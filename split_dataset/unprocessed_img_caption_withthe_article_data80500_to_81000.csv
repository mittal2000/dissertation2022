1,POLITICS,Bobby Jindal To Screen Graphic Planned Parenthood Videos On His Lawn,Laura Bassett,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bobby-jindal-planned-parenthood-videos_us_55d6320de4b055a6dab37a51,The governor will play the videos during a pro-Planned Parenthood rally at his mansion.,2015-08-20,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) -- Announced March 23, 2015",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55b7e4ec1d00003000143032.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R) said he plans to screen controversial undercover videos of Planned Parenthood on the lawn of his mansion Thursday evening in response to a rally protesting his actions against the family planning provider. The protest at the GOP presidential candidate's Baton Rouge home Thursday afternoon is in response to the governor's recent announcement that he will block Medicaid recipients in Louisiana from receiving care at Planned Parenthood. Jindal also launched a state investigation into Planned Parenthood, even though the provider does not offer abortions in the state, because a series of undercover videos released by an anti-abortion group shows Planned Parenthood doctors discussing fetal tissue donations after abortions. ""Many Planned Parenthood supporters, including President Obama and members of the White House, said they have not or will not view the horrific Planned Parenthood videos,"" Jindal's office said in a statement Thursday. ""Planned Parenthood has a right to protest today, but Governor Jindal's office will ensure that anyone who shows up will have to witness first-hand the offensive actions of the organization they are supporting.""The heavily edited videos, produced by the anti-abortion group Center for Medical Progress, use graphic videos of still-born babies, strategically cut footage and false subtitles to suggest that Planned Parenthood is selling fetal parts for profit. Congress and several governors have launched investigations into Planned Parenthood following the release of the videos, but so far those investigations have turned up nothing. Planned Parenthood apologized for the ""tone"" of one of the doctors, who discussed abortions and fetal tissue donations in the videos rather bluntly over lunch with an actor posing as a tissue procurement representative. But the group maintains it has done nothing illegal in donating fetal tissue to science after abortions at the request of the patient. Planned Parenthood says it does not profit off these donations, but receives reimbursements for the costs of transporting and preserving the specimens, which is legal.Planned Parenthood's Louisiana affiliate provided health care, contraception and sexually transmitted disease and HIV testing to more than 5,000 Medicaid patients a year before Jindal ended its Medicaid contract Aug. 3. The group noted that more than 60 percent of pregnancies in Louisiana are unintended, and New Orleans and Baton Rouge have some of the highest HIV rates in the country.A spokeswoman for the organization said Jindal's movie screening is nothing but ""political theater."" “Governor Jindal isn’t even in Louisiana today, but he’s made sure to prove that he’s always ready to put politics before Louisianan’s health,"" said Melissa Flournoy, Louisiana state director for Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast. ""This stunt is proof he doesn’t have any real answers for the people of Louisiana. He is ready to cut health care for thousands of low-income women and men without batting an eye.""Also on HuffPost:"

The Huffington Post has confirmed through sources that cuts are coming, and staffers expect the Washington bureau will be hit the hardest.A Bloomberg spokeswoman declined to comment on the expected cuts.But Josh Tyrangiel, Bloomberg’s Chief Content Officer, pushed back on any suggestion of the company retreating from government and politics. ""We will continue to cover all aspects of government and politics in Washington, New York and beyond,” Tyrangiel said in a statement. “Any reporting that indicates otherwise is blatantly false.""The layoffs come as the still very-profitable Bloomberg is hiring reporters for a new operation devoted to fast commentary and analysis on the day's news, with a focus on business and finance.The “new Bloomberg” of last summer — digital, consumer-facing — has clashed with the realities of the old Bloomberg, a $9 billion company that makes the bulk of its revenue through financial data provided to terminal subscribers. Founder Michael Bloomberg returned in September and brought in The Economist’s John Micklethwait to lead the editorial operation two months later. Micklethwait has said the company needs to refocus on core parts of its business, and a July profile of him noted that executives were assessing “redundancies” in political coverage between New York and Washington. There’s a perception inside Bloomberg that there are areas of overlap within the news operation. Bloomberg News reporter Dawn Kopecki, in a June letter to two high-ranking executives, described having “never seen morale lower” in Washington. But she also wrote of having “never seen the organization more bloated, never seen more redundancy and unnecessary overlap on beats, among editors and across platforms.”Kopecki suggested the news operation could get by with a 20 percent staff reduction, while acknowledging that her colleagues didn't share her point of view.Layoffs in Washington would mark the latest blow for a bureau that has already gone through a tumultuous year, resulting in Micklethwait installing a new bureau chief and top executive in Washington earlier this month. Micklethwait reassured staff in a memo that government and politics remained one of Bloomberg’s six core subject areas, along with business, finance, markets, technology and economics. Much of the frustration in the bureau over the past year has stemmed from the company's focus on webbier initiatives rather than on existing staffers who supply news to the terminal. Last year, Bloomberg hired Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, reportedly for $1 million each, to helm a new site, Bloomberg Politics. Many employees who worked out of Washington began to feel marginalized as the center of gravity shifted to New York, where Halperin and Heilemann are based, and resources were poured into their daily political talk show, “With All Due Respect.Justin B. Smith, chief executive of Bloomberg Media, said in a statement that the company is “fully committed to Bloomberg Politics, including the bold new site, TV program and digital video operation that we launched last October.” He said traffic had doubled and noted that 17 presidential candidates appeared on “With All Due Respect.”“The brand is a key pillar of our strategy to build the leading global multi-platform media company,” Smiths said. The staff of Bloomberg Politics is expected to be spared from the coming layoffs, according to sources, though the site will be shifting its focus in the coming weeks. Bloomberg Politics will likely relaunch with a Twitter-like news feed covering the churn of the day’s political news, accompanied by around five analytical pieces or features each day that take a broader view of the political landscape, according to a Bloomberg executive familiar with the plan.Heilemann, who went from mid-October to April without a byline, has been writing more frequently, including a Tuesday dispatch from Iowa. He’s expected to contribute even more as the site relaunches, along with Halperin and contract writers like Sasha Issenberg. The shift appears in line with Heilemann's early goals for the site. The Washington Post in a February article described his ambition as less ""inside baseball"" and more focused on publishing ""sophisticated"" takes on political events. This piece has been updated with statements from Tyrangiel and Smith. "

During the December 2014 incident, two officers shot burglary suspect Michael Johansen when he reached toward his waist. While the suspect was on the ground and subdued -- no longer a potential threat, according to witnesses -- Cagle, 45, allegedly walked up and shot him in the groin.Charging documents obtained by WBAL-TV say Cagle then cursed at the suspect after shooting him:""Officer Cagle positioned himself overtop of Johansen at which time Johansen stated, 'What did you shoot me with? A bean bag?' and Officer Cagle replied, 'No, a .40-caliber, you piece of [shit].'""Cagle, who has been suspended without pay, could face life in prison.Johansen told Fox 45 reporter Shelley Orman he doesn't necessarily want a harsh punishment for Cagle.""I'm not an angel, I know that,"" Johansen told the station. ""On the other hand, the part of being shot, it didn't warrant me being shot.""The charges against Cagle come just three months after six officers were indicted in the death of 25-year-old black man Freddie Gray, who was in police custody. Johansen is awaiting trial on burglary charges and theft of less than $1,000.Cagle is the first Baltimore police officer to be criminally charged in an on-duty shooting since 2008, according to The Baltimore Sun. In the last incident, Officer Tommy Sanders was charged with manslaughter in the shooting of an unarmed man. Sanders was acquitted of all charges in 2010."

Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has made higher education and student debt the centerpiece of her campaign.On average, college costs for full-time students increased more than 28 percent in the decade that ended last year, after adjusting for inflation, Education Department data show. State and local government funding for public colleges fell by an inflation-adjusted 0.8 percent, according to the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association. Meanwhile, the average worker's wages remained stagnant.With schools charging more while government funding and workers' earnings remain flat, students' debt levels have skyrocketed. By early next year, President Barack Obama is forecast to have presided over a doubling of outstanding student debt. When he took office, borrowers owed a combined $665.8 billion on their student loans, according to recently revised figures from the Federal Reserve in Washington.But after four years of annual 12-digit borrowing, the debt binge is finally slowing.The Education Department disbursed $77.1 billion in federal student loans through March, which means the total amount for the school year that ended in June is likely to be less than $100 billion.Last year, students and their families took out $80.9 billion during the first three quarters, and $100.1 billion for the year overall. During the 2012-13 academic year, student borrowers took out $82.5 billion in new debt during the period ending March 31 and $101.7 billion overall. The loan disbursement figures exclude consolidation loans.The academic year ends June 30. The Education Department is expected to make public last quarter's figures in the coming days.Much of the drop in borrowing is likely due to slightly lower enrollment, and less borrowing by students at for-profit schools. Some 20.3 million students were enrolled at America's colleges and universities last autumn, fewer than in previous years, according to Education Department estimates. In 2010, enrollment stood at more than 21 million students.Borrowing by for-profit students is down from $10.1 billion last year, to $8.6 billion, according to figures through March. State and federal regulators have sued large for-profit college chains in recent years for allegedly misleading students -- one of them, Corinthian Colleges Inc., filed for bankruptcy -- and the Obama administration recently finalized rules that attempt to cut off federal student aid to dodgy career programs.Over the last decade, $1 of every $5 in new federal student loans went to for-profit schools, according to the HuffPost analysis.Of the $861 billion in new loans given to students over the last decade, for-profit college students received $171.4 billion, the data show. Both figures exclude the final quarter of the 2014-15 academic year that ended in June. The high came in the 2009-10 academic year, when about $1 of every $4 in new loans, or $24.5 billion, went to students at for-profit colleges.Students at public schools took out $389.3 billion in new loans, or 45.2 percent of the total. Students at nonprofit colleges received $292 billion in new loans, or 33.9 percent of the total over the last 10 years. Foreign schools were responsible for $8.3 billion in new borrowing.Over the last five years, two-thirds of the new debt went to undergraduate students and their parents. One-third, or $166.5 billion, went to students at graduate schools.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this post referred to amounts of at least $100 billion as nine-digit numbers. They are actually 12 digits."

Oscarson, general Young Women president, speaks about the importance of family at the general women’s session of general conference on March 28, 2015.</span></p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55d611001700006e0056815c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SALT LAKE CITY – Mormons across the globe praised LDS leaders for adding the faith’s top female officers to three high-level councils, calling the historic move a moment to savor.“This allows women to join their brothers — and to include their perspective, talents, spiritual gifts and leadership abilities — in church governance,” said Suzette Smith, a Mormon feminist in the Washington, D.C., area. “A real positive. Decisions like this make me feel valued and heard.”Indeed, installing Linda K. Burton, Bonnie L. Oscarson, and Rosemary M. Wixom, to leadership councils could have far-reaching consequences in a denomination led exclusively by men.When asked whether women are members of other key committees in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, spokeswoman Kristen Howey said, “there are literally dozens of church committees. Women serve on many of them but we have no way of knowing that number without counting each of them.”The three principal, formerly male-only councils helping to run the 15 million-member faith, include “four or five (male) general authorities,” Howey said, plus the new female officers.These three committees “are immensely important in deciding how budgets are delegated, how programs and products are prioritized, and how church business moves forward,” explained Neylan McBaine, author of “Women at Church: Magnifying LDS Women’s Local Impact.”Having Burton, Oscarson and Wixom on these councils, McBaine said, “means that, even though still small in representation, women’s interests and perspectives are going to start being interwoven into administrative decisions that affect the whole organization — not just specialties traditionally under women’s purview. ”In a statement Wednesday (Aug. 19), Mormonism’s governing three-man First Presidency, welcomed the women to the table.“We are confident that the wisdom and judgment of these general auxiliary presidents will provide a valuable dimension to the important work accomplished by these councils,” LDS Church President Thomas S. Monson, first counselor Henry B. Eyring and second counselor Dieter F. Uchtdorf wrote in a letter to Mormon general authorities and general auxiliary presidencies.Despite the enthusiasm, some Latter-day Saints are looking for further steps toward equity.“It should go without saying that listening to women is a good thing,” wrote Julie M. Smith on the Mormon blog Times and Seasons. “However, the model of listening to women conveys — intentionally or otherwise — that men are still making all of the decisions. It would be nice if we could eventually move beyond that to a model where women shared in decision-making.”Angela Clayton, a Scottsdale, Ariz., Latter-day Saint who blogs at Wheat & Tares, said the development “signals to local leadership councils the need to include women in decision-making bodies.”“There are many stakes and wards (LDS congregations) in which both sexes sit in decision-making councils together, but there are other wards and stakes in which women are only nominally included to the minimum required by the handbook,” Clayton writes. “This move makes it clear that church leadership expects more input from women on decisions that affect the direction of the church.”Mica McGriggs, a doctoral candidate at LDS Church-owned Brigham Young University, celebrated the drive to add the three women’s voices at high levels, but noted their collective perspective is “the voice of American white suburban middle-class women, and is not representative of the church’s global population.”Dorah Mkhabela — the one African woman who was the first black woman to offer a prayer at the women’s session of LDS General Conference — is now off the board due to another assignment and has not been replaced.McGriggs, who is biracial, hopes LDS leaders will add to such councils “more international voices and women of color to get some variety and diversity in these meetings.”Utahn Tamu Smith, co-author of “Diary of Two Mad Black Mormons,” agreed.“While I’m pleased about what I see taking place for women, at a glance it looks like more of the same,” she said. “Personally, I hope to see more diversity, especially diversity of thought.”But Smith is optimistic about her church as it makes the effort to be “more inclusive and more transparent.”She’s grateful, she said, “to stand as a witness that the gospel lives and that is why we can and will continue to evolve.”The lively author and speaker does not believe Oscarson, with whom she has interacted, will be easily dominated.“Blindly following anyone,” Smith said, “is not in her DNA.”Also on HuffPost:"
6,ENTERTAINMENT,"If Clint Eastwood Ran For President, He Would Destroy Donald Trump",Janie Velencia and Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/clint-eastwood-would-destroy-donald-trump-in-election_us_55d6153de4b055a6dab35034,George Clooney also would take down Jeb Bush.,2015-08-20,"That giving your wife ""negotiable assets"" is a terrible mistake. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55d4bb861d00006e00145433.png?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Presidential hopeful Donald Trump might be doing well in the polls, but a recent survey released Thursday shows his chances would be destroyed if Oscar winner Clint Eastwood entered the race. Which would be astounding, given that the last time Eastwood took to politics was at the Republican National Convention in 2012 when he jabbered on incoherently at an empty chair that an imaginary Barack Obama was sitting in, a scene that left attendees dumbfounded. And yet, it seems that Americans would rather vote for a rambling, gravelly voiced Hollywood icon than the unfiltered egotistical real estate tycoon who currently leads our news coverage. At least that’s what one survey, conducted online by Harris Poll in July, tells us. It matched up well-known celebrities against real presidential candidates to see how they would perform in a hypothetical -- and far-fetched -- electoral race.Celebrities with no plans to run for office, of course, have the advantage of enjoying near-universal name recognition and the ardor of dedicated fanbases without any of the pesky drawbacks traditionally associated with serious feats of electioneering -- like worrying about fundraising, or developing a controversial political platform. This isn’t surprising to most pollsters, who’ve long documented the fact that even real politicians tend to curry more favor with the public while they’re on paper than they do after they enter the ring. But the results collected by Harris only further reaffirm America's grave disappointment and dislike of the 2016 presidential field.Those Americans surveyed are more than twice as likely to say they'd vote for Eastwood than they are to say they'd vote for Trump; 72 percent would support Clint while only 28 percent would back The Donald. But these poll respondents consistently preferred Hollywood power to political glower. For example, George Clooney bests Jeb Bush, 57 percent to 43 percent; Ben Affleck would defeat Ted Cruz by 18 percent; and Jimmy Fallon would beat Rand Paul by 10 percent.Democratic nominees Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders fare somewhat better, but are not completely in the clear. Clinton beats Oprah Winfrey by 10 percent, and Sanders beats Jerry Seinfeld by 9 percent.Another Harris Poll conducted in August found that Morgan Freeman, Clint Eastwood and Jon Stewart were the top three celebrities that Americans think would make a good president. The survey also found that nearly 6 in 10 Americans think a celebrity would make a good president. This may work better in theory than it does in practice, but it does underscore a latent public affection for political figures who emerge from off the beaten path. The 2016 cycle, in fact, has been unique in the way it’s given rise to candidates without a traditional background in elected office, such as Trump, neurosurgeon Ben Carson and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina -- three candidates who emerged from the first GOP debate with more support than they’d previously garnered.The Harris Polls were sponsored by CallFire Inc., and were conducted online. One poll surveyed 2,039 adults July 22-24, and the second poll surveyed 2,084 adults Aug. 7-11.Also on HuffPost:"
7,HEALTHY LIVING,Toxic Chemicals Taint The 'Best Possible' Food For Babies,Lynne Peeples,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/more-industrial-chemicals-found-in-breast-milk_us_55d616eae4b07addcb45ebcb,But breastfeeding is still the best choice for a child's health.,2015-08-20,"<p>Breast milk may contain harmful industrial chemicals, new research says.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55d61ceb170000b700568187.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Nature created the perfect food for a growing baby. A mother's breast milk is chock full of the essential vitamins, fats, proteins and carbohydrates needed to best build the brain, fight infection and resist chronic disease. But as new research published on Thursday reminds us, a mother's milk today also contains a cocktail of industrial chemicals.""It's really an absurd situation that women who are breastfeeding have to think about what chemical exposures they might contribute to their child,"" said Philippe Grandjean, an environmental health expert at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and author of the study. ""Breast milk is supposed to be the best possible nutrition for the infant.""And it still is, Grandjean and other experts emphasize. It's just less pure and healthy than nature intended -- and than we previously believed. Researchers have already found that a number of fat-loving chemicals can hitch rides into newborns via breast milk. Flame retardants, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and pesticides, such as DDT, are just some of the known pollutants.In the new study, Grandjean and his team tested the blood of 81 children born in the Faroe Islands between 1997 and 2000 for a class of chemicals that don't have the same affinity for fat: perfluorinated alkylate substances, or PFASs. For every month that a mom exclusively breastfed, they found her baby's blood levels of these common water- and stain-proofing chemicals increased by an average of 20 to 30 percent. Partial breastfeeding led to lower increases. Researchers discovered that the children's levels of PFASs exceeded those Grandjean's previous research had deemed safe. That research found that higher exposure to PFASs can make childhood vaccinations less effective. The chemicals are also suspected of causing cancer and disrupting normal hormone functions, noted Grandjean.You probably know PFASs as the stuff that protects your carpet from stains, keeps your food from sticking to packaging or pans, repels rain from your coat and prevents mascara from running down your cheeks. It likely even lines the waxy paper that held your morning pastry.And your body has likely been acquainted with the chemicals since you were in the womb, or drinking breast milk. ""These compounds stay in your body for years and years,"" said Grandjean.He suggested that the new findings surprised him. How did these chemicals, as pervasive and long-lasting as they are, get into milk in such high quantities? In addition to having a high fat content, breast milk is also packed with protein. So protein may offer chemicals a similar ""ride into the milk,"" Grandjean explained. Unfortunately, this implies that other, previously unsuspected toxins may also be contaminating breast milk. ""We happened to find this for perfluorinated compounds. Who knows when we'll find the next scandal like this?"" he said. ""For infants to be exposed at this early and vulnerable age is something that worries me greatly.""Still Breastfeed, If You CanAsa Bradman, an environmental health expert at the University of California, Berkeley, underscored that mothers should not be fearful about breastfeeding. His own research has concluded that even among children whose mothers had high blood levels of DDT, those who were breastfed experienced healthier development than their formula-fed peers. Given his findings, Grandjean suggests that the benefits of exclusive breastfeeding outweigh the risks, for at least a baby's first 3 to 4 months of life.And the benefits of breastfeeding extend to the mother. Women who are able and choose to breastfeed may more quickly shed pregnancy pounds. The practice can improve a mother's bond with the baby, and can even save the family money. Breast milk, unlike formula, is free.What's more, opting for formula doesn't necessarily protect an infant from dangerous chemicals, since community water supplies can carry high levels of PFASs. In a separate report also published on Thursday, the nonprofit Environmental Working Group found that even tiny concentrations of a PFASs chemical in drinking water can pose a serious threat to public health. The group refers to Grandjean's previous research, which concluded that the EPA's provisional drinking water limit for PFOA and PFASs, set in 2009, is between 100 and 1000 times too high.And if all that isn't enough to encourage breastfeeding, experts note that the practice can also decrease a mother's own burden of toxic chemicals.""Nursing a baby is the ultimate detox diet,"" writes Florence Williams in her book Breasts: A Natural and Unnatural History. As she explains, mothers who breastfeed for a year can ""siphon off"" to their infants 90 percent of their body burden of perfluorinated compounds, including PFASs.In the new study, some of the children’s blood levels of PFASs exceeded that of their mothers' by the end of breastfeeding.Of course, therein lies the irony -- and the trouble. Is breast milk just another way we pass our pollution problems on to the next generation? 'Kicking The Can Down The Road' Bill Walker, an investigations editor for the Environmental Working Group, suggested PFASs are a ""poster child"" for what is wrong with current toxic chemical regulation in the U.S. While the EPA was first alerted in 2001 to the class of chemicals contaminating drinking water, he noted, the agency remains another six to seven years away from enacting regulations.Experts raise similar concerns over the sources of these chemicals. By the end of 2015, some of the most notorious PFASs will be fully phased out of production in the U.S. ""These voluntary industry efforts have resulted in reduction of these substances in the environment,"" wrote Jessica Bowman, the executive director of the FluoroCouncil, an arm of the industry group American Chemistry Council, in an emailed statement to The Huffington Post. “To help support that phase-out, our member companies developed alternatives, based on short-chain PFAS. The alternatives are some of the most robustly-studied new chemicals introduced into the market.""But as HuffPost reported in May, experts worry this new group of PFASs may still share many of the same concerning characteristics as their predecessors. They also say this pattern of simply replacing known toxins with their chemical cousins, whose safety may remain largely unknown, is a result of the nation's outdated toxic chemical legislation, which allows chemicals to remain innocent until proven guilty.""The way the Toxic Substances Control Act is set up now, it's a dangerous experiment being conducted on all of us,"" said Walker. ""Chemical companies are allowed to expose us to their products without knowing whether or not they're safe.""""We're just kicking the can down the road. We're letting our children worry about it,"" added Tracey Woodruff, director of the University of California, San Francisco Program on Reproductive Health and the Environment.The U.S. Senate will be reconvening to consider an update to the nearly 40-year-old TSCA this fall. The bipartisan proposal has faced stiff criticism from some environmental health advocates. ""The bill has not gone far enough in terms of protecting state preemption and really reflecting the state of the science on chemical risks,"" said Woodruff. ""But there's a lot of pressure to make something happen.""While prospective and young mothers can take some precautions of their own, such as avoiding products that contain nonstick, stain-resistant, and waterproof coatings, their power to protect their progeny from tainted breast milk is limited. ""You'd have to start as a teenager to prevent the buildup over time,"" said Grandjean. ""That's not something that new moms can do much about.""""I'm calling for more research attention on the passage of industrial chemicals into human milk. We are not testing for that,"" he added, noting that the FDA requires drug companies to provide information about whether their products are safe for use during pregnancy and breastfeeding. ""But with industrial chemicals, we assume that they are safe.""""Breasts, it turns out, are a particularly fine mirror of our industrial lives,"" Williams wrote in her book. And this fact may actually attract needed attention and drive change. It was after persistent organic pollutants began appearing in human milk, for example, that countries took steps to ban them. ""Breast milk carries some political weight,"" she wrote."

However, you may have read about the film's stars. Page Six covered the recent arrest of lead Ayoub Elasri, while GQ.com admired the oddity of Dutch rapper Lil' Kleine (neé Jorik Scholten), whom ""Prince"" director Sam de Jong describes as ""the Justin Bieber of the Netherlands."" But if you haven't seen Lil' Kleine's music video ""Drank & Drugs"" yet, please stop what you're doing and watch it below. Song of the summer?Super catchy, right? If that grabbed your attention, so will ""Prince."" The film stars Elasri as Ayoub, an Amsterdam kid who spends his days setting off firecrackers in mailboxes with his boys, a crew of three other teens which include Franky (Scholten), Oussama, played by 15-year-old kickboxing champ Oussama Addi, and Achraf (Achraf Meziani). In the movie, Ayoub falls for a girl and is determined to do whatever he can to win her attention, even working for the street's most respected gangster to prove himself. But Ayoub and BFF Franky soon have a falling out when Franky starts hooking up with Ayoub's sister Demi (Olivia Lonsdale, the girl in the leopard print in the ""Drank & Drugs"" music video).""Prince"" is a stunning first feature from de Jong, who previously directed shorts and music videos (including ""Drank & Drugs.""), with charged performances from its cast of mostly non-professional actors. But in a story about juvenile aggression starring amateur actors, there's the chance fiction will mirror reality. In an interview with The Huffington Post, de Jong told us about the on-set animosity that nearly led him to recast the leads. ""It was more like social work,"" de Jong said of directing the boys. ""Most of my work with them was making sure that raw energy came into the film without exploding."" And it came close, many times.The tension on the set of ""Prince"" was mainly an ego war between Elasri, 18, and Scholten, 21. ""Ayoub was the alpha male because he was starring in [the movie], he’s the hero,"" the director said. ""But [Scholten], he couldn’t deal with that. He has like 200,000 Instagram followers, he’s like the Justin Bieber of the Netherlands. And he wanted the highest status. So the second shooting day, they just exploded."" The two boys had such a difficult time getting along on set that de Jong and the crew had to hold them back from one another. ""They really wanted to just fuck each other up all the time.""But the boys' real-life beef played into the film in more ways than one. It became so impossible to have the actors on set at the same time that de Jong came up with the idea to shoot most of their group scenes as single close-ups, which largely informed the film's style. ""It ended up being a stylistic choice, but I came on to it by necessity,"" he told us. ""I was trying to find a way to work with them, and by sending the others away I could get this quirky sort of comedy by having them act to the camera. So it feels a little constructed.""Although de Jong says he didn't use the tension between Elasri and Scholten's to heighten their characters' on-screen fight, we can't help but wonder how much the two drew from it. In one scene, Ayoub rushes toward Franky and punches him in the face, a punch that plays even more charged knowing their real-life hostility. But struggling to stifle teenagers' hormone-fueled fights and avoid legal issues -- one of the actors even stole the production car keys for a joy ride -- is not something de Jong wants to do again in the future.""It’s fucking with your head,"" de Jong said. ""At the same time it’s cool because the movie is about that. But now, in my next project, I just want to save my energy for more creative stuff.""""Prince"" is now playing.Also on HuffPost:"

The man at Save Yourself Survival and Tactical Gear in Oktaha, Oklahoma, dropped a loaded gun, which then fired a bullet into his wrist, the local sheriff's department told News On 6.He has not been publicly identified, but is expected to recover. Armed volunteers have been ""guarding"" the shop since it announced earlier this month that it had banned Muslims. ""I saw several of those gentlemen out there yesterday,"" Sheriff Charles Pearson told Muskogee Now. ""The way they were holding their weapons, with the fingers on the triggers, you can tell a couple of these gentlemen have no idea about weapons safety. It's like the Clampetts have come to town.""The Clampetts was the family in the long-running TV series ""The Beverly Hillbillies."" The store said on Facebook the shooting victim was not a volunteer, but a friend. The post, signed by ""Niki,"" said the incident was the result of ""a malfunctioning chest holster."" The safety strap of what was described as an ""old leather chest rig"" broke and the Colt .45 fell out, firing when it hit the floor. Earlier in the day, a U.S. veteran who is a practicing Muslim showed up at the range to protest its policies, and was initially turned away.""I just wanted to express my disapproval,"" Chris Martin told Fox 23. ""They just said, 'This is private property. You are not allowed here,'"" said Martin, who served during the Cold War and Desert Storm.However, the range softened its policy when they learned he was a veteran and allowed him in.“They’re saying now it’s just [banning] someone who’s an extremist or terrorist,” Martin told the station.The store made headlines around the nation earlier this month when it posted a sign saying: ""This privately owned business is a Muslim free establishment, we reserve the right to refuse service to anyone. Thank you.”It's one of several places that banned Muslims after the deadly shooting at two U.S. military locations in Chattanooga last month by Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez, a Muslim who was also killed in the attack. ""I didn’t want any terrorists, or Muslims, cult, whatever you want to call them, training on my gun range,"" manager Chad Neal, who is a veteran, told Religion News Service at the time the ban was announced. ""There is a military recruiting station in the mall in Muskogee, and I thought this was one thing I could do to help protect our local soldiers.""The store claims on Facebook that it is ""overwhelmed with the show of support from all corners of America.""The Council on American-Islamic Relations has called the sign illegal, and compared it to ""whites only"" signs at businesses before the Civil Rights movement. CAIR has also denounced the federal government for so far refusing to take action against business that have declared themselves ""Muslim-free"" zones. ""It is sad to see an Oklahoma business join the clearly illegal movement to deny service to American Muslims, and it is equally sad to note the silence of our government on this denial of religious freedom and equal access to public accommodations,"" Veronica Laziure, civil rights director of CAIR's Oklahoma chapter, said in a news release. ""As a nation, we rightfully moved past 'whites only' businesses, but our national leaders seem unwilling to challenge ‘Muslim-free’ public facilities.""(h/t Raw Story)Also on HuffPost:"

WHEN? WE'RE IN."" So that's how we found ourselves at Painting Lounge's Chelsea Studio two weeks ago, alongside Andi Dorfman. We showed up after a 15-minute walk dripping sweat, hoping our carefully picked-out outfits were cute enough to mingle with a Bachelorette and her best friends ... and other media types. We identified the entrance to the ""lounge"" by a cluster of shiny Mylar Palm Breeze balloons. Bingo. Inside, we found an immaculate Andi, clad in white jeans and a long-sleeved blouse despite the warmth of the room. Only a former Bachelorette could have the self-assurance to wear white jeans to a painting class. We were already intimidated, and still sweating profusely.Luckily, Andi didn't seem to notice our unkempt appearances -- or at least she was too much of a Georgia peach to comment on them. We sat down, untangled the equipment our podcast producer had handed us earlier that day, and got down to the business of asking questions and shoving the portable microphone in her face so she could answer them.""So, what's the deal with all the Palm Breeze?"" Emma asked. Andi explained how much she wanted to have a housewarming party that was warm, but not in her house, and involved canned sparkling alcohol spritzers. We couldn't wait to get tipsy. (Being tipsy makes you a better artist, right?)Andi told us about her upcoming breakup-themed book, a ""tongue-in-cheek diary of [her] breakup,"" which apparently will contain some ""zingers"" about her relationship with Josh Murray. She also seemed willing to laugh at herself a little bit: ""My dad’s seen me make out on TV. I have no shame left."" (Fair enough, girl.) “I dated 26 dudes on national television, I got engaged after eight weeks, and yes it was love and I will never deny that, but at the end of the day I have to sit back and kind of chuckle at it,"" she told us. ""Like, oh my God, I dated on reality television.""Mission accomplished, we bundled away our aged microphone and cracked open cans of Palm Breeze, ready to relax with some stiff drinks and casual artistic activity while unobtrusively working our way into Andi's inner circle.Then the class began.Suddenly, both of us regressed to a very specific place: junior year AP classes. Our Type A, teacher's pet personalities, so long suppressed by adulthood, sprang back full force. Claire clutched her brush so tightly her hand spasmed, and utterly neglected to get tipsy on the 4.5 percent ABV of the ruby red citrus Palm Breeze she'd scored. We became obsessed with painting inside the lines, to the point of desperation. Emma has been berating herself over her lack of ability to paint in a straight line ever since. We're fairly certain even the laid-back instructor could sense our anxiety levels rising. ""Don't worry if your painting doesn't look just like mine,"" he repeated several times, glancing meaningfully toward the two of us as we suppressed panic attacks.Andi and her friends may have been somewhere in the room, but our worlds had narrowed to the small bubble containing our canvases. We later confirmed that they were, indeed, sitting directly behind us. But nothing matters when you have a self-imposed task at hand. Apparently, meanwhile, Andi was having a little more fun with her lipstick painting.When the class finally, finally ended, we put down our brushes in exhausted relief. Sure, we'd gotten so far behind we'd missed a few steps. Sure, the Senior Web Editor of OK! Magazine, who made the error of picking the seat next to us, found herself forced to assure us that our paintings did come out nicely. But looking around the room, one thing was clear: We were better at blindly following instructions than just about anyone else there. Our inner high school nerds took modest satisfaction in this victory. Over at the cool kids' table, the mood was more upbeat. Andi and her friends flaunted creatively altered lipstick art and makeup unmarred by sweat rivulets even after hours of arduous painting. We grabbed a selfie with Andi, and bundled ourselves out the door as she and her friends kept the party going. We'd flown close enough to the sun for one night.To hear our full interview with Andi Dorfman, listen to HuffPost's ""Bachelor"" podcast, ""Here To Make Friends.""
