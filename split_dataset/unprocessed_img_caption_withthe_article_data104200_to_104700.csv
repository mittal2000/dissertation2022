During his first 18 months in office President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico signed a political agreement with the country's top three political parties, something unheard of in a country known for its acrimonious, highly partisan politics. He proceeded to get 11 major reforms approved by a divided Congress. Peña Nieto moved Mexico from the crime sections to the business pages of international newspapers. His energy reform opened up Mexico's oil, gas and electricity industries to private investment. The telecommunications reform has tackled powerful local business empires. In his annual state of the union report, on Sept. 1, a confident Peña Nieto claimed that, after a long paralysis, ""Mexico [is] on the move.""MEXICO WAS MOVINGBut the movement has turned into an earthquake. On the evening of Sept. 26 a group of first-year students of the Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers College arrived in Iguala, a city in the southern state of Guerrero. They had been ordered by their school ""Struggle Committee,"" the radical leftist group that rules life at the college, to disrupt a celebration organized by María de los Ángeles Pineda, the wife of Iguala's mayor, José Luis Abarca, who had plans to succeed her husband. The students had stolen buses. Mayor Abarca ordered the Iguala police to ""stop"" the students. When the police intercepted them, the students apparently threw stones at the police, who then reportedly responded with live bullets. According to eyewitness accounts, three students were killed right there. Forty-four others were taken away by the police. The others are presumed to have been taken to Cocula, a small town, and handed over to a drug organization known as Guerreros Unidos or United Warriors. The drug traffickers allegedly killed them and burned their bodies. The government claims the mayor and his wife had links with this drug organization. Mexico is used to violence. President Felipe Calderón, Peña Nieto's predecessor, launched a war against drugs in 2006 and saw an increase in murders from 8 per 100,000 people in 2007 to 24 in 2011. A slow decline in homicides began in 2012. In 2013, the first year of President Peña Nieto's government, there were 19 homicides per 100,000 people. The reduction prompted Peña Nieto to promote the idea that violence was a thing of the past. No more. The disappearance and apparent murder of the Ayotzinapa students has horrified Mexico and the world. Other acts of violence have also become public knowledge. When searching for the Ayotzinapa students, government investigators uncovered a number of clandestine burial sites in the state of Guerrero. They thought at first they were the Ayotzinapa students, but were proven wrong. Dozens of bodies have been recovered and are now painfully and slowly being identified. CHE STILL HERO OF THE STUDENTSThe Iguala affair has turned into a political crisis for President Peña Nieto. The Ayotzinapa school is known for its Marxist bent. Instead of having pictures of the nation's heroes, it is decorated with portraits of Che Guevara and Subcomandante Marcos. Its classes are used for indoctrinating students on revolutionary struggle. Lucio Cabañas, a famous guerrilla fighter of the 1970s, was a graduate of the college -- and remains the most admired alumnus. Dozens of left-wing organizations have now joined the Ayotzinapa Struggle Committee in a movement that openly seeks the resignation of Peña Nieto. This would appear strange. Neither the president nor his party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, had anything to do with the events in Iguala. The mayor was a member of the moderate leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution. Peña Nieto's attorney general has pretty much solved the crime, which is unusual in a country with a 98 percent impunity rate, and has detained more than 70 people, including the mayor and his wife. Many of the accused have confessed to the mass kidnapping and the executions of the students. Still, the leaders of the movement claim that this was ""a state crime"" and thus the head of the Mexican state must resign. The president's public image has been further tarnished by information that his wife owns a $7 million residential compound in Mexico City's posh Lomas district. Images of the luxurious home have circulated widely. A former successful television soap opera star, Angélica Rivera issued an emotional video explaining that she purchased the property with her own resources. Part of the compound, however, was bought on credit from a government contractor. The first lady claims that she is repaying the loan with interest. On Nov. 20, the anniversary of the Mexican Revolution, thousands of people demonstrated in the streets of Mexico City demanding Peña Nieto's resignation. At this point there is no indication that the president is even considering the move. His administration is constitutionally scheduled to end in November 2018. But the government is now afraid to use public force to prevent demonstrators from blockading roads and streets, stealing buses and trucks, ransacking supermarkets and torching government buildings. President Peña Nieto has claimed that his patience has limits, but so far the Ayotzinapa movement appears to have forced him into a corner. REMEMBERING A VIOLENT REVOLUTIONMany of the demonstrators on Revolution Day threatened President Peña Nieto with a revolution if he does not resign. Paradoxically, Peña Nieto said on that very same day, in a ceremony to commemorate the 1910 Revolution, that violence is not acceptable. Apparently he was not aware of the fact that the Mexican Revolution was a violent affair that cost the lives of perhaps 1 million Mexicans, one tenth of the population at the time. Perhaps he should have remembered the words often attributed to Porfirio Díaz, the president who after 30 years in power resigned in 1911 at the start of the revolution: ""In Mexico nothing ever happens -- until it happens.""Sergio Sarmiento is a columnist for the Mexican daily Reforma and a TV and radio commentator."
2,BUSINESS,The Term 'Black Friday' Has Lost All Meaning,Jillian Berman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-friday-obsolete-thanksgiving-deals_n_6180230.html,,2014-11-21,"Shoppers vie for copies of video games at a Black Friday sale at a Wal-Mart Stores Inc. store in Mentor, Ohio, U.S., on Thursday, Nov. 24, 2011. Retailers are pouring on the discounts to attract consumers grappling with 9 percent unemployment and a slower U.S. economic expansion than previously estimated. Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb316ac1f0000250123c0d1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Black Friday is not just a single day anymore. In the past few years, U.S. retailers have stretched ""Black Friday,"" which once meant the day after Thanksgiving, across days and even weeks of bargains. That trend could continue if companies -- struggling to grow sales in an anemic economy -- find the new strategy pays off.The change could give hope to shoppers tired of rising at the crack of dawn, or leaving their Thanksgiving table, to battle other shoppers for cheap DVD players. It could also make life a little easier for Americans who rely on Black Friday sales to take care of their holiday shopping.For now, many of the best deals are still to be found in stores on Black Friday and, increasingly, on Thanksgiving Day. Target, for example, is opening stores at 6:00 p.m. on Thanksgiving. But it also offered some Black Friday deals on Nov. 10, nearly three weeks before the traditional Black Friday, with more sales to come in the days before Thanksgiving.The extended deals are part of a larger strategy to offer a Black Friday that's convenient for shoppers, according to Jenna Reck, a Target spokeswoman. ""Black Friday at Target this year is about giving our guests access to top Black Friday deals no matter how, where or when they want to shop,"" Reck wrote in an email.Online juggernaut Amazon is starting its Black Friday sale on Nov. 21, six days before Thanksgiving and the earliest it has ever offered Black Friday deals, said Julie Law, an Amazon spokeswoman. The company made the shift after an uptick in traffic last year on the Friday and Saturday before Thanksgiving, Law said. ""Those days that we see customers shopping more, we're going to make sure that we've got great deals on those days,"" she said. Walmart, the nation's biggest retailer, has made the shift to a longer Black Friday period most explicitly. It touts what it calls the “New Black Friday” -- five days of deals. It's also hosting its second annual “Pre-Black Friday Event,” starting Friday, Nov. 21 at 8 a.m., giving shoppers the chance to buy TVs, Lego sets, KitchenAid Stand Mixers and other items at prices the company claims match or beat competitors’ lowest offers. This year's Pre-Black Friday sale has twice the number of items offered last year, according to the company.Duncan Mac Naughton, the chief merchandising officer for Walmart U.S., told reporters at a New Jersey Walmart on Tuesday that the retailer was ""building the shoulders"" of Black Friday.“If you look at the customer today, they’re very dynamic, they want to shop at different times,” he said. “You could choose to go out on Thanksgiving and stand on line and be cold,"" he said, or customers could start their shopping as early as this Friday with the Pre-Black Friday Event. Online prices start dropping in mid-November and are typically best on Thanksgiving Day, according to the chart below from Adobe. Some stores are also offering ""Black Friday"" sales starting several days before Thanksgiving: This shift is partly a response to changing shopping habits. People keep getting more comfortable with online buying, and the idea of trundling out to stores during retailer-mandated times for specific discounts keeps getting less appealing. Just 28 percent of Americans say they plan to set foot inside a store on Black Friday, according to a recent survey from Bankrate.com, a personal finance site. Offering deals earlier and more often is also a way for retailers to better get their hands on the limited disposable income of shoppers whose incomes have stagnated in recent years.“They’re targeting consumers on the lower end who once their budget is gone, it’s gone,” said Ken Perkins, the founder of Retail Metrics, a retail analytics firm. “They’re really trying to pull sales in as early as possible.”When Black Friday first started to become popular decades ago, retailers offered “really incredible, earth-shaking” deals on that day, according to Mark Cohen, the director of retail studies at Columbia Business School who is the former CEO of Sears Canada. Now, shoppers may actually get better deals the closer it gets to Christmas, as retailers try to unload their excess inventory before the holiday, Cohen told The Huffington Post.Still, there’s a strong perception that any sale involving the term “Black Friday” offers the best discount, thanks to retailer and media hype. “This is sort of a mass psychosis,” Cohen said. “This whole frenzy is completely unwarranted.” Shoppers in a New York City Macy's during the week before Christmas in 1942.The slow stretching of Black Friday across several days may be a sign of calmer times to come. Retailers are leaning less on extreme discounts to draw people into stores, Carol Spieckerman, the CEO of newmarketbuilders, a retail strategy firm, told HuffPost. Instead, a broader period of discounts will likely create a more relaxing environment that encourages shoppers to spend their time browsing in one store instead of hopping between harried shops for discounts. “If you look at the way most major retailers are staging out their deals, this year marks a really major departure from that frenzied prescribed herding mentality and into a more reasonable, trusting environment,” Spieckerman said.

The loss is one I feel daily, and I am not looking forward to the holiday season. I am sure it will be especially poignant on the days when we the picture-perfect moments include families all gathered around. But I've had my moments this year sharing a table with my dad, giving thanks for the many blessings in my life. We felt it was a spiritual practice to give thanks to God for the many blessings of which we believe He is the provider. During my dad's battle with cancer our family began ""Thankful Tuesdays."" It might sound a bit cheesy, but what a wonderful practice! On those evenings we went out to dinner together and as we gathered around the table we all shared one thing we were thankful for. Given the impetus for starting Thankful Tuesdays, the thanks were often for things like the chance to have one more day together, one more chance to make memories to carry us through the future days when sorrow and grief would be a closer companion. As I reflect on the memories of those Tuesday nights and the memories of my Dad, I find it is still the simple things that bring gratitude most quickly to my heart:Sitting quietly and watching the sunset together...Soft down pillows on which to lay my head...The silly play of puppies and the way they unconditionally respond to human affection... Hot coffee at the beginning of the day watching the sunrise as the morning dew sparkles across the fields... A glass of red wine and a bite of dark chocolate at the end of a day...Appreciating the way even the sense of taste has a purpose in our bodies, offering our wearied minds and emotions strength and comfort.It is important to be thankful for the big things- - the roof over our head, the food at our table, the privileges we are afforded. But sometimes it is in these small moments and the regular observance of finding just one thing for which you're thankful that works together to create a grateful heart. As we come to the season where as a nation we collectively pause to give thanks, I find myself thankful for a father who led by example. He taught me to make this thanks-giving a regular part of my life and to see the beauty and the grace in simple everyday things."

As Jay Leno lobs potshots at ratings-challenged NBC in his ""Tonight Show"" monologues, speculation is swirling the network is taking steps to replace the host with Jimmy Fallon next year and move the show from Burbank to New York. NBC confirmed Wednesday, March 20, it's creating a new studio for Fallon in New York, where he hosts ""Late Night."" But the network did not comment on a report that the digs at its Rockefeller Plaza headquarters may become home to a transplanted, Fallon-hosted ""Tonight Show."" (AP Photo/NBC, Paul Drinkwater)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8dd9a24000051005774ed.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"America's gun lobby discovered that the nation's epidemic of gun violence is no laughing matter. On Thursday, comedian Jay Leno cancelled his speaking gig at a gun industry event less than 24 hours after three reform groups launched a petition asking the former ""Tonight Show"" host to disassociate himself from the gun group. Leno was scheduled to appear at the 2015 Shooting, Hunting, Outdoor Trade (SHOT) Show on behalf of the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), the trade association for the gun industry. On Wednesday, the group's website claimed that tickets were  ""going fast""  for the NSSF's ""State of the Industry"" dinner on January 20, 2015 at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas. It said that Leno's appearance was ""the highlight"" of the event.Ironically, NSSF is headquartered in Newtown, Conn., only three miles from Sandy Hook Elementary School, where six adults and 20 first-grade children were killed in a mass shooting in December 2012. On Wednesday, after learning of Leno's scheduled gig, the Newtown Action Alliance, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, and the Campaign to Unload  sprung into action, circulating an online petition asking Leno to cancel his SHOT Show appearance. Another group, Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, which urges corporate restaurants and retailers to ban guns in their stores, also launched a social media campaign to persuade Leno to reconsider his NSSF appearance. ""Dear @JayLeno: There's no comedy in over 31k Americans dying per year from gun violence,"" the group twitted. ""Sincerely, @MomsDemand #JokesOnLeno."" ""I was shocked,"" said Po Murray, chair of the Newtown Action Alliance, an all-volunteer group formed after the Sandy Hook shooting. ""I figured [Leno] didn't know what they stand for."" Murray, whose four children previously attended the Sandy Hook school and who lives in the same Newtown neighborhood where Adam Lanza, the Sandy Hook shooter, once lived, said, ""We hope our petition will convince Mr. Leno to be reasonable and cancel his speech."" Within hours, more than 6,500 people had signed the petition. Several media outlets, including Mother Jones and The Nation, reported on the groups' protest. By the end of the day, Leno had backed out of the SHOT Show. He called Newtown Action Alliance's Murray to tell her about his cancellation, explaining that he wasn't aware that the group was part of the gun lobby. Leno told Mother Jones, ""I understand it's Newtown, and of course I get it. It's just, sometimes, mistakes get made.""""When it came to his attention that this was actually a pro-gun lobby show, he immediately cancelled his appearance,"" Bruce Bobbins, spokesman for Leno, told MSNBC. Leno was told that he would be speaking at a sportsman show, which he assumed focused on hunting, according to Bobbins. ""He found out that it was not what he was originally told it was, and he decided to cancel,"" he said.Leno, who hosted ""The Tonight Show"" for 22 seasons, had never previously voiced public support for the NSSF or the gun lobby. In fact, during a November 2013 ""Tonight Show"" interview with conservative Sen. Ted Cruz, Leno asked the Texas politician why he opposed stricter gun control policies. In that interview, Leno asked Cruz, ""Why is increased background checks not a good thing? ... No one is saying you can't have guns...You just have to pass a background check. Why is that bad?"" He told Cruz that without stronger laws ""a complete psychopath can go to a gun show and buy half a dozen guns.""  Gun control groups celebrated their success at getting Leno to cancel his gig, noting that it will reverberate beyond this one event.""The writing is now on the wall for celebrities who would consider getting in bed with the gun lobby,"" said Josh Horwitz, executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. ""Don't do it. Because if you do, your reputation and brand will be damaged forever, without repair.""The NSSF issued a statement after Leno turned his back on the organization.""He unilaterally cancelled his promised appearance due to pressure from the anti-gun lobby, which included false statements about our industry and its commitment to genuine firearms safety, which we attempted to personally correct with him, but to no avail,"" the NSSF posted on its website. ""We are not deterred by their publicity seeking nor are we unfamiliar with the bullying political tactics of the gun control groups that seem to have as little respect for the First Amendment as they continually demonstrate with regard to the Second Amendment.""Other gun lobby groups and conservative media echoed NSSF's talking points. Cam Edwards, host of National Rifle Association-sponsored radio and TV shows, issued several tweats, one of which said ""You Are A Coward, Jay Leno."" In an article for the right-wing website Townhall.Com, Fox News' Katie Pavlich wrote: ""It's a shame Leno let dishonest and elitist liberal stooges bully him into bailing out on a great event with some of America's best people."" The reactionary magazine Human Events called Leno ""a coward who caves to liberal activists.""The NSSF has opposed all attempts to strengthen U.S. gun laws to prevent future tragedies. The association has accused gun violence prevention advocates of ""seeking to destroy the Second Amendment"" and lobbied against even the most modest proposals, such as universal background checks for all gun sales, a reform which is supported by 92% of gun owners nationally. NSSF president Steve Sanetti even accused Newtown survivors who have advocated for tougher gun laws of reacting irrationally because they are ""angry"" and ""fearful.""Formed in 1961, NSSF's members include gun manufacturers, distributors, retailers, shooting ranges, gun owners' clubs, and gun magazines. The NSSF lobbies against limits on high capacity magazines and supports legislation allowing gun owners to carry concealed weapons. It has sought to prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating chemicals in ammunition. NSSF has been the leader in working to rebrand assault rifles in general, and the AR-15 assault rifle like the one used in the Newtown tragedy in particular, as ""modern sporting rifles,"" according to the Violence Policy Center. NSSF has three blogs, named ""Pull the Trigger."" ""First Shot News,"" and ""Bullet Points.""NSSF's annual SHOT show, where gun enthusiasts mingle with gun and ammo manufacturers selling their wares, is the group's major fundraising event. The group claims that last year's show drew 1,600 exhibitors and 70,000 participants.According to a 2012 report by the Sunlight Foundation, NSSF has given more than $700,000 in campaign contributions. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, NSSF spent $2.39 million in lobbying in 2014 so far. The group works closely with the National Rifle Association. Like the NRA, NSSF's  board includes many representatives of the gun industry. Steve Sanetti, NSSF's president since 2008, is former president of Sturm, Ruger & Co, one of the nation's largest gun manufacturers. The chairman of NSSF's board is Robert L. Scott, the vice chairman of Smith & Wesson, another major gun maker.Gun violence prevention advocates have long viewed the NSSF, along with the NRA, as major obstacles to gun reform. Last April about 100 victims and survivors of gun violence and other advocates protested the corporate gun lobby's obstruction of sensible gun laws, such as expanded background checks, outside NSSF's annual Congressional Fly-In fundraising dinner in Washington, D.C.During his 22 years as ""The Tonight Show"" host, Leno rarely voiced his political views on the air. His confrontation with Ted Cruz over gun control was an exception. But off-camera, Leno occasionally revealed his social conscience.In 2000, Leno was scheduled to appear at the Society of Human Resource Management's (SHRM) annual convention in Las Vegas when he learned that one of the most notorious union-busting law firms in the country -- Jackson, Lewis -- was getting paid to make two ""How to Stay Union Free"" presentations at the conference. Leno courageously announced that he'd refuse to appear at the SHRM unless it booted Jackson, Lewis off its agenda. Rather than lose Leno, SHRM cancelled the conference's union-busting seminar. This was quite a coup, considering that SHRM's chairman, Michael J. Lotito, was a partner at Jackson, Lewis. At the time, Leno's union, the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) noted that Leno had always been a ""stand-up guy"" on union issues. In May, Leno participated in a protest rally outside the Beverly Hills Hotel, one of two hotels owned by the Sultan of Brunei. The demonstrators called for a boycott of two hotels after the country adopted a strict sharia law permitting death by stoning for ""crimes"" including gay sex.Some of Leno's fans criticized the comedian when, in October 2003, he introduced former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger at his campaign victory party. Leno's spokesman denied that his appearance was an endorsement.""I'm not conservative,"" Leno told the LA Weekly in 2004. ""I've never voted that way in my life."" Peter Dreier teaches Politics and chairs the Urban & Environmental Policy Department at Occidental College.

Many people ask me: ""How can I avoid gaining five to 10 pounds during the holidays?"" Along with having a positive attitude and self-discipline, I always answer that question with the three tips below. Cheers to keeping the holiday ""party pounds"" off! 1. Make every meal count.  The key to weight loss is having a healthy, well-balanced meal plan. The meal plan should be tailored to your individual calorie needs, current health status, and food preferences. Eating a variety of nutrient dense foods like fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy products, lean protein choices, and high fiber whole grains, will leave you little room for processed food choices. To ensure you are eating a healthy well-balanced meal, fill half your plate with plant-based food (e.g., sautéed Brussels sprouts), one quarter of the plate with a lean protein source (e.g., grilled salmon), and the other quarter with high fiber whole grains (e.g., quinoa). 2. Make a mind and body connection with every meal and snack. Overeating commonly occurs when your mind is not aware that your body is being fueled. Allowing your mind and body to connect results in healthier portion control and a satisfied appetite. The mind and body connection can be achieved simply by enjoying your meals and snacks sitting down without any distractions. Some common distractions include: watching television, working on your laptop, reading a magazine, and getting caught up on social media. We are all guilty of being preoccupied while we eat. Make a conscious effort to avoid these distractions. Turn off the television. Leave your phone in the other room. When we enjoy our meals without distractions, we eat less and make better food choices throughout the day. Changing eating habits takes time and willpower. If you get off track, jump right back on. Never give up on your health! 3. Move every day. Exercise is essential for weight loss and our overall well-being. Whether you choose to go for a hike, swim, or Pilates class, exercising is one of the healthiest ways to relieve stress. Cardiovascular exercise is important for heart health. Weight training helps to build lean body mass and strengthen our bones. The American Heart Association recommends that we aim for at least 30 minutes of physical activity each day. If you cannot devote an entire 30 minutes to exercise, then try to fit two mini-workouts into your day. Always keep in mind when you want to shed some pounds, you need to burn more calories than you eat.

The theme of the evening was Empowering Women: Promoting Peace and Progress. Lord Raj Loomba, CBE was honored for dedicating his life to doing just this -- empowering women. More specifically Lord Loomba, CBE, has promoted the empowerment of widows and their children across the globe. As Founder and Chairman of the Loomba Foundation, he has personally taken on the plight of widows and their children by shining a light on their challenges and developing initiatives to support their needs. I first met Lord Loomba, CBE, at his office in London, England. Lord Loomba is humble despite his vast accomplishments. In 2011, Forbes India presented him with an NRI Philanthropy award, and earlier this year Northampton University bestowed upon him an Honorary Fellowship. Lord Loomba is kind and generous. It was during this meeting that he asked if I would like to be his guest at the United Nations Humanitarian Awards Dinner where he was due to receive his lifetime achievement award.  Lord Loomba, CBE and I at the United Nations 2014 Humanitarian Awards Dinner; I am wearing a necklace made by a widow in Kenya. Photo is property of Kristin MeekhofWe met a few weeks later at this dinner which also honored Mr. Stefan Persson and Dr. Phumzile Mlambo- Ngcuka. The room was quiet when Lord Loomba shared his own story. He was eloquent in speech and explained how he used his personal loss to transform an entire group of widows and their chidren across the globe. He witnessed his own mother's grief and suffer with the status of ""widow"" after his father died from tuberculosis. He was just 10, but still remembers that his mother was blamed for his father's death, and within hours of his death she was asked to remove her bindi. Equally as troubling was when his mother was asked to wear all white and was no longer able to dress in her colorful clothing. Essentially she was stripped of her dignity. One of Lord Loomba's goals is to restore a level of respect and dignity to all widows. His tireless determination knows only the boundaries that governments have established, and even there he worked to bring about change. Lord Loomba spent five years campaigning with the United Nations to have June 23 recognized as International Widows Day. This date was chosen because on this date in 1954 Lord Loomba's father died from tuberculosis leaving his wife a widow and single mother of seven children. The United Nations uses the Loomba Foundation's report, titled ""Invisible Forgotten Sufferers"" published in 2010, as their handbook to understanding the plight of widows and their children. The publication says, ""One of the main reasons why widows continue to be subjected to gross human rights violations is that although they number 245 million, there has been no comprehensive research or attempt to gather information on a global scale about their existence."" Often overlooked are widows for example who are living in Kenya, Rwanda or Uganda. The publication addresses the needs and challenges of these widows.

This project has a tremendous reach; it helps 100,000 individuals. In London Lord Loomba, CBE told me that when you help a widow the ""impact is tenfold. You empower economically and the widows are empowered socially."" When widows obtain a job or skill, not only do they support their children but often teach others the craft. The foundation also recognizes the value of education. Lord Loomba said, ""Rual India is hardest hit. There the widows are poor and undereducated."" In India alone, the Loomba Foundation has provided educational scholarships, for a minimum of five years or longer, to over 9,000 children of widows, and supported over 50,000 family members.Equally as impressive are the number of notable individuals who have lent their support to the foundation. Lord Loomba has garnered the respect from political figures and celebrities, such as Cherie Blair, CBE, QC, His Excellency Ranjan Mathai, Sir Richard Branson, Yoko Ono, and Sir James Bevan KCMG.

We haven't talked much about it but I think he takes it all with grace.John Huston, Bob Richardson, Jack Nicholson, Robert Graham... How did you not lose your sense of self with all these intense men in your life?I am extremely stubborn! I know it made my father crazy. He couldn't understand my resistance. I remember when my father would have definite ideas about who I should be or what I should do or what school I should go to. I dug in my heels very firmly and just wouldn't go along with his ideas. Which he thought were much better. He must have been frustrated with you, but secretly respectful that you stood up for who you wanted to be, no? Ultimately he had no choice! (laughs) He wanted to see who was stronger in the end. But he went on to see he wouldn't win in the end, either!Tell me about falling in love with your husband, Robert Graham.Oh, I could talk to him for hours. He was very provocative and very funny. The waiters would be scared to come over and ask what we wanted to eat because I was so incredibly involved with what he had to say. What his impressions were; his knowledge. Bob was encyclopedic about art history. To go to Rome with Bob and walk around the Vatican and hear exactly who made what, when and why. To go to the Chartres Cathedral -- he would point things out that you would never have even considered. It was such a privilege. So he was also a great teacher. Just an utterly creative person.You've said ""to bore people is one of the primary sins;"" I think it's safe to say your memoirs put you in in the Pantheon of fascinating raconteurs. These are both dedicated to your parents. What do you want them to hear?First of all, despite a rather unusual upbringing and the fact that there was a lot of coming and going - and I would say childhood confusion -- there were also incredibly grounding moments. The love of beauty that both of my parents share, their love of the arts, their determination that we should have opinions. Not to the point of being obnoxious, but they required that you thought about things. I think that's very important. I remember a seminal moment when I was nine. An image of death-row kidnapper Caryl Chessman caught my eye on the cover of Time and I asked my mother about him. I remember her explaining very precisely who Caryl Chessman was and what he was up to. And I remember having a profound sense of what was serious at a young age. Even though I grew up in remote country in Ireland, I still had a sense of the possibilities of outside. Possibilities of the human spirit and other existences. Your mother Enrica Soma was an extraordinary beauty and iconoclast in her own right. Was she the inspiration for your personal style?My mother and also my best friend Joan Buck who was 2 years older than I and was very involved in fashion growing up. She sort of turned me on to fashion magazines. But my mother had a very powerful and unusual fashion sense. Ok, we all know you are a Vanity Fair Best Dressed Hall of Famer, but your skill de-boning fish would blow Daniel Boulud out of the water! Where did you learn that?(Laughs) Well my brother Tony is a fisherman -- a very good one. We used to fish trout out of the river and I learned to de-bone them very early. And those are tricky little fish! There are a lot of small bones in them. Actually one of the things I never liked dealing with is meat, but I can really gut a fish! Your Venice house was spectacular. The street it was on, not so much. How did you deal with the craziness?Although there were challenges, there were elements of Venice I was really grateful for that were really humanizing. Kinda forced me -- at a time when I could easily have gone the other way and become more reclusive -- it sort of forced me to be more social. And I made a lot of friends out there. There are some fantastic people out there in the real world! (laughs) The nature of ""Hollywood"" is that you lose touch with the rest of the world. You get in your car and you get out to do your shopping or whatever, but you don't really interact much with strangers or people on the street. To live in Venice was at once difficult, particularly when Bob became ill -- the noise was intense -- often woke us up at night, but also very congenial. OMG, sometimes at night you didn't know if they were throwing firecrackers or shooting at each other. And then the bars would let out at 2:00 a.m., so from 2:00 to 3:00 there would be this cacophony outside on the street and all kinds of madness. Then around 4:00 a.m. everything would stop. Silence would come back. But it was sort of a fortress on the outside and a garden on the inside. It was a pretty fabulous building.You have a mind-boggling collection of very significant art (including of course, your husband's work), but tell me about the daybed that belonged to Rousseau!It's been in my family for as long as I can remember. My mother had it in London. It was kind of red, green and yellow striped canvas -- very chic in its London days. Then I brought it to America and it became blue velvet in the 70s. Now it's wearing a Fortuny outfit from the 90s. And at one point, Morris Graves a lovely artist friend of my mother's decided it needed swan feet to match the curved neck of the swan. So he made some cardboard feet that my mother had carved into wood. I also have a nice really big pair of Mermen from a Mexican church that my father had in Ireland and brought back and forth across the ocean a couple of times. But I'm a bit like a traveling circus. I do that to every hotel room I'm in. Like one of those old hippies that throws scarves on the lamps and burns incense. I was a model you know, that's how we lived.  What do you think is the essence of a life well lived?Squeezing the last drop out! I had dinner the other night with my brother Danny and my nephew Jack and some dear friends and we closed the restaurant. And that's what it's like. We always close the restaurant. I don't know, we just think we're so funny... It feels really good. Part of feeling like a clan and sharing this crazy wonderful background that we have.

10,HEALTHY LIVING,Accepting Change: Letting Yourself Fall in the Flow of Your Life,"Jeff Pulver, ContributorInternet Pioneer, VoIP. Entrepreneur. Speaker. Investor. Recen...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/accepting-change-letting-_b_6191176.html,"Growing up I have been reminded to not let days slip by and not to put things off. My dad often reminded me that the cliché ""Youth is wasted on the young"" is something he didn't want me to regret too.",2014-11-21,http://kuaijibbs.com/istockphoto/banner/zhuce1.jpg ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e68f33c00005b000a8922.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"While my current situation is not life-threatening, it has been life-altering. The following are my musings of dealing with a life-changing event.Imagine being in the top physical shape of your life. Years of training, rebooting your body. You changed your food habits, you had adopted exercise habits. You found yourself enjoying working out and making the gym a daily part of your life. Through your own journey you were able to drop 120+ pounds and rebooted your body chemistry so that you were no longer a health risk to yourself or to your loved ones.Just hours away from being a part of a 10k race which was the first organized race you had entered in your life. It wasn't about winning the race, that already happened when you entered. All you wanted to do was complete it.Six hours before leaving for the race, while waiting to have lunch with two friends on the beach in Tel Aviv, you go from sitting outside at the table to being inside an ambulance. Imagine having no memory of experiencing a five-minute seizure during which time, while seated, you dislocated your right shoulder, fractured two bones in the shoulder and tore the muscle from the bone. All you know is that you went from feeling pretty relaxed in a conversation to experiencing intense pain and not realizing for a while that you were in an ambulance or that 30 minutes of your life had gone by.And at the same moment, life was immediately different. You were no longer independent. You could not live alone or do for yourself. You were dependent on your friends and family to survive. You were living on pain meds. In my case, I am forever grateful for the friends who came to my support who took me to the hosipital and who cared for me like my family when this happened to me on October 28, 2014. Friends who were with me 24/7 at Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv and those who visited with me at the Sheraton in Tel Aviv before flying back to New York. I think Yossi Vardi summed it up the best when after I thanked him for all of his help while I was in the hospital; his reply was ""This is why friends were invented.""During the past 18 years, there has been very few times where I have stayed in one location for 30 days straight. Whether it was a meeting, a conference, an investment opportunity or a something, I have always been in motion. I wasn't prepared for this. I am still not ready to give in and not travel to someplace I feel I need to be.For someone who was living 24/7 on the Internet, time stopped. I still haven't recaptured the moments and have not been able to reply to the emails that were sent to me. I also had to let myself let go of my desire to connect across social channels and focus on my healing. It's not that I don't believe in Facebook, Instagram or twitter -- I do greatly. But letting go and accepting my new reality has come at a price. One, which I am still getting used to paying. But in order to sleep and to heal and to just get better, I've had to make the attempt to relax and close my eyes and not do everything I want to do. This remains both challenging and difficult.Growing up I have been reminded to not let days slip by and not to put things off. My dad often reminded me that the cliché ""Youth is wasted on the young"" is something he didn't want me to regret too.For some people these are just words. But when you wake up with your world upside down, you have the incentive to take positive action and to not let another day slip by. You want to maximize the time that you have and not live feeling that you are missing out on anything. Finding that balance between life and being and flow can be hard. But I am a new student to this lifestyle and I am learning.Upon arriving in New York and meeting with the surgeon who repaired my shoulder, I moved from my apartment and into my mom's home. Living independent for years and then waking up and not able to tie my own sneakers is a shock. So is not being able to dress yourself. Or deal easily with the reality that you are going to be wearing a shoulder sling for 6 weeks or that my physical therapy would last for a few months. Or that due to the seizure, in New York I can't drive a car for a year. There is a balance between wanting to be independent and finding a way to accept your own limitations without giving up. I am still learning that edge. And when I am able to show small steps of progress like being able to type again with two hands while not moving my right arm, or tie one of my shoes, I just smile. Turns out I have an amazing fantastic family. Everyone here is supportive and here for me. And I appreciate it greatly. While each day I hope to be another step closer to regaining my independence, each day I also appreciate my family even more.I am still struggling in the life/healing/being balance. I want to continue the life I had while giving my body a chance to rebuild and heal. My training sessions with Zoltan will be on hold while I go thru my physical therapy sessions. I got used to a lifestyle of intense training 3 days a week and walking 10,000 steps a day regardless of where I was or what else I was doing. I hope to get back to this lifestyle. But along the way I also hope to take in more sunrises and more sunsets and spend less time thinking about the things I have not done and more time focused on the things I want to try to be doing.One thing for certain, I will complete my physical therapy and I will travel again and I will live alone again. Not sure when that will be. And I will run in the Tel Aviv 10K night run. Running for myself and running for everyone else who wanted to be part of that race but wasn't able to join in."

Istanbul makes its 10th property (number 11 is coming to Jakarta soon). Just opened in September, there are 181 rooms and suites. Even the most basic room category measures 678 square feet, the largest entry-level rooms in the city, and include spacious terraces, walk-in closets, iPads with local info pre-loaded, free Wi-Fi, marble baths with rain showers and deep soaking tubs, and views. Oh, and a personal butler comes standard too.WHERE: Part of Istanbul's new Zorlu Center, a complex of 200 shops (everything from Gap to Gucci) along with condos, a performance center and theater managed by New York's Nederlanders, restaurants (including an outpost of Eataly) and offices, the hotel is located in a calm business and residential neighborhood on the European side of Istanbul on a hill overlooking the Bosphrorus. Istanbul's modern (and cheap) metro system is a three-minute walk away; three stops and you're in Taksim Square. WHY: If you haven't visited recently, know that today Istanbul is much more than historical treasures such as the Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace, Galata Tower, Basilica Cistern, the Grand Bazaar and Hagia Sophia. In recent years the city has welcomed a vibrant cultural scene, with art galleries (over 200 have opened in the last five years), museums, performances by local and international stars, annual festivals, and a lively nightlife scene. The local edition of Time Out (monthly) is thicker now than the London original, if that gives you any indication. And of course it's the gateway to the country's other must-sees (Cappadocia, Ephesus, Pamukkale), all an hour away by Turkish Airlines.WORKING WELL: Service is smooth and general manager Tarek Mourad has assembled a winning team (440 staff for the 181 rooms). Especially appreciated by those who still read printed material in bed, there are strong bedside reading lights. And who doesn't like a bathtub with a view?NEEDS IMPROVEMENT: Very little. One minor quibble is a lack of a 110-volt outlet by the desks, which should be standard in any new hotel hoping to attract North American visitors; there is one in the bathroom but most appliances with polarized plugs--the ones with one prong slightly bigger than the other--won't fit. (Housekeeping will provide European adapters and voltage converters on request so that you don't fry your WaterPik). Also, rooms lack hair dryers.MUST TRY: A short walk from the hotel in the Zorlu Center, two-Michelin-star chef Massimo Bottura has opened his first restaurant outside of Italy (book well ahead). Although it doesn't quite have the panache of the Singapore original, the hotel's Long Bar has indoor and outdoor seating and live entertainment, including a resident lady DJ.  And save time for exploring the hotel's 33,000-square-foot spa with Turkish hamams, saunas, steam rooms, and Jacuzzis. The naturally lit indoor pool and outdoor pool with its waterfall, cabanas, and panoramic views may be so tempting you never leave the property. The Technogym fitness center is open 24 hours a day.

Not Lauryn Hill of Fugees fame, but rather 19-year-old Lauren Hill, a student at Mount St. Joseph University near Cincinnati, Ohio. Lauren, a talented basketball player, stepped on the court recently for what should have been just the beginning of an illustrious college career. But instead, it would mark her very first and last game. Lauren is fighting an inoperable, and terminal brain tumor.During Lauren's senior high school basketball season, she began experiencing headaches and dizziness, only to find out that these were the symptoms of a brain tumor. Undeterred by her diagnosis, Lauren pushed forward, wanting to live out her dream of playing college basketball. When Lauren was told that she would likely not live to see 2015, she never gave up for a second; instead, she kept her commitment to the college basketball team, and in turn inspired her school to petition the NCAA to move up their first game to give Lauren a shot at playing. The first opponent for Lauren's team, Hiram College, would not only agree to move up the game by two weeks, they also gave up home court advantage, traveling to a 10,000 seat arena in Cincinnati, where every single seat was almost certainly filled with a Lauren Hill fan. The Hiram players however, had a secret -- they were Lauren Hill fans too. When Lauren scored the first basket of the game, and all eyes were on her, something went unnoticed: the 5 Hiram players on the court were cheering too.When I first heard Lauren's story, I couldn't help but be reminded of the legendary college basketball coach Jimmy Valvano and his famous speech which still resonates with many of us today. In Jimmy V's words, ""don't give up, don't ever give up."" A funny thing happened then, my memory took me to an equally powerful speech by Stuart Scott, who received the Jimmy V Perseverance Award at the 2014 ESPY's. Stuart, who is most well-known as an anchor of SportsCenter on ESPN, has been fighting cancer for over seven years, and said something that I've carried with me:""When you die, it does not mean that you lose to cancer, you beat cancer by how you live, why you live and in the manner in which you live."" These words could not be more accurate regarding how Lauren Hill has chosen to live with a terminal diagnosis. Lauren did not give up, she did not sit down, but instead kept her dreams alive in spite of the problems that she faced. The real winners in life aren't decided by the final score, who crosses the finish line first (or last), but rather how you choose to deal with the challenges presented to you. This is something that my daughter Alex embraced as well; she battled cancer for nearly her entire life, using the time she had to make a difference for others.There was something else in that speech that I remember, that when Stuart Scott can no longer fight, he has others around him who pick up his battles for him. Lauren Hill fought to get herself to that game, but she wouldn't have been able to do it without the support of those around her. Even the players of Hiram College helped Lauren to achieve her dream. She couldn't do it alone, and she didn't have to. The underlying theme here is twofold -- firstly that while sports can be divisive at times, at their core they make us cheer, bring us together and shine a light on important causes -- namely the fight against cancer. When the game is over and the crowd has gone home, let's not forget that the battle rages on. For Jimmy V., Stuart Scott, Lauren Hill, my daughter Alex, and the hundreds of thousands of other people who will battle cancer, the fight will not end until there are cures. These stories, the ones that we remember are not isolated ones, but rather snapshots of what is happening to thousands of people each day. After all, the second part of this story is those behind the scenes, out of the spotlight, who are moving us toward cures in their own ways. Maybe it's the parents, friends, family members, or maybe it's the doctors and nurses, or better yet, maybe it's all of us who are equally important to saving lives and moving toward the day when cures are realities. I urge you all to keep cheering, keep raising awareness for cancer, and continue to be moved to act beyond the final buzzer."

You’ve seen complaints about the quality of games on an almost weekly basis, even though that problem has plagued NBC’s Sunday Night Football just as badly, if not worse. That said, CBS got the desired effect from televising the games, increasing their audience on a night they were already competitive on.Basically, why quit when you’ve got a profitable, if flawed, thing going?John Ourand of Sports Business Daily spoke to pretty much every network head at SBJ/SBD’s Sports Media and Technology conference. While they all plan to bid, Ourand — who is usually bang on with stuff like this — predicts that CBS will retain Thursday Night Football in 2015. Whether its through the league option or a new deal is for another day.Put simply, every network still wants to televise this package, however, as blowouts have done little to tarnish the league (and the idea of games on Thursday nights) in the networks’ eyes:The leaders of four network sports divisions were asked a simple question at a recent industry conference: “Are you interested in bidding for ‘Thursday Night Football?’”So Thursday Night Football isn’t going away, not anytime soon. The NFL will decide upon a partner for 2015 (and possibly beyond) in the months to come. Perhaps they will also come upon a format to keep these games competitive and fresh, like a bye week for each team involved beforehand, if possible. That might force the NFL to have bye weeks in Weeks 1-15, but it might be worth it to make their budding franchise a true hit with diehard fans.[Sports Business Daily]"

(Photo by Scott Legato/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e69e02100003100c5ea9e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I could barely sleep the night before Oprah's The Life You Want Weekend. The high level of excitement reminded me of how as a kid, I tossed and turned on nights before trips to Disneyland. For years, I dreamed of traveling to Chicago to attend a taping of The Oprah Show. Instead, I was blessed to see Oprah for two days at her final tour stop in San Jose, Calif. The Life You Want Weekend was about encouraging people to find their purpose and live their dreams. Lady O brought a dream team of inspirational ""trailblazers"" including: Dr. Deepak Chopra, Elizabeth Gilbert, Pastor Rob Bell and Iyanla Vanzant. This was not just an event, but also a soulful and empowering experience. It was a celebration of life. The radiant energy from thousands of women (and a few men) in the arena was unforgettable. The tour couldn't have come at a better time. On my blog, I shared how the last four years have been rocky for me. Stress, health issues, betrayal by people I trusted, many deaths, career disappointments, trying to financially rebound from the recession -- all of this and more have been draining. While I consider myself to be a resilient person, I felt powerless a few weeks ago. When I prayed, I not only asked God to lift my burdens. I asked God to restore my power. So I went to The Life You Want Weekend with an open heart. On day one, Oprah graced the stage in a gorgeous, flowing orange dress. She beautifully shared her story of growing up a poor black girl from rural Mississippi, to becoming a media mogul passionate about using television to uplift people. Although the odds seemed stacked against her, and she faced obstacles, Oprah shared that even as a child she knew there was something greater for her in the world. ""Your life is being shaped by your beliefs,"" she said. ""You become what you believe.""For me, that meant if I believe I'm powerless, then I am. Or better yet, if I believe I still have power, then it's there. Dr. Deepak Chopra set the tone for day two with a wonderful meditation. His words struck me when later that afternoon he said, ""Fear is not letting go of your idea of how things should be."" At that light bulb moment, I decided to work at releasing my disappointment with how I thought things should be and accept where I am right now. Accepting doesn't mean settling for my situation, because I have the courage to make a difference in my own life. Dr. Chopra's definition of fear reminded me of Pastor Rob Bell's message about appreciating the present. In his humorous yet, moving speech he said, ""The life you want begins by embracing the life you already have. And the life you have is miraculous and matters--all of it."" Life isn't always easy, but I'm grateful I'm here another day. I'm grateful for true friends and family. As Pastor Bell said, my life, our lives, are miraculous because we were given breath. God, the Universe, whatever you call your Higher Power, chose to give us life. Iyanla Vanzant kicked off her talk with a toast. ""Here's to life,"" she said while raising a champagne glass in the air. As usual, the host of OWN's Iyanla Fix My Life kept it real, deep and meaningful with the audience. She compared creating a new life for yourself to bringing a life into the world. ""You've got to be willing to go through the pain to birth what you want,"" she told the audience. It's important to have compassion for yourself during the ups and downs. Which is why one of my favorite quotes from Iyanla's speech is, ""Make loving you a priority."" Eat, Pray, Love author Elizabeth Gilbert talked about the quest we take to discover our purpose, and being the hero (or shero) of our own stories. She asked the audience, ""Are we still planning to become the heroes of our own stories? Or are we still waiting for somebody to step in and fill that position for us?"" This resonated with me deeply. As she explained about the hero narrative, all heroes reach points in the story where they feel defeated. However, they eventually gather the strength to rise and be victorious. The hero learns from their challenges, which propels him or her to victory. Oprah said our hardships give us strength. ""Strength times strength times strength...equals power,"" she said. This all made me think about ways I could make a difference in my life and create my victorious ending. The pen is still in my hand. I realize that throughout life's challenges, my power has always been there. While I thought it was low, it was actually building up. Oprah's The Life You Want Weekend reenergized my spirit. I definitely left the arena feeling more empowered. Other women I spoke to shared my feelings. Oprah encouraged the audience to, ""Take your glory and run!"" Now that I recognize my self-power is charging, I'm not only ready to run. I'm ready to soar."
