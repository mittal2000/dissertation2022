""First, you put it on--simply put it on your body,"" the founder of Belusso swimwear tells Glamour, ""but do not assume it's ready to go at this point.""Here's why a perfect-fitting suit can require a little bit of adjusting--and three easy steps to making sure everything is shimmied into place.Per Sarkisian, getting the perfect fit can be broken down into three quick steps.1. Right away, handle the straps, making them tighter or looser so that they feel secure but aren't digging into your skin.2. Then, manually arrange your breasts by picking them up and pulling them gently toward the center of your torso--they should be fully enclosed by the structure of the bikini top.3. Finish by checking yourself in a mirror to see if the top is riding up too high in the back or on the sides and make slight coordinating adjustments to the straps.If you find you're rarely pleased with how your curves look in a bikini, there could be a sneaky suspect to blame.""Padding can sag when it gets wet and takes longer to dry than the rest of the suit,"" Sarkisian said. ""A suit with a little bit of it can be a good call for women with smaller breasts, but beware. Look for suits with removable pads so you can pull it out if need be.""More from Glamour: 10 Things He's Thinking When You're Naked  What Men Really Think About Your Underwear 30 Hair Color Ideas to Try Now 50 Swimsuits That'll Make You Look 10 Pounds Thinner 10 Makeup Tips Every Woman Should Know 6 Things Men Never Notice During SexAlso on HuffPost:"

4,POLITICS,New York's Forgotten Island Shrugs At Hillary Clinton's Big 2016 Debut,Scott Conroy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-roosevelt_n_7547602.html,,2015-06-10,"New York City's Roosevelt Island is viewed in this aerial photograph from a helicopter over New York on November 11, 2008. AFP PHOTO / Saul LOEB (Photo credit should read SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ff711f00000002258045.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ROOSEVELT ISLAND, N.Y. -- It’s easy to understand why Hillary Clinton is holding her first 2016 campaign rally at Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park on Saturday. The symbolism is about as subtle as a yellow-cab driver caught behind a slow-moving vehicle with the windows rolled down. Her midday speech will take place in the city where her family’s multibillion-dollar Clinton Foundation is based in the state she represented in the Senate for eight years and at a park that honors one of the most famous speeches delivered by America’s most revered Democratic president. ""She has long been inspired by FDR’s belief that America is stronger when we summon the work and talents of all Americans,” said Clinton spokesperson Kristina Schake. “Her fight, like his, is to work to ensure that everyday Americans can achieve not just a sense of economic stability, but lasting prosperity.""Though the park's namesake will be a fundamental element of Clinton’s speech, less central to her unofficial campaign kickoff is Roosevelt Island itself -- a quirky sanctuary of inner-city suburbia, which bisects the East River between Manhattan and Queens. To the people who live here, though, that’s not much of a surprise. This is a place that is used to getting overlooked. A 2-mile by 800-foot sliver of land that is currently inhabited by about 14,000 people in a city of more than 8 million, Roosevelt Island remains a peaceful hamlet by New York City standards. It is perhaps best known for the aerial tramway that offers a mobile addition to the Upper East Side’s skyline and was featured in a memorable fight scene in the 2002 ""Spider-Man"" film. By and large, in a city famous for its islands, this particular needle-shaped landmass -- which falls under the jurisdiction of Manhattan -- has long been largely anonymous outside (and sometimes inside) the city.“When I was growing up and through high school, you’d tell kids, ‘I live on Roosevelt Island,’ and it was like, ‘Where?’” said Mike Babcock, whose family was one of the pioneering families to move to the island in 1975, when the first residential building opened. “And these were kids who lived in the city.” But that undistinguished image has been changing quickly. Over the last couple of decades, Roosevelt Island has experienced a demographic evolution and construction explosion that has left it a more diverse and heavily urbanized place than it was decades ago -- a lot like the American electorate that the Clinton campaign believes will propel her to the White House. “On the tram, you used to pretty much know everyone by sight,” said Lillian Kirkman, who has lived on Roosevelt Island since 1982. “Now it’s pretty much like riding the subway.”It’s possible to traverse Roosevelt Island on foot in under a minute, but this is no longer a parochial place. Take a stroll down Main Street, and it can feel like you’re walking the halls of the United Nations just across the river, as more than 40 percent of the population here was born in a different country. The modern incarnation of Roosevelt Island was founded as a place where small-town charm could be found within spitting distance of the most exciting city on earth, but its enduring legacy has long been that of a place in constant transition. Back in the 19th century when it was known as Blackwell’s Island, it was home to a prison, the nation’s first hospital for treating smallpox sufferers, and the New York City Lunatic Asylum where investigative reporter Nelly Bly faked insanity and later reported in the New York World her groundbreaking investigation of the facility’s wretched conditions.After a long period of decline, the island was rechristened Roosevelt Island in 1973 in honor of the nation’s 32nd president, and a dramatic revitalization effort began that turned it into a thriving community intended primarily to offer subsidized housing to young families with a wide range of income levels. An increasingly Democratic slice of a heavily Democratic city, it’s not just the Starbucks and Duane Reade, both of which opened a few years ago, that has signaled Roosevelt Island’s absorption into the modern urban aesthetic that has taken hold from coast to coast since Clinton’s husband’s presidency. The Octagon -- a relatively imposing structure presiding over the northern end of the island -- originally served as the asylum’s main entrance. Now it is the entranceway for a pair of solar panel and fuel cell-equipped high-rise apartment buildings.And in 2011, then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced that Roosevelt Island would be the site of a more than $2 billion science graduate school for Cornell University -- likely the single most transformational development in the island’s recent history. The “Four Freedoms” Park, where Clinton will speak on Saturday, opened the year after that. Still, unlike just about every other corner of New York, even as it has changed rapidly, Roosevelt Island has resisted some of the allures of its neighboring localities. Here, $16 cocktails and ironic handlebar mustaches remain as scarce as they are common to the Instagram-saturated streets not far from the Clinton campaign’s Brooklyn Heights headquarters. You will, however, find some of the same generally unimpressed attitudes that prevail in the hipper parts of town. “We’ve had lots of local politicians -- senators and congressmen -- no one like Hillary,” said Judy Berdy, president of the Roosevelt Island Historical Society and a lifelong resident. “But I just shrug. It’s part of living in New York. You get used to it.” Just four days before the big rally, there were few signs that anything particularly special was on the horizon, as residents prepared for Saturday’s Roosevelt Island Day -- an annual, family-friendly event that will take place concurrently with the Clinton rally.At Piccolo Trattoria on Main Street on Tuesday, a sparse lunchtime crowd ordered pizza slices and deli sandwiches, as employees mopped the floor and took some run-of-the-mill verbal abuse from one woman, who wasn’t especially impressed by the yellow sign that warned her to watch her step. “Seriously, it’s very slippery in here,” she said. “If I fall, you’re screwed!”After Jesus Alvarez, 19, took the woman’s order from behind the counter, a reporter approached to ask what he thought about Hillary Clinton coming to the neighborhood. Alvarez, who has been working at Roosevelt Island’s lone pizza slice joint for about a year, offered a perplexed look along with a reminder that for the vast majority of Americans, the 2016 election remains far from the forefront of their minds. “There’s a rally here?” he asked. “I hadn’t heard about it.” "
5,RELIGION,To Serve and to Keep: Responding to Pope Francis' Call to Become Protectors of Creation,"Rabbi Lawrence Troster, ContributorEco-Theologian, Educator and Environmental Activist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/to-serve-and-to-keep-responding-to-pope-francis_b_7548114.html,Efforts like those of EcoPeace come at a critical moment in human history. Environmental degradation and climate change have become the focus of concern for people of all faiths worldwide.,2015-06-10,2015-06-09-1433889153-6039290-FaithleaderssupportingtherehabiliationoftheJordanRiver.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-09-1433889153-6039290-FaithleaderssupportingtherehabiliationoftheJordanRiver-thumb.jpg,"This post is co-authored by Jeff Odell Korgen. Most of the run-up to Pope Francis' ecology encyclical Laudato Sii (Praised Be), due to appear on June 18, has focused on issues of natural ecology like climate change, fracking, and mining. But the encyclical will also call our attention to human ecology --how we treat each other -- and its relationship to the environment. Pope Francis calls this ""integral ecology."" An interfaith campaign in the Jordan River Valley illustrates the concept.EcoPeace brings together Jordanian, Palestinian, and Israeli leaders to protect their shared regional environment. By doing so EcoPeace also promotes the conditions necessary for peace by organizing sustainable development. Its educational campaign about the environmental challenges facing the Jordan River encourages all people of the region to participate in joint efforts to restore an important spiritual symbol. The interfaith campaign of EcoPeace brings Christians, Muslims and Jews on educational tours of the Lower Jordan River where they learn about the river's religious significance in the Abrahamic traditions. EcoPeace inspires action-based community responses by showing the environmental reality of the river. It has also engaged religious and community leaders, and regional governments in signing and implementing the Covenant for the Jordan River, a statement that calls for the restoration of the Jordan Valley.Efforts like those of EcoPeace come at a critical moment in human history. Environmental degradation and climate change have become the focus of concern for people of all faiths worldwide. The upcoming encyclical will not only be a document for Catholics but will inspire all people of good will to become, in the Pope's words, ""Protectors of Creation.""To underscore the need for protectors of Creation, Pope Francis has often referred to Genesis 2:15 where the human, the adam (more literally the ""earthling"") is put in the Garden of Eden by God to ""till it and keep it"" or, as another translation says, ""to till it and to tend it."" For Pope Francis the concepts of ""tilling"" and ""keeping"" stand for a reciprocal relationship between humanity and Creation in which humans have a ""sacred duty"" to use the goodness of the earth only in a way that ensures that future generations will also enjoy Creation's bounty.This interpretation of Genesis 2:15 is echoed in Jewish sources where the Hebrew word translated as ""to till,"" (leovda) has a basic meaning of ""to work,"" but can also mean ""to serve"" or to ""worship."" The second word, ""keep"" or ""tend,"" (leshomra) has a core meaning of ""guard"" or ""protect."" The Earth can serve us, but we also must to serve the earth and preserve it for future generations. This call to serve, be served and protect for the future correlates with the standard definition of sustainable development: meeting the needs of the present generation without jeopardizing the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.Pope Francis has also utilized the New Testament portrayal of Joseph, the father of Jesus, as the model of how someone can become a ""protector,"" respecting all of the creatures of Creation, including all people.Pope Francis has noted that protectors of creation need to become protectors of people too. This is what integral ecology is all about. The kind of cooperation and peacebuilding that Ecopeace has built in the Jordan Valley stands as a shining example of integral ecology -- where peacebuilding and protection of Creation meet.We see this also in Yeb Sanyo's pilgrimages to ecologically vulnerable sites around the world which will end up in Paris in time for the beginning of the climate treaty talks in early December. Yeb's walks are part of the OurVoices' People's Pilgrimage campaign that anyone can join through a visit to a personally meaningful site. OurVoices is also co-sponsoring a march in Rome on Sunday, June 28, when thousands of Catholics, people of diverse faiths, and people of goodwill will walk from Piazza Farnese to St. Peter's Square in Vatican City. The march, One Earth, One Human Family, will thank Pope Francis for his encyclical and call for action on climate change by world leaders. It will also be an epic celebration to show how deeply faith communities care about climate change.It is time for all of us to stand up, speak out and become protectors of Creation. In the Book of Genesis the Jordan River valley is described as a ""garden of God"" (13:10) and is the place where Joshua led the Israelites into the Holy Land. It is the place where the New Testament says John the Baptist baptized Jesus. Several of the Prophet Muhammad's companions were buried on its eastern shore. Just as Israelis, Palestinians and Jordanians are trying to be protectors of Creation in their work in the Jordan River valley, so must all of us, inspired by their example and by Pope Francis' encyclical, become the protectors of the whole of the Earth and of one another. Faith Leaders Supporting the Rehabilitation of the Jordan River (Picture Courtesy of EcoPeace)This is the third in a series of posts on the encyclical by Jeffry Odell Korgen & Rabbi Lawrence Troster who are engaging Catholic and Jewish communities in OurVoices, the international, multi-faith climate campaign."
6,GREEN,How the Inga Dams Are Holding the Congo's Energy Future Hostage,"Peter Bosshard, ContributorSenior Advisor, International Rivers",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-the-inga-dams-are-hol_b_7548400.html,It is time for the World Bank and the DRC government to embrace more feasible solutions and stop holding the Congolese population hostage to their multi-billion dollar dreams.,2015-06-10,2015-06-09-1433892765-2014957-Inga1and2EncyclopediaBritannica.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-09-1433892765-2014957-Inga1and2EncyclopediaBritannica-thumb.jpg," World Bank and government officials like to describe the proposed Grand Inga dams on the Congo as a ""dream for Africa"", which could electrify the whole continent at low cost. Instead, the world's largest hydropower scheme risks turning into a nightmare which crowds out better solutions and pulls the Congo's energy sector down the drain.In March 2014, the World Bank approved a grant of $73 million to help the Democratic Republic of Congo prepare the Inga 3 Project, the first stage of the giant Grand Inga complex on the Congo River. By this time, the African Development Bank had already spent more than $50 million on feasibility reports for the dam. At 4,800 megawatts, Inga 3 would be the World Bank's biggest hydropower project ever. It will consist of a long intake canal from the Congo River, a 100-meter high dam, a hydropower plant and 3,400 kilometers of transmission lines to South Africa.Inga 3 was expected to start generating electricity in 2021, and the groundbreaking ceremony was scheduled for October 2015. Yet a year into the project, the dreamers at the World Bank are waking up to the hard reality of mega-dams. By mid-2015, the DRC government was supposed to have created a special agency to carry out the project. Consultants should have completed resettlement action plans. A private consortium to invest in the project should have been selected, and negotiations for concession and power purchasing agreements were supposed to be underway.As of today, none of this has happened. Of the three consortia that were selected for the final bidding round for the project, two turned out to be ineligible because of corruption and other malpractices. And after a feasibility process that has already lasted close to five years, the engineering companies recently recommended that the dam site be moved due to unfavorable geological conditions. Given the history of the Inga 1 and 2 dams, which were built at the same location in the 1970s and early 1980s, none of this should have come as a surprise. As an excellent account recalls under the title, The River That Swallows All Dams, the Inga 2 Dam was propagated for producing the cheapest power in the world, yet ended up generating some of the most expensive. Due to the exorbitant delays and cost overruns, the project was a major factor in the DRC's debt crisis.The Inga 1 and 2 dams never generated electricity at full capacity. In 2003, the World Bank committed to rehabilitating the neglected power stations and their transmission lines at a cost of $200 million. Twelve years into the project, the costs have more than quadrupled, and the work is far from complete. Recent World Bank updates reveal that so far, only one of the 14 turbines at the two plants has been fully refurbished. No new consumers have been connected to the electric grid yet. Under the transmission project, 286 kilometers of new lines have been built, but none of the 4,000 kilometers of existing lines have been rehabilitated. Needless to say, Inga 3 and the Grand Inga complex (with almost 13,000 kilometers of new transmission lines) will be incomparably more complex than the rehabilitation of the existing power infrastructure in the DRC. ""If we're struggling with a 5,000 megawatt project, how are we going to get a 100,000 megawatt project off the ground?"" the head of an earlier failed effort to build the Inga 3 Dam commented. ""Maybe this is mother nature's way of saying 'don't come and disturb me.'""Luckily, practical alternatives to the mega-dams on the Congo River exist. The DRC has a large potential for small and medium-sized hydropower projects, which are more effective at providing energy to the poor, have a modest social and environmental footprint and can be built quickly. Small hydropower projects are already generating power in Eastern Congo, and mid-sized projects such as Zongo 2 are under construction in various parts of the country. Southern Africa also has a huge potential of cost-effective solar and wind energy, including across the DRC border in Angola. Such projects can be developed in two to three years. In fact, the multi-billion dollar Medupi coal-fired power plant in South Africa which the World Bank approved in 2010 is experiencing massive delays, while the wind plants which were also part of the project have already started generating power. Such projects could already deliver benefits to the Congolese population if the development banks had promoted them instead of Inga 3 over the past five years.The problem is that the World Bank and the government's strong focus on mega-dams absorbs all the political will, management capacity and money in the DRC's energy sector. The Inga dams are undermining the chances of other projects to go forward. Because the government utility is facing huge financial problems with Inga 2, China Exim Bank has for example stopped its loan disbursements for the Zongo 2 Dam, and the 150 megawatt project has been halted since November 2014.What the World Bank sees as a ""dream for Africa"", the Financial Times has described ""one of Africa's largest white elephants"". Others have described it as a nightmare, a wet dream, and ""a mirage ever shimmering just out of reach."" It is time for the World Bank and the DRC government to embrace more feasible solutions and stop holding the Congolese population hostage to their multi-billion dollar dreams."

Spokespeople for the city and the museums declined to comment on what additional measures are being taken, citing security concerns.

I am in a middle seat between my fiancé and a dear friend. Both have had two Bloody Marys and are passed out because they don't like to fly. I, on the other hand, love to fly. And being in the air is what actually gives me time to do this -- write. It also gives me the opportunity to connect with what is most important in my life -- family and friends.My most recent trip could not exemplify this more. Though 95 percent of the flights I take are for business, this past Friday I hopped on a 7a.m. flight from Los Angeles to New York to see a dear friend in an 8p.m. performance of the Broadway show ""Lend Me A Tenor."" It sounds insane but in fact it was a wonderful idea because part of my 2010 New Year's Resolution was not to miss any significant events in my friends' or family's lives.In this case, this friend was just cast as the lead in his first Broadway play and with my new resolution in hand I had to support him. The problem was I had to be back in Los Angeles the following day for a work event so my solution had to be rogue, efficient, and 24 hours. So Friday I was on a plane, five hours later I was arriving in New York and one hour later I was landing at the Music Box Theater. Noting I may not be impartial, my friend truly stole the show and after a standing ovation the entire cast brought him back on stage for the final bow of the evening. That evening, just ten hours from my departure I stood with tears of joy streaming down my face and could not help but think, that if it wasn't for the Wright brothers hundred year old invention I would have missed out on this singular opportunity to support and enjoy a friend.That brings me back to sitting in the middle seat on a plane headed to New Orleans. Presently, I am headed to my hometown of Hattiesburg, Mississippi because two of my dearest childhood friends have organized the ""Festival of Art and Imagination"" to benefit the charity I started 13 years ago. The charity was formed after I lost my dear friend Stephen Hatten to Leukemia and the organization was my way to enshrine his beautiful spirit.And now flying home to receive the support of my family and childhood friends it is impossible for me to once again not think of the wonder of the Wright brother's invention. Not for holding me 20,000 feet in the air, not for giving me the opportunity to use wifi in the clouds, but for inventing a way for me to do with family and friends what I have longed to do my entire life, no matter the time, place, or reason -- connect.

(Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb6054b2200005700dca1d3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Mondays tend to be disorienting enough. But the events that transpired in the pop culture sphere this week set a particularly confusing tone to the day, forcing innocent consumers to question their loyalties and even, shockingly, suspect that the media may in fact not have the purest of intentions. The action actually began on Sunday, when an unlikely source fiercely declared herself as a feminist, taking to social media to unleash an impassioned essay regarding the media's dehumanizing depiction of women as mere arm candy accessorizing the appendages of successful men. ""I... do not. belong. to anyone. but myself. and neither do you,"" she wrote, chastising media outlets for perpetuating stale double standards and explicit misogyny. She name-dropped the likes of Gloria Steinem, called out the injustice of female slut-shaming and beseeched young women to recognize their truth worth and inherent value. Ariana Grande: badass feminist. Color me old (it's cool, I am, what with being over 30and all that), but I am not intimately familiar with the nuances of Grande's public persona. Perhaps she's long been hailed a feminist icon, and I've simply been in the dark, but her essay felt groundbreaking, if not a little shocking (in the best way possible) when it came across my feed yesterday morning. In the context of famous young women continuously denying their right (obligation?) to identify as feminists, Grande stood up loud and proud and sent an incredibly important message to her young, impressionable fans, and to women all around the world: the media is fucked up, and you deserve better. With the unexpected arrival of this declaration, things started out well on Monday. But quickly took a turn. It was early yet -- just after 8 a.m. -- and the day was filled with so much promise. But then Beyoncé appeared on my television screen and spent the next several minutes extolling the benefits of a vegan diet. Not the health benefits or the environmental payoff, however. No, Beyoncé really just wanted viewers to know that veganism is how she triumphed over her body, achieving that fit, trim figure admired the world over, and that we can follow in her dainty footsteps -- all for the price of one best-selling diet book. That's right, just as Ariana Grande -- pop princess, wearer of cat ears -- revealed herself to the world as a strong, self-possessed female standing up for the empowerment of other women and girls, Beyoncé -- fierce, outspoken feminist, champion of equality -- told us her secret to flatter abs. It was a confusing day, indeed. I experience an overwhelming, almost visceral sense of uneasiness when I morally disagree on any issue with Beyoncé. I'm a superfan. I worship at her altar. I drink the Bey Kool-Aid. And she's given me good reason to do so: Besides being a mind-blowing performer and entertainer, she's an activist, arguably doing more to further the conversation on equality than any celebrity with her expansive influence. She drops speeches on feminism from Nigerian writer Chimamamda Ngozi Adichie smack dab in the middle of radio-friendly tracks. She performs proudly on MTV in front of a towering backdrop boldly emblazoned with the word ""FEMINIST."" She's dominated a notoriously male-run industry, successfully standing atop her own empire and supporting women every step of the way. So when she has a slip-up, I wince a little. And I wasn't alone yesterday. I was heartened to log into Facebook and see a trending news story regarding the outrage Beyoncé fans were expressing over her morning announcement. I felt validated to know that others stood up and took notice, calling out the hypocrisy and degradation of this impossibly strong female role model taking to the airwaves to shill out a diet book. But I quickly learned the legions of angry Beyhive members weren't up in arms over the decidedly disempowering move. They were pissed because they expected a bigger announcement. In fairness, the irritation is understandable.""Good Morning America"" teased the three-minutes-and-change segment as if the singer were about to unveil a new album, tour, baby, documentary series and cure for cancer, all in one breath. The endorsement of a diet book she'd already publicly supported for months felt underwhelming to some, and insulting to many. But I have yet to see any ire over the endorsement itself. The fact that a woman who has stood for so much more substance has stooped to plugging diet advice. A woman who has taken on society's soul-crushing, oppressive beauty ideals in her song ""Pretty Hurts,"" is advocating veganism as a vehicle for sustained weight loss. A woman with over 35 million Instagram followers and sold-out stadiums worth of male and female fans is using her platform to sheepishly confess, ""I am not naturally the thinnest,"" on national television and that she's finally found a food plan that ""keeps the weight off.""This isn't the Beyoncé I know, love and admire, and the stumble is hard to stomach. It would be a flat-out lie to deny the fact that much of her fame has undoubtedly been influenced by her iconic body. But the agency Beyoncé took in displaying, flaunting, concealing and using her body onstage and onscreen differentiated her from other female performers who have seemingly been positioned as scantily-clad puppets selling iTunes singles. Beyoncé owned her body in a way that felt powerful. And surrendering that power in order to promote a diet book doesn't feel relatable or real; it feels weak.I'm grateful for the empowering messages Beyoncé and women like her have fearlessly put forward in the name of feminism. And I'm happily surprised to find that others in the public eye like Grande are opting to own their feminist convictions and unapologetically stand for something more than their looks, weight, or carefully-contoured faces. I just hope Beyoncé doesn't continue to disappoint -- the world is confusing enough.This article originally appeared on the author's website: www.michellekmedia.com.

12,POLITICS,LAPD Officer Involved In Ezell Ford Shooting Found To Have Acted 'Out Of Policy',Matt Ferner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ezell-ford-lapd_n_7548504.html,,2015-06-10,"LOS ANGELES, CA - DECEMBER 29: People look at a mural of Ezell Ford, a 25-year-old mentally ill black man, at the site where he was shot and killed by two LAPD officers in August, on December 29, 2014 in Los Angeles, California. The long-awaited autopsy report, which was put on a security hold at the request of police and ordered by L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti to be made public before the end of 2014, was released December 29. (Photo by David McNew/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ff8a240000310099018e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"LOS ANGELES -- The civilian board that oversees the Los Angeles Police Department ruled Tuesday that one of the officers involved in the fatal shooting of Ezell Ford last year in a south LA neighborhood was acting ""out of policy"" in his use of lethal force.The second officer involved in the shooting was found to be acting within policy with regards to use of force. While the identities of both officers are known -- Sharlton Wampler and Antonio Villegas -- the Police Commission did not identify which officer was out of policy.""This is a tragedy for all involved,"" Police Commission President Steve Soboroff said late Tuesday. ""The Ford family, my fellow commissioners express our deepest condolences.""The commission had deliberated for more than three hours, after hours of tense public comment.Reacting to the decision, some protestors shouted ""Murderers!"" inside the LAPD headquarters. Multiple demonstrators outside voiced disappointment to The Huffington Post, saying the decision was simply a ""slap on the wrist.""The commission also faulted both officers for drawing their weapons during different moments of the confrontation with Ford.""This incident has changed all involved in it forever,"" Soboroff said. The case for the officer found out of policy now returns to LAPD Chief Charlie Beck, who will decide what discipline, if any, the officer will receive.  During the public comment period in front of the commission -- with Beck and Soboroff in attendance -- frustration, anger, sadness and disappointment with the LAPD was voiced by dozens of community members. They called for the rejection of a pair of reports from Beck and LAPD inspector general Alex Bustamante that found the fatal shooting of Ford, an unarmed, mentally ill black man, was justified. The commission considered those reports -- the results of which were revealed by the LA Times last week -- when making its own decision, but was not bound by their findings. Indeed, the commission's unanimous vote on the one officer's use of force being out of policy is a rejection of Beck and Bustamante's reports on that issue.Many who spoke before the commission Tuesday sought punishment for the two officers involved in the August 2014 shooting. A significant amount of criticism was also directed at Beck, with some calling for his resignation or firing.""Chief, you're a goddamned train wreck,"" said one black man dressed in a bright red robe that resembled those worn by the Ku Klux Klan, which he said the police represent. ""You're sitting up there like everything is OK. It's not OK! People lost respect in you.""Another speaker threw dozens of sheets of paper on the floor, each one representing a person killed by the LAPD.Dredric Kennedy, one of dozens of demonstrators who have been gathering in front of Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti's official residence in support of Ford, characterized the police department as a ""racist gang.""One man did defend Beck, saying it's not fair to call him racist given the current diversity of the LAPD force. But his sentiments were followed by jeers from other community members.The public comment period was frequently interrupted by demonstrators chanting. At one point, the phrase ""Ezell Ford's life matters!"" echoed through the halls of the LAPD. Tensions culminated when, about an hour into the comments, the entire commission stood up and left the room to take an abrupt recess. The panel returned about 10 minutes later and the proceedings resumed.As the comment period neared its end, Ford's weeping mother, Tritobia Ford, pleaded with the panel for justice. ""All my son wanted to do was live,"" she said. ""How can [the officers] not have a reason to stop him, but yet you clear them? Please, I have faith in you yet. He had been stopped before and lived. These officers did wrong.""The Beck and Bustamante reviews both concluded that the use of lethal force by the officers who shot Ford was justified, the commission announced Tuesday. The LA Times reported that department investigators found evidence that Ford had struggled for control of one officer's gun -- a claim that supports the account the officers gave following the shooting.  Nonetheless, Bustamante, the inspector general, did find fault in the way the officers first approached Ford that night.What exactly prompted officers Wampler and Villegas to stop Ford the night he was shot and killed is still unknown, as the LAPD has never released an official explanation. But Beck and Bustamante's reports gave the first glimpse into the officers' reasoning. Beck's report said the officers suspected Ford, 25, had recently purchased drugs because he was walking away from a group of people near an alley known for drug use, according to the LA Times. But Bustamante's report offered a conflicting version of events, saying that the officers told investigators that they never saw Ford interact with the group and that when they first saw him, Ford was already as much as 30 feet away from the group. No drugs were ever recovered on or near Ford, the LA Times reported, citing anonymous law enforcement sources. The Police Commission decision comes after days of demonstrations outside Getty House, the mayor's official residence, calling for the firing of Chief Beck over his handling of the Ford case. Near the front gates of Getty House, groups of protesters have gathered since Sunday, holding signs, posting photos of Ford and writing chalk messages on the sidewalk.In 2014, the coroner's official autopsy report ruled that Ford's death was a homicide, noting that he had been shot three times, resulting in two fatal wounds and one nonfatal wound.The skin around one fatal wound in Ford's back had a ""muzzle imprint,"" which may suggest the shot was taken at close range. The second fatal wound was in the side of Ford's abdomen. The third wound was on his right arm.Ford died just two days after teenager Michael Brown was fatally shot by a Ferguson, Missouri, police officer. Weeks earlier, New York resident Eric Garner had died at the hands of a police officer. The national protests over the deaths of Brown and Garner have also cited Ford's case. The local man's death also sparked multiple protests around Los Angeles in the months that followed.Police and eyewitness accounts of the shooting vary wildly. Police have said that during a struggle, Ford attempted to pull an officer's handgun from its holster, and in response, the officers shot Ford. But eyewitnesses have disputed that story, saying that Ford was shot in the back while already lying on the ground. One eyewitness said he heard a police officer shout, ""Shoot him!"" just before Ford was shot three times as he was lying on the ground.Steven Lerman, a lawyer for the Ford family, described the shooting as ""an execution."" The family filed a $75 million wrongful death lawsuit last year. Earlier this year, they filed a second lawsuit against both the city and the LAPD that alleges Ford was targeted by law enforcement because of his race. "

Eventually, I showed Southdown sheep with 4-H. I even won the San Bernardino County 4-H'er of the Year award. Point being, I was lucky enough to grow up surrounded by beautiful animal friends who always soothed me. Cows, sheep, horses, chickens, pigs, cats, dogs... they were my childhood friends. My refuge.

As such, I have aligned myself with the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) for some time now. Yesterday, they issued a report that initially made me a bit skeptical regarding Costco and hens -- so I quizzed Paul Shapiro, VP of Farm Animal Protection at HSUS about their expose of Costco, and here is how it went: CJ: Hi Paul -- thank you for talking with me. I saw the release come out earlier about this and I wondered: Did Costco have an opportunity to see this or was it an ambush? PS: We've been trying hard to work with Costco for many months, and really even years. Very hard. But the company refused to have a substantive conversation about its egg supply, despite the fact that eight years ago it publicly indicated its intent to sell only cage-free eggs. Nearly a decade later, the company has no timeline for fulfilling that announcement. This was hardly a surprise for the companyCJ: So for the record, you have indeed tried to work with Costco?PS: We notified Costco about this problem long before today. But it's not too late. The company can address the issue by moving to a cage-free egg policy similar to what companies like Burger King and Unilever are doing: going 100 percent cage-free with public timelines.CJ: I've always viewed HSUS as bridge builders and for a moment there today I was wondering if you were going all Ingrid Newkirk on us...PS: I hope Ingrid had a good birthday this week! You can see how HSUS typically works with companies cooperatively to achieve meaningful animal welfare reforms at this Fortune article. CJ: What has the response been from Costco thus far? Have they reached out? It's a pretty damning clip.PS: Costco's public response so far has been silence, but the company's customer service reps have been misleading callers by falsely telling them that Costco already prohibits cage eggs in its supply. If that were true, we'd be praising them.CJ: What, in the view of HSUS, should Costco do in response to this and what do you plan to do if they continue to sit on their hands?PS: Costco should fulfill its 2007 pledge and stop selling eggs from birds locked in cages.CJ: Anything else to add on this general issue?PS: We're disappointed that Costco still allows its egg suppliers to keep birds in filthy, cramped cages for their whole lives.

Iraqi forces closed in on Ramadi and launched the operation dubbed Labaik ya Hussein', which roughly translates as 'We are at your service, Hussein' and refers to one of the most revered imams in Shiite Islam. It will see a mix of security forces and paramilitaries move south towards the city from Salaheddin province, said Hashed al-Shaabi ('popular mobilisation' in Arabic) spokesman Ahmed al-Assadi.

Strong was convicted of fatally stabbing his girlfriend and her 2-year-old daughter 15 years ago in suburban St. Louis. (Missouri Department of Corrections via AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ba2c7e0240000310095ea69.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Missouri murderer Richard Strong was executed by lethal injection Tuesday night after authorities turned aside a last-minute plea from his daughter, who was only months old when Strong killed her mother and 2-year-old half-sister.Strong, 47, was pronounced dead at 6:58 p.m. at the Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center in Bonne Terre, Missouri, according to the state Department of Corrections. He ate a last meal of fried chicken, a cheeseburger and donuts, and asked forgiveness, according to the department. His last words were: “Jehovah-jireh, you’re my provider. Your grace is sufficient for me. Forgive me for my sin. Abba-Abba, take my soul in your hands.”Gov. Jay Nixon focused on Strong’s victims in a statement, acknowledging “there have been many lives deeply affected by these crimes.”Petrina Thomas, whose niece was the toddler Strong killed, witnessed the execution and said in a statement she read to reporters that her family “was so glad that it is finally over.” (Read her full statement below.)The execution was carried out after an unsuccessful plea for clemency from his daughter, who was a baby in 2000 when Strong murdered her mother and her half-sister. Last-minute appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court and to Nixon also failed.Strong was sentenced to death in 2003 for fatally stabbing his 23-year-old girlfriend, Eva Washington, and her daughter from a previous relationship, Zandrea Thomas, in their suburban St. Louis apartment. He left Alyshia Strong, his baby with Washington, unharmed. Strong Murder victim Zandrea Thomas.Alyshia Strong, now 14, said she has forgiven her father and pleaded for clemency in the days before his execution. ""I understand that my father needs to face consequences and to pay for what he did, but I do not think it is right for me to lose my father as part of the punishment,"" Alyshia Strong wrote in her clemency petition.She wrote that she frequently visits her dad in prison, and said his advice led her to behave better in school.""My father told me that I should stay clear of the drama at school, and stay focused on the books, not the people. I listened to my father's advice, and I can honestly say that I had less drama in my school year than I would have if I had not listened to my father,"" she wrote.The U.S. Supreme Court voted 5-4 against issuing a stay that would have postponed Tuesday’s execution. Strong's attorney, Jennifer Herndon, argued that Strong was mentally ill. She said both Strong and Washington suffered from mental illness and argued frequently, according to The Associated Press.""He just snapped,"" Herndon said. ""It was just sort of a powder keg waiting to explode. It wasn't a healthy relationship.""Nixon declined to halt the lethal injection, saying in a statement that the fatal stabbing of the mother and daughter was ""very brutal.""Strong is the fourth person to be executed in Missouri this year, and the 16th in the U.S. Petrina Thomas, Zandrea Thomas' aunt, read this statement during a press briefing following the execution, according to the Department of Corrections:On behalf of the Thomas family, we would like to thank the state of Missouri for finally providing our family with closure of the horrific death of my niece and her mom. For 14 years, we have impatiently waited for this day to come. It has been said that time heals all wounds. I do not agree; the wounds remain. In time, the mind, protecting its sanity, covers them with scar tissue and the pain lessens, but it is never gone. The reality is we will grieve forever. We will not get over the loss of our loved ones, and we will learn to live with it. We will heal, and we will rebuild around the loss that we have suffered. We will never be the same again. He had a chance to watch his daughter grow up and laugh and smile with her. We never got a chance to see her first day of school, graduations, or watch her go on prom. My brother will never get a chance to walk his daughter down the aisle for her wedding day. Human life has dignity at any age. Nothing can justify the shedding of innocent blood or the taking of lives. You must take 100 percent responsibility for your choices and your actions, and pay with your own life. Revelation 21:4 reads: “He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.” "

It's an important and exciting program for organizations that are part of the AmeriCorps national service network, including City Year, because it addresses a common misperception about young people who give a year of service: that they are somehow taking a year off, instead of using the year to build valuable, marketable skills.Since City Year's founding 26 years ago, 20,000 young people have given a year of their lives to serve with us. Just this year, almost 3,000 City Year AmeriCorps members served full-time in 262 high-need schools in communities across the country.

During her year of service she gained experience speaking in public, picked up project management skills, mastered the art of building a spreadsheet and even learned how to file her taxes. She explains that in her career, she's often found herself in a situation where she is asked to work with people who have different backgrounds, experiences and opinions from her own. ""Thanks to City Year, I learned how to work with those different personalities,"" she says. ""I learned different ways to work with people and to focus on getting our common goals accomplished.""Chelsea isn't doing this on her own. Her employer, Comcast NBCUniversal, also sees value in her service, which underscores the important connection between nonprofit, employee and employer. This year - and every year for the past eleven years - Comcast has organized Career Days for the teams of City Year AmeriCorps members it sponsors. During these events, Comcast NBCUniversal employees share concrete advice with our corps members to help them grow as professionals. Workshops in ten cities this year included ""building your personal brand, ""resume revamp,"" ""interview techniques"" and ""18-minute networking"" (a sort of professional speed-dating). So far, 10,000 City Year AmeriCorps members have attended a Comcast NBCUniversal Career Day.City Year alumni can be found in almost every industry: they are doctors, lawyers, teachers, engineers, nonprofit executives and elected officials. ""Service cultivates the critical skills that will ensure young people have the expertise they need to succeed in 21st century jobs and to develop effective leaders for the future,"" says David L. Cohen, Vice Chair of City Year's Board of Trustees and Senior Executive Vice President of Comcast Corporation.Chelsea participated in the local Philadelphia Career Day, and she also leads employee service projects, serves as a board member for her local Boys & Girls Club, and is very active in a community gardening project. City Year alumni, like Chelsea, are a big part of City Year's legacy. We're proud that she got her start with us and has found a way to keep giving back through an employer that sees great value in her experience as an alumna of an AmeriCorps program.Companies that are members of Employers of National Service, including City Year partners Comcast NBCUniversal and CSX, are making the case that a year of service isn't a year off - it's a leap year, for skills, experience and professional development. As President Obama said, ""Citizens who perform national service are special. You want them on your team."" We couldn't agree more. Let's hope more companies join this important initiative."

City Year alumni, like Chelsea, are a big part of City Year's legacy. We're proud that she got her start with us and has found a way to keep giving back through an employer that sees great value in her experience as an alumna of an AmeriCorps program.Companies that are members of Employers of National Service, including City Year partners Comcast NBCUniversal and CSX, are making the case that a year of service isn't a year off - it's a leap year, for skills, experience and professional development. As President Obama said, ""Citizens who perform national service are special. You want them on your team."" We couldn't agree more. Let's hope more companies join this important initiative."

In fact, most of us came across it in high school and probably forgot about it until now. But is a powerful analytical tool for understanding how an individual must fulfill his or her basic needs before developing and fulfilling more advanced ones.A Humanist thinker, Maslow set out to understand what makes us prioritize certain needs over others and then behave accordingly. The chart goes from the most basic needs, to more advanced ones, until it finally reaches its pinnacle: self actualization, when humans reach their full potential (see video: here). When you consider, for instance, how your needs might change over time, you can begin to see exactly what Maslow was getting at with his hierarchy. As a baby, your first needs are very basic and you use your only communication tools to persuade your parents to feed you, change your diaper, etc. As a small child, you might be more concerned that your parents or other adults stay near you to keep you safe, and if those needs are met, you will become more concerned with social needs for love and friendship within your community.Maslow theorized his chart over 50 years ago, but it remains widely used (source).Maslow's ultimate level--the need for self-actualization or for reaching one's potential, may or may not develop as part of an individual's life. To take another example, let's say a woman has basic, safety, love, respect needs fulfilled and is working to understand her own full potential and improve and refine her life in order to reach it. However, she learns that her company is going bankrupt and she will soon lose her job--and with it, all of her investments. What happens? Does she continue to explore and develop herself towards actualization? Of course not. She must move back down the chart in order to fulfill some of her more fundamental needs.Maslow during an interview where he discusses Self Actualization (see more here)But what really interests me is how--by understanding individual development and motivation through this chart--we can see and help individuals develop towards self actualization. Working with dispossessed youth in the agonies of poverty, I have seen so many young people with huge potential that cannot get past the circumstances which prevent them from fulfilling their most basic needs. Young people are fighting to fulfill their economic needs--sometimes basic needs like food and shelter, and other times need for security and economic stability.Maslow's Humanistic work was in retaliation to the limitations of the theories of Freud and Skinner (source).​ When kids are working within that paradigm, they are very unlikely to develop goals for self-actualization, etc. And this firsthand knowledge has led me to see his hierarchy as one of our most important analytical tools.Why is it so important? Simply put: understanding someone's behavior and development is all it takes to tailor support to them. Abraham's chart helps us determine the origin of antisocial behavior and target support towards fulfilling that need. Even more importantly, underscoring the significance of education (and I would argue: entrepreneurship education), the view is enhanced to see how people can go from the bottom of the chart to the top in self actualization. By adding an additional point to the chart, we see how education is an important check-point or benchmark in an individual's quest to lead a better life.In Part Two of this article, which will be published Friday, I will discuss another famous chart and how it can help an individual not only reach Maslow's self actualization, but do so through entrepreneurial success.Read Part Two of this piece here."

With less than a week before the Wisconsin primary, Mitt Romney continues to campaign through the state. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8feff2200005700dd86fc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Central to the latest wrangling over a federal appeals court vacancy is one crucial fact: Wisconsin's vacancy on the Seventh Circuit is the oldest circuit court vacancy in the entire country. It's been empty since Judge Terence Evans stepped down in January 2010. That was 2,000 days ago. In that time, President Obama has successfully filled about 300 other judicial vacancies around the country, and the Seventh Circuit, working shorthanded and grappling with profoundly important issues like voting rights, the death penalty, marriage equality, and the Second Amendment, has had to decide more than 7,000 cases.   With such vital issues at stake, a new judge is needed now more than ever. The people of Wisconsin--and of Illinois and Indiana, which also fall within the Seventh Circuit--deserve a court that's working at full capacity. That's why Senator Tammy Baldwin should be commended for taking action and clearing a path forward for the president to name a qualified nominee. She recently sent a list of eight qualified candidates to the White House for the president to choose from. With a list of names in hand, the president can--and should--act swiftly on his constitutional authority to name a new Seventh Circuit judge.  Indeed, one might wonder why Baldwin didn't green light a nomination before now. The reason lies with Wisconsin's Republican Senator Ron Johnson. While Baldwin has bent over backwards to select judicial candidates in a bipartisan manner, Johnson has obstructed at every turn, and recently told the White House to keep waiting, indefinitely.  There's some important history to how we got here:  Back in 2010, President Obama nominated a law professor from the University of Wisconsin named Victoria Nourse to replace Judge Evans. Nourse had been recommended by Wisconsin's then-Senators Herb Kohl and Russ Feingold. But just days after taking office, Johnson announced his intention to block both Nourse and Western District of Wisconsin nominee Louis Butler, because Johnson had not been consulted on their nominations (he was not consulted, of course, because he had not yet been elected).  The president eventually withdrew Nourse, but Johnson wasn't satisfied. He wanted equal say in selecting judicial nominees, so he dismantled Wisconsin's decades-old commission process that gave greater influence to the senator of the president's party. (That earlier process was also in accord with common practice nationwide.) For the sake of collegiality, Baldwin agreed to go along. They established a new six-member commission and each appointed three members.   But with a new process came a new excuse for delay. The commission couldn't work on the Seventh Circuit vacancy, Johnson said, until the president made nominations to two other Wisconsin vacancies. That maneuver led to another year of waiting, and the commission did not solicit Seventh Circuit applications until July 2014--more than four years after the vacancy arose.   The commission finally interviewed eight finalists for the Seventh Circuit last November, but that's all it could accomplish. Charged with recommending at least four candidates, the commission deadlocked. Baldwin wrote to all members of the commission, encouraging them to find consensus. She asked Johnson to co-sign the letter, but he refused. In January, the commission notified both senators that it could not fulfill its charge, and by May--a full eight months after the process began and nearly six months after commission interviews--the process had stalled out entirely. So, after consulting with each of the candidates, Sen. Baldwin sent all eight names to the White House, at once preserving the commission's successfully completed work and ensuring that the president had a sufficient number of qualified Wisconsinites to choose from.  Yet again, Johnson refused to join Baldwin, and attacked her efforts to finally fill this vacancy as ""partisan."" That is not to say, though, that his position has been consistent. At one point he said that all eight candidates were now ""tainted"" and that the process must start over. More recently, he said that he is ""willing to consider and continue to fully vet . . . two applicants who"" the commission agreed on, but not anyone else.   It's not hard to see through Johnson's latest offer. It will only put the process back into an indefinite holding pattern while the White House waits for Johnson to ""continue vetting"" two candidates that he may but is not guaranteed to eventually endorse. It is one thing to bypass a broken commission process so that the vacancy can be filled; it is quite another to change the rules on the fly to ensure it remains empty.  After five years of stall tactics and changing the rules to whatever suits him, Johnson long ago forfeited whatever deference he feels he is owed. The president has a list of names and he should act, selecting the nominee who will best protect the rights of everyday people in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin. After waiting 2,000 days, they deserve nothing less."

But prison and sentencing reform will require more than talk. Meaningful prison reform requires leadership and action. We can find that leadership in every sector, and every American can contribute. I recognized such leadership when I received an unsolicited email from Michael Tausek, the Deputy Warden at Maine's State Prison. Deputy Warden Tausek reached out because he wanted to do more than talk about the need to improve outcomes of our nation's prison system. He took action. By reaching out to me -- a man who served longer than 26 years as a federal prisoner -- Mr. Tausek acted courageously. Many corrections professionals would frown upon working with a formerly incarcerated individual.Mr. Tausek made his views clear. ""To improve the outcomes of our nation's prison system, we need innovative change.""Besides serving as a senior prison administrator, Deputy Warden Tausek also led programs inside the prison. Interactions he had with men serving time gave him a unique perspective. He understood that many of those men grew up in environments that didn't offer much in the way of hope. He wanted them to use their time inside in ways that would help them prepare for a better outcome, as law-abiding citizens. Although the men were living in challenging conditions today, they could begin taking action steps that would lead to more fulfillment tomorrow.Deputy Warden Tausek reached out through my website to inquire about programs that I developed to inspire prisoners. Based on our initial conversation, I told Mr. Tausek that I would develop a program he could use to inspire the men inside. I promised to create the Earning Freedom podcast and MasterMind course.Through a series of lesson plans, participants in the Earning Freedom course would learn from the inspiring figures that guided my adjustment through a 45-year prison term. Leaders like Socrates, Mandela, Gandhi, and Frankl could teach a great deal about empowering oneself through struggle. Those masterminds inspired me. I felt confident their message would lead to more intrinsic motivation for all participants, especially since a man who served decades in prison shared how it led to success for his life. The Earning Freedom podcasts supplement this mastermind course with 30-minute episodes that follow one of three formats: 1) they describe the actionable strategies that empowered me through the decades I served in prison, 2) they feature interviews with formerly incarcerated individuals who emerged successfully, or 3) they offer interviews with CEOs, employers, and community leaders. They suggest steps people with criminal backgrounds can take to prepare for successful returns to society.The Maine State Prison is setting an example of leadership. By introducing programs to motivate people in prison to prepare for success, the institution takes a meaningful step toward improving the outcomes of the criminal justice"

The most outspoken foes of the agreement are the usual suspects, namely, Israel, Saudi Arabia and the Arab nations of the Persian Gulf area. They all claim that the agreement with Iran threatens their national security, but offer no viable alternative to the negotiations and a comprehensive agreement. What they really want is a new war in the Middle East, this time against Iran. As the President rightly stated on April 2 when the Lausanne Accord was announced, insisting that Iran dismantle its nuclear infrastructure and continuing the sanction regime and even tightening it up further will eventually lead to war with Iran.And how has the Obama administration has been trying to mollify Israel, Saudi Arabia and their allies? By threatening Iran and selling more advanced weapons to them. Last October, the U.S. announced sale of new missiles to Saudi Arabia worth $1.75 billion. This is on top of $60 billion worth of weapons that the U.S. has sold to that nation since 2010. U.S. allies in the P5+1 have also been busy selling arms to Saudi Arabia. Over roughly the same period, Saudi Arabia has spent $6 billion buying weapons from Britain and paid France another $3 billion to deliver arms to the Lebanese army, which will only worsen the sectarian strife in that nation. The U.S. has also been replenishing Saudi Arabia's arsenal since it began its aggression against Yemen, which only exacerbates tensions between that country and Iran.In May, the Pentagon announced sale of $1.9 billion in new weapons to Israel to replenish its arsenal after the Gaza war of last summer in which U.S.-made weapons were used to attack and kill Palestinians. Earlier, in February, U.S. agreed to sell 14 additional F-35 stealth fighters to Israel, on top of 19 fighters agreed in 2010. In April, Germany delivered Israel its 5th Dolphin-class submarine. Germany paid two-thirds of the cost. Germany has already agreed to sell a 6th submarine to Israel. Why does Israel need submarines, when it faces no challenge in the Mediterranean Sea? These submarines are also armed with nuclear warheads and can stay in international waters for extended periods of time. Thus, they can only be intended for Iran. The German hands that arm Israel with such deadly weapons also sabotage the efforts to reach a nuclear deal with Iran. And this is while Israel's own military believes that Iran is not the most dangerous threat to that nation, that Israel will benefit from a comprehensive nuclear agreement with Iran and that any threat will wane with the agreement.Other Arab nations of the Persian Gulf are not far behind. In his recent Camp David summit with the Arab leaders, President Obama proposed a common U.S.-built and supported air defense system, similar to Israel's Iron Dome, for the Arab nations of the Persian Gulf. In May 2014, Qatar signed agreements with the U.S. and France to purchase modern weapons worth $23 billion. Between 2009 and 2013, the tiny United Arab Emirates imported four percent of all the arms sold internationally, spending $35-40 billion. Over the past few years, Kuwait has spent $7 billion to buy new weapons.Why do these nations need so many weapons? They supposedly want to defend themselves against Iran. But Iran will never attack them. In fact, Iran has attacked no nation for at least 300 years -- unless of course they attack Iran first. The reason is simple: any war in the Persian Gulf area will not only involve the U.S. 5th fleet there, but will also close the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, hence choking off Iran's own route for exporting its oil. So Iran would be committing suicide if it attacked these nations unprovoked. In addition, the Pentagon has repeatedly stated, most recently on June 3, that Iran's military doctrine is a defensive one, ""designed to deter an attack, survive an initial strike and retaliate against an aggressor to force a diplomatic solution to hostilities."" Such weapon sales only exacerbate the already unstable and bloody Middle East. Saudi Arabia and its allies have been supporting the terrorist groups in Syria by transforming a struggle there for democratic rule into a sectarian war, have been attacking an essentially defenseless Yemen, intervened in Bahrain militarily to suppress the democratic movement there, supported the coup in Egypt that toppled the democratically-elected government of Mohamed Morsi and backed and participated in the bombing of Libya, which turned that economically-developed nation into a hub for radical Sunni terrorist groups that dispatch terrorists to a vast region, from Syria and Iraq to Mali and West Africa. Why should such despicable regimes be rewarded by selling them even more modern weapons, particularly now that the Saudi Arabia emissaries have declared that they want a regime change in Iran, the very same regime with which the United States is negotiating a nuclear agreement? There is no logic in seeking a nuclear agreement with Iran while at the same time arming the very nations in the region that oppose the agreement.But the provocations do not end with selling weapons to the foes of the nuclear agreement. The Obama administration has also been threatening Iran over the past two months. President Obama, Vice President Biden, Secretary of State Kerry, Defense Secretary Carter and Deputy National Security Advisor Rhodes have been saying that the military option for dealing with Iran is still on the table. This is not only not what is expected of a side that is interested in the diplomatic resolution of the nuclear dispute but is also contrary to the President's belief that Iran's nuclear program has no military solution.The net effect of this is not only clouding the prospects for a comprehensive nuclear agreement with Iran but also poisoning the political atmosphere in Tehran. Just like their American, Israeli and Saudi counterparts, Tehran's hardliners too oppose the nuclear agreement (as I've explained here, here and here). Hardliners in the Majles [parliament] and in the IRGC have been loudly protesting nuclear negotiations with P5+1. Both President Rouhani and Iran's chief diplomat, Foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, have been threatened with impeachment, and Zarif has even been threatened with death.Provocations by U.S. allies in the region, particularly Saudi Arabia, which has attacked Yemen and supported terrorist groups in Syria only to prevent thaw between Iran and the U.S., will only make Iran's hardliners more determined in their efforts to scuttle the final agreement. Selling arms to such ""allies,"" which are acting against the true national interests of this country, will only worsen an already terrible situation in the Middle East. Threatening Iran with military attacks while also negotiating with it only casts doubts on the sincerity of the Obama administration to reach a comprehensive nuclear agreement and to seek out Iran's help to thwart the advances made by the Islamic State."
