5,TRAVEL,What Travelers Need To Know About Visiting Greece,Suzy Strutner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/greece-travel_us_559a8873e4b0a0dabdcf9952,"Greece's debt crisis is making headlines around the world, but that doesn't mean the country's tourism industry is crumbling",2015-07-06,"Blue and white churches of Oia village, Santorini, Greece",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/559a93a313000028ef8da64b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Greece's debt crisis is making headlines around the world, but that doesn't mean the country's tourism industry is crumbling, experts say.Major banks in Greece are closed, and citizens face restrictions on ATM withdrawals in light of the country's economic crises, the latest of which involved a rejection of a bailout deal on Sunday. ATM withdrawals are limited to 60 euros per Greek citizen per day, though that amount may decrease in coming days. But travelers should be able to enjoy their vacations in Greece without major problems.First, foreigners are not subject to the same ATM restrictions. ""So far, tourists in Greece have been unaffected by recent economic developments,"" Christos Stergiou, founder of Greek luxury travel company TrueGreece, told The Huffington Post. ""Foreign credit cards continue to be functional, even with the banks closed.""As a precaution, Stergiou says visitors to Greece should arrive with the full amount of Euros they'll need in cash, as ATMs may be out of money or have long lines. He also suggests that visitors use credit cards whenever possible during their stay.Tourist operations -- like ferries, resorts and restaurants -- are expected to operate as normal on Greece's islands and mainland, Greece's Ministry for Economy, Infrastructure, Shipping and Tourism assured visitors last week. There's a small chance that fuel shortages will cause travel delays, but members of the tourism industry do not expect the crisis to seriously impact travel this season, CNN reports. Summer is typically Greece's busiest travel season, and most experts agree that travelers should continue to take advantage of all Greece has to offer, while taking extra precautions. With the debt crisis, Greece needs tourism money now more than ever. Plus, the euro has declined in value, making it one of the cheapest times ever to visit the country.We're totally on board. "

In reality, all cause mortality and per patient per year health care costs are tripled for patients with hepatitis C, whether they have cirrhosis or not."" -- Dr. Douglas Dieterich, leading hepatitis C and liver diseases researcher and specialist at the Mount Sinai Hospital, New York CityMy friend John is a retired college professor who lives on a budget. He has hepatitis C, which he acquired from a blood transfusion before the development of blood testing and screening for hep C. He does have health insurance, but like most of those seeking treatment for this condition, he has been told that he must become demonstrably sicker to qualify for treatment coverage. Meanwhile, he must not drink any alcohol and remain vigilant for symptoms, especially fatigue. Since the progression of hepatitis C to cirrhosis of the liver and cancer of the liver can take decades, and John has already had this disease for decades, he is understandably concerned. In fact, he may die sooner from other causes, his untreated hepatitis C playing an indeterminate role. There is, however, an alternative for John. If he had the $100,000+ in cash to pay for the treatment now, he could be fully and safely cured in 8-12 weeks. John does not identify himself as a socialist, and he is willing to pay what he can for treatment, but the cost in this case is overwhelming. Another friend, Alex, is a health care worker who contracted hep C sexually. He has had the identical experience as John in facing $100,000 pricing for insurance noncoverage in the absence of being demonstrably sicker. Recently, however, he had a stroke of luck. Through connections, persistence and good fortune, he managed to obtain one of a limited number of assistance vouchers from one of the drug companies that essentially entitles him to full coverage. Needless to say, he's elated. Otherwise an articulate critic of corporate for-profit medicine, he can't help but feel as if he just won the lottery.Hepatitis C is a disease that leads to cirrhosis and cancer of the liver and death in large numbers of people. The World Health Organization (WHO) suggests that 350,000 to 500,000 people die each year of liver-related diseases from hepatitis C. In 1999, I wrote a feature on hep C for New York magazine called ""C Sick"" on what was then being called ""the stealth epidemic,"" for which I interviewed Dr. Dieterich at length. Because the vast majority of those with the disease in this country had acquired this viral scourge via injection drug use, it was very difficult to arouse the greater public to any kind of action or even concern. And there seemed little hope for developing more successful treatment because profits seemed more questionable for a disease, at least in this country, that is mostly limited to people with histories of drug use. Like the gay men with AIDS who were treated so abominably by Reagan era health care policies and systems, those with histories of injection drug use not only had the same experience with AIDS, they, and a growing number of gay men along with them, are experiencing comparable medical neglect and abuse around hep C. So beneath the public radar was hep C, and for so long, that most of those who had it didn't know it. They were never tested and didn't know they should be. One of the biggest concerns motivating my investigation had to do with identifying hep C as an STD in gay men, who weren't even being encouraged to be tested. Fifteen years later, it is now finally acknowledged that hep C is seen as an STD in gay men, but sexually-active gay men still need to be informed and proactive enough to demand to be tested by their doctors, whose knowledge of hep C can still be surprisingly rudimentary. Although it has taken many years longer than it should have to get there, testing for hep C is now more routine and there is more public discussion. Almost everybody has now seen advertisements for hepatitis C treatment on television. They're strange. They show well-groomed, middle class, middle-aged people who look hopeful and trusting, but the information accompanying these images is opaque. They say things like ""there is treatment now,"" and they encourage those with the disease to ""make further inquiries."" As with virtually all other pharmaceutical advertisements, nothing is said about cost.The latest of these advertisements makes it a lot more clear that, in one of the biggest and most important developments in the history of medicine, hepatitis C is now fully curable in the great majority of cases with only 8-12 weeks of treatment with medications that have few side effects. Not one of these advertisements, however, hints at the staggering price tag of $1,000 a pill.Who can afford this? For pharma (the pharmaceutical industry) that's not the main question. The main question is how much will Medicare, Medicaid or other insurance pay for these drugs? In far too many cases, such as those in V.A. (Veterans Administration) systems, the answer is none. The overview is this. Many people who can't afford these medications, which in this country means the majority of cases, are not out of the running to receive them, and some insurance will pay for them, but in most of those cases, treatment is being delayed until there is serious disease progression -- to fibrosis and early stages of cirrhosis, even though such delays place these patients at greater risk for cancer of the liver and other conditions. Once progression is demonstrated to be well underway, some insurance companies will then pay the costs for the new hep C treatments. While those costs are high, they are a lot less than what a liver transplant would cost them, which is the only other treatment option for end-stage cirrhosis and liver failure. In other words, the insurance companies are not paying for these treatments out of the generosity of their hearts so much as because they will likely have to pay a lot more if the disease progresses to liver failure and cirrhosis.In my field of addiction medicine, and as anticipated, hepatitis C has eclipsed AIDS as the leading cause of treatable illness and preventable death. More than 90 percent of the nation's 300,000+ patients on Methadone Maintenance treatment for opioid dependence are hep C positive. Many of them have Medicaid. While some of those with advanced disease are now being treated, the majority have lesser disease and, like my friends John and Alex, are not yet considered eligible for treatment, though they do have the option of initiating lengthy appeals of insurance coverage denials and may hold out some hope for obtaining assistance vouchers from the drug companies. Meanwhile, as Dieterich put it, telling patients they must put off treatment for hep C is like telling diabetes or cancer patients to hold off on treatment until the diabetes or cancer is more advanced. And there is another consideration regarding the treatment of hep C patients with histories of injection drug use. The earlier they are treated, the less likely they are to spread hep C to others via relapse.If not for insurance and cost issues, those who, like John, Alex and those in treatment for opioid dependence, have the most to benefit from it now can't get it unless they are willing to pay for it. Most people have no way to pay such fees, but some do and others can go into debt. Cumulatively, the numbers of those who can get the money however they can are apparently enough to have swayed pharma to further leverage its collective soul by engaging in such devious financial schemes.Remember Nixon's ""war on cancer""? Well, some of the life-saving cancer-treatments that were then just pipe dreams are now reality. The problem is that most of those who need these newest and most effective drugs to save their lives are having to give up all their assets in order to afford them, to the extent of declaring bankruptcy. As spelled out by leading cancer specialists in an expose on 60 Minutes (originally broadcast 10/5/14 and updated 6/21/15), cancer costs are now among the biggest causes of personal bankruptcy. The general price for treatment is $100,000 a year. So out of control and damaging is this issue that financial toxicity and bankruptcy must now be regarded as major and probable side effects of cancer treatment. People's fears and anxieties are being exploited. Middle class patients aren't eligible for financial assistance. Pathetically, people are taking half the recommended doses of the newest and most effective treatments as a way of getting, at least hopefully, some treatment benefit. How many have died because they couldn't afford treatment?In 2013, the New York Times published an article, ""Doctors Denounce Cancer Drug Prices of $100,000 a Year."" The cancer specialists interviewed here and on 60 Minutes were unanimous in their denunciation of capricious drug pricing, which one of those on the 60 Minutes feature described as dictated by ""corporate chutzpah."" In response to such criticism, pharma gives a standard defense: The high fees are necessary to cover the costs of research. In this case, because of the widely-seen NYT criticism, pharma agreed to reduce by 50 percent the prices of the drugs specifically under indictment by the cancer docs. While it's true that we mustn't lose sight of the fact that the pharmaceutical companies are producing new miracle cures and treatments that otherwise might not have come about, and that the costs of research are considerable, in the bigger picture, pharma is nonetheless and indeed making a killing (pun intended) on these medications. As reported in the New York Times , as a result of its sales of Sovaldi, the new miracle cure for hep C, Gilead took in record profits of $10.3 billion in 2014, making it a close runner up to the world's best-selling pharmaceutical, Humira, the wonder-drug for rheumatoid arthritis, the costs of which can run more than $20,000 a year. Ever wonder why we're seeing so many advertisements for medications on television? As with any other products, getting the information out there to target populations is unquestionably the best way to boost sales. In other words, the plethora of advertisements for medications is a lot less about improving public health than it is about making bucks.As criticism mounts, and not so coincidentally as windfall profits already have been made, the prices of the hepatitis C medications are beginning to come down. Alas, any optimism that might be attached to such limited and tentative success is like making incursions on one or two villages overtaken by ISIS and hoping democracy will replace Islamic extremism throughout the land. As characterized by one leading specialist interviewed in the 60 Minutes episode, pharma has rendered drug-pricing ""unreasonable, unsustainable and immoral."" The same drugs in Canada and Europe cost 50 to 80 percent less. Meanwhile, our Republican Congress will almost certainly veto any efforts by Obama to regulate the price of drugs. Is pharma complicit in extortion and murder when unreasonable pricing and policies lead to casualties? Leading AIDS activist Larry Kramer certainly thought so, and he is legendary for denouncing as ""murderers"" and ""Nazis"" everybody who was not on the front lines of testing new drugs and getting them into patients with HIV/AIDS. Kramer was additionally clear about a subject he returned to again and again: ""evil,"" which he defined as including sins of omission and silence as well as those more overtly deliberate.As a result of the war on AIDS led by Kramer, people with HIV and AIDS got treatment despite seemingly implacable early resistance from pharma and its collaborators. In the case of AIDS, pharma lost, at least initially. Clearly, however, questionable research priorities, price-gouging and insurance coverage denials continue to erupt for new treatments for many other illnesses and conditions.When the ultimate antiviral for HIV is finally developed, the one that can cure AIDS with the success that antivirals are currently able to cure hepatitis C, will there be more all-out battles over pricing and access? Alternatively, will pharma, as Larry Kramer currently believes, deprioritize developing that cure around issues of profit? Does NIAID (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease) Director Anthony Fauci really have the power to more decisively lead the final push for curative treatment, as Larry Kramer suggested when he received the first Larry Kramer AIDS Activism Award (4/23/15) of GMHC (Gay Men's Health Crisis)?Notwithstanding a second Supreme Court decision in support of Obamacare, it's clear that health care in the U.S. remains in a state of crisis. Millions of people still don't have health insurance, and pressures remain great to repeal reforms that have extended even bare-bones insurance benefits to the uninsured and underserved. ""Big Pharma,"" as it's evermore widely designated, remains unregulated. Notwithstanding the occasional gesture of assistance to the financially challenged with lottery-like vouchers and participating in some fair pricing coalition negotiations, pharma, insurance companies, lobbies and politicians, especially Republicans -- those who stand to gain financially -- have done everything in their power to prevent the implementation of anything remotely approximating equitable and humane health care for those who can't afford costs that have no controls and that have become so exorbitant that they can only be called extortion, comparable to loan-sharking and usury.It's no longer shocking to hear stories about people who die of treatable cancer and other conditions because they had no health insurance or, if they did, because they couldn't pay the uncovered costs. By 2009, it was estimated that 45,000 preventable health care deaths were occurring annually. The ACA has doubtless reduced that number, but by how much, and can ACA coverage continue to endure the relentless incursions of for-profit interests? At what point do the rest of us do what Kramer and the AIDS activist organization he founded and led, ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power) did and are still doing: point fingers, name names, carry placards, stage boycotts, encourage divestment, and alert the media to planned demonstrations?With ACT UP, demonstrations, protests, boycotts and civil disobedience established a track record of success for confronting unfairness and complacency in health care, especially with AIDS but beyond HIV/AIDS to hep C and other fronts. But ACT UP no longer has the resources, prime-time media attention and constituency support to have as much impact. To more effectively reign in pharma for access and costs of treatments such as those for HIV, hep C and cancer, representatives of the different affected constituencies -- from those with histories of drug addiction and those in drug addiction treatment, from the poor who have no health insurance to middle-class patients whose insurance coverages are limited -- would have to come together on a larger, broader and more determined scale than we have to date.Like the new curative treatments for hepatatits C, ACT UP was another of the most important developments in the history of medicine. For the level of its achievement in unprecedented grass-health care activism, and the saving of hundreds of thousands of lives by facilitating the rapid development and distribution of unprecedentedly successful antiviral therapies for HIV/AIDS, ACT UP deserves the Nobel Prize. But don't count on that to happen anytime soon.Sadly, such activism is still urgently needed, not only for AIDS, hepatitis C and cancer, but for the entire American health care system. For that to happen, the individuals and groups that would need to come together in much greater numbers and organize a lot more effectively turn out to be nothing less than the great aggregate of humanity, the history of which is the title subject of Larry Kramer's magnum opus: the American people.

7,HEALTHY LIVING,The 3 Rs of Eliminating the Self-Sabotaging Syndrome,"Joan Moran, ContributorCreative Thought Leader, author, blogger, creative thought lea...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-3-rs-of-eliminating-t_b_7663026.html,,2015-07-06,2015-06-25-1435244509-2439642-selfsabotagecuttingtree.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-25-1435244509-2439642-selfsabotagecuttingtree-thumb.jpg,"Getting in the way of ourselves -- or, as some call this state, being our own worst enemy -- has been around since the dawn of man. Modern psychology calls this condition the self-sabotaging syndrome. Sadly, self-sabotaging behavior seems to be ingrained in human nature. According toPsychology Today (http://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/self-sabotage), self-sabotaging behavior comes in many forms, from procrastinating, to self-medicating with one drug or another, to finding solace in comfort foods instead of exercise or to unconsciously inflicting self-injurious habits. Ongoing patterns of destructive behavior ""undermine us, especially when we engage in them repeatedly.""Yet, on a broader spectrum, what happens when you self-sabotage is a profound interference with your values and your long-standing goals. Even if you realize that you are interfering with the best of who you are, there is no guarantee that you will stop self-sabotaging behavior. It's a constant temptation. I spent the last week under a kind of self-sabotaging frustration, and it wasn't fun. I tried to reset the stove clock after a power outage, and for the life of me, I couldn't do it. But I stayed with it for days and finally figured it out. For some unknown reason, my odometer decided to re-calibrate itself and lose about 8,000 miles. I read the owner's manual a dozen times to no avail. I couldn't move the odometer to the mileage that previously flashed on my dash. Final solution after a week: I took the car into the dealership. Problem solved.In two instances above, I solved my problems despite directions not being clear or even correct. I refused to be the victim of circumstances and refused to give up solving my problem. I intentionally refused to be a victim of a self-sabotaging mindset.I don't work at an office either, but I can imagine that every day, several times a day the self-sabotaging syndrome rears its ugly head. After spending hours and hours following directions for a specific program, you never achieved results. It just didn't work. You simply cannot actualize a positive outcome. You complain and you insist the directions were wrong. Are you the victim?Wouldn't it be awesome if there were some sort of turn off valve, some barrier that would protect you from needless emotional struggles and set you on a path of actualizing your full human potential?According to the online magazine PsychAlive, Psychology for Everyday (http://www.psychalive.org/self-sabotaging), knowing where self-sabotaging thoughts come from can be the first step in controlling your self-defeating behaviors. Everyone hides a myriad of childhood influences and experiences that make you your own worst enemy. There are also behavioral therapies aimed at interrupting ingrained self-sabotaging patterns of stopping thought; that is, interrupting thought, letting thoughts go or redirecting thoughts into positive statements.No one can teach you to dance if you don't want to learn. And no one can teach you how to eliminate self-defeating mindsets if you insist on them. And no one can teach you not to give up but YOU. Since everyone is a talented individual with natural gifts given to you from birth, you can teach yourself to resist self-sabotaging behavior by channeling and strengthening your talents and abilities in the direction of solving problems with positive commitment. That's when happiness and personal satisfaction ring true. Focus on the following mutually supportive 3Rs to finally, once and for all, eliminate the self-sabotaging syndrome: 1.Resourcefulness Resourcefulness implies the ability to move through difficult situations. It does not imply that there will necessarily be a successful outcome or that you'll have the ability to solve a problem with ease. The skill of being resourceful encompasses the ability to access your imagination, your inventiveness, and the aptitude to think beyond the situation that involves the difficulty. 2. Resilience  Psychology Today defines resilience ""as that ineffable quality that allows some people to be knocked down by life and come back stronger than ever. Rather than letting failure overcome you and drain your resolve, you find a way to rise from the ashes."" Resilience implies adaptation to adversity. ""It also implies the ability to endure past the point of giving up"" in the face of difficulty. 3. Resoluteness There is an element of tenacity, steadfastness and competence in problem solving. Resoluteness implies a strong tolerance for finding solutions even in the face of adverse responses. For example, overcoming an upsetting situation is a dynamic response to what might seem to be an impossible situation. Yet, this is how all the signifiant contributions in math, science, medicine and technology have been created in the history of the world.Finding solutions to solving challenging problems or forging through life's adversities can be a rewarding and positive experience. Implementing the 3Rs -- resourcefulness, resilience and resoluteness -- can be an enormously helpful checkpoint in eliminating self-sabotaging behavior. The 3Rs will also provide increased focus on your most important goals and values.Joan Moran is a noted creative though leader.

But when this special man does show up, I won't be able to be sexually intimate without pain and days-after discomfort, unless my body is being helped along with the enhancing effects of this daily medication.",2015-07-06,2015-06-29-1435585580-6524957-Dollarphotoclub_59141343.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-29-1435585580-6524957-Dollarphotoclub_59141343-thumb.jpg," My cell phone makes a ""chirpy bird"" sound every morning at 6:10 a.m. This is a reminder for me to take my daily dose of a special estrogen that targets the tissues of my vagina. This jolt of hormones repairs what menopause has taken -- the elasticity, welcoming moistures, sexual readiness and accommodation that for so many years were an unquestioned part of my being a woman.I don't have a partner in my life right now. But when this special man does show up, I won't be able to be sexually intimate without pain and days-after discomfort, unless my body is being helped along with the enhancing effects of this daily medication. You see, this sex after 50 that everyone is yammering about, isn't only about blue pills and super lube. It's not that simple. At least for me -- and as many as 75 percent of all women over 50.My libido is still energetic and awake, and my interest in male companionship is still right here and very much alive. My hips can gyrate, my toes can curl, my arms wrap and my lips know what to do. So, you'd think I'd be ready to jump right into the freedom and experimentation of sex after 50 that is now being touted and spouted all over the place. This sounds wonderful and good, but it just isn't working for me. Why? Because I find that something very different is going on. I am an older version of myself. I've changed psychologically and my body's changed physically. And with these changes, my desires have changed as well.A greater attention and care is now required for me to have a healthy and enriching sex life. I can no longer simply let my body take over and worry about my heart later. There's also a whole new level of exposure to being intimate with someone now. Because in opening my body, I am also opening up a larger feel for who I am -- one that I wasn't even capable of in my 20s, 30s, and 40s. I've lived longer. My knowing is wider; as is my history of pain, loss, understanding, purpose and love. My heart and mind have too many facets and avenues for me to play the ""we've had a few dates, so it's time for sex"" game that is so often implied or expected in the land of after-50 dating.Sure, I've had lovers over these last nine years since my marriage ended at age 51. We've had that spark. We liked one another, we laughed in eager passion and a jumping of bones. And we managed to make things work -- his part A and my part B. We both hit our stride and made it to the finish line, but there were the age-driven difficulties of Mother Nature demanding her due. My body no longer flows into instant action when my sex drive is titillated, so my sexuality isn't the easy ""bridge"" to intimacy that it once was. There is also a deeply personal and unspoken ""price"" for sex after 50.I can't pretend that things are always ready-set-go in the bedroom anymore. I can't pretend that going to bed is just a sassy wink and a happy bouncing of butts anymore. Without conscious consideration -- those pills every morning and some other inside-me preparation -- my older flesh can experience pain and sustain damage during sex.As a post-menopausal woman, my vagina simply doesn't work the way it used to. The welcoming walls that have pushed children into this world are now more like tissue paper than a cushiony and stretchy glove. So, no matter how much lubricant is applied, my womanly parts don't as readily accommodate sexual activity as they once did. The confusing part is that the damage that happens during the joy of sex may not be apparent, or even felt, for as much as 18 to 36 hours after I've been with my partner.There can be tearing and abrasion as I am panting in loving lust and accepting the beat of my partner's passion within me; and this hurt can have a two- to five-day price tag of burning, continuous need to urinate and terrible discomfort. More than a few times, I've slept on the toilet because I could not contain my urge to go and didn't want to wet the bed.Fearing this pain and possible hurt -- the price of sex after 50 -- can cause hesitation in bed; which then leads to less readiness, more dryness and tightening, and a mental mindset that is anything but relaxed and uninhibited. I've found that these difficulties are all surmountable, but it requires medication, brave communication and very specific self-care. Having ""female-friendly"" prescription coverage or a wallet that can take an added hit of $250 to $400 each month is also required.The changes in my body have slowed me down and caused me to be much more aware of what I am doing in the sex department. This isn't a bad thing at all. It's actually a powerful gift. Because my body is now asking that I consciously and self-lovingly consider what I really want and need within the physical part of my relationship with a man.What I want now is a potent intimacy of mind and heart long before we get to folding down the sheets. Without the freedom and trust that comes from truly knowing someone, I won't feel comfortable telling my partner things and showing him things -- about me and about my body -- that are now necessary for me to experience vibrant and satisfying sex.When I am able to reveal the intimate care and attention that my changing body demands and deserves, I invite my partner to do the same with me -- in courageous honesty, kindness, and generous love. And in doing this, a new vitality and understanding of loving and love-making is opening up for me in these surprisingly beautiful years of my life past 50.www.robininyourface.com/sex-after-50-the-price-and-the-gift/Robin Korth enjoys interactions with her readers.

So why not invest time into being happier?After all, doesn't happiness happen when you achieve your goals, make more money, and learn new stuff? It's not like you can just go out and create happiness, right?That's what I used to think. I used to think that if I worked hard and did my best, then happiness would just happen to me. All I needed to do was find a great job, get an amazing girlfriend, live in a super hip modern apartment with my perfect cuddly cat and then I'd be happy.And so, I got to work. I went out and looked for the right job, the right girl, the right everything. But on my quest to find happiness, I discovered three powerful truths.Truth #1: Getting what you want is hard. Every job I've ever had was cool for a while, but eventually I'd get bored with it. And while I dated some amazing women, each time they didn't really fit my picture of my perfect girlfriend. Even worse, all the cats I scratched things they shouldn't and pooped in places where poop doesn't belong.Over time I realized that getting what you want takes way more work and time than you might expect. But I didn't let that deter me. Instead, I vowed to work harder. Because of this and a little bit of luck, there were a few times when I managed to wrangle my perfect life. That's when I encountered the second powerful/painful truth.Truth #2: Nothing lasts. Things would be great for a week or a month, and then something would change. I would get a new boss at work that wasn't as cool; my girlfriend's ""cute"" little habits would start getting on my nerves; and my cat would start scratching my couch.Luckily I'm a really smart guy so it only took me about 28 years of doing this again and again before I realized that it wasn't working. I realized that despite all my hard work, I was failing to create the kind of happiness in my life that I longed for. It felt like I was in a hamster wheel with the happiness cheese dangling just out of reach.And that's when I started to think about the times in my life when I was really happy.• I remembered the times I'd spent hiking in the wilderness, the cool breeze rustling the branches, while the sun crept overhead. • I remembered going to concerts, where the music uplifted me and I danced so hard that I forgot who I was. • I remembered those moments with friends having quiet and wishful conversations inside foggy cars at 10 o'clock at night.And the more I remembered the more I realized that in these moments happiness seemed effortless.Moreover, they didn't seem like the outcome of hard work and achieving goals. Instead, they seemed to burst forth from each breath, because I was engaged, I was present, and I was alive.I started to wonder whether or not I'd been going about this whole happiness thing all wrong. I started to wonder ""what if"". Instead of waiting for happiness to happen, I created it.So I set out to discover how to create happiness, not just when I got to where I was going, but every step along the way.This journey led me to travel in India, to live in a Zen monastery, to study habits, to write about my challenges, and to work with amazing people to help them create happiness in their lives one day at a time. It's through this journey that I discovered the last and biggest truth about happiness.Truth #3: You Create Your Happiness. Along my journey, I found again and again that happiness doesn't have to be this illusive thing that you search for. In fact, happiness is something you can create in simple ways everyday.• Happiness isn't about being super positive (I'm not naturally) • It's not about having lots of stuff (often people with less have more) • And it's not about being perfect (the happiest you is the person you already are)I've done my best over the last few years to share these simple tools to create happiness and realized that's not enough. I've found that if you really want to be happy, then you have to commit. You have to decide to invest some real time into mastering the tools, the habits, and the practices that create lasting happiness.Toku is a mindfulness expert, speaker, and coach.

I am going to work against you in every way I humanly can. Here is why.,2015-07-06,Photo by: Dennis Van Tine/STAR MAX/IPx 6/16/15 Donald Trump announces his Candidacy for President of The United States of America at Trump Tower. (NYC),https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5baea5ee2200003401db02fe.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Mr. Trump,I am going to start with the most important and shortest statement first: I don't want you to become my president. I am going to work against you in every way I humanly can. Here is why:I am a Latina, born in the U.S. My parents are citizens of this beautiful country. My father, may he rest in peace, fought in Europe during World War Two. He was in England, France, Bastogne, Belgium and Germany. He landed on Omaha Beach on D-Day. He fought his way to Bastogne, and fought in the Battle of the Bulge, under George Patton. He suffered an injury during the war. Thankfully, it wasn't serious, so he was returned to the front.When he came back to the U.S. in 1946, he wore his Army uniforms because that is all he had. After getting off the ship in New York, he boarded a bus to come back to southern New Mexico.Let me tell you what my father, Enrique (Henry) Cedillo, experienced on his trip through this country: Discrimination and racism. Blatant racism. Remember that he wore his uniform on those buses? Good. As the bus stopped in different cities and towns, so passengers could take care of business and eat, daddy would sit in the dining areas of restaurants and order a meal. He had the money to pay for them. And he did.The only thing is, he wasn't allowed to eat in the dining areas of those ""fine establishments."" Because of his swarthy (that's dark to you) skin tone and black hair, he was feared by the owners and managers (many of them white) of those eateries. Where did he eat? Standing in the kitchen and swallowing his considerable pride, along with his meal. At stop after stop. Despite the fact that he had obviously fought for a country that didn't appreciate his sacrifices.If you don't remember your verbatim statement on Mexicans, rapists, drug runners and criminals, I'll paste it for you here:""The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems. ... When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.""Your words stand and speak for themselves.Let's go back to my father. I mentioned that he was born here in southern New Mexico. After New Mexico was admitted to the Union. His father and grandfather came to what is now the U.S. This was before New Mexico became a state. So, you see, our family has deep, deep roots here in New Mexico. Now, here you are, still trying to justify the ""rightness"" of your words and beliefs to everyone. NBC has fired you. Univision has severed its ties with you. The co-hosts of the Miss America pageant have done the same. Miss Mexico isn't going to compete in the Miss Universe pageant. The pageant is going to be live-streamed because it's not going to be shown on NBC, Univision or Televisa. This is probably the most hilarious fall out of your disastrous tendency to ""open mouth, insert foot.""While you go stomping and fuming about, loudly insisting that you are right, everyone you have defamed has gone about their lives and work with dignity. My own father bore the racism to which he was subjected with dignity as well. After all, if he wanted to eat, he knew he would have to move himself to those kitchens.Just in case you manage to make it all the way to the nominating convention as a candidate, I am going to make one strong suggestion to you: If you come to New Mexico, turn your plane, train, car or buggy around. If you do come into this beautiful state, do not hire any mariachi groups. After what you said about my people, it's not likely they would play at any of your campaign events. Oh. I have two grown sons. Neither one of them has gotten involved in crime. They are both productively employed. One is about to go into college and the other graduated with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering. I am deeply proud of both of them. Both of my sons are heavily involved in music after learning to play the trumpet, violin, guitar and piano. Hmm, where are their drug and rape charges? Those are nonexistent because they have not committed those crimes! In fact, their friends are just as productive, having gone to college. Friends working in engineering, the military, education, the music world, owning their own small businesses. . . shall I go on?Because, Mr. Trump, I can tell you just based on my own family's experience, your comments were made using an extremely broad brush. You have defamed millions of people, just here in the U.S. Is it any wonder that companies are backing away from you like they are?To recap:Father: U.S. citizen, fought in WWII. Worked for 40 years for the federal government. No criminal record. Mother: Worked and raised five girls. No criminal record. Sons: College graduate and soon-to-be college student. One works for the government and the second works for a large private company (not yours, thankfully). No criminal records. Sisters: All employed, no criminal records. Nieces and nephews: One college grad, working for a private company. Two college students, three high school students. No criminal records. Me: I am the owner of a small writing/editing consultancy business. No criminal record."

Most people probably don't associate entitlement with veterans. But I came home from Iraq with a healthy dose of it. Returning from the war, I was shocked at how little had changed at home. People still went shopping. They worked. They threw their kids birthday parties. They watched ""The Bachelor"" and ""The Bachelorette."" They seemed to be living their lives in blissful ignorance of the sacrifices being made daily by their countrymen a half a world away -- countrymen whose lives were on the line every single day. I could hardly believe how disconnected most people seemed from what I had just endured. My disbelief led to resentment. Resentment led to a sense of entitlement. I figured if my friends and I willingly marched into harm's way when no one else would, than they owed us.If not given the deference I believed due, I could become very angry, very quickly. Ironically, many well-intentioned people perpetuated this sense of entitlement through no fault of their own other than a genuine desire to express gratitude. They called me a ""hero,"" offered discounts on goods and services, free tickets to events, and lavished praise for my service. In my mind, these gestures reinforced the divide between us, emphasizing even more the fact that most of the country hasn't been required to sacrifice much since 9/11/01. What I couldn't see at the time was how deeply flawed this way of thinking is -- and how unhealthy it is for the veteran who sees things this way. I didn't understand how it further isolated me from friends and family. I didn't make the connection between the bitterness and the deep depression that gripped me. Were it not for the detrimental impact my behavior was having on my kids, I might never have reached out for help. But I eventually did -- and it changed everything.  Counseling taught me to examine the thoughts I had and make the connection between those thoughts and my feelings. The more closely I looked, the more dysfunctional my beliefs appeared. I started working to replace them with more rational thoughts. As I did, the depression lifted and I began to feel better. With my own house in order, I started looking for ways to serve again.Today I work as the Program Counselor at Equest in Wylie, Texas. There, we run an equine program for veterans and military families called ""Hooves for Heroes."" At the ranch, we leverage the incredible healing power of horses to help transitioning veterans identify distorted thoughts and replace them with healthier, more realistic ones. Something about working with the horses makes this process less threatening for a veteran, particularly one trapped by the bitterness that comes from a feeling of frustrated entitlement.  What is the new perspective these warriors develop? Quite often, it looks something like this: The divide between civilian and military cultures is ours to fix. We are not entitled to special treatment because we served -- we volunteered. Ours was an oath of acceptance that we are servants first and foremost. We didn't take it because we would be given a 10 percent discount at the hardware store if we returned.Does this mean that we must quietly bear the burden alone without advocating for change? Absolutely not.As warriors, we know, perhaps more acutely that anyone, how important it is to take responsibility for our country. We embody the ideal of shared sacrifice. It is up to us to model what engaged, responsible citizenship means -- not to see ourselves as a privileged class separate from civilians and entitled to special consideration. Our ranks are small. But it is up to us to swell these ranks with our countrymen, who are hungry for a sense of collective purpose -- not to further isolate from them, comforting ourselves with righteous indignation and a distorted sense of entitlement.No one owes us anything. We owe it to ourselves and our country."

And, as usual, the food was unique, delicious and served with great flair by a band of servers who also perform in the show.If you've never been to Teatro ZinZanni, The Return of Chaos is a classic getaway that should not be missed. Don't come looking to see a story, but, rather, to be surrounded by a crew of captivating, unusual characters, doing things you would not imagine possible while you're served a gourmet meal.It's an experience that allows the audience to forget their troubles and be engulfed in a fantasy world of heroes, villains, aerobatics, singing, dancing and much more. The plot centers around a band of Seattle superheroes that include Australian Joel Salom as MonoMan (he gets the prize for best costume), Frenchman Domitil Aillot as The Space Needler (took a while to figure out that he was gliding along on a Solowheel beneath his wide costume), Ukrainian Vita Radionova as Ula (who can do things with hula hoops that one can't believe to be possible) and Mickael Bajazet as the Tapman (catapulting and dancing in ways one can only imagine).  These superheroes work against (actually they tend to work with) a band of equally entertaining villains. Also mixed into the story are Mayor of Seattle Sterling Goodman and reporter Nellie Nance played by Ben Wendel and Rachel Nehmer (who perform as Duo Madrona). And when these two finally remove their character costumes and perform suspended on a trapeze, everyone is transfixed on the things they can do in mid-air. The other aerial performer that keeps people's attention is Domitil Aillot whose work on a pole seems to defy gravity, again and again.All in all, The Return of Chaos is a super hit that engulfs a tent full of diners in a world full of joy, laughter and wonder. It continues to play in the Seattle Spiegeltent through September 13."

But they are generally believed to be Bulgarians who converted to Islam from the early 15th century. Here in Greece they speak Greek, Bulgarian and Turkish, and their women generally wear head scarves and full length abayas.Be that as it may, they inhabit a somewhat remote area called Pomakohoria north of Xanthi in Thrace, a couple of dozen picturesque mountain villages of whitewashed red-roofed houses, all with characteristic Ottoman-style mosques with spindly minarets topped by dunce's caps, here in blue. Perhaps we should be more charitable and call them wizard's hats. Pomak hilltop villagesTo add to the allure the whole area is within the Rhodope Mountains and I've managed to get a taxi for only $53.83 for a 3 ½ hour trip in late April. Smynthi, the first Pomak village we come to, strides a river in a verdant ravine, two slender minarets topping its red roofs. Echinos, Pomakohoria's main village, clambers up a hillside, Thermes with its hot springs in a mountain bowl is split into three (upper, middle and lower), and Kidaris sleeps in a valley within a stone's throw of the Bulgarian border. Smynthi Echinos from cemetery Echinos close-upIt's all very bucolic, flocks of sheep, shepherds, tumbling streams, waterfalls. It's in Middle Thermes that things start going awry. A man's waving his arms like an unhinged windmill and bellowing bloody murder.  Upper and Middle Thermes from a distanceWell, it's Giorgios the driver's fault. He said I could take photos. I thought something was amiss when the scarved ladies started turning their backs and skittering away, abayas in full spate. After much screaming we escape with our lives up to the top of the peaks.  Middle Thermes shuffleNow it's the scenery that takes our breath away. Up here this is the land of the Karadere, Turkish for black forest. Wave after wave of forested ocean swell across ridge, fold, summit and valley, the green awakening of early spring glinting in the brilliant sunshine under a cloudless blue sky. Bucolic scene KidarisPure peace and paradise now. But during the cold war the whole area was closed. A tarred road to fellow European Union member Bulgaria and a border post was opened three years ago. My attempts at a Robert Capa moment at the frontier are met with a wagging finger and a very much verboten bark, but I'm allowed to snap away from the post towards the board saying welcome to Greece. Greek side of Bulgarian border Welcome to GreeceBack down on the Thracian plains it's the Via Egnatia that has been reborn. First built in the 2nd century B.C., all 696 miles of it, it stretched from Dyrachium, stop-off point for boats from Rome and now called Durrës, across what is now Albania, Greece and European Turkey to Istanbul, then called Byzantium.Along it marched the armies of Julius Caesar and Pompey in that nice little civil war they had, and a little later those of Mark Antony and Octavian (Augustus) as they hot-rodded after Cassius and Brutus for gutting Caesar and thereby giving Shakespeare an excuse to write 'O pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth.'

As a mom, I am always looking for great ways to save money at home, from ways to save on food, household supplies, clothing, and so much more, it only makes sense that I would apply the same strategies to my business. (Another great reason mom's make great business owners!)Saving a few dollars here and there, will help you to increase your net profits, without having to sacrifice the tools and services that help you to keep you business running efficiently.Replace Your Printers With CopiersWhen I first saw this tip, from Lou D'adamo, Business2Community, the first thing that came to mind, was, exchanging one expense for another, very similar one? That is actually not the case.In order to understand this strategy, you need to have a clear understanding of how much you may actually be spending on ink.Online price of $79.99 for a HP 12A Black Toner Cartridge (Q2612A). The specs state that this particular cartridge yields 2,000 copies. Doing the math I calculated that this cartridge will cost $0.0399 per page. That's almost a staggering 4 cents per page! A new Toshiba B/W copier will cost $0.007 per page, which is under a penny.For those who use multiple printers, the costs can add up, but replacing your other printers with one copy machine can save you money overtime.Outsource  There are great companies that offer business owners the support that they need with tasks that they may not have the time, or ability to take on. Something to consider when outsourcing, are the industry focused services, from Fempreneur Focused support, to Real Estate Virtual Assistants, etc.Discovering reliable, and affordable support for your business will allow you to focus on the tasks that will continue to grow your business and make you money.Buy second Hand SuppliesDo you have to have brand new office supplies?Although there are some items you will need for your business, that you should avoid pinching pennies for, there are some supplies that you can purchase second hand in order to save money. One benefit of buying second hand is the ability to pay cash, due to the reduced prices, which can be very beneficial over time.Power DownAs much as possible, that is.We tend to keep things on, that may not need on. At the end of the day, turn off computers, printers, copiers, fax machines, coffee machines, and any items that may be consuming energy. Be aware that even in sleep mode, they are consuming juice from your sockets, powering the off, can save you as much as a third on your electricity expenses.Proactively Seek Out BenefitsAll a part of being a resourceful business owner, being proactive in your research as it applies to benefits that you qualify for as a business owner, is the best way to save more money in business. There are a lot of business expenses that are deductible and knowing how this applies to you and your business will get you on track for more savings, for example, many business owners with home offices, are not aware that expenses related to their home office are deductible.Keeping more money in house, gives you a lot more breathing room in the areas that matter most to you, as a business owner. From equipment and services, flexibility in your marketing strategy, you will have the ability to spend in the areas that benefit you most.Nancy Laws, is the founder of Afro-Chic Mompreneur  and is passionate about launching Female Owned Brands.

Kennedy Memorial Stadium in Washington, D.C., celebrating two decades since their debut album. While the band had to cancel the remainder of their European tour last month following frontman Dave Grohl's stage jump that left him with a broken leg, they didn't let that get in the way of giving fans a great show.Since Grohl's leg was still in a cast on July 4, the singer came up with the idea to perform on a throne made of guitars, lights and amps while keeping his leg elevated. According to Radio.com, Grohl said he thought of the throne while on morphine in the hospital. The end result was pretty incredible:The band headlined the D.C. show that also featured performances by Buddy Guy, Gary Clark Jr., Heart, Joan Jett & the Blackhearts, LL Cool J featuring DJ Z-Trip, Trouble Funk and Trombone Shorty & Orleans Avenue. When the Foo Fighters took the stage, they played a handful of favorites including ""Everlong,"" ""Learn to Fly,"" ""Monkey Wrench,"" ""All My Life,"" ""Big Me,"" ""Breakout"" and ""Best of You,"" as well as a cover of Queen and David Bowie's ""Under Pressure."""

Sweat was released into the custody of the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision, the hospital said in a statement.Once he spends a 24-hour stint in the infirmary of the Five Points Correctional Facility in Romulus, Sweat will spend his days confined to a cell for 23 hours a day, according to NBC News. A string of Clinton Correctional's administrators -- including the prison's superintendent -- have been placed on leave as investigators probe how the convicted killers escaped from the maximum security facility on June 6. Two prison employees have also been charged in connection with the convicts' escape. Joyce Mitchell, a 51-year-old prison tailor shop employee, is accused of sneaking the inmates hacksaw blades, chisels and other tools to help them escape. Gene Palmer, a 57-year-old prison guard, is accused of smuggling the tools to the inmates in raw hamburger meat. Matt and Sweat remained on the lam for three weeks before the authorities caught up with them. Matt, 49, was shot and killed by U.S. Border Patrol Agents near the Canadian border. Sweat was captured soon after. During his recovery at Albany Medical Center, Sweat reportedly cooperated with investigators and shared details of the escape -- including that the convicts performed a ""dry run"" of their escape before breaking out.Sweat will be charged with escape in the first degree, though he was already serving a life sentence for murder. Legal analyst Lisa Bloom explained to NBC last week why Sweat is cooperating despite the fact that he'll never taste freedom again:""Gone are going to be the television, the hot plate, the working in the tailor shop,"" Bloom said. ""Those privileges, if he wants to get any of those back, if he wants to get out of administrative segregation -- solitary confinement -- he has a little bit to work with there in terms of bargaining."""

I recently sat down with Kevin O'Leary, the entrepreneur, investor, journalist, author, and financial commentator best known as Mr. Wonderful, the honest and sometimes insolent shark on ABC's Shark Tank. The advice and wisdom he shared in our time together has changed the trajectory of my businesses forever. He offered a glimpse at his personal blueprint to success and today I'm sharing it with you. Do you have massive dreams, unstoppable drive, and the determination of a bull going after a matador? Then buckle your seat belt because you are in for a ride. Here are 5 important empire building lessons to winning in business and life from inside the tank with Mr. Wonderful. If You Want Something Done - There's a saying which goes, ""If you want something done, give it to a busy mom."" O'Leary says that he couldn't agree more. At the start of 2015, O'Leary had 27 companies in his portfolio from Shark Tank. He says that roughly 1/3 of those companies were performing marginally or not at all and so he made a decision to write off those companies so that he could spend his time on the stronger performing ones. He then closely studied the chemistry of the companies he kept. He was looking to see if there was a common thread amongst all the businesses so that he could make better decisions moving forward as to the types of companies he would choose to work with from Shark Tank. The companies he was left with were in all different verticals and of all different sizes. There was one thing every company he kept had in common. Each business was lead by a woman. O'Leary says that he's come to learn that very busy women seem to have a knack for getting stuff done in business. He says that it is his experience that women have the intuition to know what will work in a business and the drive to make things happen. Two of his best performing Shark Tank businesses have been Wicked Good Cupcakes and Groove Book, both run by women with crazy busy lives. As a proponent of sound investments, O'Leary says, he's come to learn that there is little risk in investing in busy female entrepreneurs.Listen to your Mom - O'Leary notes that the best advice he has ever received about money came from his mom. She came from a modest background but was able to provide a great life for Kevin and his brother. How did she do it? Kevin's mom would invest regularly in the stock market, and she would only invest in dividend paying stocks and bonds. She would then only spend the interest, choosing to rarely dip into the original investment. O'Leary says that even today he runs his own O'Leary Funds investment firm in a very similar manner, studying and investing in dividend paying companies with strong performance histories, then reinvesting the interest and dividends earned.   Speak Your Truth - Mr. Wonderful is often criticized as being the meanest of the sharks on ABC's Shark Tank. As he sees it, most people don't want to hear the truth, and he cannot find it in him to lie to people just to make them feel good. Killing money is a crime, says Kevin. He says that he's seen more than his share of entrepreneurs who come onto Shark Tank with horrible ideas. The whole crew of sharks will realize that the idea is stupid and so nobody invests. The problem, says Kevin, is that the other sharks will sometimes coddle the guest and tell them it's a great idea and that they should pursue their dream off the show. Nothing irritates Kevin more than sharks endorsing a stupid idea because they are sending that entrepreneur back into the world with a semblance of hope and too many entrepreneurs have wasted their life savings and countless years pursuing a business idea that will absolutely never take off. Kevin says he feels an obligation and duty to tell it like he sees it, offering real, heartfelt, honest advice to entrepreneurs even when he knows it's going to hurt.Pursue Freedom - Mr. Wonderful has an interesting take on entrepreneurship. He says that when you ask someone why they want to run their own business, most say they are doing it for the money. However, he says that when you dig deeper, most entrepreneurs are really pursuing something much more important than money, they are pursuing freedom. What those entrepreneurs really want is the ability to control their days, their weekends, and their lives, which is something you have less ability to do when you are working for someone else. O'Leary says that he talks about this a lot when he's teaching classes to entrepreneurs. He says that when you drill down on the real motive for running the business, you make different decisions about your company. For example, O'Leary is not a huge fan of debt. He notes that there is a correlation between debt and freedom, or lack thereof. When a company or an entrepreneur takes on massive debt, they lose freedom, because now (like an employee) their time and their business is predicated on paying off that debt. Most entrepreneurs want freedom and debt is what often prevents that. If It's Got Rabies Kill It - O'Leary says that if an animal with rabies comes into your backyard, you wouldn't feed it and send it off into the woods in hopes that it will get better. Yet, in business, too often we hold on to things we shouldn't. There are many areas of business in which O'Leary applies this mantra. For example, he says if you have an employee who is just not cutting it, fire them. Don't spend time trying to fix them. Get rid of them, move on, and hire someone else. If you have an investment that is under-performing, kill it. If you meet an entrepreneur with a horrible business idea, kill the idea for them. As O'Leary sees it, the best business owners, entrepreneurs, and leaders are really good at killing the animal with rabies. He comes off as hardnosed and sometimes even belligerent on Shark Tank, but in my experience, he was anything but. In our time together, he offered honest advice from the heart on how to build an amazing business and life the Mr. Wonderful way."

A central theme in their worldview was that deepening the institutions of democracy, a paramount end in itself, is also the best means to a flourishing and vibrant economy.Time and again, government after government, we have been promised the freedoms of democracy and the flourishing economy that institutions of democracy brings. And each time we have not wavered from wanting these freedoms and ideals. Each time our governments have failed us. Each government has vigorously promised to fight corruption, clientelism and tax evasion. Each government has promised far-reaching reforms. Many of these reforms were those being proposed by the hated loan agreements. The same reforms that Varoufakis found mostly agreeable, at least 70 percent of these, against the strong anti-reform position of Syriza. We never hated the reforms though we knew many had reason to resist them. We hated the medicine that we mistakenly associated with the reforms: austerity. We know that our long-term prosperity lies in these reforms and other reforms that derive from being part of the EU. Most of these reforms are the nuts and bolts that at any given time uphold the ideals that we aim for. They may not all be right for us, or right at this time, and this is the debate we need to keep having with our fellow Europeans. This is one of the areas we need to apply our skills of negotiation and persuasion. This is the good fight, but it needs to be held within the moorings of the imperfect democracy that is Europe. The reason that we cling to Europe, the EU and the Euro despite all our suffering and however much we attribute to their poor handling of our present predicament, is that with all the disillusionment we have in the capacity of our own governments and our institutions, imperfect Europe remains our beacon of hope. Any party wanting a chance to govern our country knows this all too well. Syriza was not always in favor of the Euro and it has always been an ambivalent supporter of the European Union. Syriza in opposition belatedly recruited an eloquent and visionary outsider who strongly advocated the European ideals and for Greece's position in the Euro. This shift in Syriza's stance and Tsipras' promise not to risk Greece's place in the Euro was key to its electoral success. This is the contract he made with the people. It's about democracy. Once elected the entire country came to his support in the difficult task of negotiating with the EU. The costs of these negotiations have already been great. A stalled economy has meant that from a point of growth we are now back into a downward spiral. But here comes the irony and the insult. After five months of mostly grandstanding and shadow boxing. After signing a proposal that in terms of austerity was identical with that of the Troika, Tsipras realized that he could not get his own party to pass his proposal. He called for a referendum in the name of democracy. In so doing he broke the single most important promise he gave to the Greek people. The promise that he would not risk Greece's position in the Euro and the EU. He could have called a referendum at any earlier time. Instead he chose to break off negotiations and call a referendum after the expiry of the existing loan agreement. The only time that he knowingly put Greece's position in the Euro at risk. In so doing he also broke all rules of a democratic referendum. He set the time for discussion to one week with closed banks just before cash would run out and calamity would ensue. The very calling of the referendum dramatically weakened the country. He offered people to vote on a complex interim proposal that was no longer on offer. He asked the people to give him negotiating strength by voting ""NO"" to the proposal. But he always had the support of the people and the opposition parties to negotiate. He had national unity to attain a good deal, but with this referendum he is reviving old and nasty divisions. The Deputy Minister of Finance Tsakalotos said that Tsipras called the referendum because he could not get the proposal past his own party. But if that was the case he should have been seeking for a ""YES"" vote. A ""NO"" vote would only strengthen the hand of his anti-Euro internal opposition. A ""NO"" vote would make it much harder for him to achieve an agreement that could pass in parliament. So here's the the problem. Tsipras had nearly all Greeks united in his efforts to seal an agreement with the EU. You can't get much more negotiating power than that. What Tsipras always lacked was the presumed ace in the negotiating hand. A threat to leave the Euro and the EU. The nuclear option. This is the one thing Greeks have consistently denied everyone seeking to represent them. Throughout the negotiations this threat has been implicitly used to the consternation and fear of many, but most continued to believe that it was always a bluff. But there's the rub with threats. As any good game theorist knows, if a threat is not credible it wont fly. If Tsipras needed a referendum to force an agreement against the wishes of his anti-Euro internal opposition, shouldn't he have asked the people to vote ""YES""? Won't he strengthen his internal anti-European opposition by getting a ""NO"" vote? Won't he strengthen Golden Dawn and his extreme right-wing coalition partner Independent Greeks who are adding their votes to the ""NO"" option? Isn't he putting the country's position in the Euro at risk?Prominent and Nobel Laureate economists and thinkers have understood the ""NO"" vote as a vote to leave the Euro. Should I be mistaken in believing them? Should I not at least worry that the risks of leaving the Euro increase with a ""NO"" vote?Even though I strongly disagree with these economists about the merits of leaving the Euro, in large part because I have associated the imperfect Euro and EU with anchors to the ideals of democracy for my country, I respect their views and their convictions. I also respect their knowledge and honesty when they say that a ""NO"" vote means that we will most likely have to leave the Euro. I only wish that Tsipras had the same honesty and at least acknowledged that a ""NO"" vote substantially increases the risk of our leaving the Euro. This would give people a clear choice. He owes that to democracy. But Tsipras already knows what people will choose if given that choice. So instead he now promises that the ""NO"" vote is not a vote to leave the Euro. Indeed, he promises us that he will reach an agreement within 48 hours of a ""NO"" vote. Surely a promise to agree in 48 hours is a promise to capitulate to any agreement. That is the bizarre predicament that he has put us in. A true travesty of democracy. This piece has been updated to reflect the results of the referendum. "

Likewise, Iranian negotiators must realize that Iran's nuclear program is seen at a threat by major powers.",2015-07-05,Excellent vivid images of flags for you. With the texture of fabric at 100 percent view.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc152a0230000370093e8d3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As the P5+1 and Iran negotiate over the future of Iran's nuclear program, some have begun to argue that the Iranian people are so supportive of reaching a deal that the Iranian government would face severe public opposition if it does not come to an agreement with world powers. We also see commentaries inside Iran arguing that not only President Obama's legacy, but also the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election hinges on whether or not Obama succeeds in securing a deal with Iran. Neither of these positions are supported by existing opinion polls from Iran and the United States. While it is true that the Iranian people do support reaching a deal along the lines of the Lausanne framework, polls from Iran clearly suggest that much of the support rests on a perception, held by majorities of the Iranian people, that Iran will continue to develop its nuclear program -- albeit under a more intrusive international inspection regime -- and that Iran's conditions regarding the scope and pace of sanctions relief will be met. If these conditions are not met and the negotiations fail, the polling suggests that Iranians would more likely blame the P5+1 than Iran.In a recent poll of the Iranian people, conducted jointly by the University of Maryland, University of Tehran, and IranPoll.com in May 12-28, a clear majority (57 percent) express support for a deal under which Iran, for a number of years, would limit its centrifuges and nuclear stockpile to the level needed for nuclear energy and accept more extensive inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency in return for the P5+1 accepting Iran to enrich uranium, lifting economic sanctions, and expanding nuclear cooperation with Iran. However, the same poll also shows that 62 percent of Iranians believe that the deal will result in the termination of all U.S. sanctions on Iran, not just those related to Iran's nuclear program. Moreover, majorities of Iranians are assuming that the sanctions are going to be lifted so precipitously that they would see, within a year, significantly more foreign investment (62 percent) and tangible improvement in living standards (55 percent). Importantly, those who have more moderated expectations are also significantly less likely to support the deal, and 51 percent of Iranians say that ""unless the U.S. agrees to remove all of its sanctions, Iran should not agree to a deal.""U.S. public opinion is also more nuanced than often portrayed. While polls suggest that a clear bipartisan majority of Americans favor reaching a deal with Iran, that support too rests on certain expectations. If these expectations are not met and the negotiations fail, the American people too are unlikely to blame their own leadership. According to a study conducted by the Program for Public Consultation and the Anwar Sadat Chair for Peace and Development at the University of Maryland, 61 percent of Americans support an agreement that would limit Iran's enrichment capacity and impose additional intrusive inspections in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. Only 36 percent of Americans support ending the current negotiations and increasing sanctions in an effort to get Iran to stop all uranium enrichment. Other polls show similar levels of support for reaching a deal.The same polls of the American people, however, show that a solid majority (63 percent) of Americans believe that Iran's nuclear program is a ""major threat"" to the United States and 68 percent think that Iran is unlikely to really curtail its nuclear program and not develop atomic weapons. Therefore, the support of the American people for the deal rests on the assumption that the deal will impose adequate restrictions on the program and require intrusive enough inspections that would prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons if it ever decided to go down that path. If it proved necessary, President Obama might well benefit politically from refusing to accept a deal that falls short of what is required to ensure that Iran's nuclear program remains exclusively peaceful. Likewise, contrary to what some have claimed, resisting a deal that is too far from the expectations of the Iranian people might well make President Rouhani more popular, not less. As the world powers negotiate with Iran, they should constantly remind themselves that the Iranian government has not come to the negotiating table to discuss the terms of its surrender. They are at the negotiating table because they believe Iran's national interests could be better served under a win-win arrangement. Likewise, Iranian negotiators must realize that Iran's nuclear program is seen at a threat by major powers and they are unlikely to accept a deal that does not effectively alleviate their concerns. If either side misperceives these realities, we are likely to see this and other deadlines pass, as did the previous ones, with significant gaps remaining between the P5+1 and Iran on what constitutes a ""good deal"" on which all could agree."

It's an even better sign of the vibrancy of the classical music business for that to happen under the auspices of a new major international initiative that brings together commercial and non-profit entities. Classical Live -- a collaboration between Google Play Music, 21C Media Group, and five of the world's most beloved orchestras -- is a new platform for digital classical music recordings. Available for streaming and download through Google Play Music, these recordings offer a glimpse at the artistic vitality of some of the hottest conductors and orchestras on the music scene today. The first phase of Classical Live launched in June 2015, with the release of three albums from the Boston Symphony Orchestra (Andris Nelsons, Music Director), two from the New York Philharmonic (Alan Gilbert, Music Director), two from the Cleveland Orchestra (Franz Welser-Möst, Music Director), two from the London Symphony Orchestra (Sir John Eliot Gardiner, Conductor), and three from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra (Mariss Jansons, Conductor Emeritus).Besides offering music fans an opportunity to hear their favorite orchestras and repertoire through a new platform, Classical Live also stands to enrich the existing contemporary music discography. This specific contribution to the annals of recording history is likely to outweigh the addition of standard repertoire recordings to the marketplace. One Classical Live recording -- Selections from the NY Phil Biennial 2014 -- merits praise in the first phase launch of the project. This album is the only contemporary music recording included in the launch of Classical Live, and represents a bold statement by the orchestra: that new music and contemporary composers have a place in the heart of the organization's profile. The recording showcases the work of ten diverse contemporary composers (HK Gruber, Vito Žuraj, Jay Schwartz, Nina Šenk, Michael Hersch, Julia Adolphe, Max Grafe, Andrew McManus, Matthias Pintscher, and Oscar Bettison). Matthias Pintscher, a regular artistic partner with the New York Philharmonic, is also featured prominently in his role as a conductor on the recording. Click here for the complete track list. The New York Philharmonic, which has admirably cranked-up its performance and recording of contemporary works under Music Director Alan Gilbert, stands out from the pack of orchestras on Classical Live. Gilbert's tenure at the Philharmonic, which is set to conclude in 2017 as a result of his recent resignation announcement, has seen the launch of the New York Philharmonic Biennial, numerous new commissions, and the founding of the orchestra's CONTACT! series of new music concerts. While recording contemporary music is not likely to offer significant income to Google Play or the New York Philharmonic, their inclusion of highlights from the 2014 Biennial in the launch of Classical Live is laudable and hopefully a sign of more good things to come in the future. It is certain that significant artistic merit exists in the endeavor of recording music by contemporary composers. Offering these recordings through the digital space and avoiding the production costs of creating physical CDs will surely help the New York Philharmonic's bottom-line. The orchestra's 2015-2016 line-up for CONTACT! and the Biennial is chock-full of new works that should be recorded and made available to the international listening public. Classical Live recordings are available for download ($4.99 for full albums; $0.69 for individual tracks) or streaming ($9.99 per month). All selections are formatted as MP3s and can be accessed through play.google.com, the Google Play Music app for Android and iOS, or by directly downloading the files to your computer or device."

Authorities say they already control the eastern, southern and western approaches.""Today's advance is a key achievement to isolate Daesh terrorists inside the city and cut all their supply lines,"" Hussaini said, referring to Islamic State. ""Today's advance will determine how and when Falluja liberation operations start.""Two army sources said Islamic State fighters deployed at least two suicide car bombs to break the advance, killing 21 members of the Hashd Shaabi and army force, but failed to stop them capturing a bridge at al-Sheeha, north of the city.They said Islamic State forces pulled back to the nearby area of Albu Shijil, where they came under heavy bombardment from army artillery.Iraqi forces are being supported in Anbar by a U.S.-led coalition which has been carrying out air strikes for nearly a year against Islamic State in its self-declared caliphate across parts of Iraq and Syria.In Iraq, the Islamist militants have been pushed out of the city of Tikrit and eastern province of Diyala, but are still fighting in the town of Baiji, home to Iraq's largest oil refinery. In Syria they have lost ground to Kurdish fighters, but captured the central town of Palmyra in May.In the Iraqi capital Baghdad at least 12 people were killed in four separate bombings. Two bombs struck on Sunday morning, and the second pair exploded after dusk as people were breaking their daily Ramadan fasts.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks, but statements issued in the name of Islamic State on Sunday said it was behind two bombs which killed 10 people the day before.

With the collapse of talks between the Greek government and its creditors, Tsipras called the referendum, seeking a ""no"" vote on the latest bailout terms offered by the Eurozone and IMF. Not surprisingly, many business commentators and economists have savaged the negotiating tactic being employed by Tsipras, essentially claiming that such an approach will lead to the inevitable ejection of Greece from the Eurozone, and an even worse contraction of the already depressed Greek economy.On the basis of cold logic, those pundits may be correct. However, the affairs of human societies are rarely played out in a purely logical manner. Those observers, and the leadership of the Eurozone and IMF, have ignored the lessons from Greek history of the last century.In asking Greek voters to render a vote for ""Οχι"" (pronounced ""Ohi,"" which is ""no"" in Greek), Tsipras was echoing one of the most important dates on the Greek national calendar, ""Ohi Day,"" held every October 28. ""Ohi Day"" commemorates an event that occurred on October 28, 1940 which has influenced the Greek national character ever since. It was on that day that the Italian ambassador to Greece handed an ultimatum to the Greek Prime Minister, Ioannis Metaxas. Mussolini, who was jealous of the military successes achieved by his Axis partner, Hitler, decided he would attempt the game of conquest as well. Despite the fact that Metaxas was a dictator, sympathetic to both Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, Mussolini decided on attacking Greece for no other reason than it appearing to be a defenseless country, ripe for easy conquest. At 3 a.m., Metaxas was informed by Rome's ambassador that an Italian army would march into Greece from Albania in less than three hours, and he must capitulate or expect war. The answer from Metaxas was ""Ohi.""That one word rallied Greek resistance to the invasion mounted by Fascist Italy. Metaxas, who was an ill man who would die within months, underwent a profound metamorphosis. He abandoned his previous empathy for fascism, and became a stalwart fighter for democracy. On the day of the Italian invasion, Metaxas issued a proclamation to the Greek people which began with these words, ""The hour has come to fight for the liberty of Greece, her integrity and honor."" In a stirring radio broadcast made a month later, Metaxas told his nation, ""All must know that the struggle must be hard and long, and that our road will not be strewn with flowers, but we shall overcome all difficulties, face all perils... We are fighting for values the significance of which goes beyond our own frontiers and those of the Balkan countries and extends to all humanity. Let us thank God that His will has again destined Greece to fight for such a lofty cause.""To the surprise of the entire world, the Greek army utterly routed the Italian invaders, and even liberated a large party of Italian-occupied Albania. It was the first time in World War II that an Axis army had been defeated in a land campaign. At a dark time in human history, the courage of the Greek nation was a rare beacon of light.Eventually, Nazi Germany intervened in the fighting, and its massive war machine overcame Greek resistance. However, even under Nazi occupation, the Greek people continued to resist by mounting guerrilla warfare. The war brought much suffering to Greece, and an argument could have been made that accepting the Italian ultimatum might have spared the nation much material suffering. However, the cost would have been severe to the Greek people's sense of national dignity. In 1940, they followed in the direction set by Metaxas and established an example of national honor that inspired the world.On July 5, 2015 the Greek people have again said ""no."" As in 1940, despite the hard road mandated by their decision, the Greek people have placed national honor and dignity on a higher plane than the only other alternative on offer: an ultimatum based on collective indignity and national impoverishment ."

Responding to their call, European Council President Donald Tusk announced that euro zone leaders would meet in Brussels on Tuesday evening (1600 GMT).German Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, leader of Merkel's center-left Social Democratic junior coalition partner, said it was hard to conceive of fresh negotiations on lending more billions to Athens after Greeks voted against more austerity.Leftist Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras had ""torn down the last bridges on which Greece and Europe could have moved towards a compromise,"" Gabriel told the Tagesspiegel daily.His comments reflected a mounting public demand in the most powerful EU country, which is also Greece's biggest creditor, to eject Athens from the 19-nation currency area, of which membership was intended to be irreversible.It was not clear whether Merkel, who has repeatedly said she wants to keep Greece in the euro zone, would shift to a similarly hard line.But senior lawmakers in her conservative bloc also spoke firmly: ""Now one has to ask the question whether Greece would not be better off outside the euro zone,"" Hans Michelbach, a member of the Bavarian Christian Social Union, told Reuters. ""Unfortunately, Greece has chosen a path of isolation."" The vote sharpened differences between Greece's few remaining sympathizers in the euro zone - mostly in Italy and France - and hardline countries led by Germany that are fed up with pouring loans into Greece.Italy's foreign minister, Paolo Gentiloni, said the euro zone should resume efforts to reach a deal with Athens.""Now it is right to start trying for an agreement again,"" he tweeted. ""But there is no escape from the Greek labyrinth with a weak Europe that isn't growing."" SILENCE FROM BRUSSELSThe euro fell sharply in early Asia-Pacific trading on Monday, losing about 1.4 percent against the U.S. dollar, as analysts for Citi, Barclays and other banks said a Greek exit was now their ""base case"" or most likely outcome.There was a thunderous silence from top EU policymakers in Brussels and Frankfurt who conferred by telephone but avoided public appearances to comment on an outcome that was a stunning setback for EU governments but delighted Eurosceptic populists.The European Commission said in a brief statement that it ""takes note of and respects"" the referendum result. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, chairman of the Eurogroup of finance ministers of the currency bloc, said in a letter to his Dutch Labor Party members before the vote: ""Although the government in Athens would like people to think otherwise, it is about the question of whether Greece stays in the euro zone or not.""European Parliament President Martin Schulz said the EU should start preparing a humanitarian aid program for Greece.The 60-40 margin of defeat for the terms of a cash-for-reform deal, which the leftist Greek government rejected a week ago, shocked EU officials who had been heartened by opinion polls showing the 'Yes' camp gaining ground as bank closures and the rationing of cash withdrawals began to bite.It was a personal blow for European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, one of the architects of the euro, who worked for months to try to broker a debt deal with Tsipras despite misgivings in Berlin. Deputy finance ministers and senior officials of the Eurogroup Working Group will hold a conference call on Monday to take stock of the situation, another euro zone official said.Any future negotiation would run up against the hardening of opinion in Germany.The head of Germany's savings bank association said Greece had broken with the rules of the euro zone and should leave the currency bloc. The head of the German exporters' body said he could not see how Greece could stay in the euro zone now.Hardline German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, denounced in 'No' campaign posters as a blood-sucker, has leaned towards making an example of Greece and pushing it towards the exit, sources familiar with his thinking say.In a weekend newspaper interview, Schaeuble said Athens might consider leaving the currency area temporarily.Eurosceptics around the EU were jubilant at the rejection of what French far right National Front leader Marine Le Pen called ""the European Union oligarchy.""""It is 'No' vote of freedom, of rebellion against European 'diktats' of those who want to impose the single currency at any price, through the most inhuman and counter-productive austerity,"" she said in a statement.In Britain, anti-EU UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage commended Greek voters for ""calling the EU's bluff.""""EU project is now dying. It's fantastic to see the courage of the Greek people in the face of political and economic bullying from Brussels,"" he said.Eurosceptics in the Netherlands and Italy joined the chorus of glee at the EU's discomfiture. In Spain, leader of the new far-left Podemos party, Pablo Iglesias, who is close to Tsipras, tweeted: ""Today in Greece, democracy has won.""
