It’s called “Cosmos Rings” and it’s expected to release in Japan this summer. The company says it’s the “world’s first” RPG made fully for the Apple Watch.That’s arguable: There have been other RPGs that run on the device, like “Watch Quest!” and “Runeblade,” but “Cosmos Rings” could be the first that doesn’t require an iPhone. Apple introduced Apple Watch-native apps with watchOS 2 last fall.The Apple Watch screen is dinky compared to the iPhone ― let alone a television ― but the move makes more sense than you’d think. According to recent analysis, the Apple Watch, an iPhone-connected accessory launched by the tech giant last year, is a $10 billion business.“Apple isn’t walking or jogging but sprinting ahead with Apple Watch,” Neil Cybart, an Apple analyst who runs the Above Avalon blog, wrote in a post last month.Square Enix has also been keen on expanding its mobile gaming options. The company has released iOS and Android versions of classic games like “Final Fantasy VII,” “Secret of Mana” and “Dragon Quest III,” in addition to smartphone-only entries like “Final Fantasy: Brave Exvius.” Mobile gaming is expected to generate $35 billion in revenue this year, according to an analysis from Deloitte. That’s more than “traditional” PC gaming and console gaming, though mobile gaming is also much more competitive ― the average smartphone game makes a lot less money than PC or console games, that same analysis said.As for the amount of money an Apple Watch RPG can make ― we’ll just have to see.H/T TechnoBuffalo"

He has a Senate re-election first.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CLEVELAND ― A close Donald Trump associate suggested on Thursday morning that the Republican nominee may put his extensive political capital behind boosting a primary challenger to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in 2018.In characteristically colorful and biting terms, Roger Stone harshly criticized Cruz for his much-discussed convention speech the night before, in which he declined to endorse Trump. Calling the senator “an odious, greasy figure who doesn’t have any of Reagan’s warmth or likeability,” Stone said that Cruz had jeopardized his future run for the White House.“Conservatives have long memories,” said Stone. “So in four years or eight years after the Trump presidency, conservatives will remember that he walked out on us.” But the threats didn’t end there. Making his way through radio row, where he took turns denouncing the Texas Republican for various local listening audiences, Stone hinted that Trump would try and prop up an opponent to Cruz when he runs again for the Senate in 2018.“Who knows, maybe Trump will endorse a Republican primary opponent for him in Texas, because there is a lot of talk among conservatives in Texas today about a primary for Ted,” Stone said. “This was a giant miscalculation. He could have set himself up and had the warm support of Trump supporters in some future bid. Instead he is a pariah in this party.”For the most part, Trump’s camp has been angry with Cruz for his speech, but not to the point of being openly vindictive. Stone, with his penchant for political gamesmanship, has upped the drama a notch by suggesting that there could be retribution for Wednesday night.Cruz certainly must have suspected this would come when he encouraged attendees to vote their conscience in November. The senator wrote the speech himself, cleared it with the Trump campaign, and defended it the next morning during a meeting with Texas delegates. Those delegates ― who could very well affect the GOP Senate primary fight in 2018 ― seem torn on the senator’s move.  A number of them could be overheard outside the convention arena on Wednesday night openly musing about their desire to rid themselves of him. But others were more livid at Trump, who they felt had deliberately tried to embarrass Cruz by whipping up boos in the crowd and timing his entry into the hall to stomp on Cruz’s address.“Trump walking into the arena proved that he is a classless individual, OK?” said Jeremiah Hunter, a delegate from Longview, Texas. “Because he stole the thunder from Ted Cruz right when he was ending his speech. That’s classless. It was deliberate and anyone who thinks it’s not deliberate is delusional.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."
6,POLITICS,Corporations Less Prominent At Donald Trump's Republican National Convention,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rnc-corporations-donald-trump_us_5790e8b4e4b0fc06ec5be8e4,"""You don’t see the type of very visible, proud arm around the shoulder that corporations have traditionally done at these conventions,"" one observer said.",2016-07-21,Corporate support has been muted at Donald Trump's nominating convention in Cleveland.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5790ea05190000aa038a771b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CLEVELAND ― Walk around Quicken Loans Arena, where Republicans have nominated Donald Trump as their presidential candidate this week, and you’ll notice something missing: There is practically no evidence of corporate involvement at the 2016 Republican National Convention. In recent history, corporations have provided both direct and in-kind contributions to political party conventions, often proudly displaying their signage around town and within the arena. This year’s convention feels different. Thanks to Trump’s open attacks on Latinos, women, Muslims and Black Lives Matter activists, among many others, the convention has drawn protests from activist groups calling for a corporate boycott. It appears to be working.Just prior to the start of the convention, the host committee announced a $6 million shortfall in funds and, according to reports, the Republican National Committee sent a last-minute appeal to billionaire casino magnate Sheldon Adelson to help fill that hole. The RNC ultimately had to apologize to Adelson for filling the letter with false claims about corporations that had pulled their funding. Those companies had actually never promised to give money in the first place.“As you come here and you walk around, you don’t see the type of very visible, proud arm around the shoulder that corporations have traditionally done at these conventions,” noted Rashad Robinson, spokesman for Color of Change PAC, a group that has pressed corporations not to fund the convention ― particularly those in the tech sector. Some companies did provide technical or in-kind support for the convention, including Google, AT&T, LG, Microsoft, Delta Airlines and Cisco. It isn’t immediately clear if these and other companies only provided in-kind technical support, or if they also made direct contributions to the host committee. The host committee does not need to disclose its donors until 60 days after the end of the convention.Corporate sponsorships have been far more apparent outside the arena at the many convention-related parties, events and workspaces around town. Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and AOL (which owns The Huffington Post) have all set up workspaces for reporters. Press events have also featured corporate and lobbyist sponsorship, including the daily RealClearPolitics forums funded by America’s Credit Unions, a number of medical professional trade groups and the Partnership for a New American Economy, a corporate-backed coalition of U.S. mayors.The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has also hosted nightly parties. On Tuesday night, it featured a controversial set by the ‘90s rock band Third Eye Blind, which took the opportunity to denounce the Republican Party platform. The event was designed to promote the charity Musicians On Call, but was funded by the recording industry’s lobbying arm and a host of corporations, including AT&T, Microsoft, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Comcast, 21st Century Fox, Aflac, Southern Company and DTCC. The lobbying firm Fierce Government Relations was also a sponsor. In addition to the Recording Industry Association of America, other corporate trade groups sponsoring the event included the Nuclear Energy Institute, American Gas Association, Edison Electric Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Global Intellectual Property Center.This was one of the few events that featured the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s name. The powerful business lobby is a central part of the Republican Party’s election infrastructure and, with the GOP’s establishment wing, pushes for business-friendly policies, fewer regulations and lower taxes.The Chamber, however, is a major proponent of international trade deals and immigration reform legislation ― both opposed by Republican Party nominee Trump. Along with the National Association of Manufacturers, the Chamber has feuded with Trump over his opposition to pro-corporate trade deals and proposals to impose high tariffs on imports.One longtime Republican Party activist expressed surprise over not receiving an invitation to any Chamber event in Cleveland.Tom Donohue, president of the Chamber, was in Cleveland on Wednesday and appeared on Fox Business, where he noted that he was not yet endorsing Trump and said that corporations are still waiting to hear from both candidates. That may explain why both the Chamber and corporate America are less noticeable at this year’s Republican convention.“I’m not sure ... because business is still looking carefully and listening,” Donohue said. “Trump talks about some important things, energy and taxes and financial areas. Hillary, perhaps, has more experience, and businessmen like that ― businessmen and women like that.” “But I don’t think that’ll be decided until you hear the speeches here and next week and you see the first debate,” he continued. “And then you’ll see people going to move where they’re going to move.”That timeline is definitely too late for convention organizers and party-goers looking for corporate backing.Christina Wilkie contributed reporting.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."
7,POLITICS,Mike Pence's RNC Speech Gives Voters What They Want To Hear,Samantha Neal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mike-pence-rnc-speech_us_5790dcbbe4b0bdddc4d35508,The speech highlighted his normalcy -- a rare quality on the Trump campaign.,2016-07-21,"Republican U.S. presidential nominee Donald Trump (L) greets vice presidential nominee Mike Pence after Pence spoke during the third day of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, U.S. July 20, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5790dd141300002d0005f220.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Unlike most of the high-profile figures who took the stage Wednesday night, vice presidential nominee Indiana Gov. Mike Pence is unknown to most voters. After formally accepting his vice presidential nomination, Pence immediately dispelled the figurative elephant in the room: “For those of you who don’t know me, which is most of you...” His introductory speech marked a crucial opportunity to make a lasting impression on the mass public; a publicized vantage point from which he could sell both himself and the Republican ticket to viewers. And he did just that.During his convention speech, Pence tactically touted his economic accomplishments in Indiana, specifically citing the budget surplus and tax cuts. He hammered home his success in governing his home state, leveraging his political experience. Pence also struck a personal note, emphasizing his Christian, conservative and Republican identity ― “in that order”.A Morning Consult poll tested whether Pence’s stance on various issues would affect the likelihood of voters supporting the Republican ticket. The results were a mixed bag. The Indiana governor’s economic accomplishments were seen to have a positive effect on voters ― about half of independent voters and 3 in 4 Republican voters say they have a better impression of Pence when they know that Indiana had a $210 million budget surplus at the end of 2015, and that Pence lowered property and corporate income taxes. Other issues elicited negative feedback among voters. When respondents were told that in 2009 Pence voted “no” on enforcing against anti-gay hate crimes and that in 2007 he voted to allow job discrimination based on sexual orientation, about half of voters (and almost half of independents) say they had a less favorable view of him. Pence mentioned none of these policy positions in the convention speech.Although vice presidential picks tend not to sway election outcomes (and polling indicates that this case will not be any different), Pence certainly adds contrast to the Republican ticket ― he is, in many respects, the antithesis of Donald Trump. “[Trump] is a man known for a large personality; a colorful style, with lots of charisma,” Pence said of the business mogul during the speech. “So I guess he was trying to balance the ticket.”A new swath of polling by CBS/YouGov among 11 key battleground states shows that more voters consider Trump’s selection of Pence as “cautious” rather than “bold,” “boring” as opposed to “exciting” and as bringing “stability” rather than “uncertainty” to the ticket. Respondents also believe Trump’s vice presidential choice reflects “politics as usual” more so than it “represents change.”These terms typically characterize anything but the routinely bombastic Republican nominee. Although polls show that the Pence selection has a negligible impact on voters’ likelihood of supporting Trump, it signals what could be a maneuver on Trump’s behalf to appeal to the GOP establishment by throttling back on his typically extremist tendencies. The reorientation appears antithetical to the very sentiment that elevated Trump to political prominence in the first place. The CBS/YouGov poll also asked voters whether they exhibited any level of agreement with Trump concerning various issues the Republican presidential nominee takes a strong stance on: immigration, terrorism, how to change Wall Street and economic inequality, and the need to change Washington. A majority of voters expressed some level of agreement with Trump on every key issue. Interestingly, of all the key issues polled about, respondents expressed a very high level of corroboration (73 percent) with Trump’s stance on one particular issue: “the need to change Washington.”However, Trump’s selection of a Washington insider as a running mate perhaps signals a move to consolidate the traditional Republican base. Though Trump’s appeal is largely based on being a political outsider, he appears to be bending toward the traditional establishment politics he once marketed himself as being detached from. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."
8,POLITICS,Donald Trump's Fundraising Cut Hillary Clinton's Money Advantage In Half In June,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-fundraising-june_us_57904019e4b0fc06ec5bbbf6,From a balance of $1.3 million to $20 million in one month.,2016-07-21,Donald Trump can actually raise money from donors.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5790406c1300002d0005f100.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CLEVELAND ― Republican nominee Donald Trump, who ended May with only $1.3 million in the bank, raised $26.7 million for his campaign in June and entered July with more than $20 million on hand.Trump’s fundraising haul was a decent take for his first full month raising money from donors in his presidential bid. It was, however, nowhere near the $36.3 million raised in June by the campaign of Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic Party nominee. Clinton had $44.4 million cash on hand entering July ― more than double what Trump had.That may seem like a huge disadvantage for Trump. But in just one month, he reduced the amount he trails Clinton in cash on hand by half. Still, he’s not raising nearly as much money as 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney at this point in the campaign.The largest pool of Trump’s funds raised from donors came from small contributions of $200 or less. In total, he raised $12.1 million from these small donors. An additional $2.2 million, nearly all of it from small donors, was transferred from a joint fundraising committee connected to the Republican National Committee. Trump raised another $7.8 million from bigger donors, directly contributed $2 million himself, and loaned his campaign $1.8 million. The $2 million contribution appears to be the $2 million Trump promised to give in a fundraising email if donors also chipped in a combined $2 million.That $1.8 million loan brought the total Trump has loaned his campaign to $47.5 million. Trump has repeatedly claimed, to great suspicion, that he had forgiven these loans in June. The report filed with the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday shows that Trump did, in fact, forgive all of those loans. It barely matters at this point, as Trump could only repay those loans with funds raised for the primary campaign. The general election campaign will officially begin on Thursday, when Trump accepts the Republican nomination in Cleveland.The Trump campaign claimed earlier this month that he had raised $51 million for his campaign and the Republican Party in June. The full breakdown shows that Trump raised $32.4 million for two joint fundraising committees connecting his campaign to party committees. His campaign raised an additional $20.7 million from donors, and received $3.8 million from the candidate himself. That means the total raised by Trump in June was $53 million.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

The battle cry adorns T-shirts. It is scrawled on posters. It has even come from the mouths of official speakers at the podium inside the Quicken Loans Arena.But for all boisterous chants of “LOCK HER UP,” even many of Donald Trump’s most ardent supporters here don’t see any viable path to putting Clinton behind bars. A lot of them acknowledge the complications posed by due process as they call for the imprisonment of the presumptive Democratic nominee for president. And some say the investigators have spoken with regard to emailgate and it’s simply time to move on.Earlier this month, FBI Director James Comey announced he was recommending Clinton not be criminally charged for the way she handled classified information on a private server while secretary of state. Although he offered a blistering critique of Clinton and her team ― “they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information” ― Comey said there was no proof anyone intended to break the law.Jack Leinweber, an Air Force veteran from Texas in town for the convention, said he believes Clinton lied, “and we have a major problem with someone becoming commander-in-chief who’s been caught lying.” Leinweber feels certain that if a regular Joe like himself had handled classified information in the same way Clinton did, he’d be headed to the hoosegow. But as for whether the Democrat should be locked up, “That’s not my call,” Leinweber noted. And if Clinton happens to win the presidency ― unfortunate as it would be ― “we’ll have to support her,” he said. “You always have to support the presidency.” Donald Larson, a Cleveland-area Republican running for Congress, also said he’d be in prison for doing the same thing Clinton did. A Navy veteran, Larson said he’d handled sensitive information as a communications officer.“If I had taken a [transceiver] off of the ship, took it to my condo in San Diego, ran all my ship’s message traffic through it, and then brought that back, they’d have hauled me in, put me in handcuffs, I’d be court martialed, and I’d still be in Fort Leavenworth,” Larson, 48, said. “Guaranteed.”Larson said Comey should have recommended the Justice Department bring charges against Clinton. But now he holds out no such hope. Despite the convention’s primary refrain, he doesn’t expect to ever see Clinton in prison. “It’s done,” he said. “It’s over. That’s not going to happen.” Pamela Nicolay is more optimistic. A 56-year-old from Placerville, California, Nicolay was walking through the scrum outside the arena proudly holding up a Trump sign. She said she hasn’t voted in a presidential election since casting a ballot for Ronald Reagan, but her passion for Trump was so great that she now finds herself in Cleveland. Nicolay despises Clinton ― if she were to win the White House, “I would run to the store as fast as I could and get as much ammo as I could and buckle down,” she said, laughing. And, yes, she believes Clinton should be in a jumpsuit and talking to her husband through glass.“Martha Stewart went to prison for way less,” Nicolay said.So what does the process look like for finally sending Clinton to a federal penitentiary?“Get rid of the corruptness and the judges and stuff that’s in the Supreme Court,” she said.Jeff Howe, a former Marine from Nashville, Tennessee, was walking through the crowd here holding a sign that read “Clinton for Prison.” (The same slogan is available on merchandise sold by vendors throughout the convention area; the T-shirts include the name Infowars.com, the website of radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.) “She needs to be held accountable,” Howe said. “I have to be held accountable, shouldn’t she?”Howe rattled off the assorted Clinton controversies ― Whitewater, Benghazi, the emails, etc., all of which were listed on the other side of his sign. “They’ve been doing these things for years,” he said of the Clintons. “You or I do that, we ain’t going to get away with it.”Howe said he didn’t know if Clinton’s handling of the Benghazi attacks amounted to criminality. And he acknowledged he didn’t know exactly what Clinton should be prosecuted for in order to send her to prison.“I’m not a lawyer, brother,” Howe said. “But I would think she’s done some things that were wrong and she needs to be held accountable. Does that mean she should be in prison? She certainly shouldn’t be president.”Howe then started a “lock her up” chant, with a handful of passersby jumping in before it gradually tapered off.One Trump supporter who didn’t join the chorus was a Cleveland local named Ken, who declined to give his last name. Ken is committed to voting for Trump, believing that, despite his fabulous wealth and luxurious lifestyle, the Republican nominee genuinely cares for working-class folks like himself. But Ken’s devotion to Trump doesn’t extend to a desire to see Clinton sent to the pokey.“It is up to the criminal system to determine that,” Ken said. “They have determined that she does not belong in prison, and I have faith in the system.”Standing near a cart hawking Hillary-for-prison T-shirts, Ken made a quiet, personal plea for civility. “I truly feel that there should be common sense and respect for both parties,” he said.Michael McAuliff contributed reporting."

During their season, WNBA teams and players have led by wearing pregame protest shirts and speaking at press conferences ― but it’s now costing them thousands of dollars.On Wednesday, the WNBA fined the New York Liberty, Phoenix Mercury and Indiana Fever for wearing black shirts during warm-ups in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. Each team was fined $5,000 and its players were fined $500, according to the Associated Press. “We are proud of WNBA players’ engagement and passionate advocacy for non-violent solutions to difficult social issues but expect them to comply with the league’s uniform guidelines,” WNBA President Lisa Borders said in a statement provided to the AP. However, the WNBA’s apparent pride in its players’ activism and media attention is up against a stiff and unsettling adherence to the rule book. The Liberty have worn the plain black shirts four times total and did it again on Wednesday against the Washington Mystics on the road. Mercury and Fever players wore them Tuesday night. WNBA rules state that uniforms cannot be altered in any way.It didn’t matter that the shirts were made by Adidas, the league’s official uniform supplier. It also didn’t matter that wearing plain black warmups — as opposed to shirts with text — began as a compromise between the Liberty and its players, who wanted to build off the momentum sparked by the Minnesota Lynx’s protest shirts and a press conference given earlier this month. Aware of the uniform rules, players informed the league office last week of their protest plans. In a laissez-faire manner, the WNBA decided to not prohibit the shirts for that week’s games. At the beginning of this week, however, the league sent out a memo reminding teams of its uniform policy, noting that it would be enforced moving forward. Following NBA Commissioner Adam Silver’s stated preference for players to use social media, pregame and postgame press conferences and community events for political and social activism as opposed to the court, the WNBA encouraged players to use those platforms for expression instead. Their warning went unheeded.The WNBA’s decision to take action against its players has already drawn sour reactions from around the league. Last night, Mercury forward Mistie Bass vented her frustration with, in her mind, the league’s double standard. The league’s fine is surprising given that dozens of players wore the black warmups with approval from their teams ― and considering that other professional leagues have not issued fines after player protests.In December 2014, many NBA players, lead by superstars LeBron James and Kobe Bryant, wore black “I Can’t Breathe” warmup T-shirts in protest over grand jury decisions not to indict police officers who killed Eric Garner and Michael Brown. NFL players have also made “hands up, don’t shoot” gestures during games.But the NBA and the NFL ― yes, the same NFL that fined players last season for dedicating a small uniform accessory to a dead parent ― decided against punishing its players. Fining LeBron James or any other major star for social activism is a bad public relations move.There’s a coldness to the WNBA’s punishment that seems to go against its progressive values. Instead of making an exception for its passionate, mostly black players during a historically troubling period of social and racial unrest in the U.S., the league is prioritizing ticky-tack by-the-book rules.More voices need to be encouraged, not fined ― and silenced. CORRECTION: The players were fined $500, not $5,000 as previously stated."

He is now citing the pledge and demanding that his former rivals endorse him.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57903669190000aa038a758a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CLEVELAND ― For Republicans still in shock that Donald Trump is actually their presidential nominee, and wondering which single moment in time they should return to in order to fix things, here is the start to at least one alternative timeline:Thursday, Sept. 3, 2015, 1 p.m: Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus announces at a Washington news conference that Trump’s refusal to support the eventual nominee meant he could not participate in the coming presidential debate at the Reagan Library in California. Priebus suggested that the reality TV star instead seek the Democratic nomination, whose front-runner he has contributed to in the past.Of course, it did not happen that way at all.In reality, Priebus sought a meeting with Trump, traveled to Trump Tower in Manhattan, and persuaded him to sign a pledge promising to support whoever was the eventual GOP nominee ― which Trump immediately showed off at his own news conference.“That was the most significant misread that I have ever seen in my career,” said Florida consultant Rick Wilson, who has emerged as one of Trump’s harshest Republican critics. “How he thought, ‘I will go to this raving narcissistic maniac and kiss his ring and then he’ll respect me,’ just blows me away.”Priebus declined several Huffington Post interview requests, but on Wednesday defended his decision to win Trump’s signature on the pledge. “It was a great idea,” he said as he left one Republican convention event on his way to another.Even at the time, when most of the GOP candidates and nearly all political observers believed Trump’s popularity would fade in the coming months, some Republicans worried that having Priebus travel to Trump’s home base, and not the other way around, created a troubling impression.“Trump is in control,” Peter Wehner, an aide to former President George W. Bush, told The Washington Post. “It looks like the RNC is going hat in hand to Trump. It doesn’t help the RNC. It simply helps Trump.”Wilson said he sees Priebus’ Trump Tower visit as the inflection point that forever changed the race, starting the process of “normalizing” Trump in the minds of Republican primary voters ― and all because party leaders believed that Trump was actually worth the billions he claimed.“That fear of Trump’s resources sent Reince Priebus scurrying like a terrified hobbit to the Barad-dûr of the Trump empire to beg the Orange Lord to sign a pledge,” Wilson wrote in a scorching May essay on the website Heatstreet. “The thought that Trump could easily fund a third-party bid was a cheap form of political blackmail against the RNC, and it worked. It was a classic Trump con.”Numerous publications have placed Trump’s actual net worth at a mere fraction of the $10 billion he boasts. National Journal found he had no more than $232 million in liquid assets, based on his financial disclosure report, and actually would be far wealthier had he just invested his inherited share of his father’s empire in an index fund tracking the S&P 500 back in 1974.But the RNC, despite a well-staffed research office, didn’t bother checking into Trump’s financial wherewithal. One official said privately that vetting its own candidates is not generally something the RNC does. In any case, with 17 presidential candidates, the party had its hands full just handling primary season logistics, the official said.One top RNC member, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal party business, said doing anything to help or hurt any candidate was not the party’s role. “The party has done everything it can. We cannot control the candidate. That’s not our job,” the member said. “We had a great process. It was fair and open and transparent. That’s our job.”That a pledge was even necessary was because Trump, at the first debate in August 2015 ― at the very arena where Trump will deliver his acceptance speech Thursday ― was the sole candidate on stage to raise his hand when moderator Brett Baier asked who could not promise to back the ultimate Republican nominee and not run as an independent.“If I’m the nominee, I will pledge I will not run as an independent,” Trump said. But he was unwilling to say what he would do if he didn’t win the nomination. He then suggested he could use the offer of his support as a bargaining chip. “I’m, you know, talking about a lot of leverage.”Trump subsequently reneged on the pledge. He told CNN at a March 29 town hall in Wisconsin: “I have been treated very unfairly ... by basically the RNC, the Republican Party, the establishment.”Weeks later, after essentially clinching the nomination with his May 3 victory in Wisconsin and then near daily since then, he has been demanding that his vanquished rivals endorse him.“They signed a pledge saying they will abide, saying they will back the candidate of the party,” Trump said at a June 29 rally in Bangor, Maine. “They broke their word. In my opinion, they should never be allowed to run for public office again because what they did is disgraceful.”Trump’s shifting views on the pledge and his weaknesses as a general election candidate notwithstanding, at least one anti-Trump Republican is willing to cut Priebus and the RNC some slack. The concern last autumn was that even a modestly funded third-party run, he said, also on the condition of anonymity, would peel off enough Republican votes to guarantee a Democratic win.“Once Trump entered this race, Reince was having trouble just getting out of bed each day,” the Republican strategist said, adding that persuading Trump to agree to the pledge made sense at the time. “It was about extinguishing that fire. The threat of his running third-party was a threat that was taken very seriously at that time.”"

Mike Pence. Trump’s choice appears to signal of what kind of president he would be ― and it’s the kind who wants to work closely with Congress’ most conservative members.Below are some of Pence’s greatest hits over the years:Pence has been at the forefront of the GOP’s battles against Planned Parenthood, birth control access and abortion rights for years. He even threatened to shut down the federal government over Planned Parenthood funding as a congressman in 2012.His cuts to Planned Parenthood funding in Indiana exacerbated an unprecedented HIV outbreak in a rural area where the family planning provider had been the only HIV testing center. After he signed a bill into law to severely restrict abortion rights in the state, women flooded his phone lines to tell him about their periods.He also embarrassed the Republican Party and the state of Indiana by signing a controversial “religious freedom” bill into law that licensed discrimination against LGBT people.Then, after backlash, he signed a revised version ...leading to a major drop in his approval rating.He tried to defend the law by comparing it to an existing federal law backed by Democrats, despite the fact that the Indiana law had additional language that facilitated LGBT discrimination.And in an interview, he refused to say whether it should be illegal under state law to discriminate against LGBT people.After his announcement as Trump’s VP pick, Emily’s List summed the duo up:“Together, they are a perfect storm of classic, out of touch, GOP extremism.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

The GOP platform's anti-gay marriage plank is out of step with most Americans. And the current political environment isn’t great for Hillary Clinton. This is HuffPollster for Thursday, July 21, 2016. TRUMP MIGHT NOT GET MUCH OF A CONVENTION BUMP - Will Jordan: “There are lots of election myths out there, but the convention bounce – a candidate rises in polls after their party’s convention – has good supporting evidence. As outlined by political scientist John Sides, the bounce is real and can be spectacular (in 1992, Bill Clinton saw his support grow by 14 points). However, as Thomas Holbrook notes, the effect has been smaller in recent years….This year’s conventions are on consecutive weeks, but they also take place earlier in the summer, and, as we discussed last week, an unusually large number of voters have yet to rally to one of the major party nominees. So far, the GOP convention has been a bit chaotic. Officials had to squelch an anti-Trump revolt, some of the party’s biggest stars are sitting the event out, and – whatever you think about plagiarism – media coverage has probably focused less on ‘humanizing Trump’ than the campaign hoped. For me, the big question is whether Trump can break out of the high-30s/low-40s level where he’s been stuck all year. To win with those numbers, he would need third-party candidates to do tremendously well, preventing Clinton from reaching back into the mid-/high-40s, where her support was only a few months ago.” [YouGov]Historical data shows such bounces diminishing in recent years - Lydia Saad: “On Aug. 18, 1988, Vice President George H.W. Bush accepted his party’s nomination for president at the Republican National Convention in New Orleans.…Before the convention, more voters thought Bush was a follower (52%) than a leader (37%). After the convention, the numbers nearly reversed. Similar gains in perceptions of Bush as ‘strong,’ ‘sincere,’ ‘confident’ and ‘intelligent’ resulted in a nine-percentage-point increase in his favorable rating and a six-point increase in support for Bush against his Democratic opponent, Michael Dukakis. As a result, after trailing Dukakis from May through August ― including by 17 points right after the Democratic convention in July ― Bush took the lead following the Republican convention and remained on top through the election….Bush’s six-point convention bounce roughly matched the 6.2-point average increase for both parties in Gallup polling from 1964 through 1992. More recently, however, the average convention bounce has been 3.8 points.” [Gallup]THE GOP’S ANTI-GAY MARRIAGE PLATFORM ISN’T POPULAR - HuffPollster: “The Republican Party’s continuing opposition to same-sex marriage may have appeased the party’s social conservatives, but it appeals to a dwindling slice of the electorate, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds….’Traditional marriage and family, based on marriage between one man and one woman, is the foundation for a free society and has for millennia been entrusted with rearing children and instilling cultural values,’ the platform reads in part. That position puts the party at considerable remove from the American public, which appears largely uninterested in seeking a leader who is against gay marriage. Just 23 percent of Americans polled say that they’d be more likely to vote for a presidential candidate who opposes gay marriage, according to the HuffPost/YouGov poll. Thirty-five percent would be more likely to vote for a candidate who supports gay marriage, while another 31 percent say it doesn’t matter.” [HuffPost]THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT ISN’T HELPING HILLARY CLINTON - Mark Blumenthal: “This week’s SurveyMonkey Election Tracking poll finds a narrowing of the presidential race among registered voters nationwide….[T]he political environment of the last several weeks has been generally daunting for the Clinton campaign. First, the seemingly endless series of high profile shootings and attacks has boosted the salience of terrorism. In mid-June, immediately after the Orlando nightclub shootings, the percentage of registered voters who chose terrorism as the issue that matters most to them nearly doubled, from 12 to 23 percent and has remained at roughly that level for the past three weeks…. Republicans and independents who lean Republican mention terrorism as their most important issue more often (34 percent) than Democrats and Democratic leaners (13 percent) and independents who lean to neither party (18 percent). The increased salience of terrorism – an issue that motivates the Republican base – may play a role in narrowing the horserace numbers. Second, FBI Director James Comey’s recommendation of no criminal charges against Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server likely helped reinforce doubts about her ethics. Last week, four out of five voters (82 percent) said Clinton’s use of a personal email server while serving as Secretary of State was inappropriate and more than half (56 percent) disagreed with Comey’s recommendation against prosecuting Clinton.” [SurveyMonkey]CANDIDATES ARE RELYING MORE ON SOCIAL MEDIA THAN TRADITIONAL WEBSITES - Elisa Shearer: “Roughly a quarter of U.S. adults (24%) turn to social media posts from either the Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump campaigns as a way of keeping up with the election, according to a new Pew Research Center survey conducted June 7 to July 5, 2016. This exceeds the portions that rely on the candidates’ campaign websites (10%) or their emails (9%)....What’s more, most of those who rely on the candidates’ websites and emails for news also turn to candidates’ social media posts for information, whether on Twitter, Facebook or some other platform….Individually, the Clinton and Trump campaigns have about an equal reach online: Roughly the same portion of Americans turn to each campaign’s social media feeds (17% each) and campaign websites (7% for Clinton and 6% for Trump). A somewhat greater portion turn to emails from the Clinton campaign (7%) than the Trump campaign (3%), but the figures are quite low for both.” [Pew] HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

The controversial law, which was passed in March, forces transgender people to use the bathroom that corresponds with the gender they were assigned at birth, rather than the gender they now identify as, and bars local governments from protecting the LGBT community through nondiscrimination policies. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver had previously warned in April that the league would pull the All-Star Game out of Charlotte should HB2 not be altered, but had not set a deadline for the state to do so. The NBA and Charlotte Hornets were reportedly working with lawmakers to alter the bill to the league’s satisfaction in the weeks leading up to the decision.The league has not finalized where it will host the All-Star weekend instead, but said it will make a decision “in the coming weeks.” The Vertical reports that the league is zeroing in on New Orleans as a potential alternative.Gov. Pat McCrory (R), a staunch defender of the law, rebuked the NBA and “left-wing special interest groups” who have criticized the law.“The sports and entertainment elite, Attorney General Roy Cooper and the liberal media have for months misrepresented our laws and maligned the people of North Carolina simply because most people believe boys and girls should be able to use school bathrooms, locker rooms and showers without the opposite sex present,” a statement read.“Twenty-one other states have joined North Carolina to challenge the federal overreach by the Obama administration mandating their bathroom policies in all businesses and schools instead of allowing accommodations for unique circumstances. Left-wing special interest groups have no moral authority to try and intimidate the large majority of American parents who agree in common-sense bathroom and shower privacy for our children. American families should be on notice that the selective corporate elite are imposing their political will on communities in which they do business, thus bypassing the democratic and legal process.”In a joint statement, the Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBTQ civil rights organization in the country, and Equality NC, a North-Carolina-based LGBTQ advocacy organization, praised the NBA for taking a stand against bigotry. “Today the NBA and Commissioner Silver sent a clear message that they won’t stand for discrimination against LGBTQ employees, players or fans,” HRC President Chad Griffin said in the statement. “Every day that HB2 remains on the books, people across North Carolina are at risk of real harm. We appreciate the leadership of the NBA in standing up for equality and call once again on lawmakers to repeal this vile HB2 law.”Perhaps, ironically, canceling the All-Star Game will most adversely punish Charlotte, a city that had tried to protect transgender people before the HB2 was signed into law. The city passed a resolution just one month before to protect the transgender community from discrimination. The anti-LGBT state law made it so the city could not follow through.In its statement, the league left open the possibility that it award the 2019 All-Star Game to Charlotte, should North Carolina resolve the issue to the league’s satisfaction. The NBA apologized to fans in North Carolina for the decision. “We are particularly mindful of the impact of this decision on our fans in North Carolina, who are among the most passionate in our league,” the league said. “It is also important to stress that the City of Charlotte and the Hornets organization have sought to provide an inclusive environment and that the Hornets will continue to ensure that all patrons — including members of the LGBT community — feel welcome while attending games and events in their arena.”"

The researchers at Cornell Food & Brand Lab have discovered that humans’ desire to indulge in food porn has been happening for 500 years. The first evidence of it is in still life paintings in which lobsters, bread, exotic fruit and salt were often depicted, but were hardly actually found on people’s dinner tables.The researchers looked at 750 European and American food paintings from a 500-year period (140 of those depicted family meals). They found that people have always had a difficult relationship with vegetables. Vegetables only showed up in 19 percent of paintings, while fruit stole the show in 76 percent. Bread and pastries made an appearance in 54 percent and meat 39 percent. Salt was the most popular seasoning by far and cheese was the favored dairy product. Shellfish, which was very hard to come by, showed up in 22 percent of paintings ― far more often than in anyone’s home from that era.What’s the takeaway? That we as humans have always had the desire to feast our eyes on indulgent, aspirational food ― even if it might mean we’re a little crazy. "

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) doesn’t seem to be changing his mind.Speaking at a breakfast Thursday morning with the Texas delegation at the RNC, Cruz said Trump’s negative comments about Cruz’s wife and father kept him from endorsing the real estate mogul for president. “You might have a similar view, if someone were attacking your wife,” Cruz told an audience member.He argued that the pledge made during the GOP primary, in which he and other GOP hopefuls said they would vote for the eventual Republican nominee, was “not a blanket commitment.”“The day that pledge was abrogated was the day this became personal,” he said. “I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife.”“[I’m not going to] come like a servile puppy dog and say, ‘thank you very much for maligning my wife and maligning my father,’” Cruz added, promising he would not vote for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.Cruz said Trump did not ask him to endorse, and said he told the Republican nominee three days ago that he would not endorse him.The Texas senator added that he was not eager to come and speak at the GOP convention after Trump threatened to “spill the beans” on his wife and accused his father of helping the assassin of former President John F. Kennedy. “You’ve got to get over it, this is politics,” an audience member shouted at Cruz.Cruz expressed his disappointment that RNC attendees negatively reacted to his call to “vote your conscience,” saying politics aren’t a team sport with “red jerseys and blue jerseys.” He repeatedly insisted he would take a calm yet positive approach to this election, pointing out that he “did not say a single negative word” about Trump in his Wednesday night speech.“The way to win... is not just to scream and yell and attack as a traitor anyone who would dare question our candidate,” Cruz said.Watch Paul Ryan in 360 at the RNC"

In a blog post, he cited concerns that the game was affecting his brain and mental health as the main reason for hanging up his cleats at the age of 29.“My wife used to joke about the ‘little things I forget,’” wrote Monroe, who played left tackle for the Baltimore Ravens for his final three seasons. “Things like that were just a joke around the house until this past winter, when my four-year-old daughter said, ‘Daddy you don’t remember anything!’”By retiring due to mental health concerns explicitly, Monroe joins a growing list of former NFL players who put their brains before their money, including Buffalo Bills linebacker A.J. Tarpley and San Francisco 49ers linebacker Chris Borland. The primary fear of these players is developing chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, a degenerative brain disease cause by repeated hits to the head, which can only be diagnosed after death. According to Boston researchers, the disease was found in 87 of the 91 deceased former NFL players that were tested.“The last 18 years have been full of traumatic injuries to both my head and my body,” Monroe wrote in The Players’ Tribune. He attributed those injuries to a “never-ending cycle” that seems to be the norm for most players in the NFL: “injury, shake it off, ‘recover,’ repeat.” Monroe admitted that his decision might be perplexing to many people, but added, “I am thinking of my family first right now — and my health and my future.” "

And Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has chosen anti-LGBT Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana as his running mate, a man who signed an extreme, discriminatory Religious Freedom Restoration Act last year.Nonetheless, Log Cabin Republican president Gregory T. Angelo, in an interview with me on SiriusXM Progress at the RNC this week, still characterized Trump as a “leader” on LGBT rights.“As far as LGBT issues go, he has actually been a leader on LGBT rights,” Angelo told me, even though Trump is opposed to marriage equality and supports the First Amendment Defense Act. “He said he would be our friend as president,” Angelo said in Trump’s defense, referring specifically to Trump’s speech after the Orlando mass shooting at the queer Pulse nightclub where 49 people, mostly queer people of color, were murdered. “And he said we live in a remarkable society where people ‘love who they love and express themselves as they are.’”When pressed on Trump’s opposition to the fundamental issue of marriage equality, Angelo said, “I don’t lose any sleep thinking for a minute that marriage equality in the country will be overturned.”Angelo also excused Trump for choosing Mike Pence as a running mate and for the GOP’s extremist anti-LGBT platform. Speaking about the platform specifically, Angelo actually characterized Trump’s refusal to step in and prevent anti-LGBT language ― language which includes opposition to marriage equality, the promotion of transgender “bathroom bills” and support of so-called “ex-gay” therapy programs ― as a result of Trump being supportive of LGBT people. “On some issues... the platform is exemplary of our candidate, Donald Trump ― on policies like illegal immigration, on trade,” he explained. “But in an odd way, because Donald Trump was not campaigning as a social issue warrior, there was a vacuum there. And the fact that there was a lack of campaigning from Donald Trump on social issues and a lack of assertion on these issues, that vacuum was filled by [Family Research Council’s] Tony Perkins and hard-line conservatives who saw an opportunity to double down on those issues in the platform.”When challenged on the claim that Trump has not been campaigning by courting social conservatives on anti-LGBT issues ― the Republican presidential nominee promised on both Fox News and the Christian Broadcasting Network to appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn the historic Obergefell ruling and he has met with and made promises to anti-LGBT conservatives several times ― Angelo said he was confident that he still supported LGBT rights.“Very little of [that] has me raising me an eyebrow,” he said, dismissing such campaigning and pointing to the fact that Trump “went to a same-sex wedding” and uses the term “LGBT,” which he called “historic” for a Republican presidential candidate.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar,rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

As he took his designated seat, 25A, a female flight attendant loudly said, “Mohamed Ahmed, seat 25-A, I will be watching you,” according to the letter. About a minute later, the attendant allegedly said, “Mohamed Ahmed, that is a very long name, Seat 25-A: I will be watching you,” and then added in a louder and more aggressive voice, “25A: you will be watched.” According to the letter, passengers in Radwan’s vicinity heard the attendant’s remarks. The attendant also “did not make a statement about or to any other passenger.”When Radwan asked the attendant about her remarks, she allegedly replied that she was monitoring everyone.Radwan says he questioned this, telling the attendant she’d only said his name and seat number aloud, and that her actions were discriminatory. To this, the attendant allegedly said Radwan was being “too sensitive,” and walked away.After recounting the woman’s remarks to the other flight attendants, Radwan was reportedly informed that American Airlines would have to remove him from the flight for making the first female flight attendant “uncomfortable.”“I felt too unsafe to fly with American again,” Radwan told The Charlotte Observer about the incident, adding that he had to book a much later flight at a cost of about $1,500.But it’s about more than money and being inconvenienced, he told the paper. “I’ve been a U.S. citizen for 13 years but at that moment I felt my sense of being American taken from me.”And he’s not the only one. In at least four incidents this year, the letter from Radwan’s lawyer states, Muslims say airlines in the United States discriminated against them.In March, a Muslim family was removed from an United Airlines flight after requesting an additional strap for their child’s booster seat. In April, a Muslim passenger was removed from a Southwest Airlines flight after a passenger heard him speaking Arabic (he had said “Inshallah,” which means “God-willing” or “hopefully”). Also in April, a Muslim Somali woman says she was removed from a flight with no good explanation. And in June, a bearded man says he was removed from an Alaska Airlines flight after a passenger allegedly said he looked “Arabic and scary.” For the last six months, The Huffington Post has also documented the near-daily acts of harassment, violence and discrimination Muslims face in the U.S. “Given the continuing rise of anti-Muslim rhetoric and hate crimes occurring throughout the United States, this type of reckless and harmful conduct should not be tolerated by our nation’s airlines, which are legally charged with safely carrying all individuals who are rightfully present in an equal and nondiscriminatory manner, without regard to their religious affiliation or ethnicity,” says Sayed’s letter.

I am immensely disappointed,’” Aguilar said. “To which I said, ‘I’m immensely disappointed every time a Hispanic baby dies in this country, and that’s what would happen with Hillary Clinton as president.’” This was, of course, a reference to Clinton’s stance on abortion.Aguilar’s attitude has been a common one at the Republican National Convention’s Latino-focused events ― that he’s a “hold-your-nose-and-vote” alternative to the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. While Latino conservatives are coming around to Trump, it seems to have very little to do with him, and a lot to do with her. “We have to put this in perspective,” said Aguilar, who is president of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles. “I understand the animosity against Trump, but I think we’re called this election [to make] a practical vote.”Trump says that Latinos love him, and certainly, there are some who do. Yet Clinton remains far more popular with Latinos as a whole: A NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Telemundo poll released Sunday put her Latino support at 76 percent to Trump’s 14 percent. According to a poll released at the convention, less than half of self-identified conservative Latinos have a positive view of Trump, and less than one-quarter of Latino moderates do. The “good news for Donald Trump” ― as The Latino Coalition, the group that commissioned the poll, described it in a handout ― is that 40 percent of those who expressed a “very negative” to “neutral” impression of Trump still said they were considering voting for him or were undecided. Meanwhile, about 60 percent of moderate and conservative Latinos surveyed had a negative view of Clinton. “People simply just don’t like her,” said Ruth Guerra, a spokeswoman for American Action Network, a group that promotes Republicans, at a National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials panel on Tuesday. “So that gives Donald Trump another opportunity.” Trump surrogate and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) acknowledged at a Latino Coalition lunch on Wednesday that many people dislike the Republican candidate for president. He talked far more about Clinton’s deficiencies than Trump’s merits, and ended up making a comment similar to the “vote your conscience” statement that elicited boos for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) at the convention on Wednesday evening.“I’m not here today to make a hard political sell,” Christie said. “I am here to try to tell you the truth as I see it. You will make your judgment on who, in your heart, you believe is the best person to be the next president of the United States.”  The GOP convention speeches have largely mentioned Latino immigrants ― especially undocumented ones ― in negative terms. Multiple speeches on Monday night referenced undocumented immigrants who killed Americans. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) said immigrants are taking Americans’ jobs. There were a few more positive moments: Kentucky state Sen. Ralph Alvarado Jr. (R) delivered a prime-time speech Wednesday that praised Latino immigrants, including his parents, and he even spoke in Spanish. But Alvarado, like others, didn’t so much praise Trump as he criticize Clinton and President Barack Obama. “Americans face an important decision. Do we want someone who is brutally honest ― perhaps to a fault ― or do we want someone who is brutally dishonest?” he said. Another positive comment about Latino immigrants on the main stage came from Rachel Campos-Duffy, the wife of Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.), who mentioned her grandparents coming to the U.S. from Mexico during her speech on Monday. When her husband spoke at the Latino Coalition event on Wednesday, he also talked mostly about Clinton instead of Trump. Afterward, when The Huffington Post asked him why, he said he wouldn’t speak to HuffPost. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said Sunday that Trump would conduct a “Hispanic engagement tour” soon, although he gave few details of what that would entail. The RNC did not make a spokesman available for an interview, and the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.Bettina Inclán-Agen, who previously led Hispanic outreach for the RNC, said she hoped to see more Latino outreach from the Trump campaign and that she wants to support him ― but she’s just not there yet. “I’ve been very vocal with my reservations on the tone and the statements that he has said, and I hope that moving forward we see more of someone who wants to reach out to all voters and less of some of the conversations and topics that have unfortunately dominated the headlines,” she said. “I want to be proud to show my son what I do for a living.” Guerra’s departure from the RNC made headlines earlier this year, but she downplayed the idea that she left because of her opposition to Trump, saying instead that she was taking advantage of a good opportunity. But when HuffPost asked who she was planning to vote for in the fall, she just trailed off.“I’m not voting for Hillary, so...” she replied.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

Reportedly, several inside the company told internal investigators that they also had unsavory interactions with Ailes.

A few years ago, no single woman at Fox had that power.Ailes has denied all charges.“Gretchen Carlson’s extraordinary courage has caused a seismic shift in the media world,” her lawyers said in a statement Thursday afternoon. “We hope that all businesses now understand that women will no longer tolerate sexual harassment and reputable companies will no longer shield those who abuse women. We thank all the brave women who spoke out about this issue.”The message in the wake of Ailes’ stunning departure is clear: Women are a rising force in American culture. Sure, we’re still woefully underrepresented in the uppermost corners of power ― only a handful run the biggest public companies or hold Senate or board seats.

We’ve got one lady gunning for the Oval Office; another running the Federal Reserve. And even at a conservative television network that puts its female anchors at glass-topped desks so viewers can ogle their legs, women’s ascendancy cannot be tamped down. Comedian Samantha Bee puts it more succinctly: Twenty-five years ago, when a young woman named Anita Hill first brought the concept of sexual harassment to the country’s attention, accusing Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of some seriously offensive and inappropriate behavior, she was vilified as a “scorned woman” and an “erotomaniac,” the New Republic noted recently. That was a typical reaction. When a woman accused a powerful man of sexual harassment, she was ridiculed, called hysterical, and accused of being a lying, seductive vixen. Times have changed. Just ask Bill Cosby.“It’s a long way from the 1990s, when Anita Hill’s credible claims against Clarence Thomas and Paula Jones’s against Bill Clinton gained plenty of traction but left the powerful men in their top-of-the-world perches. No longer,” Margaret Sullivan wrote earlier this week in the Washington Post.Sex discrimination is still common in the workplace to be sure, but it’s not considered OK anymore ― especially if it’s brought to the public’s attention.Many credit Rupert Murdoch’s sons, Lachlan and James, who now run Fox’s parent company 21st Century Fox, for bringing Ailes to heel, but it’s not clear that his fall would’ve been as swift had the case been handled privately.“[Carlson] made her allegations public, which was rare,” Jennifer Berdahl, a professor at the Sauder School of Business at the University of British Columbia, told The Huffington Post. “She rallied sentiment. I think that pressured Fox. I don’t think Fox is more enlightened.”It’s also not clear yet if Ailes’ departure will spark a meaningful cultural shift at the network; several prominent anchors have come to his defense publicly. But his departure is a sign that women’s discrimination claims are now finally being taken seriously. “It’s great progress,” said Berdahl, who has systematically studied harassment and discrimination at many companies and organizations and serves as an expert witness in discrimination trials. “There’s a lot more normalization of women’s voices. Women are legitimate equals. Someone you take seriously.”Berdahl has been teaching MBA students for nearly 20 years and has noticed a real shift in how male business students think about sex discrimination.Even a decade ago, the subject was dismissed by her students. “There was definitely this attitude that this was was not a serious thing and you’re shrill to tell us these things,” she said. “Men would say openly, ‘Oh, I would never hire a mother, she would be unreliable.’ Those comments were common, or they would laugh when sex harassment was brought up.”Now more of Berdahl’s male students are dating women with careers and career aspirations ― and they’re on their girlfriends’ sides.Today, 40 percent of households are headed up by women, Berdahl noted.

Given the Trump campaign’s antics to this point, the theory was at least plausible. After all, who could forget that Donald Trump once posed as his own PR person so he could brag about how much the ladies loved him. (Trump has denied this, but... come on.)But as numerous reported accounts attest, the answer is no. McIver was present and mentioned during a 2007 interview of Donald Trump. She has co-authored some of Trump’s books, a fact that allowed the mogul to blame her for some of his exaggerations in a 2007 deposition.For any remaining skeptics, however, there is now additional hard evidence. Ancestry.com found McIver’s junior high school yearbook photo from 1962.Based on media reports that McIver hails from San Jose, California, the site found only one record of a person with that name in the Bay Area city.There is a resemblance with a widely circulated photograph of the adult McIver. And she acknowledged the photo as her own on Thursday, from her new (and unverified) Twitter account.Of course, the hardened conspiracy enthusiasts will never be satisfied. Apparently, some people now want to see McIver’s birth certificate.Remind you of anyone?Nick Wing contributed reporting."
31,IMPACT,Formerly Homeless Protest Sale Of Synthetic Pot In NYC,Krithika Varagur,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nyc-k2-protest_us_578e5529e4b0aad703ab4de0,Dozens of formerly homeless men protested the sale of the dangerous and unpredictable drug.,2016-07-21,"Members of the Doe Fund's Ready, Willing, & Able program protested K2 in Brooklyn's Bed-Stuy neighborhood on Thursday, July 14.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578e5b1a1900001e028a7048.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"New York City has been rattled by a surge in overdoses of synthetic marijuana, also known as K2 or spice. At least 130 people overdosed within three days this month from a particularly harmful batch of the drug, and were treated in hospital emergency rooms.Last Thursday, members of the Doe Fund, a homelessness nonprofit, held a march in Brooklyn to protest the sale of K2 in city bodegas and delis. “Local businesses that sell this drug are complicit in a public health crisis,” Alexander Horwitz, the Doe Fund’s Chief of Staff, told the Huffington Post. “We’re working with the NYPD to apply direct pressure on these retailers.”Most K2 sales occur in independent bodegas for as low as $1 per cigarette. The drug is manufactured in China and its effects include disorientation, hallucinations, and raised blood pressure, according to the NYC Department of Health. “The profit margins on this are so low that it’s incredibly selfish for store owners to contribute to the destruction of the very communities they serve,” Horwitz said.The sale of K2 has been illegal since October 2015, but one challenge with enforcing this is the fact that the drug’s chemical composition varies from batch to batch. The current law is worded in a way that refers to specific formulations of the drug, so vendors can circumvent it by claiming that the specific version they sell is not illegal. Sen. Chuck Schumer introduced a bill this week that would outlaw the drug in broader terms. The chemical variance within K2 also means that each batch affects users in unpredictable ways: that’s why so many people overdosed from the most recent “bad batch.” The approximately 50 men who showed up to the protest on Thursday were members of a DOE Fund program called Ready, Willing, and Able that helps transition homeless individuals into jobs and housing. Many of them have overcome drug abuse themselves, so they are particularly invested in this issue, Horwitz said. The protest was held in Brooklyn’s Bedford­-Stuyvesant neighborhood, near Big Boy Deli, one of the establishments that was raided one day earlier. The police did not find any K2 on-site during the raid. Horwitz said that customers showed up at the deli specifically asking for K2 during the protest.Reginald Scott, a Ready, Willing, and Able trainee who showed up to protest, suggested that people who were addicted to K2 seek help at the Doe Fund or a similar program.“These individuals on K2 can come to the program and do like I’m doing. They can get off the spice and come and work,” Scott said in a press release provided to HuffPost.Horwitz says the Doe Fund is planning several more protests in coming weeks. One priority going forward is opening a discussion with bodega and deli owners, which he said have been “unproductive” so far.“This drug preys on our city’s poorest and most vulnerable,” he said. “Almost exactly like the crack epidemic of the eighties. We don’t want history to repeat itself.”Correction: A previous version of this article stated 130 people died from a recent batch of K2."
32,SPORTS,Michael Bennett Might Be The NFL's Worst-Compensated Star,Jordan Schultz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michael-bennett-seahawks-contract_us_578d15d8e4b0fa896c3f776e,One of the league's most prolific defensive linemen is also its 27th highest-paid.,2016-07-21,"No 4-3 defensive ends in the NFL recorded more pressures (91) last year than Michael Bennett. Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll tells HuffPost: “I love the heck out of him.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578e4df61900004c038a7017.jpeg?cache=XKudu0p8VO&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Seattle Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett overcame the highest of odds. He went from undrafted free agent in 2009 ― meaning he wasn’t selected during the 256-pick draft ― to not only making a team and building an NFL career, but becoming a Pro Bowl Defensive MVP and Super Bowl champion.The problem now for Bennett is that he’s stuck in a contract that leaves him woefully underpaid. Bennett, 30, is a game-wrecker, a premium asset in today’s pass-happy NFL.“I just want to be fairly compensated with the top guys in the league,” Bennett tells The Huffington Post. “I’m definitely one of the top five defensive ends.”To understand his dominance, we must first understand how the former Texas A&M standout compares to his peers. Despite being the 27th highest-paid defensive lineman in the league, Bennett is, by nearly any measure, one of the five most productive. His 10 sacks in 2015 ranked 11th among all defensive ends, and his 24 quarterback hurries tied for sixth. As a reference point, three-time Defensive Player of the Year J.J. Watt tallied 26 QB hurries in the same period. Speaking of Watt, Bennett ranks second only to the Texan defensive end in total quarterback pressures (292) over the past four seasons, according to Pro Football Focus.Perhaps most telling, though, is the fact that no 4-3 defensive ends in the league recorded more pressures (91) last year than No. 72.The other notable aspect of Bennett’s game is his effectiveness at containing the run. Defensive end is a position known primarily for getting after the quarterback. Sacks and quarterback pressures are crucial. Stopping the run is not sexy, nor is it a common trait of defensive ends, even the good ones. But Bennett is different. Last season, per usual, he consistently played on all three downs, as opposed to only in predictable passing situations, a trait he has developed during his seven-year career. He’s had a top-10 run-stop percentage among 4-3 defense ends each of the past three years, as well.“Mike is probably one of the most versatile athletes in the National Football League,” said Michael Robinson, a former teammate of Bennett’s in Seattle and a current analyst for the NFL Network. “That’s what makes his contract situation pretty peculiar. He really may be the most underpaid defensive linemen in NFL history.”Robinson praised his former teammate’s ability to “play all five spots.”“He’s a damn good dude,” Robinson said. “He wanted a contract last year, but he still came to work. He’s a pro’s pro. Mike was always the best teammate... Mike is needed in that locker room and he should be paid like it.”For his part, Bennett says he’s “happy to see guys get paid.” But, he adds, “you definitely want to get what you think you’re worth. When you put all the things together, I just don’t see a lot of guys having the type of impact I have.”The Seahawks defense has benefited greatly from Bennett’s stellar play across the board. Widely considered the NFL’s most dominant, it led the league in scoring defense in 2016 for the fourth consecutive year. All the more reason things are frustrating for Bennett: The way NFL contracts are constructed, a player can be cut any time without a significant cap hit to the team.“It’s been super hard, because you want to be a great teammate and you want to take care of your family,” said Bennett, who is married with three daughters. “You want to find a balance.”The interesting part about the Seattle defense is that when it comes to the other stars, nobody else is underpaid. Quite the contrary, in fact. Safeties Earl Thomas and Kam Chancellor rank second and third at their respective positions. Linebacker Bobby Wagner is also second, while fellow linebacker K.J. Wright isn’t far behind. Richard Sherman has inked an excellent deal that makes him the fourth highest-paid cornerback in the league.Bennett is entering the third year of a four-year contact signed in March 2014 that pays him $28.5 million overall with $16 million guaranteed. He’s set to make $5.5 million this year and $7 million next year. These are, to be sure, enviable sums of money. But other players of similar ability and with comparable skill sets are getting paid much more, and the disparity is puzzling. Watt is paid $16.6 million a year, with a contract that stipulates $51.9 million guaranteed and $100 million overall. Olivier Vernon of the New York Giants just signed a deal to earn $17 million a year from a contract that pays $52.5 million guaranteed and $85 million overall. The Miami Dolphins’ Ndamukong Suh is paid $19 million a year with $59.95 million guaranteed and $114 million overall. (Drew Rosenhaus, Bennett’s former agent who negotiated his current contract, didn’t respond to a request for comment for this article.)Despite remarks to the contrary in May, Bennett could still opt to hold out of the Seahawks’ training camp, which begins July 30, in an effort to get a better deal.“It is never-ending,” Bennett says. “Especially when people are getting new contracts every day. You sit there and you’re like, ‘Damn, really?’ I’m just to the point where it’s kind of like, if you don’t think I’m valuable, then just get rid of me.”It’s not that the Seahawks operation doesn’t recognize Bennett’s prowess. But head coach Pete Carroll and his staff have a policy of not negotiating extensions with players who have two years or more remaining on their deals. The organization has been “very disciplined” in this regard, as Carroll points out.Still, if any Seahawk deserves to have an exception made for him, it’s Bennett. Nobody else is in quite the same position right now, creating so much value for the team while getting paid so disproportionately little.“Michael Bennett is an extraordinary individual and an extraordinary teammate,” Carroll told HuffPost. “I love the heck out of him... He’s not wrong. He’s right [to be frustrated].”To his credit, Bennett’s production the past two seasons has gone well beyond what his contract suggests. He has become an elite player at his position. And at 30, he’s keenly aware that this is likely his final major contract as an NFL player. It’s a fact that Carroll says he respects as well.“We’re gonna make an effort,” Carroll said. “An effort so he remains a Seahawk.”Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com or ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram at @Schultz_Report.

33,LATINO VOICES,George Takei Warns What A Trump Presidency Could Mean For America,Hilary Hanson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/george-takei-warns-what-a-trump-presidency-could-mean-for-america_us_57912ef1e4b00c9876ceb0ac,"“I still remember the day armed guards marched up our driveway with bayonets, ordering us out of our home.""",2016-07-21,George Takei said he wants Latinos to vote in full force against Trump so he doesn't become the next president. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5791313b2400002600b32694.jpeg?cache=iIkOuUbiYh&ops=crop_0_129_1987_1277%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Actor, activist and social media star George Takei is calling on his Latino fans to do all they can to prevent Donald Trump from being elected as the next U.S. president.In a Spanish-language video posted on Facebook Thursday, Takei — who noted many people probably didn’t know he spoke Spanish — used his Japanese-American background as a warning about what a Trump presidency could potentially bring for all Americans.Takei explained in the video that when he was a little boy, after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, the U.S. government infamously rounded up more than 100,000 people of Japanese ancestry living in the U.S. and forced them into internment camps. The racially motivated policy used misguided fears to convince the public that anyone of Japanese descent, even U.S. citizens, was a potential threat to national security.“I still remember the day armed guards marched up our driveway with bayonets, ordering us out of our home,” Takei said. “I remember my mother’s tears as we took with us only what we could carry, and lost all we had worked so hard for.”He explained that his family was first relocated to a horse stable at a racetrack, and they were later held prisoner at a camp for four years.Takei draws a parallel between that moment in U.S. history and the remarks that Trump has made about Mexicans today — referring to them as rapists and criminals and promising mass deportations of millions of undocumented immigrants.And, though, Trump has claimed to that he has no problem with those who’ve immigrated legally, his behavior has indicated that a clear-cut distinction doesn’t exist for him. As Takei pointed out, Trump once insisted that the Mexican-American federal judge, Gonzalo Curiel, who’s handling the Trump University lawsuits was “hostile” and would treat him unfairly, even though Curiel was born in Indiana. He’s also referred to the protestors who flew the Mexican flag at his rallies as “illegals” without evidence to support his claim. Takei concluded the video urging Latinos to register to vote, and in November to vote against Trump in full force.And though this video focused on Trump’s attitude towards Mexicans, Takei has previously drawn parallels between WWII U.S. policy towards the Japanese and Trump’s comments on Muslims.“You (Muslims) are now being vilified,” Takei said at the Muslim Public Affairs Council Media Awards in May. “You are now smelling that stench of irrational fear, and its very important that we all join our voices together as one and particularly for us as Japanese Americans who experienced the horror and devastation of imprisonment in our own countries that we share that experience and speak together with you.”Trump has previously called to ban all travel to the U.S. by Muslims and stated that he would not rule out a national database of Muslims.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar,rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

I wasn’t happy with how that turned out. I wasn’t necessarily proud of those words.”The vitriol hasn’t stopped Grand from being particularly cheeky (in some cases, literally) on his Instagram. After he posted a snapshot of himself wearing nothing but a Speedo, fans superimposed the image onto a variety of humorous backgrounds – on the moon, with a free-falling Madonna and alongside Jake Gyllenhaal in “Brokeback Mountain.” Grand re-shared the images, he said, because “we can all afford to laugh at ourselves sometimes.”Currently at work on a new album, Grand said fans can expect his sophomore effort to reflect both his “subtle sense of sarcasm” as well as his personal growth as a performer.“These last three years, I’ve really found out a lot about myself,” he said. “I think that there’s a great power to being unapologetically who we are.”"

37,ENTERTAINMENT,"When Plus-Size Women Are On Reality TV, Why Are They Always Models?",Jillian Capewell,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/when-plus-size-women-are-on-reality-tv-why-are-they-always-models_us_5790d612e4b0bdddc4d34e3d,Searching for actual body inclusivity amid the rose petals of dating TV shows.,2016-07-21,"""Curve model"" Ashley and her match B.T. on ""Coupled.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5790dd831300002d0005f223.jpeg?cache=xco3IA1K36&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"You can be highbrow. You can be lowbrow. But can you ever just be brow? Welcome to Middlebrow, a weekly examination of pop culture. Sign up to receive it in your inbox weekly.As a card-carrying member of Bachelor Nation, I have bought into the idea that dating on reality TV deals heavily in fantasy. Aside from the never-in-real-life premise of a 20- to 30-something guy or gal getting to choose between two dozen eligible romantic prospects, the ensuing love stories captured by the show are rife with helicopter rides, rose-petal-strewn private concerts, horse rides at sunset, etc.Anyone tuning in accepts the idea that everything on screen will bear more resemblance to the romance shelf at a bookstore than any actual dating experiences. Still: Why has it proven so difficult to allow body inclusivity in this fantasy world? The “Bachelor” franchise has long lacked diversity among its contestants. Most of them are fit, white and conventionally attractive. War veteran Jubilee Sharpe, who is black, made “Bachelor” history for lasting until Week 5 on Ben Higgins’ season, which kind of sums up the series’ race problems in a nutshell. The show, which has yet to cast a black lead, hinted at a more “diverse” Bachelorette to come after Higgins, and, uh, kind of delivered with JoJo Fletcher, who is half-Persian. (Caila Quinn, who is half-Filipina, was in the running for the position before producers decided JoJo’s story resonated more with fans.) “Coupled,” a new dating show on Fox, presents a more diverse — though still heteronormative — cast and somewhat ameliorates the stress-inducing model of 25-on-1 that the “Bachelor” shows typically follow. Men are helicoptered (and then boated) one at a time onto the island where 12 women wait. They each get some first-impression time with him before deciding whether to head back to the bungalows alone, or wait for him at a nearby bar. Of the women waiting at the bar, the guy selects two to accompany him to a private villa, where they see if their initial chemistry holds up. Among the women, I noted while watching the first few episodes, is Ashley, a “curve model.” She is, true to her profession, slightly more curvy than her fellow single women, but still well within what would commonly be considered “hot” in a sampling of Tinder users. Her presence reminded me of “Bachelor” contestant Bo Stanley, a plus-size model and former surfer who appeared for one brief episode on Chris Soules’ season. It appears that within the conventional reality-TV dating realm, one can be a little curvy as long as you’re white and so attractive that your actual profession is to be attractive. This brings us back to the fantasy point I mentioned earlier. Sure, TV is escapism, and reality TV, despite the word “reality” in its description, is the ultimate escape. It’s fun to watch pretty people join together and split apart in dramatic ways, all while giving us great crying shots during in-the-moment interviews. (Alex, a conservative radio personality on “Coupled,” is a beautiful ugly crier.) All of this begs the question: Why can’t fat people be part of that fantasy? We can look at the misguided flop that was the condescendingly named “More to Love,” which was basically “The Bachelor” for a plus-sized guy and his plus-sized ladies. It’s no wonder this misguided attempt at inclusivity lasted for just one season, as it implicitly sent the message that fat people can only date other fat people, that anyone over a certain size wasn’t qualified for “normal” dating shows and had to be othered over onto an underperforming television show that execs can now point to and exclaim, “See?! No one wants to watch that!” While discussing this topic, my co-worker mentioned she had looked at the “More to Love” Wikipedia page, pointing out that the contestants’ height and weight were listed. “In what world is that information relevant,” I chatted back. “In the ‘More to Love’ world, Jill,” she wrote. “In a world where I can look and be like, THIS DUDE JUST PICKED THE SMALLEST PLUS-SIZE GIRL AVAILABLE.”I wonder if I would have looked at my own love life differently if I saw someone who looked more like me being loved on television, if all women could breathe a little easier to see a wider range of body types on television, each of them just as worthy and lovable as the next, outside of a Dove commercial. It must be said that as a white woman, I generally see myself well-represented in media; these issues are compounded for women of color who aren’t a certain size or otherwise don’t have the typical dating-contestant “look.”I don’t wish for some “Kumbaya” movement where reality-TV daters have to shelve their natural attraction in the name of picking a “real” woman; I just want reality TV to acknowledge that people — any kind of person — can be attracted to fat people, without it being “brave” or “groundbreaking” or anything but totally normal. (Replace “fat” with “disabled” or “tattooed” or “genderqueer,” and the same idea holds up.)The internet, for all its faults, has at least provided a place for fat women to show that they feel attractive and loved, somehow still a radical act. There’s the amazing Lindy West, author of Shrill, who appeared on The Guardian with the headline, “My wedding was perfect — and I was fat as hell the whole time.” There’s Kristin Chirico of BuzzFeed, too, with the powerful essay, “My Boyfriend Loves Fat Women,” where she ruminates on the idea of fitting into her beau’s “type.”The difference, I realize, is that these two women are discussing lasting love, whereas the romantic connections on reality TV, by virtue of its format, are mostly made up of chemistry-fueled, sometimes short-lived, attraction. But I think television producers could be willing to try harder to marry what we already see on television with what we see IRL.Follow Jill Capewell on Twitter: @jcapejcape"

After all, why settle if you’re bound to win? Well, Trump’s flashy Las Vegas hotel apparently didn’t get the “no settling” memo from the Republican nominee. The Trump International Hotel ― a joint venture between Trump and casino magnate Phil Ruffin ― has agreed to settle charges that it retaliated against two hotel employees for union organizing. The hotel will shell out $11,200 in order to resolve the union-busting allegations, according to settlement documents from the National Labor Relations Board.Alma Zamarin, a food server at the property, said she was treated unfairly by management for years because she supported the union. She’ll receive $1,500 in pay as part of the agreement.“I finally have justice,” Zamarin said in a statement through the Culinary Workers Union, a local of Unite Here that represents 57,000 service workers, many of them on the Vegas strip. “I’m not done fighting to make my workplace better ― I will keep going until Donald Trump and his son, Eric Trump, sits down and negotiates a good contract with their employees.”Zamarin claimed she was denied a job transfer because of her union sympathies. Another worker, Michael Campus, said his hours were reduced for the same reason. Campus will be paid $9,700 under the agreement. If those amounts seem small, it’s because U.S. labor law does not allow workers to pursue damages if their union rights were violated ― they can only seek back wages and reinstatement on the job.The hotel also agreed to post a notice informing employees of their rights under the law.The settlement was part of an ongoing and ugly labor dispute at the Trump International. In December, housekeepers and other low-wage workers at the hotel voted to join the Culinary Workers Union, despite a lengthy anti-union campaign waged by the hotel. As The Huffington Post first reported earlier this month, Trump Ruffin LLC spent more than half a million dollars on consultants whose job is to convince workers to vote down the union. The union won the election anyway, by a vote of 238 to 209, and the NLRB board certified the results.But the hotel still hasn’t acknowledged the workers’ union or begun bargaining. Instead, it appealed to the NLRB asking that the election results be thrown out. Meanwhile, the general counsel for the board, who functions as a pseudo-prosecutor, issued a series of complaints against the hotel, accusing it of firing one employee, discriminating against another, and dangling benefits in front of workers to encourage them to vote down the union. Under U.S. law, it’s illegal to retaliate against workers for supporting a union, or to promise them rewards if they keep the workplace union-free. When workers feel their rights were violated, they can file so-called unfair labor practice charges against their employer, as the Trump International workers did. In this case, the board’s general counsel found enough merit in the workers’ claims to pursue charges against the hotel. The settlement resolves just one piece of the larger dispute.Unlike typical Republican presidential candidates, Trump is making a direct play for union votes, predicting that union members in general will support him over Hillary Clinton. The tussle in Vegas has undermined his claims that he gets along well with unions as a businessman and would better serve the interests of union members as president. Organized labor on the whole is campaigning hard against him.The culinary union has accused Trump International of stalling, saying the hotel should sit down with the workers and start bargaining a first contract. As Bethany Khan, a union spokeswoman, recently told HuffPost, “They’re running out of time and options to delay this.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

In a new interview with GQ, Beckham opened up about the dating rumors, explaining that they actually did more harm than good for his love life. “Whoever was there taking the pictures inside of a private party, inside of a privateer, private-er area of the house ― we were in the kitchen of the house, where there was only, like, 15 people.

Somebody that I think is pretty darn exciting. Somebody that speaks from the heart. Somebody that I think is connecting with the American people.”Priebus also denigrated political strategists and consultants who’ve backed more traditional candidates or suggested that Trump could not win.“And for all the experts that are out there, and there’s a lot of them – not me, but people like me that get on TV, and they tell you who’s going to be great, who’s not going to work,” Priebus said. “How have we been doing with these experts? Not good. Not good.”Trump was formally nominated as the Republicans’ candidate for president Tuesday and is scheduled to deliver his acceptance speech Thursday. Yet even as his supporters celebrated his win on the floor, entire state delegations that backed different candidates largely remained seated – evidence that the celebrity businessman’s bombastic style and relatively recent conversion to GOP politics have left a significant percentage of the party base uneasy with him.Priebus tried to reassure the delegates on Wednesday that Trump’s loud public persona is not who he really is.“I talk to Donald Trump, as you may know, many times a day about every topic you can imagine. ... I have never once taken the phone and said, ‘I can’t believe this guy.’ Not one time,” Priebus said. “He is a gracious, personable guy who, I will tell you, in private listens [and is] fairly quiet. And I just want you to be assured that he loves this party, he can’t wait to work with all of you, and I think that we’re not just going to win in November, but I think that we’re going to start a new direction for our party.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."
