4,POLITICS,Obama Shut Out Eric Holder From His Decision To Kill Bin Laden,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-eric-holder_us_56328b6fe4b0c66bae5bd098,And what that tells us about the decline of the government lawyer -- and the law itself -- in the context of national security.,2015-10-31,Not pictured in this iconic photo: the lawyers who laid the legal groundwork for the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in May 2011.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The law and the country's chief law enforcer no longer matter when it comes to legality of the war on terror.A handful of top government and military lawyers advised President Barack Obama on the legal complexities of killing Osama bin Laden. But the most powerful of them all, then-Attorney General Eric Holder, was left out of the deliberations.In a front-page story published on Thursday, The New York Times' Charlie Savage offered the untold account -- excerpted from an upcoming book on the Obama presidency's military policy -- of the top-secret discussions that laid the legal framework for the Navy SEAL raid that killed bin Laden in May 2011.Holder only found out about the deliberations a day before the raid, according to the Times. Thomas Donilon, a national security adviser to the president, seems to have made the unilateral call to exclude him.Weeks before the planned ambush, the four attorneys -- CIA General Counsel Stephen Preston, National Security Council legal adviser Mary DeRosa, Pentagon General Counsel Jeh Johnson and Joint Chiefs of Staff legal adviser James Crawford -- each worked on discrete legal memorandums targeting specific aspects of the operation.As options that would have resulted in more civilian casualties were ruled out, the lawyers eventually settled on a ""unitary military incursion"" -- the raid -- and reached the seemingly unanimous conclusion that there existed ""clear and ample authority for the use of lethal force under U.S. and international law,"" according to an unnamed official quoted in the story.But this by no means sounds like a detached assessment of the facts and the law. Rather, we're told the lawyers confronted the legality of a mission ""intending to kill bin Laden as its default option."" Once that was settled -- and behind Holder's back -- ""Obama later explicitly ordered the kill mission,"" according to officials.The lawyers also divvied up addressing the legal justifications for moving forward with the plan without telling Congress, for what to do if bin Laden was captured alive, and for a burial at sea -- all objectives that appear consistent with the work of specific departments and agencies with a vested interest in bin Laden's demise.Tellingly, Preston acknowledged the memos were needed ""because we may be called upon to explain our legal conclusions, particularly if the operation goes terribly badly,"" according to an official.But what if those very conclusions were manipulated to achieve the killing of bin Laden at all costs? Is that legal advice -- a neutral evaluation of the many potential factual scenarios and how the laws of war apply to them -- or pushing for a preordained outcome?""Military lawyers often play a tricky pre-combat role in clarifying the rules of engagement and applying the laws of war to particular targets,"" Harvard law professor Noah Feldman explained in a Bloomberg View column responding to the Times article. ""They need to be careful that they're actually applying the law -- not distorting it to achieve operational goals."" When you throw in the fact that Obama specifically shut out his top lawyer, Holder, and the Office of Legal Counsel -- the Department of Justice arm that advises the president on the legality of executive policy -- there's reason to believe that the four lawyers who engineered the mission had a clear mandate to make it legal.University of Chicago law professor Eric Posner, who has written extensively on international law, wondered whether freezing out ""the entire Justice Department"" was some sort of payback, especially since the Office of Legal Counsel had previously been ""less than cooperative when the White House sought a legal rubber stamp for the Libya intervention in 2011.""""Has the OLC been demoted for its insubordination?"" Posner asked.To veteran national security journalist Marcy Wheeler, the fact Holder was left out of deliberations was no different from the time ""Dick Cheney excluded John Ashcroft from key information about torture and wiretapping"" during the George W. Bush administration. Should Obama be held to a lesser standard because bin Laden is one of the least sympathetic targets in American history?As for the present state of DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel, Jack Goldsmith-- its former head under Bush who reportedly fought to disavow the administration's reviled ""torture memos"" -- offered the grim assessment that its relevance as an advisory body in national security matters is on the wane and may even be at its lowest point, even lower than during the Bush years.Why this matters in the grand scheme of national security law transcends the object of Obama's kill order.""No one's mourning for Bin Laden, and that's as it should be,"" wrote Feldman. ""But the rule of law is made of many discrete, small legal judgments. Distorting those judgments when the stakes are high perturbs the force field of legal justice. That should be a concern, regardless of how repulsive the victim.""CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the last name of the Office of Legal Counsel's former head. It's Goldsmith, not Goldstein."
5,POLITICS,White Nationalists Gather On Halloween To Discuss How Oppressed They Are,Samantha Lachman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/white-nationalists-conference_us_56353a69e4b063179912ab4b,"They're not racist, they just want a white ethno-state.",2015-10-31,"Speakers at the ""Become Who We Are"" conference talk with members of the media on Oct. 31, 2015, in Washington, D.C.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56353c36190000b100b9561e.jpeg?ops=crop_0_629_3264_1609%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The 150-plus white men who gathered on Halloween to discuss their shared European heritage and identity insisted they don’t think they’re better than other races. They’re simply different, they said. They’re “white advocates” and “identitarians.” “Racial idealists” or “racial communitarians.” The label “white supremacists,” to them, is a political “scare term” created by liberals and groups like the Southern Poverty Law Center to undercut “legitimate” white interests. The conference, called “Become Who We Are,” invited other white people to gain this race consciousness so their revolution can move off Twitter, blogs and online journals and into the mainstream. Discussion topics included ""The Origins of the White Man,"" ""The Tragedy of Southern Identity"" and ""Why We Will Win."" “There’s something radical about actually being public and talking about these views seriously,” said Richard Spencer, president of the National Policy Institute, which organized the conference. “There’s a tendency in our movement to embrace the fringe -- we want to be alienated from society, we want not to be taken seriously.""""We’re trying to make this a sensible position that all white people need to think about,"" he said.Nonetheless, conference attendees wore name tags that revealed only their first names.Spencer referenced the red pill in the movie ""The Matrix"" to suggest that white people were becoming “red pilled” -- awakened -- by their reality or lived experiences.“You can’t get away from this general tendency to delegitimize the white man,” he said. “We totally recognize the fact that our views are considered beyond the pale, or awful -- but we’ve got to start this way. The gay movement had to start at some point, Zionism had to start in the 19th century when that was considered a ridiculous, terrible notion.”Of course, this insistence that their views are based on genuine differences rather than a sense of superiority is undercut by the sort of rhetoric their community uses to describe traits they believe are inherent in other races or ethnicities. Jews are manipulative. African Americans are lazy or violent. Latinos are free-riders who are stealing American jobs. Etcetera. This reporter, who is Jewish, was one of three journalists who attended a conference session open to the press at the National Press Club in the heart of Washington. A sentiment among the event’s speakers and attendees is that Jews have rigged the American political system to encourage more open immigration policies, so they can bond together with other minorities and subjugate Americans of European ancestry.But Jews, they said, have maintained a cohesive identity, and there’s much to admire about that.“The Jews exist precisely because they were apart, precisely because they had, maybe you could say, a bit of paranoia about trying to stay away -- please don’t quote paranoia,” Spencer said.Most Jews would respond that they were forced into ghettos in Europe because of anti-Semitism. The conference’s participants think it’s the reverse: Anti-Semitism arose because Jews evolved separately and achieved economic and political success that has, understandably, inspired envy. It’s a chicken and egg non-dispute we’re not going to resolve here.Regardless, conference speakers agreed that white nationalists could learn quite a bit from the Jews.“The opposition to intermarriage. The creation of their own state. The recreation of their language. This is the greatest triumph of racial idealism in history. All we’re asking for is equality. The same right that Jews claim for themselves,” said Sam Dickson, an attorney who advocates for breaking up the United States to create a white ethno-state. (Dickson has represented the Ku Klux Klan in court.)Dickson suggested that white people “could give” black people Massachusetts and New York -- “blacks could be given Manhattan” -- while whites would take states like Iowa. He said the white ethno-state of his imagination would be open to all whites, liberals and conservatives alike.""White people, as we’ve become a minority, will not be able to live in a state of severe repression and discrimination,” he said. “Our ethno-state will not be a meeting of the Tea Party; it’s not going to be the Southern Baptist Convention. It’s going to be a genuine ethno-state with Christians, Catholics, alcoholics, teetotallers, gay people -- it’s not going to be a subset of the right.”This ethno-state won’t happen without a revolution of thinking among whites, however. And this revolution won’t happen within the bounds of American politics. But having a Republican presidential candidate like businessman Donald Trump talk about deporting millions of immigrants and repealing birthright citizenship is a start.“He’s certainly saying things on immigration that we haven’t heard from a mainstream candidate in a very long time,” said Kevin MacDonald, a former professor at California State University, Long Beach, who his fellow speakers describe as the preeminent authority on how Jews intentionally cultivated superior intellectual capabilities in order to better compete for resources.“That’s absolutely a breakthrough -- and he’s been excoriated for it,"" MacDonald continued. ""So I think he is seen by people like us as a possible home"" -- though he may not achieve his goals on immigration. ""It’s not that we even believe that he will necessarily do it but it’s not like we have other choices, either,"" MacDonald said.There were only about 12 or so women at the conference, which is perhaps understandable given that white nationalists on Twitter want to #BringBackThePatriarchy and force women back in the kitchen, 1950s style.“Any radical movement is mostly staffed by males,” Dickson said. “Women are by nature conformist, they give more obedience to authority, they’re more involved with family and children, they have to be more worried than we are about damage to the family. In any movement for reform, whatever it be, men always dominate.”Despite its timing, none of the conference’s attendees wore costumes. They were frightening enough dressed as themselves.Related on HuffPost:"
6,POLITICS,Campaigns Consider Dramatic Changes To The GOP Debates,"Sam Stein, Scott Conroy, and Michael Calderone",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/campaigns-gop-debates-changes_us_5633f5e4e4b06317991291aa,Proposals include drawing straws and gaining veto power over who moderates.,2015-10-31,"The GOP frontrunners, Donald Trump and Ben Carson, hold heavy sway over what changes will be made to the Republican presidential debates.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5633f737190000b100b955e4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Republican presidential candidates will meet Sunday night to chart changes they want to the presidential debates amid mounting criticism of what many of the campaigns say has been an unwieldy and unfair process.The meeting follows the Republican National Committee’s decision on Friday to suspend its debate partnership with NBC News, in response to claims that CNBC moderators mistreated its candidates at Wednesday night’s forum. Sunday's gathering has being described by sources on campaigns and at the RNC as an opportunity to produce reforms that the committee could then present to networks still scheduled to host debates.Spearheaded by the campaigns of Dr. Ben Carson and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, the process has been haphazard. As of late Friday afternoon, one top campaign official said they had not yet settled on a place to meet in Washington. And it remained unclear if an official from the RNC would be allowed to attend.""Some of the candidates are interested in pursuing the idea of seeing if there is additional common ground that the RNC can advocate for,"" said Sean Spicer, a top RNC official.Regardless of who attends, finding commonality may prove exceedingly difficult.Being considered is a proposal to split the 14-candidate Republican field into two equal-sized debates, with candidates drawing straws to determine who competes in each. The proposal is being pushed by campaign representatives of Jindal and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who would naturally benefit from the even distribution. Both men have been relegated to the ""undercard"" debates, which have a far smaller audience than the main-stage events, and a kiddie-table stigma.In the past, top-tier candidates have resisted the idea. And there was pushback when it was proposed to the campaigns immediately after the CNBC debate, including from middle-tier candidates like Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.). ""They all are worried that they won't be on the stage with Trump,"" said one top campaign official, in reference to the audience the business mogul draws.However, antipathy for the existing format is running so high that even some of the top-tier campaigns are sounding amenable to the idea.“We're listening,” a senior official with a higher-polling candidate, who has been featured in each prime-time debate, told HuffPost. “About time we trim the stage down from 10, and that's one way.”Among the other possibilities that have been discussed is getting rid of the undercard debate altogether and inviting all 14 qualifying GOP candidates to appear on stage at the same time. This idea, however, was quickly cast aside as likely only to worsen the current predicament.Another proposal being batted around is to provide candidates with several minutes for opening statements. But because the campaigns of Carson and Trump insist that the debates go no longer than two hours, this would severely cut into time spent on question and answers.In addition to format overhauls, campaigns are debating reforms on the margins. According to a high-ranking campaign source, several campaigns have requested getting veto power over who moderates the debates.Campaigns are also proposing a system in which during every commercial break, the moderator would be handed a listing of the amount of time allotted to each candidate in the preceding segment. The next question would then go to the candidate who got the least amount of time up to that point.""We want to prevent another disaster from occurring, where the moderators become the story,"" said Hogan Gidley, a senior adviser to former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee's campaign. Gidley was not advocating any specific proposal. ""We are going to decide what the rules are and then agree before we step foot on the debate stage.""The meeting on Sunday will bring to a head a crisis that has been building for months. Campaign backlash against the RNC was inevitable, given that party leaders took much firmer control over the debate process this election cycle after the 20-debate circus of 2012 was deemed too chaotic. In January, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus announced plans for nine scheduled debates and named network sponsors. The RNC mandated some networks, such as CNN, needed to have a conservative media partner, while others, such as Fox News, Fox Business and CNBC, did not.This criteria was established to assuage long-running Republican gripes that major media outlets can’t be trusted to be fair to the party's presidential candidates on stage.CNBC, with its pro-business slant, wasn't expected to be a controversial choice. But the forum on Wednesday proved to be problematic from the get-go. The campaigns complained that the questions veered away from economic policy and into personal matters. They also were aggrieved over the distribution of time between the candidates. One campaign official said an RNC aide had claimed to have an algorithm to ensure equity of time. ""Which is ridiculous,"" said the official. ""You don't need an algorithm. You need a stopwatch.""Priebus got out in front of the criticism on Wednesday night as the candidates cleared the debate stage, calling out CNBC's moderators for doing ""a disservice to their network, our candidates, and voters."" A top Republican official told The Huffington Post that Priebus called many campaigns -- though not all -- to ensure that he had their support in suspending the next debate with NBC. And when he met no pushback, he sent Friday's letter to NBC News chairman Andy Lack, saying that CNBC conducted the debate “in bad faith.”The RNC still intends to hold a debate on Feb. 26, even if NBC and sister network Telemundo -- the only Spanish-language partner in the Republican debate schedule -- are no longer involved. Priebus wrote that National Review, the conservative media partner for the debate, remains part of the event.National Review editor Rich Lowry did not respond to a request for comment on the RNC’s decision.The RNC’s move to penalize NBC puts the networks hosting the six remaining Republican debates -- ABC News, CBS News, CNN, Fox News and Fox Business -- in a tricky position.The TV networks can continue debate preparations as planned, but run the risk of looking weak in not pushing back against a political party abruptly deciding fellow broadcasters aren't fit to host a debate. Even competitive news organizations, at times, have acted collectively after one is sidelined over claims of unfair coverage. For instance, network bureau chiefs banded together in 2009 to defend Fox News as the White House attempted to freeze out the network. The following year, the White House Correspondents Association gave Fox News a front-row seat in the briefing room.So far, the networks haven’t rushed to show solidarity. Representatives from CNN, CBS News, and ABC News declined to comment. A Fox News representative did not immediately respond. Beyond competition, rival networks may be hesitant to stand up for CNBC, given how poorly the debate was conducted. Even within 30 Rock, the event was viewed as everything from a missed opportunity to challenge candidates on substantive economic issues to an outright disaster. There’s now frustration within NBC over being penalized for CNBC’s errors, according to network sources, especially when many believe NBC’s political team would’ve done a better job conducting the debate if given editorial control.NBC, officially, holds out hope that an agreement can be reached with the party and the now-suspended debate won’t be canceled.“This is a disappointing development,” NBC said in a statement Friday. “However, along with our debate broadcast partners at Telemundo we will work in good faith to resolve this matter with the Republican Party.”Also on HuffPost:"

""They need to know that even if they suffer from something serious, this does not cancel their whole life -- they still have a right to work, to education, to their family.""Health services in Greece have suffered repeated budget cuts during the years of financial crisis. The care of patients with mental health disorders is among the hardest-hit fields.Against this grim background, the nonprofit Social Psychiatry and Mental Health Scientific Association launched a pilot program to protect and promote the rights of those with mental health disorders. Over three months ago, the association opened Greece's first office dedicated to advising mental health patients on legal issues.""When people first saw our promotional spot on TV, everyone called,"" Darmogianni said. ""So, in the beginning we had to make clear what mental health advocacy is all about.""The advocacy office consists of lawyers and clinical psychologists, as well as a social worker, who mainly offer legal assistance to people who have been diagnosed with mental health disorders and their caretakers. They handle cases ranging from property and insurance rights to ""judicial protection"" for those who can't represent themselves in court. One of their main challenges is to decide whether those people are in a position to pursue legal action or need clinical treatment first. The group also provides assistance to mental health professionals.The project is supported by two nongovernmental organizations, the Hellenic National Commission for Human Rights and the Mental Health Institute for Children and Adults. It is funded by European Economic Area Grants under the mantle of the We Are All Citizens program.According to a survey by the University of Ioannina, anxiety and depression are on the rise in Greece. Some 1 in 6 Greeks between the ages of 18 and 70 has developed some kind of mental disorder, and 1 in 12 have a serious mental disorder. Perhaps the most shocking finding is that 75 percent of those in need of treatment never receive it. Mental illness remains a stigmatized topic in the country, and patients are marginalized.Darmogianni said that the problems in mental health services had been brewing long before the financial crisis. ""In Greece, the so-called psychiatric reform did not happen properly in the last 30 years,"" she said, referring to policies to de-institutionalize mental health patients and facilitate social integration by moving care from hospitals to community centers.Vlassis Tomaras, associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Athens and head of an independent committee that advises the Ministry of Health on mental health issues, said that reform has been obstructed by such factors as a lack of psychiatric units in general-care hospitals, a lack of oversight of private and public facilities, a shortage of community mental health centers, and a range of administrative obstacles. He said that the main problems are structural, not financial, but that the economic crisis has forced many patients away from private psychiatrists and into public institutions.Those public health facilities have been severely strained by the continuous budget cuts. According to Antonis Sakellaris, special adviser to the minister of health, existing institutions are understaffed and overcrowded, and there are no resources to build new facilities or train more personnel.Some of the patients who have fallen through the cracks end up at the advocacy office. Darmogianni gave the example of a woman who used to see a psychiatrist in private practice but can no longer afford the visits. Now she doesn’t know how to get her medications. “We help people find and access suitable mental health structures in situations like this,” Darmogianni said. In the first three months alone, as people poured in looking for help, the advocacy office took on 100 cases.“It turns out the needs are bigger than we thought,” said Alexandros Lountzis, a lawyer and coordinator for the office.The program’s limited timespan ― it’s scheduled to end in April 2016 ― affects the kinds of cases it is able to accept. For complex problems like violations of medical confidentiality or involuntary hospitalization, it usually refers clients to the services of the Greek Ombudsman, an independent public authority that looks into complaints from individuals who have been failed by the government.“We cannot take a case when we know the trial will probably take place in three years, as is so often the case with Greek courts. This program only runs until next April,” Lountzis explained.It’s striking how common some of these violations are. “Sixty percent of all incidents of hospitalization in public mental health hospitals are involuntary, ordered by the prosecutor, while the average percentage in EU countries does not exceed 9 percent,” Lountzis said.Before its time is up, the office aims to publish a concise guide to the rights of mental health patients, with practical advice on legal issues and services, and to organize a series of seminars to educate lawyers, judges, police officers and others.“If any of this helps people get a little closer to the issues of mental health patients, then we would be somewhat pleased,” Lountzis said. The office hopes that by April 2016, the Greek government will recognize the need to extend its services permanently. “Unless there is someone who believes that these problems will miraculously cease to exist next year,” Lountzis said.Related stories on The WorldPost:"

Today, we speak with Turkish novelist and essayist Kaya Genc.Turkish citizens will head to the polls on Sunday to vote in the nation's second election of 2015. The vote takes place just weeks after the worst terror attack in Turkey's history, when deadly bombings blamed on the Islamic State group killed at least 95 people at an opposition rally in October.Along with the bombings, renewed fighting between Turkey's government and Kurdish PKK militants means that security concerns have taken center stage in the elections.Yet Turkey is facing a host of other, crucial challenges, including an economy that has been flagging for years and tensions over poverty and inequality. While analysts and observers predict how the election will affect President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his AK Party's hold on the country, they may be missing the nuance of what the elections mean to the average Turk.The WorldPost spoke with Istanbul-based novelist and essayist Kaya Genc to learn about his perspective on the upcoming vote. In a recent op-ed for Al Jazeera, ""Poverty in Orhan Pamuk's Turkey,"" Genc argued that Sunday's snap election provides the perfect opportunity to discuss acute income inequality in Turkey -- and explained how literature plays a role in publicly addressing the country's social challenges. You write that that inequality has become a major challenge in Turkey. What difficulties does the country face in that regard? In the first decade of this century, Turkey witnessed an economic boom: This meant more opportunities and jobs for the poor. The boom did little to increase things like worker rights or the number of memberships to worker unions; on the contrary, the more job opportunities we had, the more open to exploitation the market had become.Incomes of the poor increased, but in an unequal way. Mevlut, the protagonist of Orhan Pamuk's latest novel, A Strangeness in My Mind, experiences this inequality acutely -- he rises in society economically, but people who came to Istanbul with him during the same years rise more quickly than he does, because they are more ambitious and care less about things like religion, personal ethics or public morals. So inequality is a byproduct of Turkey's economic boom and should be considered alongside the economic conditions in which it appeared. Is inequality a topic Turks frequently discuss, despite its absence from politicians' political platforms? I think people here care about their economic situation more than anything else in the world. The problem is, they don't articulate this interest in economy in the public sphere. All we get from politicians is words on ""the clash of life styles in Turkey"" or promises like ""destroying the backwardness of Turkish people."" By this, politicians often mean a forced change in people's lifestyles. I think, in the final weeks of this election, we started hearing more about the economy, which is a positive sign; both Republican and Conservative parties made concrete, detailed economic promises. We will see whether they will be able to keep them if they win the elections. How are novelists in the country helping to shed light on this issue?Latife Tekin had produced an aesthetically daring fictional world based on the lives of the poor in her Berji Kristin: Tales from the Garbage Hills, which has an excellent English edition published by Marion Boyars. Tekin's style is very poetic and presents the world of the poor as something aesthetically fascinating, rather than as some horrid space one should escape from as soon as possible. In Orhan Pamuk's A Strangeness in My Mind, the approach towards the lives of the urban poor is more realistic, and Pamuk can be said to have produced an almost Marxist analysis of the material conditions of the poor. His fiction sheds light on the business networks between the urban poor, which have long been invisible for Turkey's middle class fiction readers. The accustomed way of telling stories here had been through the perspective of upper-middle-class intellectuals, civil servants, those with public functions whose job it is to ""save the poor from themselves,"" ""enlighten"" and ""educate"" them. We are currently seeing a reversal of this perspective, with new books written in the voice of the poor, where civil servants and the rich sections of the society are seen under a new and less-flattering light. What’s one major thing the media misses in its coverage of Turkey’s politics and this election cycle? Turkish media is fascinated by the international media, and how they represent Turkey's reality in their television coverage or op-ed pages. It is very meta: The main concern here is whether Turkey is ""represented truthfully"" abroad. From fulfilling basic journalistic functions like fact-checking to more broader issues like editorial integrity, the standards of the press here is in a sad shape.Turkish media is more concerned about how The Economist newspaper in London views the elections in Turkey and what an editor in her Manhattan office thinks about Turkey, than about what people in Turkey's poor neighborhoods may be feeling and thinking. This goes hand-in-hand with a demonization of Turkey's working classes. Columnists represent the poor as empty-headed people scratching their ugly bellies, suffering from malnutrition.In the early years of the republic, the rural poor used to be represented as cockroaches, ignorant creatures that had to be reformed by the state apparatus by all means. Like ""chavs"" in British culture, about which Owen Jones wrote an excellent analysis, Turkey's working classes are looked down upon and seen as a problem that needs fixing in the future by enforcers of enlightenment and modernity.

Russia’s transport minister dismissed that claim as not credible.Almost everyone on board the Airbus-A321-200 operated by the Moscow-based Metrojet airline was Russian; Ukraine said four of its citizens were passengers. Russian officials did not give a specific breakdown of the 217 passengers’ ages and genders, but said 25 were children. There were seven crew members.A civil aviation ministry statement said the plane’s wreckage was found in the Hassana area some 70 kilometers (44 miles) south of the city of el-Arish, in the general area of northern Sinai where Egyptian security forces have for years battled local Islamic militants who in recent months claimed allegiance to the Islamic State group.The ministry said the plane took off from the resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh shortly before 6 a.m. for St. Petersburg in Russia and disappeared from radar screens 23 minutes after takeoff. Egyptian Prime Minister Sherif Ismail toured the crash site and later told a Cairo news conference that 129 bodies had been recovered.Photos from the site released by his office showed the badly damaged sky blue tail of the aircraft, with the Metrojet logo still visible. In the background, heaps of smoldering debris dotted the barren terrain.One photo showed a member of the search team holding the flight recorder, or black box, which Ismail said would be scrutinized as investigators try to determine what caused the crash. Russian investigators were expected to arrive in Egypt on Sunday.Natalya Trukhacheva, identified as the wife of co-pilot Sergei Trukachev, said in an interview with Russian state-controlled NTV that her husband had complained about the plane's condition.She said a daughter ""called him up before he flew out. He complained before the flight that the technical condition of the aircraft left much to be desired.""One Egyptian official, Ayman al-Muqadem of the government's Aviation Incidents Committee, said that before the plane lost contact with air traffic controllers, the pilot had radioed and said the aircraft was experiencing technical problems and that he intended to try and land at the nearest airport.It was impossible to independently confirm whether technical problems were to blame, and no other Egyptian official repeated the claim on Saturday.In a statement on its website, Metrojet said the A321-200 aircraft was in good shape and that the pilot was experienced. It identified the captain as Valery Nemov and said he had 12,000 hours of flying experience, including 3,860 in A321s.Russian Transport Minister Maxim Sokolov said officials from Moscow and Cairo were in touch over the incident. The Egyptian officials, he said, had not confirmed the claim by Islamic State militants who said they ""brought down a Russian plane over Sinai state with more than 220 Russian crusaders on board."" The militant group did not provide any evidence to back up its claim.""Based on our contacts with the Egyptian side, the information that the airplane was shot down must not be considered reliable,"" Sokolov said, according to a report by the Interfax news agency.An English-language statement issued by the office of Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi spoke of Russian leader Vladimir Putin commending the efforts made by authorities in Egypt ""to uncover the circumstances surrounding the incident.""Militants in northern Sinai have not to date shot down commercial airliners or fighter jets. There have been media reports that they have acquired Russian shoulder-fired, anti-aircraft missiles. But these types of missiles can only be effective against low-flying aircraft or helicopters. The Russian airliner was cruising at 31,000 feet when it lost contact with air traffic controllers, according to Egyptian aviation officials.In January 2014, Sinai-based militants claimed to have shot down a military helicopter; Egyptian officials at the time acknowledged the helicopter had crashed, but gave no reason.But two major European airlines — Germany's Lufthansa and Air France — were not taking any chances. Both announced Saturday they would immediately stop flying over Egypt's Sinai Peninsula for safety reasons until the cause of the crash was determined. Their aircraft would take alternate routes to reach destinations in the region.Spokeswomen for the airlines spoke anonymously in line with their respective companies' regulations.Egypt's foreign minister, Sameh Shukri, warned ""foreign"" countries that he did not identify against taking measures that reflect speculations on the cause of the crash. ""That will impact the Egyptian economy and lead to damages. These nations must consider this as well as their relations with Egypt,"" he said.Friends and relatives of the crash victims were gathering Saturday at a hotel near St. Petersburg's Pulkovo airport. Psychologists were meeting with them in a large conference room off the lobby and police kept journalists away. Some left the room occasionally, looking drawn with tear-stained faces.Yulia Zaitseva was one of them. She said her friends, newlyweds Elena Rodina and Alexander Krotov, were on the flight. Both were 33. Zaitseva said Rodina, her friend for 20 years, ""really wanted to go to Egypt, though I told her, 'Why the hell do you want to go to Egypt?'""""She was a very good friend who was ready to give everything to other people. To lose such a friend is like having your hand cut off,"" Zaitseva said, adding that Rodina's parents feel ""like their lives are over.""Russian airlines became infamous for poor safety in the early years following the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, which caused severe financial troubles and regulatory disorder. Although accidents have diminished in recent years, crashes persist, many of them blamed on human error.According to Russian news agencies, the flight was chartered by the St. Petersburg-based Brisco tour company. The plane was made in 1997 and has since 2012 been operated by Metrojet.Officers from Russia's top investigative body raided the offices of Metrojet and Brisco on Saturday, searching the premises and questioning employees. Investigative Committee spokesman Vladimir Markin said agents also took samples of fuel from the airport in the Russian city of Samara where the plane stopped Friday before heading to Sharm el-Sheikh, where it had overnighted.Roughly three million Russian tourists, or nearly a third of all visitors in 2014, come to Egypt every year, mostly to Red Sea resorts in Sinai or in mainland Egypt.""It is too premature to detect the impact this will have on tourism. We need to know what happened first,"" Tourism Ministry spokeswoman Rasha Azazi told The Associated Press.There was no sign of anything unusual at Sharm el-Sheikh's airport just hours after news of the disaster broke. Hundreds of vacationers, mostly from Europe and the Middle East, were arriving and departing. Flights in the afternoon were leaving at the rate of four to five per hour, with lines for international check-in spilling out the main gates.Pavel Moroz, a 30-year-old engineer from Moscow, arrived in Sharm el-Sheikh on Saturday afternoon on a Metrojet flight. He plans to stay for a week to take a scuba diving course.""We heard the news a few hours before leaving and thought for a bit about canceling our trip, but then decided to go anyway and everything was fine,"" he said as he left the airport."

12,RELIGION,Pulitzer-Winning Dance Critic On How To Live And Move With Grace,"Cathy Lynn Grossman, Religion News Service",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sarah-kaufman-art-of-grace_us_563113b6e4b0c66bae5a9234,Dance critic Sarah Kaufman's new book studies people who have lived with grace -- from Cary Grant to Barack Obama.,2015-10-31,“Art of Grace” by Sarah L. Kaufman. Photo courtesy,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5631152f1c00006f00570d56.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON (RNS) Sarah Kaufman, the Pulitzer Prize-winning dance critic for The Washington Post, has long written about movement — what we tell each other with our posture, our motion, our eyes and our ways of relating to each other, body and soul.Her first book, “The Art of Grace: On Moving Well Through Life,” is both joyful and directive, a celebrity-packed collection of observations and a manual for easing anyone’s way through the world.It’s a book with a message, delivered with calm command.She wants us to stand tall. Stand tall like Cary Grant, who, with a simple glance, a shoulder twitch or an acrobatic dive, could take an audience to another emotional plane. Like Nelson Mandela, with “joyful equanimity.”She wants us to move.Move like Lynn Swann, the Hall of Fame NFL receiver whose balletic leaps and twisting runs mesmerized fans and frustrated gridiron foes.Move like rock show roadies orchestrating the stage light setup in a stadium or flame-defying cooks in a restaurant kitchen — in silent symphonies of coordinated movements. Celebrity chef Thomas Keller had his French Laundry waitstaff trained in the baroque minuet, to perfect their attentive spirit.Move like Michelle Obama “mom-dancing” with Jimmy Fallon, bringing a snap and hip-roll of unabashed delight, or Obama’s friend Beyoncé, with velocity on stage and an “anti-diva” persona offstage.Heads up. Kaufman wants to see our eyes — and, through them, our hearts. There, she hopes to see grace, “a quality that engenders love,” a rabbi told her.The book, on sale Nov. 2, begins with Grant, a man who epitomized grace.Kaufman was going to write about movement in the movies and the first one she looked at was “The Philadelphia Story,” with Grant playing against the redoubtable Katharine Hepburn. Every look, every turn, every move by Grant, a vaudeville acrobat in his British youth, advances the story.“The more I learned about Grant, the more I wanted to explore what makes someone live with grace. He had outer grace but more importantly, he had inner grace. He was generous, humble and courageous,” said Kaufman, sitting in a cafe near her office for an interview.For someone with the professional title “dance critic,” you might expect her book to feature more dancers, whose art demands discipline, self-sacrifice, harmony and balance.There are few — and not always because of their performance talent on stage. Kaufman looks to Margot Fonteyn. She was the personification of “serene self-possession” on stage, couture elegance offstage and tireless duty to support and nurse her invalid husband.Kaufman spent three years looking for people who live with open hearts, open arms, open minds and an insistent dignity to what they do, from rearing children to governing nations.“The Art of Grace” reaches back to an ancient Egyptian’s hieroglyphic notes to his son on living well, to the three Graces of classical art — charm, beauty and ease — dancing hand in hand in Botticelli’s “Primavera,” to modern times.There are chapters devoted to athletes (shoutout to the elegant moves of Swiss tennis player Roger Federer), entertainers (Jackie Gleason gallivants across a page), more movie stars (including Jennifer Lawrence’s Oscars trip-up, and charming recovery), service workers and politicians.If grace is the unmerited gift of love or forgiveness or simple delight that we offer each other in our best moments, then Kaufman went looking for “amazing moments of connection, stunning kindness and movement that carries you along.”This is “not a dance book,” she says. It’s a book about life. It even concludes with 10 simple tips — most directed at how we treat each other.“At the heart of grace is ease. Defying gravity, smoothing your actions, reducing friction. Releasing your gifts to the world. Lightening the burdens of others,” she writes. It takes practice.“The fashion of the times is to be very self-involved,” said Kaufman, 52, glancing out the cafe window at passers-by, heads down, staring at their cellphones.“We’re all driven to extend our brand. We are photo-bombing. We are posting our GIFs and our memes. Instead, we should look up and let others delight us,” said Kaufman, a small, wiry woman with ballet-trained posture and large, happy eyes. She watches people, from waiters to Washington elites.Consider Barack Obama. Her book describes him loping onto the public stage in the 2008 campaign, fluid and easy. But the weight of seven years in office has changed his stance, his walk, his eye contact.“He’s become more strained, more aloof, more distant — and less graceful,” Kaufman wrItes. The manuscript had already gone to print when the president took to the pulpit in Charleston, S.C., to lead the mourning for nine people murdered in a black church Bible study.That day, giving a sermon about the nature of grace as the unmerited gift of God’s love and forgiveness, he leaned forward and softly began to croon “Amazing Grace.”Kaufman called it “the greatest speech of his presidency, and a courageous act. That whole experience was incredibly graceful. He wove together what is essential in a good person or a good commander in chief or a good nation — generosity, sacrifice and working toward something greater than ourselves.”Also On HuffPost:"
13,POLITICS,Your State And Local Elections Are Now A Super PAC Playground,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2015-elections-super-pac_us_5633d165e4b0c66bae5c7bbb,Don't underestimate the importance of super PAC money in local elections this year.,2015-10-31,"Sen. David Vitter (R-La.), a candidate for Louisiana governor, is one of the biggest recipients of super PAC support for state, city and local elections in 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5633d701190000a600b955b4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The influence of billionaires in the post-Citizens United era is in no way limited to the 2016 presidential and congressional elections. While the super-wealthy dominate those races, local and state elections in 2015 are also attracting big money from Forbes-listed billionaires and local wealthy interests that's funneled through super PACs.Not all states, cities and municipalities hold elections on even-numbered years. On Nov. 3, voters in Kentucky and Mississippi will hold gubernatorial and legislative elections, and voters in New Jersey and Virginia will vote on legislative candidates. Louisiana held its pre-runoff election for governor and many other down-ballot races on Oct. 24, and will hold a runoff on Nov. 21. Many other cities and municipalities have held or will hold elections this year, including Chicago, Philadelphia, Nashville and Dallas, among many others.Super PACs and nonprofits -- in some cases connected to a single candidate -- have taken on a dominant role in many of these elections. Super PAC spending on state and local elections often has more of a direct influence on government than spending on the more talked-about 2016 presidential election. In many cases, donations to these unlimited money groups come from developers, contractors and special interest groups looking to gain special favors from their local government.“When you look at smaller races, the relative importance of outside spending increases, both in terms of outcome of election and influencing policy,” said Rick Hasen, a University of California, Irvine law professor and author of the forthcoming Plutocrats United: Campaign Money, the Supreme Court, and the Distortion of American Elections.Super PACs emerged after the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision opened the door to unlimited donations from corporations, unions and -- following a related lower court ruling -- wealthy individuals, so long as they remain independent of candidates. The court's belief in such independence has not, however, played out in the real world.Super PACs are spending the most on the two hotly contested gubernatorial races in Kentucky and Louisiana. Some groups raising unlimited sums for Kentucky’s gubernatorial race, including the ones involved only in the primary election, have collected more than $14 million. Those involved in Louisiana’s election have pulled in more than $16 million.The key role of super PACs in off-year gubernatorial races became clear in 2013, when Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) launched the Fund for Louisiana’s Future, a super PAC to support either his Senate re-election or a run for governor. Vitter opted for the latter, coming in second in Louisiana's Oct. 24 gubernatorial election. He's now advancing to a Nov. 21 runoff against the top finisher, Democrat John Bel Edwards, and well-funded interests have donated significant sums to his super PAC. Cheniere Energy donated $125,000 to Vitter’s super PAC. The natural gas company has already received more than $1.7 billion in property tax relief and other incentives and rebates to expand its liquefied natural gas export site at Sabine Pass. MCNA Health Care, the contractor running Louisiana’s Children's Health Insurance Program dental program and Medicaid, also contributed $100,000 to Vitter’s super PAC. New Orleans Saints owner Tom Benson and his wife, Gayle Benson, have contributed $37,500. The state gave the Saints a sweetheart deal on a stadium renovation in 2009.The pro-Vitter super PAC spent most of its money on beating back fellow Republicans Scott Angelle and Jay Dardenne in Louisiana's open general election. The Republican Governors Association has meanwhile pumped $3.2 million into another super PAC to help Vitter in the runoff.LA Families First -- the super PAC backing Edwards, Vitter’s Democratic runoff opponent -- is mostly funded by teachers unions and labor unions, including the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters.Labor unions are also the largest force behind Kentucky Family Values, the main super PAC supporting Kentucky Democratic gubernatorial candidate Jack Conway. Unions provided $2.5 million of the $6.9 million the group has raised, and the Democratic Governors Association donated another $3.4 million. Putting Kentucky First, a super PAC funded with $5.2 million from the Republican Governors Association, is supporting Republican candidate Matt Bevin.Super PACs in Kentucky are also supporting the Republican and Democratic candidates for attorney general, and another super PAC is backing Democratic state auditor candidate Alan Edelen.New Jersey legislative races have seen their fair share of super PAC spending as well. A collection of Democratic Party groups, mostly funded by labor unions, are working to ensure the state legislature remains in the hands of Democrats.General Majority PAC, a group run by Susan McCue, a former aide to Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), has raised $5.3 million from unions representing teachers, electrical workers and carpenters to spend on New Jersey races. The unions are concerned that Gov. Chris Christie (R) would be able to push through his desired pension cuts with more Republicans in the legislature.A state Senate election in Virginia that could determine which party will control the body for the next two years has turned into a battle over gun control between the National Rifle Association and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The billionaire former mayor has promised to spend $1.5 million to support Democratic candidate Jeremy McPike through the Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund nonprofit. The NRA is backing McPike's opponent, Hal Parrish. An ad by Everytown for Gun Safety can be viewed below.Super PACs have also played key roles in city elections for mayor and city council members across the country this year.Chicago Forward super PAC supported Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s re-election bid when he was forced into an April 7 primary runoff against Cook County Commissioner Jesus “Chuy” Garcia. The pro-Emanuel group spent $2.7 million to support the mayor’s victory in the Democratic primary -- essentially securing his re-election on Nov. 3 -- and another $1.1 million to help his allies on the city council. Billionaire investors usually affiliated with the Republican Party, including Ken Griffin, David Herro and Craig Duchossois, provided much of this money.The Democratic primary in Philadelphia also featured big super PAC spending by super wealthy investors. American Families PAC gave $7 million to support State Sen. Anthony Williams. Susquehanna International Group heads Jeffrey Yass, Arthur Dantchik and Joel Greenberg, who have consistently backed Williams for his support for charter schools and other school privatization policies, funded the super PAC. Williams lost the primary -- which is the only important election in the heavily Democratic city -- to Jim Kenney. Kenney received support from a super PAC funded with slightly less than $2.5 million from labor unions.Super PACs injected nearly $1 million into the mayoral election in Nashville, Tennessee, that saw the election of Megan Barry on Sept. 10. Citizen Super PAC, which backed Barry’s opponent, David Fox, received more than $800,000 from Fox’s brother, George Fox.A debate over the development of a toll road in Dallas led businessmen involved in city council races to create opposing super PACs. Wealthy businessmen including billionaire Harlan Crow, oilman Ray Hunt and investor Al Hill Jr. made five-figure donations to For Our Community, the pro-toll road super PAC. Coalition for a New Dallas, the anti-toll road super PAC, received $150,000 from Trammell Crow Jr.Small cities are not immune to super PAC involvement either, as two northern New Jersey cities found out in 2015.In Little Ferry, New Jersey, a group called Focus on Families is circulating flyers attacking Mayor Mauro Raguseo. “These fliers are ridiculous in their attacks, and I think the people of Little Ferry know that,” Raguseo told The North Jersey Record. The biggest problem is that Focus on Families has not filed a single disclosure report detailing who its funders are.Just slightly to the west, New Jersey Future First, a super PAC run by a Democratic Party consultant, got involved in a Republican township council primary election in Parsippany, New Jersey. The super PAC's involvement was confusing to residents at first, and especially to the officials it targeted. The group stated that all of its funding came from America’s Future First, a 527 group registered with the Internal Revenue Service. That confusion was cleared up when America’s Future First disclosed that its donors were Fairview Insurance Agency and Adams, Rehmann & Heggan Associates. Both companies held contracts with the city’s government, and the council members they opposed were critical of the contracts.Super PAC involvement continues even further down-ballot: Lately, billionaires can be found influencing races for school board and district attorney in Louisiana.Billionaires backing education reform spent big money through super PACs in Louisiana’s Board of Elementary and Secondary Education elections. A collection of groups funded by billionaires spent approximately $3.5 million on these elections to maintain a pro-Common Core majority.Empower Louisiana PAC, the biggest spender on the BESE elections, received $800,000 from former New York Mayor Bloomberg, $625,000 from a nonprofit connected to billionaire investor John Arnold, $400,000 from Walmart heirs Jim and Alice Walton, and $250,000 from Los Angeles billionaire Eli Broad. The Stand for Children super PAC also received $250,000 from Jim Walton and $125,000 from Arnold’s nonprofit. Both groups support Common Core, charter schools and school vouchers, among other education reforms.Meanwhile, a fight over the death penalty and its disproportionate impact on minorities is playing out in the district attorney election in northern Louisiana’s Caddo Parish. Democratic candidate James E. Stewart is running to try to change the parish’s notoriety for leading the nation in death penalty sentences. Louisiana Safety & Justice PAC, a super PAC that supported Stewart and received over $400,000 from billionaire hedge fund manager and criminal justice reform advocate George Soros, was the biggest spender in the election. Stewart advanced to a Nov. 21 runoff against Republican Dhu Thompson.While super PAC fundraising for 2015 elections will come to a close soon, fundraising by state and local super PACs for next year's elections, and beyond, continues apace.Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser launched a super PAC to back her allies on the city council in 2016. The group has already attracted large contributions from local developers with extensive business before city government.Correction: A previous version of this article misstated the results of Louisiana's gubernatorial election. John Bel Edwards came in first and David Vitter came in second. Also, the article stated that Eli Broad was based in San Francisco, but he is based in Los Angeles."

21,POLITICS,Does This Guantanamo Prisoner Deserve His Time Back?,"Andrew Royce Bauer, ContributorCo-Founder of WeTranslate, Helping Refugees Overcome Language ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/did-this-guantanamo-priso_b_8440964.html,"If more Americans were aware of the tragic tale of Shaker Aamer's treatment, it would be safe to assume his instant release would have come to the backdrop of throngs of cheering well-wishers.",2015-10-31,Shaker Aamer of the UK is still being held at Guantanamo. (Department of Defense/MCT via Getty Images),https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb91b2d220000bb01dd8f60.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"J.K Rowling stood at the lectern, surveying the brilliant students at Harvard University, and spoke about the one great privilege even she wasn't blessed with: that of being an American citizen. ""You belong to the world's only remaining superpower. The way you vote, the way you live, the way you protest, the pressure you bring to bear on your government, has an impact way beyond your borders. That is your privilege, and your burden. If you choose to use your status and influence to raise your voice on behalf of those who have no voice; if you choose to identify not only with the powerful, but with the powerless; if you retain the ability to imagine yourself into the lives of those who do not have your advantages, then it will not only be your proud families who celebrate your existence, but thousands and millions of people whose reality you have helped change.""It has been proven time and time again. When enough Americans raise their voices in unity, even the world's most powerful government can do little but represent their wishes. Just last month a 14-year old boy in Texas got arrested for bringing to school a clock his teachers thought might have been a bomb. Within hours, outrage and ridicule poured in with such venom Ahmed Mohamed found himself at the receiving end of an invite to the White House. If people all across America had instead chosen to glance at the story, shrugged their shoulders, and moved on, who really would have paid any attention to the treatment a teenage boy of Sudanese immigrants suffered in Irving, Texas?Not all stories are quite as feel-good, though. Here is one of a man called Shaker Aamer, one of Guantanamo Bay's longest serving prisoners, the torture base that still operates, despite worldwide pressure to scrap the enhanced interrogation center. A 47-year old Saudi Arabian citizen and legal resident of the United Kingdom, he was kidnapped by bounty hunters in Afghanistan in December 2001, and subsequently handed over to American forces. The Unites States sent him over to Guantanamo Bay for a reason no one has yet ever been able to assign. Alleged leaked documents suspect he received money from Al-Qaeda and fought in the Battle of Tora Bora, but the US cannot have been too confident they could bring about a prosecution. Therefore, the father-of-four has been detained at Guantanamo for nearly 14 years, never even charged of a crime, let alone convicted. He was approved for release in 2007 and 2009, yet never actually freed, allegedly because of the fear he would reveal ""too much"" about what went on in Guantanamo. Thus, it appeared, his detention was indefinite. His health has gradually been deteriorating since life in captivity while he lost over half his body weight. His lawyer, Clive Stafford Smith, said he was ""gradually dying in Guantanamo Bay.""On September 25 this year, after backbreaking efforts by his lawyers to cut through the arcana of the American justice system, Obama's administration officially notified Congress of its intention to release Aamer to the UK, after which a prisoner must be set free in 30 days. October 25 was Day 30. And all it took was three Republican senators on a supposed ""fact finding"" mission to the base to delay his release from the Land of the Free. He was to remain, for now, at Guantanamo Bay. Clive Stafford Smith did not hold back with his frustration.'They have had 30 days to prepare [for his release] - it only took 28 days after 9/11 to start a war in Afghanistan.' Two months short of fourteen years since his abduction, Aamer was finally released from the base, and flown to a British government plane to England. Security was tight, with press being allowed nowhere near the airport to ensure his immediate thoughts remained just that, but it is poignant to wonder what he would make of the sort of world he finds himself in. He may thank his wife for her years of hardship and loyalty; a single mother raising four children in London is unlikely to have come without its tribulations. He will see three London teenagers on their way to adulthood in his house, the children who were toddlers when he was torn away from them. Then, he might set his eyes on a 13-year old boy called Faris, whom he has never seen. How could he have done? His youngest child was born on the day he arrived at Guantanamo Bay. It was Valentine's Day in 2002, but the love for this family man appeared to be in short supply. If more Americans were aware of the tragic tale of this man's treatment, it would be safe to assume his instant release would have come to the backdrop of throngs of cheering well-wishers. The awareness of the details of a case with almost no mitigating factors to assume anything other than nefarious misconduct is one of depressingly many in the wake of 9/11. The issue received little press coverage in the United States throughout his ordeal, and a horrible injustice has been done. Even Ahmed Mohamed couldn't build a clock that gave Shaker Aamer these nearly 14 years back with his family, but it is our duty to demand to know why it was ever allowed to tick on so long in the first place.Journalist Danyal Rasool significantly contributed to the research, writing, editing, and publishing of this work.

Donald Trump generated 201,978 Tweets between 8pm - 10:20pm Eastern Time on October 28, 2015. In comparison, Donald Trump received 1,008,792 Tweets during the Second Republican Debate on September 16 and 836,388 Tweets during the First Republican Debate on August 7. The politician who had the most successful night was almost certainly Ted Cruz, who generated 200,151 Tweets...or 99% as many Tweets as Donald Trump in the same time period. In an increasingly adversarial environment; where the CNBC moderators and the candidates were both visibly agitated with each other; Cruz denounced media bias and accused CNBC’s line of questioning to have nothing to do with public policy and basically amounting to a smear campaign against all the Republican candidates. It was clearly the moment of the night and hit a bipartisan nerve in the audience.""Ted Cruz wins on Facebook - Per a release from Facebook, the most discussed moment of the night was when Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) criticized the debate questions. Cruz was also the most discussed candidate followed by Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. John Kasich drives the most Google searches in the first hour - Philip Bump: ""When Monmouth University polled Republican voters in September, 60 percent of the people they spoke with had never heard of Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R). That's a problem for a guy that wants to be president. So Kasich came into the third debate with a plan: Picking a fight. He started early, throwing rocks at Donald Trump. And Trump took the bait. And, for a moment at least, it worked. No candidate was more searched on Google during the first hour of the debate than John Kasich. Just for a moment, mind you. And what they were searching for was an answer to the point Trump raised: His relationship with Lehman Brothers, which is probably not ideal. But they were looking….On a more sustained basis, the winners were two people we've gotten used to seeing atop the pack: Ben Carson and Donald Trump. But also a newcomer. Marco Rubio received slightly more interest over the course of the debate than Donald Trump. [WashPost] But don’t take those focus groups and instant online polls too seriously - HuffPollster: “‘While these discussions make for far more compelling television than dry survey statistics, they have important limitations,’ HuffPost's Mark Blumenthal wrote in a 2008 column. ‘Every group is a small, non-random sample, and it is hard to know the degree to which the views of participants may be influenced by the atmospherics of the telecast, the probes of the moderator or the opinions expressed by others in the group.’ And even if a focus group or online poll accurately takes the measure of public opinion, there's another, more fundamental challenge with trying to figure out who ‘won.’ Unlike a sports game or an election, debates don't necessarily produce clear-cut winners or an objective way of naming them. Supporters of a politician are likely to think their preferred candidate won, regardless of the outcome, and even a strong performance can have relatively little impact on the polls.” [HuffPost]The real winner: Baseball - Americans, however, were overall more interested in the World Series than politics on Wednesday night: [WashPost]REPUBLICANS PLAY TO ANTI-MEDIA SENTIMENT - HuffPollster: “Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) slammed the media during Wednesday night's GOP presidential debate for supporting liberal and Democratic views, and both were rewarded with thunderous applause. There’s a reason. According to a recently released Gallup poll, only 32 percent of Republicans have a great deal or fair amount of trust in the mass media. Gallup has asked the same question each year since 1997: 'In general, how much trust and confidence do you have in the mass media -- such as newspapers, TV and radio -- when it comes to reporting the news fully, accurately and fairly -- a great deal, a fair amount, not very much or none at all?' In every poll, Republicans have showed the lowest levels of trust.” [HuffPost]IOWA POLLS SHOWING HUGE CLINTON SURGE MIGHT BE OUTLIERS - HuffPollster:: “Hillary Clinton holds an overwhelming lead over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (I) in two new surveys of the Iowa caucus, results that either stand out as significant outliers or mark a dramatic surge.Clinton leads Bernie Sanders by 41 points in Monmouth University's first survey of Iowa's Democrats. She leads by 38 points in a Loras College poll also released Tuesday, up from the 25-point lead she held in Loras' August survey. That's a sharp departure from the three other polls conducted in Iowa this month, which show Clinton ahead of Sanders by just 3, 7 and 11 percentage points.” The issue could be how Monmouth and Loras sampled: Both used registered voter lists, and Monmouth sampled Democrats who voted in at least one of the last two primary elections. Loras sampled Democrats who voted in past general elections. [HuffPost] Why that might be a problem: As Nate Cohn wrote, “These two conditions — being a registered Democrat and recent primary participation — exclude many of Mr. Sanders’s supporters. He fares best among unaffiliated voters in most polls, and thousands of them will participate in the Iowa caucuses. To participate in the caucuses, you have to be a registered Democrat — but you can change your voter registration at the event, so people who are currently unaffiliated or even Republican could ultimately participate.” Cohn points out that the youth and unaffiliated vote was a strong force for Obama in his 2008 Iowa win, although it was an anomaly for those groups to participate in the caucus at high rates. [NYT]TRUMP FALLS OUT OF LOVE WITH POLLSTERS - Philip Bump: ""In April, not-yet-a-candidate Donald Trump tweeted enthusiastically about a new poll released by Monmouth University. 'Wow,' he said, 'the respected Monmouth University poll has me ahead of most Republican candidates nationwide, and most people don't think I'm running!' Over the weekend, Monmouth released another poll, this time showing Trump in second in Iowa.'The thing with these polls,' Trump said on 'Morning Joe' on Tuesday, 'they're all so different. One guy is up here, somebody else is up there, you see swings of 10 and 12 points and, immediately, even the same day. So right now it's not very scientific.'...Each time there's a new, unpleasant poll out, Trump retweets people who agree with him that the polls are goofy. Given that such occurrences are increasingly regular, we figured we'd debunk some of the most common arguments Trump and his fans have deployed in their own defense."" [WashPost]-Donald Trump: “I don’t believe those polls…because both of those pollsters don’t like me."" [Politico]-FiveThirtyEight's Harry Enten: “Donald Trump’s guide to polls: 1. Polls that show Trump ahead are greatest of all time. 2. Polls that show Trump behind are worst ever.” [@ForecasterEnten] GREENBERG: DEMS SHOULDN'T RUN FOR OBAMA 'THIRD TERM' - HuffPollster: ""Bill Clinton's former pollster thinks it's a mistake for Democratic presidential candidates to essentially run for President Barack Obama's 'third term.' 'That's not what the country wants. It's not what the base of the Democratic Party wants,' said longtime Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg, whose past clients include Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. 'The Democratic Party is waiting for a president who will articulate the scale of the problems we face and challenge them to address it.' Greenberg thinks it's time to go bigger. His comments came in an interview with The Huffington Post previewing his new book, America Ascendant, which chronicles what he describes as the 'revolutions that are changing America, changing politics, changing culture, changing economics.' Greenberg argues in the book that these revolutionary changes, including a population that is growing younger and more racially and culturally diverse, will lead to a period in which America will be ""exceptional again."" But he believes that renewal will require a period of sustained political reform, comparable to the Progressive Era at the turn of the 20th century, and the defeat of the ""counter-revolution"" being waged by the modern Republican Party. [HuffPost]A PERSONAL NOTE - Mark Blumenthal: HuffPollster will be back next week as usual, but today is my last at the Huffington Post. I started blogging in 2004 as Mystery Pollster. Together with Charles Franklin and with the support of Doug Rivers and Polimetrix (now YouGov), we founded Pollster.com in 2006. We partnered with the National Journal in 2008 and came to the Huffington Post when Arianna Huffington gave us a new lease on life in 2010. And we launched this newsletter in 2013. So perhaps, for me, some degree of restlessness has been there all along. Next month, I will begin another new job as head of election polling for SurveyMonkey. Writing for the Huffington Post and its readers has been a special honor and privilege. It has given me a chance to work every day in a newsroom full of uniquely bright, talented, passionate journalists. I've learned to write for a wide audience and had my words greatly improved by some of the best editors are in the business. I got to team up with the first rate developers who rebuilt the Pollster.com charts from the ground up, fulfilling the vision we had for the site since our founding nine years ago. And I've had an unmatched ringside seat covering politics and polls during a period of challenge and reinvention for the survey research industry. I have every confidence that Pollster and the HuffPollster newsletter are in the very able hands of newly promoted Senior Polling Editor Natalie Jackson, Director of Polling and Staff Reporter Ariel Edwards-Levy and Associate Polling Editor Janie Velencia. To all who have turned to these pages over the years to use our charts or follow or reporting, and to all who have supported my work or contributed to it, I say thank you.

The politician who had the most successful night was almost certainly Ted Cruz, who generated 200,151 Tweets...or 99% as many Tweets as Donald Trump in the same time period. In an increasingly adversarial environment; where the CNBC moderators and the candidates were both visibly agitated with each other; Cruz denounced media bias and accused CNBC’s line of questioning to have nothing to do with public policy and basically amounting to a smear campaign against all the Republican candidates. It was clearly the moment of the night and hit a bipartisan nerve in the audience.""Ted Cruz wins on Facebook - Per a release from Facebook, the most discussed moment of the night was when Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) criticized the debate questions. Cruz was also the most discussed candidate followed by Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. John Kasich drives the most Google searches in the first hour - Philip Bump: ""When Monmouth University polled Republican voters in September, 60 percent of the people they spoke with had never heard of Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R). That's a problem for a guy that wants to be president. So Kasich came into the third debate with a plan: Picking a fight. He started early, throwing rocks at Donald Trump. And Trump took the bait. And, for a moment at least, it worked. No candidate was more searched on Google during the first hour of the debate than John Kasich. Just for a moment, mind you. And what they were searching for was an answer to the point Trump raised: His relationship with Lehman Brothers, which is probably not ideal. But they were looking….On a more sustained basis, the winners were two people we've gotten used to seeing atop the pack: Ben Carson and Donald Trump. But also a newcomer. Marco Rubio received slightly more interest over the course of the debate than Donald Trump. [WashPost] But don’t take those focus groups and instant online polls too seriously - HuffPollster: “‘While these discussions make for far more compelling television than dry survey statistics, they have important limitations,’ HuffPost's Mark Blumenthal wrote in a 2008 column. ‘Every group is a small, non-random sample, and it is hard to know the degree to which the views of participants may be influenced by the atmospherics of the telecast, the probes of the moderator or the opinions expressed by others in the group.’ And even if a focus group or online poll accurately takes the measure of public opinion, there's another, more fundamental challenge with trying to figure out who ‘won.’ Unlike a sports game or an election, debates don't necessarily produce clear-cut winners or an objective way of naming them. Supporters of a politician are likely to think their preferred candidate won, regardless of the outcome, and even a strong performance can have relatively little impact on the polls.” [HuffPost]The real winner: Baseball - Americans, however, were overall more interested in the World Series than politics on Wednesday night: [WashPost]REPUBLICANS PLAY TO ANTI-MEDIA SENTIMENT - HuffPollster: “Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) slammed the media during Wednesday night's GOP presidential debate for supporting liberal and Democratic views, and both were rewarded with thunderous applause. There’s a reason. According to a recently released Gallup poll, only 32 percent of Republicans have a great deal or fair amount of trust in the mass media. Gallup has asked the same question each year since 1997: 'In general, how much trust and confidence do you have in the mass media -- such as newspapers, TV and radio -- when it comes to reporting the news fully, accurately and fairly -- a great deal, a fair amount, not very much or none at all?' In every poll, Republicans have showed the lowest levels of trust.” [HuffPost]IOWA POLLS SHOWING HUGE CLINTON SURGE MIGHT BE OUTLIERS - HuffPollster:: “Hillary Clinton holds an overwhelming lead over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (I) in two new surveys of the Iowa caucus, results that either stand out as significant outliers or mark a dramatic surge.Clinton leads Bernie Sanders by 41 points in Monmouth University's first survey of Iowa's Democrats. She leads by 38 points in a Loras College poll also released Tuesday, up from the 25-point lead she held in Loras' August survey. That's a sharp departure from the three other polls conducted in Iowa this month, which show Clinton ahead of Sanders by just 3, 7 and 11 percentage points.” The issue could be how Monmouth and Loras sampled: Both used registered voter lists, and Monmouth sampled Democrats who voted in at least one of the last two primary elections. Loras sampled Democrats who voted in past general elections. [HuffPost] Why that might be a problem: As Nate Cohn wrote, “These two conditions — being a registered Democrat and recent primary participation — exclude many of Mr. Sanders’s supporters. He fares best among unaffiliated voters in most polls, and thousands of them will participate in the Iowa caucuses. To participate in the caucuses, you have to be a registered Democrat — but you can change your voter registration at the event, so people who are currently unaffiliated or even Republican could ultimately participate.” Cohn points out that the youth and unaffiliated vote was a strong force for Obama in his 2008 Iowa win, although it was an anomaly for those groups to participate in the caucus at high rates. [NYT]TRUMP FALLS OUT OF LOVE WITH POLLSTERS - Philip Bump: ""In April, not-yet-a-candidate Donald Trump tweeted enthusiastically about a new poll released by Monmouth University. 'Wow,' he said, 'the respected Monmouth University poll has me ahead of most Republican candidates nationwide, and most people don't think I'm running!' Over the weekend, Monmouth released another poll, this time showing Trump in second in Iowa.'The thing with these polls,' Trump said on 'Morning Joe' on Tuesday, 'they're all so different. One guy is up here, somebody else is up there, you see swings of 10 and 12 points and, immediately, even the same day. So right now it's not very scientific.'...Each time there's a new, unpleasant poll out, Trump retweets people who agree with him that the polls are goofy. Given that such occurrences are increasingly regular, we figured we'd debunk some of the most common arguments Trump and his fans have deployed in their own defense."" [WashPost]-Donald Trump: “I don’t believe those polls…because both of those pollsters don’t like me."" [Politico]-FiveThirtyEight's Harry Enten: “Donald Trump’s guide to polls: 1. Polls that show Trump ahead are greatest of all time. 2. Polls that show Trump behind are worst ever.” [@ForecasterEnten] GREENBERG: DEMS SHOULDN'T RUN FOR OBAMA 'THIRD TERM' - HuffPollster: ""Bill Clinton's former pollster thinks it's a mistake for Democratic presidential candidates to essentially run for President Barack Obama's 'third term.' 'That's not what the country wants. It's not what the base of the Democratic Party wants,' said longtime Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg, whose past clients include Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. 'The Democratic Party is waiting for a president who will articulate the scale of the problems we face and challenge them to address it.' Greenberg thinks it's time to go bigger. His comments came in an interview with The Huffington Post previewing his new book, America Ascendant, which chronicles what he describes as the 'revolutions that are changing America, changing politics, changing culture, changing economics.' Greenberg argues in the book that these revolutionary changes, including a population that is growing younger and more racially and culturally diverse, will lead to a period in which America will be ""exceptional again."" But he believes that renewal will require a period of sustained political reform, comparable to the Progressive Era at the turn of the 20th century, and the defeat of the ""counter-revolution"" being waged by the modern Republican Party. [HuffPost]A PERSONAL NOTE - Mark Blumenthal: HuffPollster will be back next week as usual, but today is my last at the Huffington Post. I started blogging in 2004 as Mystery Pollster. Together with Charles Franklin and with the support of Doug Rivers and Polimetrix (now YouGov), we founded Pollster.com in 2006. We partnered with the National Journal in 2008 and came to the Huffington Post when Arianna Huffington gave us a new lease on life in 2010. And we launched this newsletter in 2013. So perhaps, for me, some degree of restlessness has been there all along. Next month, I will begin another new job as head of election polling for SurveyMonkey. Writing for the Huffington Post and its readers has been a special honor and privilege. It has given me a chance to work every day in a newsroom full of uniquely bright, talented, passionate journalists. I've learned to write for a wide audience and had my words greatly improved by some of the best editors are in the business. I got to team up with the first rate developers who rebuilt the Pollster.com charts from the ground up, fulfilling the vision we had for the site since our founding nine years ago. And I've had an unmatched ringside seat covering politics and polls during a period of challenge and reinvention for the survey research industry. I have every confidence that Pollster and the HuffPollster newsletter are in the very able hands of newly promoted Senior Polling Editor Natalie Jackson, Director of Polling and Staff Reporter Ariel Edwards-Levy and Associate Polling Editor Janie Velencia. To all who have turned to these pages over the years to use our charts or follow or reporting, and to all who have supported my work or contributed to it, I say thank you.

24,CRIME,"Amonderez Green, Teen Shot Near Ferguson, Was An Avid Rapper",Nick Visser,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amonderez-green-rapper_us_5631b029e4b0c66bae5b0830,"""Sometimes I just feel like I gotta admit/ That I don't know this s**t.""",2015-10-30,"Police on the scene near where Amonderez Green, 18, was found with a gunshot wound to the face.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5631b0cc190000b100b952cb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Amonderez Green, the 18-year-old who died early Thursday from a gunshot wound to the face in Normandy, Missouri, was an avid rapper who uploaded dozens of tracks to Soundcloud over the past year.The circumstances surrounding the shooting, which took place just south of Ferguson, are still murky. Officers with the Normandy Police Department say Green was suicidal, and that he fired several shots at police dispatched to the scene to calm him down. Police say they returned fire, but that Green shot himself in the face during the pursuit. However, multiple witnesses told The Huffington Post that officers may have shot the teen. Loved ones described Green as ""very sweet,"" though said he could at times be a ""hothead.""""He was very loving and very sweet and humble. He was a hard worker and supported his family,"" his cousin, Donneka Green, said.""I cannot lie, he was kind of a hothead,"" another friend told HuffPost. ""He was one to argue with teachers, get into fights and stuff like that. But he wasn’t a killer.""In all, Green uploaded 36 clips to Soundcloud under the moniker ""Luhh Reezye."" It's hard to know to what extent the music is autobiographical -- and it would be wrong to assume that any of it is, since hip-hop is a genre where some people are especially eager to take literally any lyrics that seem incriminating. At the very least, though, the music suggests another side of Green besides the hotheaded teen: a kid who evidently liked to spend time on the computer, crafting songs.In many of the tracks, Green raps or sings about subjects familiar to any angsty teen: young love, a fondness for pot. Other songs address the tribulations of young men of color. [Warning: The following paragraphs contain explicit language.]A song called ""I Don't Know"" is all adolescent confusion and insecurity, with lines like ""I be thinking like 'What the fuck is going on different/ Than other people's lives?'"" On the chorus, Green sings that ""sometimes I just feel like I gotta admit/ That I don't know this shit.""Other songs, like ""Too Much"" and ""All I Need,"" focus on relationships -- their beginnings and their endings.Meanwhile, a song called ""Who Gives A Fuck"" includes somewhat standard-issue anti-police lyrics: ""Fuck the fucking feds, also fuck Officer [inaudible]/ That nigga tried to hit me cause I wasn't fucking saying/ Shit, bitch/ Fuck the feds, fuck the motherfucking feds.""You can listen to all of Green's songs on his Soundcloud page.Matt Ferner and Sebastian Murdock contributed reporting.Also on HuffPost:"
