On Monday, the former Mizzou football star added his voice to the growing chorus of students, professors and athletes protesting racial tensions on campus with walkouts this week, encouraging the school to ""stand by #ConcernedStudent1950"" on twitter.""Concerned Student 1950"" is the name adopted by a group of student protesters who pushed for the resignation of university president Tim Wolfe. Wolfe announced his resignation Monday morning. (""1950"" is a nod to Gus T. Ridgel, MU's first black graduate, who received his diploma in 1950.)Sam said the news of Wolfe's resignation was ""not surprising at all.""""We stand by each other,"" he added. ""We are a family.""ESPN reporter Howard Bryant noted Sam was on campus for the protests Monday.Mizzou football coach Gary Pinkel also supported the protest, even though it meant his players would not engage in any football-related activities until a resolution could be reached.Also on HuffPost:"
1,POLITICS,Thousands Of Workers Who Were Shorted On Overtime Pay Are Headed To The Supreme Court,Dave Jamieson and Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-tyson-class-action_us_5640b1ebe4b0307f2cae06fd,It's the biggest Supreme Court case you've never heard of.,2015-11-09,"Demonstrators gather outside the Supreme Court in Washington, Tuesday, June 21, 2011, to protest the court's Wal-Mart class-action lawsuit decision.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Workers who band together to sue their employers over wage theft or discrimination are about to have their biggest day in court in years.On Tuesday, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in a crucial case that could tighten the rules dictating how workers and consumers band together in the first place -- which could limit their ability to bring class-action lawsuits and other collective actions against corporations.The case, Tyson Foods v. Bouaphakeo, involves a group of pork-processing workers in Iowa who claimed the meatpacking giant shorted them on overtime pay. The employees sued under the Fair Labor Standards Act in 2007, arguing they should have been compensated for the time it took to put on and take off the safety equipment they were required to wear while they worked. A jury eventually agreed, resulting in a $5.8 million judgment in favor of roughly 3,300 workers.Now, Tyson wants the hefty award thrown out. The company does not dispute that the workers should have been paid for the hours in question. Rather, Tyson argues that the statistical method a court used to determine damages for the workers was legally bogus, and that the workers therefore aren't eligible to sue collectively.At issue are the federal rules of procedure judges must follow when “certifying” a class of plaintiffs -- the first step in all class-action cases. Both plaintiffs and corporations put up their biggest legal fight at the certification stage, which can easily take years to complete. If a handful of workers can’t adequately show that they represent a ""class"" of thousands, the certification fails and the case essentially dies. Each employee is then left to sue on their own, and most don’t have the resources to do that.For worker advocates, that could be a big setback. An individual meatpacking worker who was shorted on pay might be owed a few hundred or thousand dollars -- probably not enough to entice a lawyer to pursue her case alone. But when workers join together in large classes, there's a greater incentive for attorneys to represent them. The Supreme Court, for its part, has been all too eager to stiffen the highly technical rules of class actions, often to the detriment of plaintiffs. That’s why the Tyson Foods case could have huge implications. A look at the lengthy list of who’s supporting who in the dispute shows as much: Organized labor and low-wage worker advocates have filed briefs in support of the workers, while the Chamber of Commerce and other major business lobbies have lined up behind the company. ""Not only Tyson but employers and companies of all kinds would, I'm sure, welcome a broad ruling restricting the availability of class actions,"" Scott Michelman, a lawyer with Public Citizen who is representing the workers, told The Huffington Post. ""A lot of the workers may be from marginalized populations in one way or another and have trouble seeking recourse without this device of a class action.""On the other side, Tyson and management-side lawyers argue that the method used to determine damages -- applying an average sample to all the workers in the class -- is a sham.According to the company, the plaintiffs relied on experts who applied average damages across the class, even though workers had different jobs with different responsibilities, and some spent more time donning, doffing and rinsing equipment than others. (The company also says the class of workers is illegitimate because a small percentage of the employees turned out not to be owed any overtime.)Andrew Grossman, who penned an amicus brief on behalf of the libertarian think tank Cato Institute, argues that applying average damages is unfair not only to Tyson but also to individual workers, since some are entitled to more money than others.""They set up the class action in a way that frustrated individual determinations of damages,"" Grossman said. ""Is it fair to plaintiffs?""""What they're trying to is have a 'trial by formula,' using an unsound, unrepresentative sample, and thrust it down the throat of the defendants,"" said Richard Alfred, head of the wage-and-hour litigation group at the law firm Seyfarth Shaw. “Trial by formula” is a phrase pulled from another major class-action case, Wal-Mart v. Dukes, in which the Supreme Court virtually tossed what Justice Antonin Scalia called “one of the most expansive class actions ever."" The case was led by a trio of female workers at the retail giant who claimed they were being denied equal pay and opportunities for promotion.Tyson is relying heavily on the Walmart precedent to make its case to the justices. In fact, shortly after the court decided the case in 2011, Tyson invoked it unsuccessfully to try to kill the class action altogether -- contending that the plant workers couldn’t show “in one stroke” that all of them were injured equally and that an award of damages would make the class whole.Meatpacking companies in particular have a long history with this type of class-action suit. The suits are known in legal circles as ""donning and doffing"" cases, since they have to do with the time spent putting on and taking off equipment. In slaughterhouses, dressing for work isn't as simple as putting on a T-shirt; many employees wear heavy protective gear that resembles chain mail. At the Tyson plant in Storm Lake, Iowa, some of the knife-wielding workers also spend extra time cleaning and storing their equipment. Tyson itself has been sued numerous times over donning and doffing issues, according to federal court records. In a settlement with the Department of Labor in 2010, the company agreed to have certain line workers start clocking in before they put on their gear and clocking out after they took it off. At the time, Tyson said it was modifying its practices ""in order to avoid the continued expense and disruption of further litigation."" (The workers involved in the current case were employed at Tyson between 2004 and 2010, according to Michelman.)In an emailed statement to HuffPost, Tyson said ""we value our employees and strive to treat them fairly.""Complicating the ""trial by formula"" argument is that both sides agree that Tyson failed to keep an adequate record of how much each worker spent working overtime. In the absence of such records, the Supreme Court itself has said that workers can “approximate” how much they’re owed in such cases by drawing a “just and reasonable inference” -- which is exactly what the Tyson workers did, and what the lower courts that ruled in their favor accepted as valid.So how will the Supreme Court deal with these competing precedents? It could simply find ways to deploy them in Tyson’s favor by tying them to the real end game: the rules of forming a class action in the first place. Because the rules require “commonality” among all the class members very early in the litigation, the court could easily agree with Tyson that the variance in the workers’ duties and damages owed -- which a statistical average obscures -- were too great at the outset to warrant bringing them all together under a large class action.If the court agrees the employees are too dissimilar, the class action is bound to fail -- at which point workers would have no other recourse but to pursue their claims as individuals or as smaller classes, in which workers might be grouped according to more discrete job categories. This would set a precedent limiting the scope of future class-action suits, which would be a boon to Tyson and other big companies -- including Walmart, the nation's largest private-sector employer, which filed an amicus brief in support of Tyson.The National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group for low-wage workers, filed a brief in support of the Tyson employees. Catherine Ruckelshaus, the group's general counsel, told HuffPost it was ""sort of disgusting"" that Tyson hadn't tracked the workers' donning-and-doffing time and paid them for it. Ruckelshaus said a broad ruling against the workers could make it harder for workers of all kinds to pursue back pay in class actions. ""There continues to be wage theft in lots of jobs in this country, and meat processing is one of the top employers that the Department of Labor has consistently identified as repeat offenders,"" Ruckelshaus said. ""The suits are mostly filed by immigrant workers who don't have a lot of power in the workplace. [A ruling in Tyson's favor] is going to keep these workers from coming to the courts to enforce their rights."""

Effective Jan. 1, 2016, the 66-year-old Loftin will transition to a new role overseeing the development and renovation of the school's research facilities, according to a statement from the University of Missouri system. Loftin became Mizzou's chancellor in February 2014.  “It has been my pleasure to serve as chancellor of this great institution. I hope that every member of our campus community will embrace each person’s right to express their opinions in a respectful manner and to make progress toward our common goal of an inclusive campus that values the contributions of all individuals,"" Loftin said in a statement. ""I am excited for my new challenge to lead the university’s research facility development.”Hank Foley, Mizzou's senior vice chancellor for research and graduate studies, will serve as interim chancellor. Loftin's resignation announcement comes just hours after University of Missouri system president Tim Wolfe announced he would leave his role, effective immediately. The embattled president faced calls for his resignation from students, faculty and even state lawmakers over how he handled racial tensions on campus. Discontent with Mizzou leadership has brewed for some time, but hit a critical point when more than 30 black players on the school's football team announced over the weekend they would not practice or participate in any team activities until Wolfe resigned.Also on HuffPost:"
3,POLITICS,Chris Christie Vetoes Election Reform Bill In New Jersey,Samantha Lachman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chris-christie-automatic-registration_us_5640d98ce4b0307f2cae3e5e,The state could have become the nation's third to implement automatic registration.,2015-11-09,Republican presidential candidate and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie vetoed legislation that would implement election reforms.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5640de17290000d7004dc7da.jpeg?ops=crop_0_210_3000_1728%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) vetoed a package of election reforms passed by the state's Democrat-controlled legislature Monday, arguing the legislation was ""thinly-veiled political gamesmanship."" The Democracy Act aimed to implement automatic voter registration when voters apply for driver's licenses. (Eligible voters have the option to opt out before they are automatically registered with Department of Motor Vehicles information.) Only two states -- California and Oregon -- have passed automatic registration bills. The bill also included provisions creating two weeks of in-person early voting and enacting online voter registration. Voting rights advocates say such measures would help boost turnout, which was 30.4 percent in last year's midterm elections, ranking among the worst in the country. Roughly 1.6 million eligible New Jersey residents are not registered to vote.Christie's veto wasn't a surprise, as he had said in June that he thought the bill would increase fraud and that he didn't think citizens should be registered automatically. On Monday, he further justified his opposition to the legislation by saying he thought it would be too cumbersome and costly. “New Jersey taxpayers deserve better than to have their hard-earned tax dollars spent on thinly-veiled political gamesmanship and the State must ensure that every eligible citizen’s vote counts and is not stolen by fraud,” the governor said in a statement.The press release announcing his veto said the bill ""represents a manifest attempt to use election reform for political gain rather than a genuine bipartisan effort to further improve the State’s election system."" Proponents of automatic registration have rejected Christie's fraud argument, saying that such methods have the potential to clean up the state's voter rolls by reducing data entry errors from paper forms. Democratic lawmakers in 17 states and the District of Columbia have introduced their own automatic registration laws, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law.“Automatic registration is good for the country, and good for New Jersey,” said Myrna Pérez, deputy director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center. “The Democracy Act would have made our registration lists more accurate and up to date, and voting more flexible and convenient. We are extremely disappointed Governor Christie chose to veto a bill with these kinds of proven benefits. Instead of passing laws that make it harder for Americans to vote, lawmakers must work to modernize our voting system for the 21st century.”New Jersey Democrats had suggested they would try to put aspects of the package on the ballot as a proposed constitutional amendment in 2016 if Christie vetoed the legislation.

4,HEALTHY LIVING,Being Moody Helps Us Adapt To Change,Carolyn Gregoire,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/moodiness-study_us_5640bedae4b0411d3071a8be,"Our fluctuating moods are far from irrational, neuroscientists say.",2015-11-09,"Moods help us adapt to change, according to a new study.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5640d6ce14000069023ca3e0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The word ""mood"" is a loaded term. Often, moodiness, particularly as it applies to women, is interpreted as irrational and self-indulgent. But moods -- those nebulous and fluctuating states of feeling -- do have a biological purpose and may even be useful for helping us to better understand our surroundings, according to New York psychiatrist Dr. Julie Holland, author of Moody Bitches. Women's moods are a ""healthy, adaptive part of our biology,"" Holland has argued.A bold new theory of moodiness, published last week in the journal Trends in Cognitive Sciences, adds credence to this claim, suggesting that men and women's natural emotional fluctuations actually serve an important purpose: helping us to better adapt to changes in our environment. The new study suggests that moods help us to learn from our personal experiences so that we can better respond to similar situations next time. ""It’s long been known that mood biases our judgments and perceptions, but this effect has usually been regarded as irrational or disadvantageous,"" Dr. Eran Eldar, a neuroscientist who studies emotion at University College London and one of the study's authors, told The Huffington Post in an email.""By computationally analyzing causes and consequences of mood that are evident in the laboratory, we showed that mood’s biasing impact can, in fact, serve an adaptive role.""Here's an example: When a stock trader experiences an unexpected financial gain, it would undoubtedly improve her mood. This positive mood, in turn, would likely inspire her to take more risks, thereby adapting to a market environment that's on the rise. A sizable body of research has shown that emotional states can powerfully color our perceptions and judgments. The new theory -- based on brain imaging data exploring the association between moods and monetary loss or gain -- suggests that we learn from experiences that are colored by our moods. Our expectations then reflect not only changes in reward availability (for instance, the rising stock) but also changes in the overall availability of reward in our environment.Therefore, moods are an efficient means of learning about the environment, and they help us to quickly adapt to change. ""Our moods reflect inferences that things are generally getting better or worse for us, and they impact our behavior so as to adapt to these changes,"" Eldar said. As the researchers note, positive and negative moods are most useful when they're relatively short-lived, persisting only until our expectations are in line with a change in reward. Then, most people will return to a baseline emotional state. It's easy to see how humans may have evolved in some way to be moody, and to use fluctuations in mood as a source of information about one's surroundings. ""The effect of mood may have helped survival by ensuring quick adaptation to changes that possess an underlying momentum -- for instance, gradual changes in weather in springtime -- or that affect the general availability of resources, for instance, changes in the social status of an animal,"" Eldar said. Of course, moods aren't always reliable gauges of a situation -- or as the saying in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy goes, ""feelings aren't facts."" Still, being more in tune with our moods can only help us to become more aware of how our emotions color our judgments and perceptions, both in a positive and a negative sense. And in defining the vital functions of our moods, scientists may one day come to better understand the root causes of mood disorders like bipolar disorder and depression. Far from being ""irrational,"" the researchers conclude, moods are a healthy and indeed evolutionarily adaptive aspect of human cognition. ""Being moody at times may be a small price to pay for the ability to adapt quickly when facing momentous environmental changes,"" they wrote.  Also on HuffPost:"
5,POLITICS,Bernie Sanders Promises Action On Immigration In First 100 Days As President,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-immigration-reform_us_5640cb6ce4b0307f2cae2699,"""This is the just and moral thing to do.""",2015-11-09,Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) promised swift action on immigration reform.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders promised Monday to begin taking executive action on immigration reform during the first 100 days of his presidency, including sweeping deportation relief that would go beyond the policies of President Barack Obama. ""To the degree that Congress is unable to act, it is clear to me that the president of the United States has got to use the powers that are in his province,"" he said in Las Vegas at a forum hosted by the advocacy group Fair Immigration Reform Movement and the magazine The Nation. The Vermont independent senator has been increasing his efforts to win over the Latino community, which largely supports immigration reform and ranks it as a higher priority -- although not usually the highest priority -- than voters at large. Though he hasn't traditionally been a major voice on immigration reform, Sanders promised to take bold action should he win the presidency. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who are also seeking the nomination, have pledged to act as well. Sanders promised Sunday at a Las Vegas rally to end ""the excessively wasteful $18 million deportation regime."" He echoed that promise on Monday, saying he would direct Immigration and Customs Enforcement ""to immediately stop initiating deportations against"" certain undocumented immigrants. He also pledged to shut down private detention centers, after he introduced a bill last month that would end private prison contracts with the government.Sanders also said he would expand on Obama's deferred actions programs for undocumented young people and parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents. That might be difficult -- although the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, is currently operating, the 2014 executive actions by Obama are blocked in the courts, continuing to put eligible parents at risk of deportation despite the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents program, or DAPA. Sanders said if he were president, DACA and DAPA would be supplemented by deportation relief for parents of DACA recipients, along with other family members and anyone who would have been eligible for legal status under the 2013 immigration reform bill that passed the Senate but never got a vote in the House.Victims of domestic violence and unaccompanied minors who came to the U.S. from Central America would be considered a distinct group for purposes of asylum, Sanders said, a policy that could make it easier for them to remain in the U.S.""This is the just and moral thing to do,"" he said. Finally, Sanders said he would ensure that women who come to the U.S. with their husbands would be able to work even if they entered because of their spouse's work visa, something many are not currently allowed to do. Sanders said he will be releasing broader immigration policies in the coming days.The candidate's executive action announcements were broadly similar to those of O'Malley and Clinton, although O'Malley frequently notes that he was the first to put out an immigration platform and has the most executive experience on those issues.All three candidates have said they would expand Obama's deportation relief policies and push for comprehensive immigration reform. O'Malley spoke at the Fair Immigration Reform Movement and The Nation forum on Sunday, and criticized Sanders and Clinton after the event. ""I think one has to ask, is this a priority for the two of them because it’s an election year or if it’s because something they truly believe in?” O’Malley said at a press conference, according to the Las Vegas Sun. All of the GOP candidates oppose Obama's executive actions on immigration, and have pledged to end the DACA and DAPA programs. "

7,RELIGION,This App Will Help You Sort Through Your Views On Dying,Jaweed Kaleem,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cake-app-death_us_564104f7e4b0b24aee4b5e07,"“One of the biggest problems right now is that even if you want to have these conversations, most of us have no idea where to start.""",2015-11-09,Cake asks people to think about what they want for their funerals as part of end-of-life planning.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5641076314000069023ca4b8.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There are apps for nearly everything -- ordering food, catching rides and finding dates, to name just a few of the common tasks people accomplish via a swipe of a screen. Now, a Boston-based company wants to make thinking about and planning for death just as simple.Cake, as in “a piece of cake,” is a website and soon-to-launch app that asks people a series of yes-or-no questions about the end of their lives in order to help them think about certain issues, plans and needs. The topics include funeral preferences and financial planning, as well as whether there are places people want to see before dying and how satisfied they would be with their relationships if they died tomorrow.The Cake questionnaire is online right now, and Suelin Chen, Cake co-founder and CEO, said the team aims to launch the Cake app within the next month. Chen developed her project in collaboration with the Innovation Hub at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.“One of the biggest problems right now is that even if you want to have these conversations, most of us have no idea where to start. It's daunting and overwhelming,” Chen said.“Even though we know ourselves, we may not truly understand our own values around end of life because most of us haven't spent much time thinking about it. We developed the app as a way to ease people into thinking about the end of life.”Chen and co-founder Mark Zhang, a palliative care specialist, said that hundreds of people have signed up for Cake online since they launched in beta testing mode in early October. She said she hopes the Cake process will help people “surface our values and remind us to focus on what's most important so that we can live better.”According to recent surveys, this kind of focus about the end of life is one that many people want but few people get. A survey from Boston-based nonprofit The Conversation Project, for example, found that 90 percent of Americans say it’s important to talk about dying with loved ones but only 30 percent have done it. Another recent poll from the Pew Research Center found more than 25 percent of U.S. adults had rarely or never given thought to what kind of care they wanted from doctors at the time of their deaths.Cake's co-founders see their project as part of the antidote to such statistics. After users go through the questionnaire, which can be completed in one sitting or in pieces, Cake generates a shareable profile. It has four parts: legacy, funeral, health and legal/financial. Depending on how a person responds, Cake suggests actions to take and summarizes views into succinct statements. “I could have a better backup plan for my life and my assets,” says one possible result under “legal/financial.” “Quality of life is more important to me than living as long as possible,” says another under “health.” Users can sign into their Cake accounts, which are free, via email or Facebook. For $99 a year, they can access a concierge version that includes email access to one-on-one Cake consultant, as well as facilitated conversations with loved ones about the end of life. During the beta period, the concierge version is free, and users can sign up at JoinCake.com.The company is also planning to sell “Cake books,” custom-designed prints of a person’s end-of-life views and preferences.The app is targeted toward users who want to talk about dying to their loved ones, as well as those who want to share their end-of life-wishes with their doctors and caretakers.“We interviewed dozens of health care professionals and routinely heard doctors say that bringing up advance care planning ‘is the hardest part of my job.’ Even doctors who are trained in how to have these conversations find it challenging to bring up,” Chen said. “Additionally, there's often not a lot of time at the doctor's office. It makes sense to provide a synchronous tools that empower people to think about things on their own and with their families while they're in the waiting room, or at home.”Chen, who previously worked as a field researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital and as a health care consultant, added that the app isn’t supposed to replace in-person conversations.Instead, ""Cake serves as an icebreaker, a resource and a launch point for conversation,"" she said."
8,BUSINESS,Some LGBT-Friendly Businesses Stayed Silent On Houston Equal Rights Ordinance,Amanda Terkel and Ruby Mellen,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lgbt-business-houston-hero_us_5640ec34e4b0411d3071ed1b,Houston voters rejected the ballot measure last week.,2015-11-09,"""No men in women's bathrooms"" became the slogan for the HERO opposition.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=crop_0_0_3484_1703%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Houston voters last week overwhelmingly rejected a city ordinance providing comprehensive nondiscrimination protections, dealing a blow to civil rights groups that had heavily campaigned for the measure. The lopsided loss came as a surprise to many, since the measure had heavy support from some big-name politicians, celebrities and companies both in Houston and nationwide. But a number of companies with heavy footprints in Houston stayed silent, despite having strong records on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights. The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance -- dubbed HERO for short -- would have barred discrimination on the basis of race, age, military status, sexual orientation, gender identity and 10 other categories. Corporations such as Apple, General Electric, Hewlett Packard and JP Morgan Chase, along with a number of Houston businesses and business groups, all announced their support for HERO. An LGBT activist involved in the HERO fight confirmed that the coalition also reached out to BP, Chevron, Deloitte and Shell to try to get their support. Those companies never came out with stances specifically on HERO. BP has its headquarters in Houston, and the other three companies are all in the top 10 biggest employers in the city. BP spokesman Brett Clanton told The Huffington Post that the company has long opposed discrimination of any kind, but did not comment specifically on HERO. ""We strive to ensure that our workforce represents the societies where we operate and reflects an environment of inclusion,"" he said. ""And we expect our community and business partners to act in a way that’s consistent with our sense of fairness and equal opportunity."" Shell spokeswoman Kelly op de Weegh stressed in a statement that the company has ""been a leader in Diversity & Inclusion practices for many years, with inclusive policies, benefits, and a workplace culture that is supportive of LGBT employees.""""Our approach to influencing externally has been to work in partnership with organizations who are experts in advocating for underrepresented groups,"" she added. Chevron and Deloitte didn't return a request for comment.The Huffington Post also reached out to Kroger, Macy's and Walmart -- which all employ thousands of people in the Houston area -- about their HERO position, but none replied. All seven of these corporations are traditionally strong gay rights allies and rank high on the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index, which grades whether corporations have LGBT-friendly policies. Walmart also spoke out when Indiana passed a ""religious freedom"" law that opened the door for businesses to discriminate against LGBT individuals. The national opposition eventually forced Gov. Mike Pence (R) to sign a revised measure that explicitly bars a business from denying services to someone on the basis of categories that include sexual orientation and gender identity.In Houston, the conservative opposition successfully shifted the focus of the HERO debate to the protections for sexual orientation and gender identity, scaring the public into thinking that male sexual predators could claim transgender status to enter women's restrooms and assault women. The proposition never specifically mentioned bathrooms. It did, however, bar discrimination in public accommodations, which include public restrooms. Although cities that have instituted nondiscrimination ordinances have not seen any increase in the number of bathroom sexual assaults, the vast majority of transgender people report facing harassment in restrooms. Nineteen states and the District of Columbia have nondiscrimination laws that cover sexual orientation and gender identity. There is no federal law protecting LGBT individuals from discrimination, although a group of lawmakers introduced a bill in July that would provide them comprehensive protections.Also on HuffPost:"

More than 4,000 Starbucks workers have already signed up, the company said. However, some Starbucks employees suggested that the program could be expanded to meet their families' needs. Veterans can already obtain bachelor's degrees through the 71-year-old G.I. Bill, so they wanted to transfer the employee benefit to their families, company spokeswoman Laurel Harper told The Huffington Post. ""Our veterans shared with us that the benefit is generous, but many weren't taking advantage of it because they had already pursued a bachelor's degree,"" Harper said  in an email. ""That's when we began the work with Arizona State University to enhance the benefit to make it more relevant to our veteran and active duty partners.""Starbucks also announced that it has surpassed the halfway mark on its goal to hire 10,000 service members by 2018. About 5,500 Starbucks employees are former and current members of the armed forces, according to the company.“We have a responsibility as a nation to honor our veterans and their families for their service and sacrifice, but it goes beyond saying thank you -- we must put our thanks into action and collectively help those who are making the transition from military to civilian life,” said Howard Schultz, Starbucks' chief executive and chairman, in a press release.“Not only do we have a moral duty to engage veterans once they leave the service, we know that doing so in a meaningful way will ultimately strengthen our nation,” he added. This Veterans Day, active duty service members, reservists, veterans and military spouses can visit their local Starbucks for a free tall brewed coffee.  Last year, the average unemployment rate for U.S. veterans was around 6 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, and it has dropped to about 5 percent this year. It's comparable to the national unemployment rate, which is also hovering around 5 percent."

As he rises in the polls, some of his rivals are attacking his past support for immigration reform.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/563f80a91400006f023ca325.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Republican rivals of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) criticized him Sunday for his history of support for immigration reform, highlighting an area of significant vulnerability for the presidential candidate as he rises in the polls.Rubio, who worked with Democrats in 2013 on a failed comprehensive immigration reform bill, has since tried to distance himself from the legislation. But Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) brought the issue to the forefront on Thursday, telling CNN that Rubio had been a core figure in the bill's creation.""He was not only totally committed -- he was in that room with us, four Democrats, four Republicans,"" Schumer said ""His fingerprints are all over that bill. It has a lot of Rubio imprints.""Asked on CNN's State of the Union whether that history would pose problems for Rubio, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) predicted it would.""He was a co-author of the bill. It was a Rubio bill. It was a Rubio-Schumer bill,"" Paul said. ""So, he does have to explain it. I think it will be a big part of things.""Paul used a question about Hillary Clinton's foreign policies to take another jab at Rubio. ""I see her and Rubio as being the same person,"" he said. ""They both want a no-fly zone. They both have supported activity in Libya, the war in Libya that toppled Gadhafi, an intervention that made us less safe. They both have supported pouring arms into the Syrian civil war, a mistake that I think allowed ISIS to grow stronger. And they both have supported the Iraq War.""Another rival, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), also keyed off on Rubio. Speaking on Fox News Sunday, Christie criticized Rubio's shift on legal protections for so-called Dreamers, undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. Rubio, who had previously said he would continue the executive program until Congress passed immigration reform, now says that it ""cannot be the permanent policy of the United States.""""I just want people to be consistent,"" Christie said in reference to Rubio's position. ""The president of the United States has signed what I consider to be illegal executive orders. Whether you agree with the underlying nature of the order or not, I don't think we should be allowing presidents to have illegal executive orders...I understand now Marco has changed his answer to say he agrees with me, so that's good."""

""After your face-to-face meeting, Putin has withdrawn from Ukraine,"" she says. ""Believe me, he does not want to be called a loser again. He cried for hours.""The national anthem has been rewritten (new lyrics: ""It's yuuuge.""), China is borrowing money from America, and Telemundo has been converted to an English-language network.The sketch ends with Trump declaring that if you think this is great, you ain't seen nothing yet. ""I said to the writers of this sketch, keep it modest, OK? It's better to start with low expectations, that way you have nowhere to go but up."" It's then revealed that the whole sequence has been a campaign ad funded by The Melania For First Lady Foundation.Trump explained at the start of the evening that he was taking part in poking fun of his own campaign ""because he could take a joke."" He has previously called himself ""an entertainer,"" when he wanted to deflect negative attention he received for a remark about Carly Fiorina's face. ""Many of those comments are made as an entertainer, because I did 'The Apprentice.' It was one of the top shows on television. I decided not to do it again because I wanted to run for president. But some comments are made as an entertainer. And, as everybody said, as an entertainer [it] is a much different ballgame.""Trump’s invitation to host was met with outrage. A coalition of Hispanic advocacy groups had publicly called for SNL to pull Trump from the show, and accused NBC of providing a platform for “hateful speech” by having him on. On Wednesday, activists presented NBCUniversal with a petition carrying 500,000 signatures, urging the network to find a different guest host.Back in June, the network announced it would no longer air the Miss Universe and Miss USA Pageants, co-owned by Trump, because of derogatory comments he made about Mexican immigrants. “When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best,” Trump said in a speech announcing his run for president. “They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.Protesters gathered outside of 30 Rock Saturday night, chanting “Hey hey, ho ho, racism has got to go!” ""Allowing Trump to host 'Saturday Night Live,' a storied comedy show, is nothing short of a slap in the face to the more than 57 million Latinos living in the U.S.,” said Brent Wilkes, the national executive director of the League of United Latin American Citizens, which organized the protest.67 Hispanic public figures signed an open letter this week denouncing Trump, and appealing to Americans to “stop tolerating his absurd views.” The Democratic National Committee piled on Saturday night with a mass email slamming Trump’s ideas on climate change and Obamacare, in addition to immigration."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has admitted that even he has been surprised by how quickly he's surged in the polls.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/563cef4f1800002a003040d6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Believe it or not, American voters aren't going to elect a president anytime soon.In fact, Americans won't choose the next White House occupant until Nov. 8, 2016, exactly one year from now. The first presidential nominating contest of the cycle will be the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1.Still, that hasn't stopped anyone from focusing on weekly polls and candidate gaffes -- all of which may mean nothing in a year. Here are a few of the stories, big and small, that have shaped the presidential cycle so far.Clinton's EmailsDemocratic candidate Hillary Clinton has had to answer questions about her exclusive use of a private email account while she was secretary of state. The New York Times first reported on it in March, and Clinton initially downplayed the issue, saying she simply used a personal account out of convenience, followed regulations and had turned over all of her work-related emails to the State Department. After launching her campaign, she continued to dismiss the controversy, saying her email use didn't matter to voters and even joking about the controversy. At the beginning of September, Clinton finally apologized for her private email use. The FBI is investigating whether sensitive material was improperly stored on Clinton's private server, and the State Department is slowly making Clinton's messages public.Even though the issue has dragged on, it has sometimes played to Clinton's advantage. The former secretary of state gave an impressive performance last month when she testified for 11 hours before the House Select Committee on Benghazi, which initially discovered her personal email use. There was also loud applause during last month's Democratic debate when her Democratic challenger, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), said Americans were ""sick and tired of hearing about [Clinton's] damn emails."" Sanders has since said, however, that the investigation into Clinton's emails should continue.Sanders' SurgeWhen the self-described democratic socialist launched his campaign, he was considered a long shot. But to the surprise of many, including Sanders himself, he has surged in crucial early states such as Iowa and New Hampshire, has had impressive grassroots fundraising, and is seen as Clinton's biggest rival for the Democratic nomination, though the senator still trails Clinton nationally.Despite her lead, Clinton has attacked Sanders for his record on gun control and suggested he has used certain rhetoric because she is a woman.Carson Can't Help HimselfThe former neurosurgeon has surged in the polls lately, but the veracity of his inspiring life story has come under fire.Politico reported Friday that Carson had never applied to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, even though he wrote in his memoir, Gifted Hands, that he was offered a full scholarship to the school. The candidate later told The New York Times that he received an informal offer to get into West Point, which covers the cost of tuition for its students, but did not pursue it.Carson also reversed course on an incident in the book that describes him as trying to stab another child, after CNN and other media outlets questioned it. He now says it was a relative, not a close friend, whom he tried to stab.The Republican, who's leading in polls of Iowa voters, has also had to confront statements he made in a 1998 commencement address in which he said the Egyptian pyramids had been built to store grain.Carson insulted several different groups of people in the course of his campaign. After Houston voters did not support an anti-discrimination ballot measure amid fears that it would allow predatory men in women's bathrooms, Carson said that it ""wasn't fair"" for transgender people ""to make everyone else uncomfortable.""In September, Carson said he could not support a Muslim president because the religion is at odds with the U.S. Constitution.The candidate also said he would have done more to fight off the shooter during a deadly rampage at Oregon's Umpqua Community College.""I would not just stand there and let him shoot me,"" he said. ""I would say, 'Hey, guys, everybody attack him. He may shoot me, but he can’t get us all.'""But Carson wasn't done yet. He also suggested the Holocaust could have been prevented if Jews had guns.Trump's CampaignFrom the moment Donald Trump launched his GOP campaign and insulted Mexicans immigrating to the United States, the billionaire has been the center of attention.“When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best ... They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems,"" he said during his presidential announcement. ""They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”NBC dropped its business relationship with Trump over the comments, while Univision said it would no longer air his Miss USA pageant. (Trump is suing the latter.)But that was just the beginning for Trump. In July, he criticized Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who was a Vietnam War prisoner, saying, ""He's a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured.""But the comment, condemned by many Republicans, didn't seem to harm Trump's status as the GOP front-runner. Neither did comments he made after the first Republican debate in August, when he accused Fox News host Megyn Kelly of treating him unfairly in the debate.""You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes. Blood coming out of her -- wherever,"" he told CNN after the debate. His campaign later dismissed the suggestion that Trump was referring to menstruation.During the first debate, Trump also refused to promise that he would support the eventual Republican nominee, setting off some speculation that he would consider an independent bid. Trump later put an end to the speculation and signed a Republican National Committee pledge to support the eventual nominee.He has also consistently lobbed insults at his GOP rivals, calling former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush ""low energy"" and implying Sen. Rand Paul was ugly. He also insulted former Hewlett-Packard executive Carly Fiorina in an interview with Rolling Stone, saying, ""Look at that face! Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?!""Black Lives Matter VisibilityThe Black Lives Matter group has been visible on the campaign trail, interrupting events by Democratic presidential hopefuls Clinton, Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley. In July, Sanders and O'Malley were both interrupted by protesters at an event (Clinton did not attend), and O'Malley was booed for saying that ""all lives matter"" -- a comment he said immediately afterward was not meant to offend anyone.Sanders was also interrupted during an August event and released a statement afterward saying he was ""disappointed"" by the disruption. Sanders has since moved to improve his relationship with the group, releasing a criminal justice reform platform and meeting with activists privately. Clinton and O'Malley have met with Black Lives Matter activists, who have also requested meetings with Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Carson.Bush Can't Decide His Position On IraqBefore he officially announced he was running for president, the former Florida governor told Fox News' Megyn Kelly, for some reason, that even with the benefit of hindsight, he still would have invaded Iraq. Bush was quickly criticized by conservatives for the comment, and let a week pass before saying that, had he known what we know now, he would not have invaded the country.The 14th AmendmentOver the summer, the Republican field of presidential candidates grew interested in repealing the 14th amendment, which guarantees citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil, regardless of whether their parents are citizens. Trump called it ""the biggest magnet for illegal immigration"" and several other candidates followed suit, saying the issue needed to be re-examined.Christie's Plan For Tracking Undocumented ImmigrantsThe New Jersey governor in August proposed an unusual way to track individuals who have overstayed their visas in the United States.""So here's what I'm gonna do if I'm president. I'm gonna ask Fred Smith, the founder of FedEx, come work for the governor for three months. Just come for three months to Immigration and Customs Enforcement and show these people,"" Chris Christie said.""We need to have a system that tracks you from the moment you come in,"" he continued. ""And then when your time is up ... then we go get you. Tap you on the shoulder and say, 'Excuse me, thanks for coming, time to go.'""Christie later clarified his comments, saying it was ridiculous to think he was comparing people to packages and specifying that he wants to use fingerprint technology to track immigrants.Rubio's Attendance RecordRubio has an awful attendance record in the Senate, something he has defended by arguing that his time is best used doing things other than showing up for votes. That absenteeism has not sat well with some, including the Florida Sun Sentinel editorial board, which wrote that Rubio should resign his Senate seat while he campaigns.But Rubio has also been able to use the attacks to his advantage. When Bush suggested during an October debate that the senator should resign his seat, Rubio turned the attack against his fellow Floridian.“Someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you,"" Rubio said.Biden Weighs Another Presidential RunOver the summer, the vice president was considering whether to run for president again. The speculation increased after it was rumored that Joe Biden's late son Beau had asked his dad to run for president on his deathbed and after the vice president made public comments that seemed to be attacking Clinton.But Biden ultimately decided not to run, saying in October that the window for him had closed.Bashing The MediaThe Republican presidential candidates claimed they weren't being treated fairly during an October debate, even though some of the questions were perfectly substantive. The candidates were so upset that they met and compiled a list of demands to send the Republican National Committee for future debates, though some candidates eventually refused to sign the letter. RNC Chairman Reince Priebus also suspended the committee's partnership with NBC News, which was slated to host another debate in February.Some Candidates Haven't Made ItThe most surprising early exit from the presidential race was Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R), once considered to be a favorite for the GOP nomination. Walker dropped out of the race on Sept. 21 amid dismal poll numbers. When he announced that he was suspending his campaign, Walker called on more candidates in the GOP field to drop out so the party could unite against Trump. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) also dropped out of the race. On the Democratic side, former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee, former Sen. Jim Webb (Va.) and Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig have dropped out.Also on HuffPost:"
