Chuck Grassley, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, says he won't schedule hearings for Obama's Supreme Court pick because the next president should get to fill the court seat. That's unprecedented.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586d812e15000037069174d9.jpeg?ops=crop_315_0_4011_2722%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) is best known in Washington these days as the Judiciary Committee chairman refusing to give a hearing to President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee.But back in his home state, two former top government officials are wondering what happened to the Grassley they used to know: a legislator who proudly helped take politics out of the state's judicial confirmation process.Republican Joy Corning and Democrat Sally Pederson, both former Iowa lieutenant governors, are teaming up to try to convince Grassley to hold hearings for Obama's court pick, Merrick Garland. They held a Thursday press event in Des Moines to remind him of his roots.""You voted in favor of Iowa's constitutional amendment that took campaign politics out of Iowa's judicial system,"" said Corning, citing a 2014 interview in which Grassley boasted about voting as a state lawmaker to prevent political parties from nominating judges. ""You express great pride in that vote, and I quote, 'It was a very forward-looking thing to do what we did 50 years ago.'""That's a sharp contrast to what's happening today, she said.""Throughout your career, Chuck, you have been a fair-minded, common-sense consensus builder,"" the former GOP official continued. ""Refusing to fill the Supreme Court vacancy is none of those things.""Pederson said Grassley has a unique opportunity to break the standoff on Capitol Hill and use his leadership position to move the process forward.""The senator's opposition [to hearings] is troubling,"" she said. ""Moreover, this is not the Chuck Grassley we thought we knew.""Both Corning and Pederson know Grassley from their overlapping political careers. Corning was Iowa's lieutenant governor from 1991-1999; Pederson held the post from 1999-2007. Grassley has been a senator since 1981.The two women are leading a group, Justice Not Politics, to further their cause. Their nonpartisan coalition represents tens of thousands of Iowans who think courts should be free of political and financial influence.HuffPost asked the pair, via phone, what they thought could ultimately sway Grassley on the issue.""He needs to hear from the public,"" Pederson said. ""He's going to be back in Iowa holding town hall meetings. I think this is a topic that's going to come up.""The Senate is about to go on recess for two weeks, which means Grassley and other senators will be back home meeting with constituents. Corning agreed that if the Iowa senator hears their thoughts on the Supreme Court fight, it could make him reconsider his hardline position.""We know that a majority of Iowans think this is what should happen,"" she said.A Grassley spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.CORRECTION: A previous version of this article stated that Joy Corning was Iowa's lieutenant governor from 1981-1999. She became lieutenant governor in 1991. "

His remarks on the same day Michelle Obama launched a new Let Girls Learn initiative in Austin at the South by Southwest conference earlier that morning.President Obama discussed important topics including equal pay, education for women around the world and the online harassment women face far too often on the Internet.""One thing I’ve been thinking about this past week is the unique challenges women face in the virtual world,"" Obama told the crowd, made up of historic women like Cecile Richards, Nancy Pelosi and the first female NFL coach Jennifer Welter. ""Last Friday, I was at South by Southwest, where the epidemic of online harassment was a topic of discussion. We know that women gamers face harassment and stalking and threats of violence from other players. When they speak out about their experiences, they’re attacked on Twitter and other social media outlets, even threatened in their homes.""The president highlighted how many women are speaking out against this online harassment every day -- and why their activism is so important:What’s brought these issues to light is that there are a lot of women out there, especially young women, who are speaking out bravely about their experiences, even when they know they’ll be attacked for it -- from feminist bloggers who refuse to be silenced, to women sports reporters who are opening up about the extreme safety precautions they need to take when traveling for work. Every day, women of all ages and all backgrounds and walks of life are speaking out. And by telling their stories, by you telling your stories, women are lifting others out of the shadows and raising our collective consciousness about a problem that affects all of us.He added that the Internet is a public space ""where women have every right to exist freely and safely"" without fear of harassment or violent responses of any kind.Skip forward to the 40 minute mark to see President Obama's full speech. (Story continues below.) ""Obviously, this is not unique to the Internet,"" Obama added. ""Women have been up against this kind of nonsense since the beginning of time. As long as women have dared to enter the public space -- whether they’re fighting for their rights or simply walking the streets, there have been times where they’ve been harassed by those who apparently see the mere presence of women as a threat."" Obama said that while it's important for women to continue to speak up about online harassment, it's also integral that men join in. ""This is not just the role for women,"" he said. ""It's about men speaking up and demanding better of themselves and their peers, their sons, their friends, their coworkers. Because we’re all in this together."""

Thomas Webber, 71, grew up outside Buffalo, New York, but moved to Syria in 1975 when he was offered a teaching position at an American school there. He's lived in the country ever since.Many American expats left Syria as civil war broke out in 2011, but Webber has no plans to leave. ""I have the choice of any country, including America, and I choose to stay here,"" Webber told The Associated Press earlier this month. ""It's part of my heart now.""In an interview with BBC on Thursday, Webber said the cease-fire agreement between world powers that went into effect last month has increased stability in the region to the point that he actually feels more secure in Syria than he would in the United States. ""Since the cease-fire, I feel safer, believe it or not. I feel safer in Damascus than I do in any American city,"" Webber said. ""In Damascus, I know who has the guns. In America, everybody has a gun. And in America, you have these very strange people firing on a school, on a cinema, [on the] streets of every major city in America. It's really a shame.""Listen to Webber's interview with the BBC above.American gun violence has killed thousands, but the Syrian civil war is still more deadly. According to the Gun Violence Archive, firearms killed about 13,398 people in the U.S. in 2015. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group, estimates 20,977 civilians were killed in Syria's civil war last year. Webber is not naive about the realities of Syria's violent conflict, which has left close to half a million dead and prompted millions of Syrians to flee the country and seek refuge elsewhere. ""We've had our fair share of rockets and mortar shells coming in,"" Webber said. ""I've had two neighbors that have passed away -- shrapnel from a rocket fire that hit a rooftop."" Webber is optimistic that the ongoing peace negotiations in Geneva will ultimately succeed.""The Syrian people are tired right now, they're very tired, five years of civil war,"" he said. ""I feel we're going to have a very long-lasting peace coming in a very, very short period of time."" "

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) faced off in Illinois' primary Tuesday. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_0_443_5147_2930%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton defeated Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in Illinois’ Democratic presidential primary Tuesday.Sanders was previously trailing Clinton by double digits in polls of the state's Democratic voters, but the race appeared to tighten in the last two weeks. Clinton led Sanders, 50.5 percent to 48.7 percent, with 99 percent of the state's precincts reporting.Clinton, who was born in the Chicago suburb of Park Ridge, highlighted Sanders' votes against gun safety measures and his mixed record on immigration reform while campaigning in the state. She also touted her own criminal justice reform and education policies.Her campaign had worried recently that she would lose Illinois to Sanders on Tuesday, along with Missouri and Ohio. The Clinton campaign was more confident that they’d win North Carolina and Florida, which also held primaries the same day, and emerge with more delegates thanks to victories in those states. Clinton had 768 unpledged delegates to Sanders’ 554 heading into Tuesday’s contests. That figure doesn't take into account her large lead among super delegates, the elected officials and party leaders who aren’t tied to the candidate who wins their state. In Illinois, Sanders’ campaign emphasized Clinton’s ties to Chicago’s deeply unpopular Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who endorsed her in 2014 and served with her in President Barack Obama’s administration, in the hopes of peeling off support from African-American and Latino voters who distrust Emanuel’s administration. Clinton has sought to distance herself from Emanuel following revelations that city officials withheld dashcam footage that showed a police officer shooting Laquan McDonald 16 times as the teenager walked away. While Clinton expressed confidence in Emanuel in early December, she also called for a federal inquiry into the October 2014 shooting and its aftermath. The mayor was resisting such an investigation, but Clinton said Emanuel had to prove his credibility in reforming the city's criminal justice system and be held to the standard of ""complete and total reform.""Sanders' campaign ran television ads in Illinois featuring Chuy Garcia, the Cook County commissioner who unsuccessfully challenged Emanuel for the mayoral job last year, and Chicago school principal Troy LaRaviere, who criticized Clinton in his spot.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) by 14 percent in polls of the state's voters. Trump, who has won nine other Southern states, will scoop up most of North Carolina’s 72 delegates.During a stump speech in Fayetteville on Mar. 9, Trump assured attendees that he would “bring jobs back” to a state where many factory jobs have been outsourced to cheaper foreign markets. North Carolina voters will play a larger role in determining the nominee this year than they have in years past. In 2013, the state’s general assembly decided to hold the presidential primary in March instead of in May, when the nominee will be pretty much solidified. Each candidate will pick up delegates in North Carolina since there is no eligibility threshold. Delegates will be divvied up based on the order candidates finish in the primary.There are 358 delegates up for grabs on Tuesday, between North Carolina, Illinois, Missouri, Ohio and Florida.Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

Once the officer got a good look at Nayeri, it sparked an immediate chase -- as luck would have it, right toward the police station.After Nayeri’s capture, Hay-Chapman led the officer back to the white van where they found Tieu inside.Prior to their Jan. 22 escape, Nayeri was being held on aggravated mayhem, kidnapping and torture charges. Tieu was being held on gang-related murder and attempted-murder charges.""Mr. Hay-Chapman's information directly led to the capture of Nayeri and Tieu,” the county’s Board of Supervisors stated last month while recognizing his actions. “His assistance protected public safety by giving law enforcement information it needed to take dangerous fugitives off of the streets and put them back behind bars.""Speaking to the Chronicle a few days after the pair’s capture, Hay-Chapman said he was aware of the potential reward money but said, ""that didn't matter."" ""I was just doing the right thing,"" he said.Still, when asked what he'd do with the money if rewarded, he told ABC he'd use it to start a new life for himself and his two adult children and grandchildren.His 33-year-old daughter suffered a brain hemorrhage at birth and was left severely disabled. His 30-year-old son has meanwhile struggled with drug addiction, so much so that it led to him losing custody of his two children, he told the Chronicle.Before suffering a back injury, Hay-Chapman told the Chronicle that he was a carpenter, a heating and air conditioning installer, a vault locksmith and worked as a hotel night manager.Last week the board approved awarding three others with $50,000 between them for providing information in the case. Hazel Javier will be given $15,000, Jeffrey Arana, $15,000, and Armando Damien, $20,000."

Once the officer got a good look at Nayeri, it sparked an immediate chase -- as luck would have it, right toward the police station.After Nayeri’s capture, Hay-Chapman led the officer back to the white van where they found Tieu inside.Prior to their Jan. 22 escape, Nayeri was being held on aggravated mayhem, kidnapping and torture charges. Tieu was being held on gang-related murder and attempted-murder charges.""Mr. Hay-Chapman's information directly led to the capture of Nayeri and Tieu,” the county’s Board of Supervisors stated last month while recognizing his actions. “His assistance protected public safety by giving law enforcement information it needed to take dangerous fugitives off of the streets and put them back behind bars.""Speaking to the Chronicle a few days after the pair’s capture, Hay-Chapman said he was aware of the potential reward money but said, ""that didn't matter."" ""I was just doing the right thing,"" he said.Still, when asked what he'd do with the money if rewarded, he told ABC he'd use it to start a new life for himself and his two adult children and grandchildren.His 33-year-old daughter suffered a brain hemorrhage at birth and was left severely disabled. His 30-year-old son has meanwhile struggled with drug addiction, so much so that it led to him losing custody of his two children, he told the Chronicle.Before suffering a back injury, Hay-Chapman told the Chronicle that he was a carpenter, a heating and air conditioning installer, a vault locksmith and worked as a hotel night manager.Last week the board approved awarding three others with $50,000 between them for providing information in the case. Hazel Javier will be given $15,000, Jeffrey Arana, $15,000, and Armando Damien, $20,000."

They each face 10 charges, including three first-degree assault charges and six attempted murder charges, as well as conspiracy to commit murder, Alsobrooks said.The three are being held without bond, she said.There were six officers involved in the incident and some of them have not provided statements, officials said.The entire department is receiving counseling, Stawinski said. Forensic analysis is expected to be concluded on Wednesday, he said.(Reporting by Suzannah Gonzales in Chicago and Joseph Ax in New York; Editing by Scott Malone and Peter Cooney)"
12,POLITICS,Democrats Roll Out Plan To Tackle Wage Theft,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wage-theft_us_56e97793e4b065e2e3d80659,They want to increase penalties on employers who rip off their workers.,2016-03-16,Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said the bill would empower workers who aren't being paid fairly and even the playing field for businesses that are doing the right thing.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Democrats in Congress say it's time to crack down on wage theft.On Wednesday, three lawmakers introduced a proposal aimed at discouraging unscrupulous employers from shorting their workers on pay. The bill, called the Wage Theft Prevention and Wage Recovery Act, would ramp up the penalties for wage theft and make it easier for workers to recoup what they're owed.Under the current law, employees who aren't paid for all their hours are only legally due the minimum wage -- at least $7.25 per hour -- or, in the case of overtime hours, time-and-a-half pay. The Democrats' bill, however, would make employers liable for the full, agreed-upon wage for which someone was working, be it $7.25 or far greater. The bill would also mandate that employers provide their workers with regular paystubs -- something not currently required under federal law -- and fine them if they don't do so.In addition, the bill would jack up the damages and civil penalties on employers who commit wage theft. It would create a new civil penalty of $2,000 for employers who fail to pay the minimum wage or the overtime rate, while also vastly hiking the current penalty for repeat offenders. The bill would boost the civil damages available to workers from double the wages they're owed to triple.The proposal was introduced by Sens. Patty Murray (Wash.) and Sherrod Brown (Ohio) in the Senate and Rep. Rosa DeLauro (Conn.) in the House. In a statement, Murray said the legislation would discourage wage theft and make the system fairer for businesses that already do right by their employees.“This bill would help even the playing field for the vast majority of businesses that are treating their workers fairly, and it would empower more workers by making sure their paychecks reflect the hours and hard work they put in on the job,"" she said.Even if it gains widespread Democratic support, it's unlikely the legislation will go anywhere while the GOP controls both chambers of Congress. Republicans have been loathe to place any new regulations on private-sector businesses during the Obama era, especially ones that come with fines attached to them. That said, some GOP members have supported smaller measures aimed at curbing wage theft among federal contractors. Business groups would lobby hard against the Democratic proposal were it to start moving anywhere. They may find one particular provision especially threatening: a change to federal law that would make it easier for workers to join group lawsuits over wage theft. Rather than requiring workers to ""opt in"" to such a suit like under current law, the proposal would allow for class-action suits in which workers must ""opt out"" of them -- thereby increasing the number of plaintiffs suing the employer. Reliable statistics on wage theft are hard to come by, in part because many workers don't report it for fear they'll lose their jobs or have their hours cut. But a 2009 study of low-wage industries in three cities found that roughly a quarter of those surveyed said they were paid less than the minimum wage at some point the week prior. Three-quarters said they weren't paid the full time-and-half overtime rate for hours worked over 40 in the week."

John Kasich, right, speaks as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) listens during a Republican presidential debate earlier this month.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Tuesday's primaries led to Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) dropping out and Ohio Gov. John Kasich winning his first state. But the contests also left the Republican Party largely in a state of limbo, poised between the prospects of a controversial front-runner and a divisive nominating convention fight. Republicans may be willing to fall in line behind businessman Donald Trump if he wins the nomination, but many would rather not have to make that decision. In exit polls to date, between 43 percent and 60 percent of GOP primary voters have said they would be satisfied to have him as their nominee. While Trump's remaining rivals aren't any more broadly popular than he is, that's significantly lower than the 62 percent to 85 percent of Democrats who'd be content to see former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton lead their ticket. In a new HuffPost/YouGov survey, conducted prior to Tuesday's primaries, fully half of all registered voters who belong to or lean toward the Republican Party still say they'd prefer to see someone besides Trump as the party nominee this year. Among that group of GOP voters, 79 percent believe any of Trump's remaining rivals would make a better nominee.That adds up to nearly 40 percent of the GOP electorate that views Trump as the worst of all possible primary options.Those numbers reflect a remarkable level of unpopularity for a party front-runner, marking Trump as significantly more divisive than past candidates such as John McCain and Mitt Romney. They also speak to the growing disharmony within the Republican Party.Thinking Trump would be a weak nominee, though, isn't necessarily the same as thinking he'd be a catastrophic one. Just 34 percent of GOP voters say Trump's nomination would be bad for the Republican Party, while 27 percent say it would be bad for America.Only 36 percent think Trump's Republican rivals should work together to try to stop him from winning the nomination. A 52 percent majority -- including, unsurprisingly, nearly all of Trump's supporters, oppose such an effort. An ABC/Washington Post poll conducted earlier in March found similar results, with 53 percent of Republicans opposing the idea of a contested convention.That a paper-thin majority of GOP voters don't want to see Trump brought down isn't exactly a ringing endorsement, of course. But it does underscore that many Republicans would also be deeply dissatisfied to see the party openly colluding against him.The outcome of the Republican nomination remains very much up in the air. Regardless of what happens, though, it's likely to leave an unusually large share of the party heading into the general election race on unhappy terms.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted March 11-15 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov's nationally representative opinion polling.

15,BUSINESS,Investing Advice For Women Isn’t Sexist; It’s A Necessary Corrective,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sallie-krawcheck-women-finances_us_56e98d89e4b065e2e3d81e2d,Wall Street legend Sallie Krawcheck explains.,2016-03-16,Sallie Krawcheck's experience on Wall Street led her to found an online investing platform targeting women.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56e9911c1e0000b300704616.jpeg?cache=EJL5nZF4fJ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sallie Krawcheck, at one time widely considered the most powerful woman on Wall Street, was fired twice from high-profile banking jobs, partly, she believes, because she was a woman.""It wasn’t as though the boss said, 'We don’t like female parts,'"" she told The Huffington Post recently. It was, according to Krawcheck, because she took an approach to business that she has since come to believe is inherently female -- focusing on long-term goals and relationships. (There was also a lot of office politics at play, to be sure.)The ""women are different"" theory is now driving the 51-year-old's second act. Krawcheck has founded Ellevest, an online investing platform targeting women. Women do not invest their money at the same rate as men. The reason for this is up for debate; while some believe women are risk-averse, others note that they simply earn less money than men. Krawcheck has a different take: Women simply face different challenges -- like financing long career breaks for care-taking, paying for maternity leave, living longer than men, etc.The new site is still in beta mode, with a launch planned for later this year. Krawcheck also chairs Ellevate, a women's networking company. HuffPost talked to her recently about women, Wall Street and why we’re more likely to want to have a beer with the guy running JPMorgan than with Hillary Clinton.Why don’t women invest as much as men?Wall Street is for men by men, I like to joke. I know lots of outstanding financial advisers who do a great job for women, but overall the industry does a great job for men. CNBC looks a lot like ESPN. The goal of investing is beating the market. It’s male. It feels competitive. When you speak to women about investing, they rarely talk about beating the market. Women talk about what they want to do in life and how investing can help them get there.Doesn’t creating an investing company targeting women specifically just serve to keep the financial industry male dominated?For years, I bristled at the idea that women would need their own thing. Well-intentioned journalists would say we need more hand-holding. We need simple. That’s not it. Women’s needs are different. What do I mean? We talk about the cost of a career break. That’s not something men grapple with. Women on average take breaks of up to 11 years and they are extraordinarily expensive. Another issue that impacts women more is not having mandated parental leave.You talk about how the retirement crisis is a big women’s issue.It is an insight I had a year ago when I was putting on my mascara one morning. We retire with two-thirds of the money that men have -- and we live longer.If we cast retirement as a gender issue, the solution becomes about keeping women in the workforce, mandating parental leave, helping women invest more -- all of which can help grow the economy. The solutions go from depressing to pretty much all positive.Aren’t I better off just putting my money into a low-fee index fund, rather than letting a so-called expert pick stocks for me and charge higher fees?Over time, if investing is your only goal, yes you are better off putting your savings into a diversified low-fee index fund. That is the portfolio that we will use. I would say advisers can bring other capabilities to bear. For example, there is enormous value in a financial plan. It’s hard to go where you want to go, if you don’t know where you are going.What was it like to be a young woman on Wall Street when you were starting out in the '80s? How do you think it’s changed?It was outwardly hostile. I was left with a Xerox copy of male parts on my desk every morning. I don’t believe that happens now. All those guys who were hazing you back then probably run things now.Your theory may be correct, but when I go person by person I don’t know where they are. Does it ever frustrate you that for all your success, people still keep asking you “how do you do it” and “tell us about being a woman”?Not at all. Because when I was in my 20s. Even in my 30s, there were so few female role models. When I would look around, I couldn’t see a path forward. I remember working at Salomon in London and being literally the senior woman there. I am really always very happy to talk about how I did it and how I didn’t do it and the approach, because there still aren’t enough role models. The percentage of women in C-suites and in boardrooms is still absurdly low. Why?If there were an answer, well-meaning people would have closed the gap. Some part is not mandating parental leave and that women don’t make it through the funnel [to the top]. Some is inherent gender bias. Likability and success in men is positively correlated. Think Jamie Dimon, you want to have a beer with him. [Editor’s note: Nope.] It’s inversely correlated for women; think Hillary Clinton. Men and women both have biases like this. My mother told me, ""I’m not going to vote for Hillary. She’s too ambitious."" I said, ""Mom, hello?"" She said, ""You do it in a nicer way, honey.""This interview has been edited for clarity and length.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated Krawcheck's role with Ellevate. She runs the organization but is not a founder."

And since the Senate will not be acting on this nomination, he would not be holding a perfunctory meeting, but he wished Judge Garland well,"" McConnell spokesman Don Stewart said in a statement.Garland is known as a moderate and his nomination was a bit of a letdown to many in his base who wanted a strong progressive -- and ideally, someone who would add to the diversity of the court.""It's deeply disappointing that President Obama failed to use this opportunity to add the voice of another progressive woman of color to the Supreme Court, and instead put forward a nominee seemingly designed to appease intransigent Republicans rather than inspire the grassroots he'll need to get that nominee through the Senate gauntlet,"" said Charles Chamberlain, executive director of Democracy for America. “Judge Garland's background does not suggest he will be a progressive champion and he is not the justice a conservative Republican would have nominated, but it is Pres. Obama's Constitutional duty to nominate Supreme Court justices, and he is clearly qualified,"" CREDO Political Director Murshed Zaheed said in a statement. Garland has actually earned strong support from Republicans in the past -- including Hatch himself. Last week, Hatch basically dared Obama to nominate Garland, whom the Senate confirmed to the D.C. Circuit in 1997 on a bipartisan 76-23 vote.""The President told me several times he’s going to name a moderate [to fill the court vacancy], but I don’t believe him,"" Hatch told Newsmax. ""[Obama] could easily name Merrick Garland, who is a fine man.""And name him he did.

Indeed, the Republican statements opposing Obama's nominee often didn't even mention Garland and certainly didn't go after his qualifications. ""This has never been about who the nominee is. It is about a basic principle,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said. In other words, if Democrats prevail in the November elections, Republicans may want to confirm Garland, recognizing that the next president may nominate someone with a far more progressive record.And presumably, all the Republican senators who lose their reelection bids will sit out the vote, since the people will have spoken.

Even as the world eagerly awaited Donald Trump's election night address in his nearby Mar-a-Lago resort, things were whisper-quiet in the real estate magnate's eponymous property. The club's bar was entirely empty, save for a woman wearing a white ""MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN"" hat ordering celebratory Champagne. The TV was tuned to a college basketball game, even as Fox News was calling the Sunshine State for the former ""Apprentice"" host. It might have been the only bit of peace and civility to prevail in Trumpland this week. With the GOP primary possibly ending in a contested convention, the likelihood of Trump's already disgruntled and sometimes violent constituency growing more volatile will grow ever more likely.If the mood at Trump's events are any indication, his supporters might be spoiling for a literal fight. During Trump's rally in Boca Raton on Sunday, his supporters were already anticipating the unrest that could result from an attempt to hand the party's nomination to someone with less success in the primaries.Ron Royce, a DJ who was sporting a leather jacket with the words ""OBAMA SUCKS"" scrawled on the back in white paint, foresees a level of discord not witnessed since the 1968 Democratic National Convention erupted in violence over Vice President Hubert Humphrey's nomination.""That was the Democratic Party. Democrats are the only ones that riot. Republicans don’t riot. This time they might,"" he mused. “There’s gonna be pandemonium on the floor between all those delegates. They’re gonna start some shit.”That sentiment was echoed by John Germita, a New York City transplant who had affixed a Trump bumper to his shirt and was carrying a Trump yard sign.""I don’t know if there would be violence, but it would be a big problem,” he speculated. “People are gonna go crazy. I will, anyway.”Trump himself seemed to parrot Royce's and Germita's statements on Wednesday, speculating during a CNN interview that a contested convention would give rise to ""riots.""""I think you would have riots,"" he said. ""If you disenfranchise those people, and you say, 'Well, I’m sorry, but you’re 100 votes short, even though the next one is 500 votes short,' I think you would have problems like you’ve never seen before. I think bad things would happen.""""I wouldn’t lead it, but I think bad things would happen,"" he continued.Trump's comments mirror his previous reactions to unruly behavior. A number of protesters and reporters have been physically mistreated by Trump supporters and staff, prompting sometimes blithe, and other times downright supportive, responses from the candidate, who promised to pay for any legal fees incurred by indicted supporters.Indeed, in a strong rebuke to the media, Trump not only appeared onstage Tuesday night with his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski -- who has been charged with assault for violently grabbing a Breitbart reporter -- but thanked him for a job well done, prompting pointed reactions in the press.The issue of violence will likely stay front and center as Trump attempts to solidify his hold on the GOP nomination. His two remaining challengers, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, have both made issues of Trump's control of his supporters, or lack thereof, a central point of their attempts to deny him the nomination, either through primaries or in Cleveland this July.“I will be … forced going forward to talk about some of the deep concerns I have about the way this campaign has been run by some others -- by one other, in particular,” Kasich told reporters on Tuesday.Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."
19,BUSINESS,The Federal Reserve Holds Off On Interest Rate Hike,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/federal-reserve-holds-off-on-interest-rate-hike_us_56e97729e4b0b25c9184039e,Good news for consumers -- and possibly for Hillary Clinton.,2016-03-16,Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen speaking at a press conference on Wednesday after the Fed announced that the benchmark interest rate will not rise.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56e9b8f8150000ad000b2422.jpeg?cache=7Qj6IyTb3U&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Federal Reserve announced on Wednesday that it is leaving its benchmark interest rate unchanged, a move designed to encourage recently robust job creation to continue.The decision by the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank panel charged with adjusting its influential federal funds rate, means Americans will likely avoid paying higher interest rates on their mortgages, car payments and other loans.The influential federal funds rate, or the interest rate banks charge one another for overnight lending, will remain at a target range of 0.25 to 0.5 percent. The Fed raises the interest rate to head off rising price inflation by slowing the pace of job market growth.“With appropriate monetary policy, we continue to expect moderate economic growth, further labor market improvement and a return of inflation to our 2 percent objective in 2-3 years,” Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen said at a press conference announcing the decision. “However, global economic and financial developments continue to pose risks.”The last time the Fed raised the federal funds rate was in December, the first time since the 2008 financial crisis. It is a testament to the tenuous state of the economic recovery eight years later that the Fed is still exercising so much caution.Wednesday's decision was widely expected, in light of modestly gloomier global economic conditions and lackluster U.S. wage growth.As investors have become more anxious, credit has become harder to obtain in the United States. The tighter lending had the same depressing effect on the economy as a 1 percentage point Fed rate hike, according to economists at Goldman Sachs.The dollar also continues to rise relative to foreign currencies, making U.S. exports less competitive.And while the U.S. economy continues to produce jobs consistently, wages declined in February.Yellen acknowledged that the robust job market had yet to produce significant wage growth.“I must say, I do see broad-based improvement in the labor market and I’m somewhat surprised we’re not seeing more of a pickup in wage growth,” she said. “It is one of the factors that suggests to me there is continued slack in the labor market.”Inflation is finally approaching the Fed’s 2 percent target, however, indicating that the Fed may soon have the evidence it needs to raise the interest rate when the FOMC meets again in April.The price of consumer goods, excluding food and energy, rose 1.7 percent growth in the 12 months ending in January, according to the price index favored by the Fed.Indeed, all ten sitting members of the FOMC, as well as the seven regional Federal Reserve bank presidents not on the committee, believe economic conditions will allow for an interest rate hike before the year's end.The 17 officials' predictions, however, released in a survey known as the ""dot plot,"" show greater pessimism about the economy than when the Fed last met. The officials' median projection is that the Fed will raise the interest rate to 0.9 percent by the end of 2016, compared with the December 2015 median projection of 1.4 percent.One sitting FOMC member, Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank President Esther George, voted against the decision, favoring a 0.25 percent rate hike at this time.In a week dominated by presidential election and Supreme Court nomination news, the Fed’s announcement stands to draw only moderate attention. But the lack of a rate hike, which gives the economy more leeway to grow unencumbered, is probably good news for Hillary Clinton’s presidential candidacy. The putative Democratic front-runner is poised to benefit from a positive economic outlook, since voters are more likely to return an incumbent party to power if the economy is doing well.Public opinion polls and the populist electoral mood in both political parties suggest that voters still do not feel their economic fortunes palpably improving, despite a record streak of job growth. Many analysts argue that the lack of a political upside to the high-performing economy is because Americans are, on average, not making much more money.That is why progressive economists and activist groups have been calling on the Fed to allow unemployment to dip even lower, so employers will begin raising wages more significantly in order to compete for workers.The progressive Fed Up coalition, comprising groups representing low-income workers and communities of color, is calling on the Fed not to raise the benchmark interest rate at all in 2016.“The Fed needs to connect the dots with reality: involuntary part-time work is still almost double pre-recession levels, labor force participation rates are still low, Black unemployment is more than double white unemployment and Latino unemployment and underemployment is still at crisis levels, and wage growth is almost non-existent,” Dushaw Hockett, executive director of SPACES, a Washington, D.C. community group that is part of the Fed Up coalition, said in a statement. “Rather than slowing down progress, the Fed should do all it can to facilitate growth in 2016 and beyond.”"

He named Kathryn Dominguez, a University of Michigan economist, as a nominee this past July. Senate Banking Committee Chair Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said on Tuesday that he would not hold hearings on either of the two nominees until the White House names a vice chair for supervision at the Fed, a regulatory post required under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law.Yellen directed questions about the vice chair nomination to the Obama administration, even as she argued that the Fed was already effectively performing the regulatory duties specified under Dodd-Frank. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The seven (or currently, five) Washington-based Fed governors serve on the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank body responsible for adjusting the benchmark interest rate, alongside a rotating group of five regional Federal Reserve bank presidents.In addition to Yellen’s concerns about the range of views on the Board of Governors when two seats remain empty, some progressive economists and activists worry that the unfilled seats gives more influence to the regional Fed presidents, who are not political appointees and would otherwise be in the minority.The regional Fed presidents, who are appointed by the regional banks’ boards of directors, are more likely to have strong ties to the financial industry. That makes them more disposed to be wary of inflation than committed to maximizing employment, the thinking goes.Four of the 12 current regional Fed presidents have worked for the Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs.Jordan Haedtler, campaign manager of the Fed Up coalition, a network of groups pushing the Fed for more progressive monetary policy, called Yellen’s statement “strong.”“The impact [of the empty seats] is proven empirically to be a more bank-friendly and hawkish FOMC than Janet Yellen would probably prefer,” Haedtler said.Fed Up has solicited several thousand signatures calling on Shelby to hold hearings. But Haedtler also wonders why the White House has not placated the powerful senator by naming a vice chair for supervision.“I don’t think it is a good excuse for Richard Shelby to use -- it is a bogus excuse -- but I am confused as to why the White House would let him have that excuse,” Haedtler concluded.CORRECTION: This article has been edited to correct Jordan Haedtler's title at the FedUp coalition."

Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) says he's willing to consider Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, on his merits. Shockingly, that's controversial in this Senate.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56e9e06a1500002a000b2477.jpeg?ops=crop_0_374_4288_2474%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Most Republicans blocking President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee cite various principles for the obstruction, but there may be a better predictor for how hardline their stance is: the difficulty of their re-election campaign.Immediately after Obama announced he was selecting federal judge Merrick Garland to replace the late Antonin Scalia on the high court, GOP leaders doubled down on their refusal to vote on or even meet with him or any nominee.But a little further down the ladder, some GOP senators said they would indeed sit down with Garland -- and break with leadership over it. Many of them are up for re-election in 2016.For those in tight races, now is definitely not the time to come across as partisan obstructionists. They're in the middle of trying to cast themselves as the best senators ever, avoiding reporters whenever possible, dyeing their hair in the dead of night and trying out sharp new talking points with voters back home. GOP leaders may be ready to deny action on any Supreme Court nominee, but for vulnerable senators, to refuse to even meet with a perfectly nice guy named Merrick Garland ... well, that's just rude. Here's a look at the Republican senators up for re-election this year and what they've said about meeting with Obama's nominee. A wholly unscientific analysis suggests a correlation between a senator's willingness to give Garland a chance and said senator's panic level about getting re-elected. We'll rank them in rough order, from most terrified of blowing their election to least.Sen. Mark Kirk (Ill.): ""I will assess Judge Merrick Garland based on his record and qualifications,"" he said in a statement. That's probably a good thing for voters to hear in the state that sent Obama to the White House to make that court pick in the first place. Analysts see Kirk's Senate contest as a toss-up, but the only public poll available finds him trailing Rep. Tammy Duckworth (D).Sen. Ron Johnson (Wis.): His office did not respond to a request for comment. But a Wisconsin paper reports him saying his position continues to be ""let the American people decide,"" suggesting no action until Obama is gone. He hasn't exactly been rock-solid in that stance, though. Last month he appeared to waffle, saying he never said he wouldn't vote. ""By the time I would actually take the vote, if it comes to that, I'll take a vote,"" he said. Johnson is trailing former Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold in most polls.Sen. Kelly Ayotte (N.H.): ""I feel I would want to explain my position to the nominee. I mean, he does serve on the circuit court of appeals, so I want to give him that courtesy,"" she told reporters. This is another toss-up, with incumbent Ayotte holding a single-digit lead on Gov. Maggie Hassan (D).Sen. Rob Portman (Ohio): ""If the nominee requests a meeting, Rob would be happy to sit down with him and explain his position,"" said his spokesman, Kevin Smith. He emphasized the senator is still opposed to moving a nominee this year, though. Portman is in a dead heat with former Gov. Ted Strickland (D) in a state where 56 percent of voters want the Senate to consider a nominee.Sen. Pat Toomey (Pa.): Analysts have the state leaning Toomey's way, but he gave the same answer, verbatim, when asked four times about next steps on Garland's nomination. ""We put out a statement this morning and I'm going to refer you to the statement,"" he told reporters, flying down a flight of stairs. But he did want to make clear in a statement on Twitter that it's nothing personal against Garland -- it's personal against Obama. ""Should Merrick Garland be nominated again by the next president, I would be happy to carefully consider his nomination,"" Toomey said.Sen. John McCain (Ariz.): ""I've issued a written statement. I've said everything I'm going to say on it,"" he told reporters. His statement doesn't suggest he'd meet with Garland.Sen. Chuck Grassley (Iowa): He chairs the judiciary committee and has said he won't give Garland a hearing. But he's agreed to meet with Garland in early April, after the Senate's upcoming two-week recess, per White House spokesman Eric Schultz.Sen. Richard Burr (N.C.): ""Why meet with someone who's not going to have a hearing, or have a vote?"" he asked reporters.There are three states where the Republican senators are retiring this year: Indiana, Florida and Louisiana. For those senators and others in reasonably safe contests, their position on the high court nomination becomes … what? Sen. David Vitter (La.): ""I don't do hallway interviews,"" he told HuffPost, while riding an escalator. What about escalator interviews? ""They're the same."" Vitter wrote an op-ed last week arguing that no Obama nominee should get a hearing.Sen. Richard Shelby (Ala.): ""Why would I want to waste my time or his?"" he asked HuffPost.Sen. Johnny Isakson (Ga.): He didn't weigh in specifically on meeting with Garland, but he laughed off a reporter's question about potentially moving the nomination in the lame duck. ""Oh God. I'm not even going to dignify that question or hypothesis with a response.""Sen. John Hoeven (N.D.): ""I'm reserving judgement at this point,"" he told reporters.Sen. Roy Blunt (Mo.): Democrats, at least, put Blunt's contest in the sleeper category, but he was standing by the GOP leadership line. “This is a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land,"" Blunt said in a statement. ""The president has every right to nominate someone, and the Senate has the Constitutional responsibility to decide if it’s the right person at the right time. I will not vote for this nominee to the Supreme Court.”A spokeswoman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee did not answer a question about the pattern among vulnerable senators. A spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee was willing to entertain the question, but suggested there was no difference between lawmakers being open to meeting Garland and McConnell's hardline position.""A meeting to tell the nominee you won’t consider his appointment for political reasons is just another craven move from incumbents who refuse to do their jobs,"" said the DSCC's Lauren Passalacqua. ""Just as they refuse to stand up to Donald Trump, voters shouldn’t be fooled: anything short of a hearing and vote is obstruction, pure and simple.”Other GOP senators up in 2016 are:John Boozman (Arkansas)Mike Crapo (Idaho)James Lankford (Oklahoma)Mike Lee (Utah)Jerry Moran (Kansas)Lisa Murkowski (Alaska)Rand Paul (Kentucky)Tim Scott (South Carolina)John Thune (South Dakota)Laura Barron-Lopez contributed reporting."

Bob Goodlatte, said leaving refugee decisions up to Obama is ""no longer a viable option.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56e983d41e0000c600710596.jpeg?cache=zu1xce344o&ops=crop_60_248_4365_2597%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- House Republicans are trying once more to restrict the resettlement of refugees in the United States, by stripping power to set admission numbers from the president and by allowing states and localities to ban those vulnerable individuals from their communities.The House Judiciary Committee approved this latest anti-refugee bill -- introduced only two days before it was considered by the panel -- on Wednesday. Now it moves to the full chamber for consideration.The new legislation follows months of efforts to limit refugee resettlement, particularly of Syrians and Iraqis, who were singled out in another bill that passed the House last year. Although the current bill doesn't call for a ban on Muslims, as has been proposed by Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump, it aligns with his arguments against Syrian refugees: that they could be dangerous and that states should be able to keep them out.One Republican on the Judiciary Committee went so far as to claim that President Barack Obama might ""be vindictive"" and send 10,000 Syrian refugees to the very states and counties that objected to taking them in.""This makes certain that you could have at least four years where a president cannot double, triple, quadruple the number as punishment and send them to you,"" Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) said of his amendment to increase the period of time that refugees would be banned from a locality after its officials or legislature expressed their disapproval.That amendment was rejected, although no other Republican stepped up to dispute his argument about Obama.The House bill would disallow resettlement of ""any refugee"" in a particular state for one fiscal year after the governor, state legislature, top local official or local legislature formally expressed disapproval.Officials in more than half of the states announced last fall that they did not want Syrian refugees to be sent their way, and Texas even sued to block such refugees. Thus far the states lack the power to actually do so.""Considering the terrorist threats facing our nation, we have a right to be concerned about resettlement of refugees from countries that are hotbeds of terrorist activity. ... Essentially ignoring the pleas of communities across the U.S. and leaving refugee resettlement decisions to the administration is no longer a viable option,"" said Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.).The legislation would set a cap on total refugee admissions at 60,000 individuals -- 25,000 fewer than Obama proposed for this fiscal year -- which could be changed only with Congress' approval. It would also recommend that those who are in the religious minority in certain countries be prioritized for resettlement.Democrats argued that the legislation plays off the public's fears and could have a devastating effect on vulnerable individuals.Previous proposals to prioritize religious minorities were opposed by Christian- and Jewish-affiliated faith groups on the grounds that they could be discriminatory. Religious persecution is already taken into consideration -- and Democrats and advocates agree that it should be -- but no one category of persecuted individuals is placed above others when the U.S. government admits refugees.Republicans denied that keeping out Muslims specifically was a goal. As bill sponsor Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho) noted, Muslims are the minority in some of the countries to which the provision would apply, such as Burma.But Muslims from the Middle East currently make up a huge proportion of the world's refugees, and prioritizing religious minorities right now would reduce their chances of reaching the U.S.""We would de-prioritize Iraqis and Afghanis who supported U.S. armed services. A woman fleeing sex enslavement by Boko Haram or female genital mutilation would likely be passed over,"" Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) said at the committee meeting on Wednesday. ""A political dissident in North Korea would find no refuge in America because he's not a religious minority.""""It appears to be crafted to exclude Muslims from Middle Eastern countries,"" Lofgren added.The bill would also increase requirements for refugees to remain in the U.S., mandating that they undergo regular security screenings until they become legal permanent residents.Rep.

But ""one thing is clear: the brutal, bloody beating of [attorney James] Crawford by a law enforcement officer must be condemned and further calls into question the integrity of the Orange County District Attorney's Office and the Orange County Sheriff's Department,"" said Michael Ogul, president of California Public Defenders Association, in a statement Monday.Ogul's group also renewed its call for a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into the DA's office over allegations of misconduct stemming from the county's jailhouse informant program -- an unfolding scandal that has been roiling the local criminal justice system since 2014.Matthew Guerrero, president of California Attorneys for Criminal Justice, repeated his group's call for a ""thorough, independent"" investigation into the courthouse altercation in a statement Tuesday. Declaring that his organization will not stand by in ""silence,"" Guerrero pledged that it will be making a public records request for evidence in the case, including any video.Last week, Crawford alleged that he was beaten by Dillon Alley, an investigator with the DA's office, following a heated argument inside a courtroom. His attorney, Jerry Steering, told HuffPost that the disagreement escalated into violence after Crawford mentioned the jailhouse informant scandal.As Crawford exited the courtroom, said Steering, the investigator jumped him from behind and began ""bashing his brains out"" on a bench in the hallway and ""punching his lights out.""Steering said police finally pulled the investigator off Crawford. But no arrests were made. And Alley was not immediately put on administrative leave. Alley's attorney, Paul Meyer, told the Los Angeles Times that his client was also injured in the incident, but would not say how specifically.Almost immediately after the news broke, Tom Dominguez, president of the Association of Orange County Deputy Sheriffs, said in a statement that Crawford's ""one-sided version"" of events was false and that the defense attorney was trying to ""drum up a payday.""For their part, the criminal defense groups said that law enforcement's response to the incident has been woefully inadequate. They also condemned Dominguez's rush to defend the investigator when all the facts weren't yet available, with Guerrero calling his statement ""disgraceful.""Guerrero criticized law enforcement for ""circling the wagons"" and for not being transparent about the incident. ""[O]ne might reasonably wonder how the Association of Orange County Deputy Sheriffs could certify that Mr. Crawford's 'version' is 'not true' before the Sheriff's Department has completed their investigation,"" Ogul said.Ogul and Guerrero both lambasted the DA's office for failing to express any criticism of its investigator or make any denunciation of the violence generally.""Indeed, so far as we can tell, the District Attorney has taken no employment action whatsoever against Mr. Alley,"" Ogul continued, ""not even merely placing him on administrative leave during the investigation.""The DA's office said that all information about the incident must be reviewed before any action can be taken against the investigator. Lt. Mark Stichter, spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department, told HuffPost that all facts and information in the investigation have now been turned over to the California state attorney general's office. A Change.org petition calling for the arrest and prosecution of Alley has received more than 1,000 signatures since it began circulating at the end of last week.The DA's office was already facing tremendous scrutiny over allegations that it illegally withheld evidence gleaned through a formerly secret jailhouse informant program and thereby violated the rights of multiple defendants. Fallout from the snitch scandal has derailed multiple murder cases, with some accused murderers even walking free. Crawford himself won a new trial for client Henry Rodriguez last month when a judge ruled that county prosecutors had hidden jailhouse informant evidence in the double-murder case. Just four months ago, a group of former prosecutors and legal experts -- including both criminal defense groups speaking out over the beating -- called on the DOJ to conduct a full investigation of the DA's office and the sheriff's department over the informant program. It remains unclear exactly how many cases may have been affected by tainted informant evidence. Deputy Public Defender Scott Sanders has argued that any murder case in Orange County over the last 30 years in which a jailhouse informant was used deserves to be re-examined. Sanders first unearthed the alleged misconduct, as well as internal records from the program that may have been improperly concealed for decades.Tony Rackauckas, district attorney of Orange County, has maintained that no one in his office intentionally behaved inappropriately in relation to the jailhouse informants program, and he has invited the DOJ to investigate his office's practices in that area.Daniel Medwed, a law professor at Northeastern University who has written in depth about prosecutorial misconduct, sees the situation in Orange County differently. He told HuffPost that last week's courthouse violence is yet another sign, ""among many,"" that the DA's office is not functioning properly.""The fact that the informant scandal went on for so long and on such a broad scale, of course, suggests significant dysfunction and a lack of an ethical compass in the office,"" Medwed said.

29,POLITICS,Ohio Voters Choose House Freedom Caucus Candidate To Replace John Boehner,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/warren-davidson_us_56e85051e4b065e2e3d779ca,The influential group of conservative lawmakers made the former House Speaker's life miserable in Congress.,2016-03-16,"House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) retired last year, setting off a crowded race for his seat. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_18_124_4639_2475%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"First, the House Freedom Caucus got rid of John Boehner. Now, it's on track to replace him with one of its own.On Tuesday, businessman and former Army Ranger Warren Davidson won the GOP primary in Ohio's 8th district, which Boehner represented for nearly 25 years. Fifteen Republicans were vying for the chance to succeed the former House speaker, who announced his retirement late last year. It was a heavily symbolic victory for the House Freedom Caucus -- the influential group of conservative lawmakers that made Boehner's life miserable and contributed to his resignation from Congress -- whose super PAC threw financial support behind Davidson.""This is the first open seat up this cycle, so we’re doing everything we can to win,"" Caucus Chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) told The National Review last week. ""The first one is always important. It just happens to be the former speaker's seat.""Jordan added that there's a strong chance Davidson will join the caucus if elected, which he's expected to be in the heavily Republican district. Davidson also had the backing of the Club for Growth, whose super PAC threw in more than $1 million to help him.""With a strong message of economic freedom, Davidson came out ahead of a field of 15 candidates, including some career politicians,"" Club for Growth President David McIntosh said. ""The Club's PAC is especially thrilled that Warren Davidson will enter the fight for economic liberty almost immediately.""Senate Conservatives Fund President Ken Cuccinelli said Tuesday night he was confident Davidson ""will fight to balance the budget, fully repeal Obamacare, and stand up to the liberals in both parties.""Davidson wasn't the only candidate running against the establishment, i.e., Boehner and his legacy. ""Talk to even a few candidates, and you get a sense that their stances are variations on the same theme: Less government interference and less regulation, lower taxes, strong national security and gun rights,"" The Columbus Dispatch wrote in February.Davidson now moves on to a June 7 special election to fill out the remainder of Boehner's term. The winner would need to run for re-election in November to serve beyond that time."
30,CRIME,Why Police Warned Their Community About A Rap Battle Challenge,Hilary Hanson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rap-battle-challenge-police-charleton-massachusetts_us_56e979efe4b065e2e3d8091b,The police chief says the incident was no joke.,2016-03-16,Police fear that a group of young men who challenged boys to a rap battle may have had ulterior motives.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56e97c6b1e0000c600710577.jpeg?cache=O0ULmEkFCg&ops=crop_0_1605_2836_1960%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"When a Massachusetts police department posted a “community notice” about a suspicious rap battle, Facebook users and the media pretty much immediately began making fun of them.But Charlton Police Chief James Pervier told The Huffington Post that the incident really wasn’t that much of a laughing matter, citing details that did not appear in the original notice.The police department Monday posted on Facebook that two or three males in their late teens and early 20s had pulled over to challenge a group of younger teens to a rap battle, asking them to “spit some bars.” When the younger boys declined, the older ones drove away:On 3-12-2016 approximately 3:00 p.m. a black SUV with 2-3 male occupants, in their late teens/early 20s, pulled up to three young teenage boys on Dresser Hill Road.Facebook users called it “absurd,” asked, “What’s next, a dance off?” or noted that the only real crime was “open toed sandals.”But police counter they had legitimate cause to post the notice.“I’m looking at it from the public safety side,” Pervier said.Pervier brought up an important detail not mentioned in the notice -- the older males actually asked the boys to get inside the vehicle. Additionally, the “young teenage boys” were only 12 years old, and the incident took place in a remote, somewhat rural area in front of a residence. The 12-year-olds, he said, were frightened by the encounter.And while there’s a good chance that the older males didn’t have any criminal intentions, Pervier felt that the department would be “negligent” to not inform the public and try to get more information about what was going on, just in case.“If people want to make light of it, fine, but I’m looking at it from a much larger perspective,” Pervier said."
