The former Rhode Island governor is scheduled to speak at the Democratic National Committee's Women's Leadership Forum.Earlier this week, NPR reported that only 10 people have contributed $200 or more to Chafee's campaign. The 30 percent of Chafee's big budget supporters that NPR interviewed contributed a meager $15,000 to his campaign. $4,100 of that sum came from his own pocket. For comparison, Republican presidential hopeful Ben Carson has raised some $20 million. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton snagged about $45 million in the second quarter of 2015 and added another $28 million in the third. And Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is sitting on tens of millions himself.According to HuffPollster, Chafee is polling at .4% in recent Democratic 2016 polls.What does the future hold?

Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican, maintains he is leading a legitimate investigation into the 2012 attack at a U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya, which took place when Clinton was secretary of state.Democrats' decision to stay on the committee to push back on Republicans' efforts comes a day after the panel grilled Clinton for 11 hours and produced little new information. Gowdy himself couldn't point to anything new that he learned from her testimony.So far, the committee has cost more than $4.5 million and hasn't turned up much. There have been seven previous investigations into the 2012 incident and none found any wrongdoing by Clinton.Democrats later put out a statement calling the committee ""a taxpayer-funded expedition"" targeted at Clinton.""After meeting with Leader Pelosi today, we are calling on Speaker Boehner to immediately shut down this abusive, wasteful, and obviously partisan effort,"" they wrote.

Martin O'Malley and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Formerly a Republican, Chafee switched his party affiliation to Democrat in 2013.Chafee was appointed to the Senate in 1999 to replace his father, who died in office. He was elected to a full term in the Senate in 2000. He was the only Republican in the Senate to vote against the Iraq War, a fact he used against Clinton throughout the primary.Chafee failed to gain much attention during his time in the race. He struggled to crack 1 percent in most polls, and his most publicized policy platform was suggesting the United States adopt the metric system. He was largely overshadowed by Clinton and Sanders during CNN's Democratic Debate in October, aside from a strange moment where he fumbled explaining why he voted to repeal a landmark financial regulation bill in the Senate.HuffPost Pollster shows Chafee polling at less than 1 percent.Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly described the law Chafee voted to repeal as deregulation legislation.Also on HuffPost:"
7,POLITICS,House Dems Weigh Boycott Of Planned Parenthood Select Committee,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-planned-parenthood-committee_us_562a9d1be4b0aac0b8fd01ef,"But because participating in the Benghazi committee paid off, Democrats may do the same for Planned Parenthood.",2015-10-23,House Democratic Caucus Chairman Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.) hinted the party would participate in the Planned Parenthood committee.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- House Democratic leadership is considering boycotting a newly established congressional committee to investigate the medical practices of abortion providers, though it is more likely they will participate as a defensive measure.Outgoing House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) announced appointments Friday to the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s Select Investigative Panel, which will look into the practice of fetal tissue donations by Planned Parenthood (or as the press release puts it, “focus on the abhorrent practices of big abortion providers”).Boehner placed eight Republican lawmakers on the committee, including four women. One of those four, Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) will serve as the committee chair.The announcement of the committee places Democrats in a conundrum similar to the one they faced when Boehner created the select committee to investigate the 2012 attacks in Benghazi. They could boycott the committee as a means of tagging it as a strictly partisan enterprise. Or they could place lawmakers there in hopes of keeping tabs on the committee’s investigation.Democratic Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.) told The Huffington Post that leadership is currently weighing the pros and the cons of participation. Citing the benefits gained from being on the Benghazi committee, Becerra hinted that the party would likely end up participating.“You hate to disengage when that’s your job. You hate to not be on the field. You don’t want to ever disarm unilaterally. But it is still a farce, so…” Becerra said, trailing off. “Benghazi makes it clear what you are looking at. For those who wish to be responsible with our government, who believe our government is supposed to be doing oversight under the Constitution and really try to fulfill our role, it is tough to say that we are just going to distance ourselves because we know it is a political show.”Democratic lawmakers have, by and large, been supportive of Planned Parenthood after carefully edited videos purported to show the organization illegally selling fetal tissue. The group has argued that the videos are doctored to show officials trying to profit off the practice, which is restricted under law. And Planned Parenthood has unilaterally stopped collecting reimbursement for the costs of processing and transporting fetal tissues. Still, Republicans have alleged gross wrongdoing and called for an end of all federal reimbursements to the organization. A committee is already investigating Planned Parenthood's use of federal funds, though its chairman said he has found no wrongdoing.The select committee established by Boehner was meant to placate conservatives in his party who wanted to shut down the government unless legislators ended funding for Planned Parenthood. In addition to Blackburn, the Republicans on the committee are Rep. Joe Pitts (R-Pa.), Rep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.), Rep. Larry Bucshon (R-Ind.), Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.), Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.), Rep. Vicki Hartzler (R-M0.), and Rep. Mia Love (R-Utah).When Boehner created the select committee to investigate Benghazi, parts of the Democratic base encouraged the party's leadership to boycott. But the decision to appoint members appears to have paid off, with access to witness interviews and a better ability to respond to attacks lobbed at former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The benefits have been strong enough that leadership has said it will keep its remaining membership intact, even as it calls for the committee to be disbanded following Clinton's 11-hour testimony on Thursday. A decision on whether to participate in the Planned Parenthood committee should come soon, a Democratic aide told HuffPost."

Just 12 percent think Biden made the wrong call. Biden, who saw his favorability ratings surge over the summer, remains highly popular, both within his party and across partisan lines. Seventy-two percent of Democrats say they hold a positive opinion of him, while just 14 percent view him negatively. Americans as a whole are 19 points more likely to rate him favorably than unfavorably, making him better-liked than virtually any other politician on the national stage, including President Barack Obama, Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton and GOP presidential hopefuls Donald Trump and Ben Carson.Had he entered, Biden would likely have seen his sky-high ratings fall back to earth after incurring the scrutiny and criticism faced by an actual candidate. Clinton saw even stronger ratings than Biden's as secretary of state, but became dramatically less popular once her campaign kicked into gear.And Democrats, despite their esteem for Biden, don't believe he was especially likely to nab their party's nomination. Just 14 percent think he would have been very likely to win the primary had he entered, while 35 percent say he would have been somewhat likely to win and 41 percent that it's somewhat or very unlikely that he would have prevailed.Recent polls of the Democratic race have found that Biden's decision not to run is likely to benefit Clinton.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Oct. 21-23 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

The character of our country is only as strong as our leaders — the only special interest I am beholden to is the American people and together we will Make America Great Again!”The statement comes after reports by the Washington Post showed that Trump and his campaign were connected to the Make America Great Again super PAC to support his campaign. The super PAC announced it would close down after the reports were published.Trump further sent a letter to each of the super PACs that appear to support him to tell them to cease operations and to not use his likeness to raise money.Every candidate running for the Republican presidential nomination is bolstered by a super PAC or nonprofit supporting their candidacy.Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush personally raised $100 million for his Right to Rise super PAC during a more than six-month period when he toured the country claiming not to be a candidate. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal did the same thing for a super PAC and a nonprofit that does not disclose its donors -- a practice commonly known as “dark money.”Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) is aided by both a super PAC and a dark money nonprofit. The nonprofit has already spent $6 million to boost his candidacy without disclosing the donors behind it.Trump has not entirely funded his campaign without help from donors, as he claims. He has lent or contributed $3.7 million to his campaign and received $3.9 million from other donors. Most of those donations came from those giving under $200 and very well could represent people purchasing Trump’s famous “Make America Great Again” hats."

AFSCME President Lee Saunders said the union went through a six-month process to determine which candidate its members wanted to support, and ultimately found that nearly two-thirds of them planned to back Clinton in the primary.""Members want a candidate who will make it easier instead of harder to join together in strong unions and stand together for wages and benefits that can sustain our families,"" Saunders said in a statement. ""What we also heard was AFSCME members want the candidate who will be the most effective champion for working families, and who will be able to deliver a victory in this critically important election. AFSCME members believe that candidate is Hillary Clinton.""Clinton said in a statement that she was honored to earn AFSCME's support.""I am proud to stand with public sector workers at the federal, state, county and municipal levels of government. They make this country work,"" she said. The endorsement comes one day after Clinton's widely praised testimony before the House Select Committee on Benghazi, where she emerged unscathed -- and actually stronger, politically -- after 11 hours of questioning. Although Clinton's top primary opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), has a long history of supporting labor rights, Clinton has won the vast majority of union endorsements this cycle. The International Association of Firefighters, however, said this week that it will not endorse anyone this year after its preferred candidate, Vice President Joe Biden, announced he would not be running. Some AFSCME members made it clear Friday that they're unhappy with the union's decision to endorse Clinton. Eight leaders of AFSCME Council 28 in Washington state initiated a petition Friday, shortly before Saunders made his announcement. It has about 100 signatures so far.""We in Council 28...are against AFSCME doing an early endorsement for President of the United States,"" read the group's press release.

The House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations will look for answers today from GM CEO Mary Barra about a faulty ignition switch and mishandled recall of 2.6 million cars that’s been linked to 13 deaths and dozens of crashes.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A federal judge, disgusted by cushy deals that allow lawbreaking corporate bosses to avoid jail time, used a ruling in a little-known corruption case to tear into Department of Justice prosecutors this week. In an 84-page opinion Wednesday approving a deferred prosecution agreement for ex-Army contractors indicted in a bribery and kickback scheme, U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan, of the District of Columbia, slammed federal prosecutors for striking a similar deal with General Motors last month.Faulty ignition switches in GM vehicles killed at least 169 people. The company, accused of concealing the defect from regulators and lying about it to customers, agreed to pay a $900 million fine as part of a deferred prosecution settlement. No individual GM executive or employee has been prosecuted.In his opinion in the case of the former Army contractors, Sullivan called the Justice Department's deal with GM ""a shocking example of potentially culpable individuals not being criminally charged.""“Despite the fact that the reprehensible conduct of [GM's] employees resulted in the deaths of many people, the agreement merely ‘imposes on GM an independent monitor to review and assess policies, practices, and procedures relating to GM’s safety-related public statements, sharing of engineering data, and recall processes' plus the payment of a $900 million fine,"" Sullivan wrote.Charges against GM will be dropped in as few as three years. The deal was criticized as a slap on the wrist -- the fine amounted to less than one-third of the automaker's 2014 profit. As USA Today noted in an editorial last month:  ""Individuals are deterred from wrongdoing by the prospect of going to jail, much more so than by the prospect of seeing the corporate treasurer pay money to the government.""Days before the settlement with GM, the Justice Department released an internal memo pledging to prosecute individual corporate employees for white-collar crime, rather than just the institutions that employ them. That memo came after years of harsh criticism that the department had failed to successfully jail even a single top finance executive in the 2008 financial crisis.Deferred prosecution agreements are intended to give defendants a chance to clean up their act and rehabilitate. If they comply (and pay fines), the charges are dropped. Increasingly, Sullivan wrote, such offers are extended to corporations accused of criminal misconduct.From 2000 to 2005, the government made ""just over four"" deferred prosecution agreements a year, Sullivan wrote. That number ""increased dramatically"" since, with a record number this year, the judge said. "

It’s a shrewd strategy for a league whose social reach extends far beyond that of any of its competitors. In terms of Twitter followers, the only league that’s even relatively competitive with the NBA’s 17.6 million is the NFL, trailing around 20 percent behind at 13.8. Meanwhile, the MLB and NHL are stuck at the kiddies’ table with 5.28 million and 4.2 million, respectively.To give perspective, the NBA has more than three times the number of Twitter followers than President Obama.The disparity is even clearer in the case of Facebook, as the NBA page has more “likes” (27.4 million) than the NFL, MLB, and NHL combined.For an organization obsessed with growing its base, the new system will likely not only bring in additional dollars in streaming revenue, but will also expand the NBA’s social reach even further, tapping into and taking advantage of the culture favored by its players and fans.“Over 90 percent of our players -- I think the exact number is 87 percent -- have at least one social [media] account,” Rosenthal Brenner continued to NBCSports. “Our teams are committed to posting great content. At the end of the day, we’re all huge fans of the game and using social to talk hoops has been a very successful strategy for us.”The NBA has just solidified its spot as the league of millennials’ dreams -- and feeds.

The details are hazy, but what we know is this: In those early hours, 31-year-old Corey Jones had pulled over to tend to his failing car, was “confronted” by a plain-clothed police officer who never identified himself, was fired at five times and died shortly thereafter, with no dashboard or body cameras recording the incident.Now Wilfork is speaking out about the shooting -- how he craves justice for his friend, how this death is just one instance of a larger systemic problem and how he plans to use the “platform” of the NFL as a launching point for these tough but crucial societal conversations. “The crazy thing is it’s not the first time this [kind of incident] has happened,” Wilfork said at his team’s press conference Thursday. “We’ve seen a lot of this going on in society, but especially when it affects you personally … it just gives me an opportunity to speak about it.”With his team playing in Miami this weekend, Wilfork will visit Jones’ family in South Florida as they all seek clarity about Sunday’s event and justice in its aftermath. “We’re dealing with somebody that was shot dead,” he continued. “We have to try and figure out a solution [to this societal problem] … I think everybody needs to be held accountable, plain and simple.""“We’re going to continue to get justice and that’s how it is right now. I think sometimes we have a platform we can use for a certain purpose. This week, this is my purpose. To have the platform I have to speak about it, that’s what it’s all about.”Wilfork’s words and cries for justice fit with the broader kindling of the Black Lives Matter movement in professional sports. The NFL’s St. Louis Rams, the NBA’s LeBron James, Derrick Rose, Kobe Bryant and others have all taken public action, using their respective platforms -- whether it was a football field or a basketball court -- to raise awareness of the issue and the need for immediate action. On Thursday, Wilfork’s words echoed the raised hands and donned shirts of those other athletes. And, after last Sunday’s news, he now understands the significance of the movement on a personal, poignant level. “[It’s] important for me to stand up and talk about this issue,” Wilfork said near the end of the presser. “[And] I’m going to use this platform [of the NFL] to deal with it.”Also on HuffPost:"
22,RELIGION,How Emory University Is Getting Students To Ask The Big Questions,Jaweed Kaleem,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/emory-university-religious-studies-big-questions_us_562a44dee4b0ec0a38941fb3,"""We want to help students better understand themselves and the world that they are in.""",2015-10-23,"Emory University, where the Department of Religious Studies tries to teach students to address the big questions of life.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/562a92bd1400002200c7abd0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Each year, dozens of undergraduate and graduate students arrive at Emory University to think about the big questions as they study under faculty members in the Department of Religious Studies. By looking at topics ranging from Greek and Roman philosophy, to ancient Hinduism and contemporary Islam, professors aim not only to equip students with the right credits for a degree and skills for the workplace, but also to help them ask and think about the cosmic questions any emerging adult encounters. What is a life well-lived? What is purpose? How do you define success, joy and happiness?With regularly offered courses like Death and Dying; Religion and Sexuality; and Religion and Healing, among more traditional topics, the department tries to “help students better understand themselves” and their outlook on life, says department chairman Gary Laderman.That quest follows a trend at American universities. Many have increasingly attempted, as New York Times columnist David Brooks recently noted, “to stem the careerist tide and to widen the system’s narrow definition of achievement” and “cultivate the whole student: the emotional, spiritual and moral sides and not just the intellectual.” At Amherst College, that has included a campus dialogue called “Ask Big Questions,” while at Brown University, it has meant a relatively new concentration in Contemplative Studies and a campus series on Ethical Inquiry. Since 2009, the National Endowment for the Humanities has distributed $3.2 million in grants to fund college and university courses that tackle the “enduring questions.”In an interview with HuffPost, Laderman, who has spent his 23-year career at Emory studying the ways humans create meaning, shared how he and his colleagues are helping students explore their life journeys. This interview has been edited for clarity and length.What’s the mission for religious studies at Emory?It’s a big question. We might have answered that differently 20 years ago. We want to help students better understand themselves and the world that they are in. In doing that we look at several topics, but it's also got to be done in the world of pre-professionalism. Not that we are giving ourselves away to that mentality, but we have to figure out a way to meet halfway so that college doesn't become a one-track pre-career experience, but also one of larger exploration.It's all about finding a way, especially at that transition from youth to adulthood, for reflection and contemplation of the biggest questions and the purpose of life. Sooner or later these questions will come up for these young kids. It’s part of our jobs to help them get to a place where they can ask them.Religion has a special dilemma. Most people don't get it, in that they assume you are being religious or advocating a religion or going into a vocation. We are arguing, “No, there is knowledge you can gain here that you can draw from in a career as a doctor, a lawyer, a politician.”You offer several nontraditional courses, such as Death and Dying as well as Religion and Healing. Can you share more about these?Like other departments, we offer more traditional introduction to religion courses like the history of Christianity and the history of Buddhism, but some of our biggest courses are those that are more thematic and unconventional. This semester I’m teaching on Religion and Sexuality. The enrollment is 220 students, which is unprecedented for humanities. I teach Death and Dying once a year, and that is another course that gets over 100 students.We also have courses on religion and ecology, religion and the body. These all address some of the themes we are getting at, in terms of getting students to think about the meaning of life and purpose. You can find some hooks that really draw students into larger modes of thinking, whether it’s sex or the body or popular culture.What attracts so many people to want to learn about death and dying?I think it has to do with the age people are at, and an intellectual curiosity into certain areas of our life that we don't talk openly about or that we are only are able to speak about under certain constraints, whether it's in the church or with doctors. It can be a little more confined in those contexts, in terms of really being able to speak openly and freely and emotionally.In general, students are interested in finding a space to talk about things that they don't get to intellectualize about. Then there are the specific reasons they come in. I know some that have come in in the midst of grief. It’s also a course that students hear about when they are deciding between economics and organic chemistry and want a relief in their schedule. But they realize it’s not exactly a relief!What was your own journey in becoming someone who thinks of the big questions as a central part of your career?I was a psychology major at California State University, Northridge. From early on I was interested in death and was thinking of going into psychology and becoming a therapist. I became interested in psychoanalysis and started reading a lot about existentialism. It was through those courses that I started taking religion courses. Then I went to graduate school at U.C., Santa Barbara. I started out in the psychology of religion, but got waylaid from that and went more in the direction of history and culture.I got my B.A. in ‘86 and my Ph.D. in ‘94. Working at Emory is the first and only job I’ve had in the field. I was following my own intellectual interests. It’s a luxury students don’t always have today, to feel the life of the mind and follow your own passion. It’s part of an older model of education, but I hope students can pursue more in that way as time goes on."
