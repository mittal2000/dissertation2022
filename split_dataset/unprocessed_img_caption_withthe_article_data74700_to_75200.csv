3,ENTERTAINMENT,Buckminster Fuller's Vision of a World That Works for Everyone,"L. Steven Sieden, ContributorWorld renowned speaker and expert sharing Buckminster Fuller's...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/buckminster-fullers-visio_b_8381918.html,,2015-10-25,2015-10-25-1445736234-8811993-64.Tomaketheworldworkfor612.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-10-25-1445736234-8811993-64.Tomaketheworldworkfor612-thumb.jpg,"On this the hundred year anniversary of Buckminster Fuller being expelled from Harvard for the second time (1914 and 1915), I stop to remember what we can all learn from a man many of us believe was a Bodhisattva well on the Path to becoming a Buddha. Bucky (as he preferred to be called) was not interested in formal education, and like the Buddha he taught us not to believe anything we read or hear from so called ""experts,"" but to trust our personal experience above all else.  That's not to say that we can't or shouldn't learn from others with more experience than ourselves, but it does remind us that most ""experts"" (especially those in positions of power with governments, corporations, religions and other institutions) have an agenda that is by definition limited to their immediate group be it a company, nation, religious sect, etc. Accordingly, they can't do what genuine spiritual leaders have taught for centuries -- love thy neighbor, treat others as you would like to be treated, we're all in this together, etc.Instead, institutions like Harvard (and all aspects of what we call ""the system"") teach us that specialization is good, and that each of us has to do something we don't really want to do in order to make a living or as Bucky referred to it ""earn our right to be alive."" This is the divide and conquer mentality that has kept a minority in power since the Big Man was appointed to protect the village and eventually became King (a tale Bucky often recounted as the dawning of modern politics).Divide and conquer and to keep conquered keep divided is precisely what today's perceived leaders advocate. Politicians want us to believe that there are not enough resources to support everyone, but back in the 1930's Bucky Fuller inventoried all the world's resources and determined that we would have enough resources to support all life on Earth (even with today's population) in about 1976.We now know that somewhere around 1976 we humans reached a point in time when there was enough food to feed everyone. That is still true, even though tens of thousands of people will die of starvation today and tomorrow and the next day until ...We humans shift our focus and resources from weaponry to what Bucky labeled ""livingry."" Everyone knows what livingry. It's the stuff that supports rather than ends life. Food, shelter, clothing, energy, education, clean water, etc.This is the lynchpin of what this twice-expelled from Harvard ""average healthy human being"" (one of Bucky's definitions of himself) was able to show millions of people during his eighty-eight years on the planet he named Spaceship Earth. Perhaps it's time we start listening to this sage advice from a man who devoted his entire adult life to creating ""a world that works for everyone.""The cosmic question Bucky asked audiences again and again for fifty-six years is more relevant than ever. How do we make the world work for 100% of humanity in the shortest possible time through spontaneous cooperation without ecological damage or disadvantage to anyone?This query will not be answered in a Harvard classroom or any institution that still adheres to the ""divide and conquer"" specialization mentality that's gotten us into our current predicament. It's up to each of us to look deeply into ourselves and find answers that contain personal integrity as well as the sustainability that will allow us to survive and thrive as individuals and as a species.May the wisdom of Buckminster Fuller again become widely public and influential in creating the fuller future that is our birthright as Spaceship Earth crewmembers."

5,WORLDPOST,The Philippines and America: A Tale of Two (Troubled) Democracies,"Richard Javad Heydarian, ContributorAcademic, policy adviser, and author of ""Asia's New Battlefiel...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-philippines-and-ameri_b_8382080.html,"As far as the Philippines is concerned, it hardly ever had real mainstream political parties that could boast large-scale membership, ideological coherence, specific policy commitments and grass roots support. Practically all presidential candidates in the Southeast Asian country can be classified as centrists, with no significant ideological differentiation.",2015-10-25,2015-10-25-1445742522-2453908-1024pxThe_Parthenon_in_Athens.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-10-25-1445742522-2453908-1024pxThe_Parthenon_in_Athens-thumb.jpg,"""Indeed it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time,"" argued Britain's legendary prime minister, Winston Churchill. The implosion of the Soviet Empire about half a century later, on the heels of Gorbachev's failure to balance systemic reform with regime preservation, seemingly reinforced Churchill's famous dictum, paving the way for Francis Fukuyama to triumphantly declare ""the end of history."" As a statesman, who was unceremoniously dismissed from power after ably shepherding Britain out of the clutch of Nazi onslaught, Churchill was deeply aware of the idiosyncrasies of democratic politics, even in the world's oldest parliament. As a former policy-maker and student of comparative politics, Fukuyama was well aware of the appeal of anti-democratic sentiments across the world, especially in the Global South, and warned against the political apathy and hedonism of 'the last man' in modern democratic societies. Far from arguing that democracy is a flawless mechanism of social organization, Churchill and Fukuyama, however, were simply arguing that democratic polities represent the least imperfect system -- the closest we could get to realizing G.W.F. Hegel's notion of a world-historical state. Despite all its imperfections, once democracies mature and a civic culture takes roots, it becomes, in the words of political scientists Juan J. Linz and Alfred C. Stepan, ""the only game in town."" Combining power with purpose, the United States -- the world's oldest modern democracy -- has long presented itself as the beacon of freedom. And its former colony, the Philippines, was probably the first laboratory of experimentation with exporting American-style democracy -- marked by separation of powers, weak bureaucracy, and elite-dominated legislature -- to the ""Orient.""Enthralled by the doctrine of Manifest Destiny, President William McKinley was bent on a fulfilling a colonial project to ""educate the Filipinos, and uplift and civilize and Christianize them,"" which obviously ignored the obvious fact that a large number of Filipinos were already Catholics, while a full-fledged independence movement -- the first in Asia -- was feverishly sweeping across the nation in the late-19th century. Yet today, both nations are struggling against growing voter dissatisfaction and skepticism with democratic politics. While political outsiders such as Donald Trump and Ben Carson have captured the imagination of Republicans in the United States, the Philippines, in turn, is experiencing its own version of ""autocratic nostalgia"", with a significant amount of voters extolling the virtues of  'iron-fisted leadership"" and embracing strongmen, who promise to introduce 'discipline' to the country. What went wrong?Democratic DecayTo be fair, democratic skepticism is not unique to the U.S. and its former Asian colony. In Democracy in Retreat, Joshua Kurlantzick chronicles half-a-decade of declining political freedom across the world, the longest in four decades. While most countries around the world can boast about holding elections, majority of them are defective or semi-free nations, which struggle to hold fair and free elections and fall way short of safeguarding the basic civil liberties and political rights of the majority of their citizens. In the Arab world, which was momentarily gripped by the prospect of democratic transformation, democratic revolutions have given way to mayhem, civil war, and outright cynicism. Loyalist of Ali Abdullah Saleh, the former Yemeni strongman, have sought to undermine (with considerable success) the post-revolutionary regime of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, while many ordinary citizens in Egypt, fed up with deteriorating security and economic uncertainty, have nostalgically looked back to the days of relative stability under Hosni Mubarak. Syria is consumed by an all-out civil war, with no end in sight. Only Tunisia, the cradle of the Arab uprisings, offers some promise of democratic transformation. No wonder then, this year's Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the National Dialogue Quartet, a civil society group which played a crucial role in brokering a democratic consensus between secular and Islamist forces in the country. But Tunisia is also racked by security threats and economic uncertainty.The world, in the words of Larry Diamond, a leading authority on democratization studies, is experiencing a ""democratic recession"". As Diamond argues: ""In the thirty years following [Portugal's] Carnation Revolution, democracy expanded around the world like never before. But around 2006 it came to a halt. Though the total number of democracies has not sharply declined, space for civil society is shrinking. Freedom and democracy are in recession."" Meanwhile, autocratic regimes such as Singapore -- the ""showcase of efficient authoritarianism"" as Pankaj Mishra put it -- have attracted admirers across the world, thanks to their impeccable economic record, reputation for rule of law, and meritocratic leadership, especially when compared to liberal democracies in Latin America, Africa and South Asia. And one can't deny that the economic foundations of Newly-Industrialized Countries (NICs) such as South Korea and Taiwan were laid down prior to their democratic revolution in the mid-1980s. The success of few autocratic regimes in East Asia dangerously conceals the failure of their countless peers in other parts of the world, particularly in the Middle East and Africa, where tyrannical rule has gone hand in hand with economic sclerosis. In Political Order and Political Decay, Fukuyama shows how the success of autocratic regimes in East Asia has been more a function of their strong Confucian tradition of state-building and meritocratic leadership than the centralization of power in the hands of a repressive leadership, which has produced disasters in other settings. No wonder then, even after their democratic transition, Confucian nations such as South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan have managed to secure prosperity for the majority of their citizens. Nonetheless, one can't deny that the ""Singapore model"" of meritocratic leadership stands in stark contrast to the populist mediocrity of politicians in many liberal democracies, particularly in places such as the United States and the Philippines. Not Too Different On the surface, the U.S. and the Philippines are too different to be compared. One is a mature democracy with one of the world's wealthiest populations. The other is a poverty-stricken nation, which often struggles to even hold credible elections, as was the case in 2004 under the Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo administration. Upon a closer inspection, it seems the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. In many ways, both countries are outwardly democratic nations that are captured by an oligarchy. That the Philippines is an oligarchy should come as no surprise. As Benedict Anderson shows in an essay for London Review of Books, a fairly coherent set of landowners and big businesses have dominated the country since America's Gilded Age in the 19th century. Today, about 178 political dynasties dominate 73 out of a total of 80 provinces. The vast majority of legislators (70 percent) hail from political dynasties, dwarfing even comparable Latin American countries like and Mexico (40 percent) and Argentina (10 percent). Thanks to the advent of Super PACs, and decades of concentrated growth, the U.S. is following in the footsteps of its former colony (so one can say the tree doesn't fall far from its apples). In a study by Princeton University scholars, entitled ""Testing Theories of American Politics: Elites, Interest Groups, and Average Citizens"", the authors conclude that the U.S. is effectively an oligarchy, where ""economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on US government policy, while average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little or no independent influence [author's emphasis]."" In terms of campaign financing, according to investigative journalists from The New York Times, an ""overwhelmingly white, rich, older and male"" group is beginning to play an outsized role, with only 158 families (contributing $176 million in the first phase of the campaign) responsible for almost half of all the seed money raised for presidential candidates of both parties. The growing role of private funders has coincided with the decline of traditional political parties, which for long served as a crucial transmission belt for reflecting diverse public sentiments and reliable fund-raising machinery for candidates, who supported a fairly coherent set of policies and stood for specific set of principles and values. In the U.S., a strong plurality of voters no longer identify with either of the two major parties, thanks to the growing ideological polarization between the Republicans and Democrats, which has made the federal government at times extremely dysfunctional. As far as the Philippines is concerned, it hardly ever had real mainstream political parties that could boast large-scale membership, ideological coherence, specific policy commitments and grass roots support. Practically all presidential candidates in the Southeast Asian country can be classified as centrists, with no significant ideological differentiation.The country's upcoming presidential and local elections, the same year as the U.S., is reaching a new level of strangeness, with three members of the same party running for vice-presidency, while a senatorial candidate has suggested that he will run as guest candidate on the ticket of three different political parties. A leading vice-presidential candidate had no qualms with basically claiming that since he was not representing any specific party, he is instead running under ""Partido Pilipinas"" (Filipino people). Filipino politicians are essentially dispensing with any pretension to modern party-based politics. Interestingly, the slate of presidential candidates in the Philippines, however, hardly resembles the buffoonish roster of Republican hopefuls, which have captured the global imagination. All of the four Filipino presidential candidates boast strong educational credentials and haven't uttered anything even remotely akin to the outrageous statements of leading candidates in the Republican primaries. (Although the Southeast Asian country can boast a wide array of very colorful nuisance candidates, who are expected to be disqualified before enjoying the same limelight as their peers in the Republican party that are, quite astonishingly, now leading the race.) A relatively inexperienced politician, Senator Grace Poe, is currently leading the presidential race in the Philippines, exposing lingering distrust with political insiders. Instead of banking on her track record and (limited) experience in office, she is leveraging her squeaky clean image, her pedigree as the daughter of the late movie star and presidential candidate Fernando Poe, and perceived independence from the ruling establishment. Meanwhile, the only son of the former dictator, Ferdinand Marcos, is a top contender for the vice-presidency -- which, unlike in the U.S., is separately contested from the office of presidency -- even if he has refused to offer a full-hearted apology for his father's crimes during the two-decades-long martial law, which ended after the 1986 ""People Power"" Revolution. America's dysfunctional politics, meanwhile, has convinced one in six Americans to flirt with the idea of ""having the army rule"", according to the World Values Survey.In both the Philippines and the U.S., personality-based politics is dominating the electoral landscape, favoring political outsiders who have astutely tapped into popular frustration with business-as-usual democracy. To many, autocratic rule doesn't seem to be as frightening as it used to be. The physics of politics has dramatically changed, and, by a strange twist of history, the U.S. now increasingly resembles its former colony, transforming into a fragile democracy threatened by oligarchic takeover. What is at stake is no less than the survival of the least imperfect political system in human history."

Despite President Hassan Rowhani's pledges to the contrary, corruption and human rights continue to pose a huge challenge.According to Transparency International, Iran ranks 136 out of 175 countries. The scale of corruption has not changed significantly when comparing Rowhani's presidency with that of his predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.A considerable part of the economy and financial systems are owned and controlled by Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the office of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Since they enjoy the final say in decision-making, Rowhani and his cabinet do not have the power to tackle corruption.""Corruption in Iran is ingrained in the political and financial institutions that are the country's backbone,"" (Dr. Majid Rafizadeh). However, often figures across the political spectrum, including members of the president's office, engage in corruption for their political and financial benefit. Corruption in Iran is ingrained in the political and financial institutions that are the country's backbone.Embezzlement and money-laundering within the banking system are prime examples of corruption. In addition, corruption takes place by granting loans, financial benefits and fellowships to relatives of senior officials or those who show their loyalty.FacadeFrom time to time, the judiciary might bring a political or business figure to court on charges of corruption. Most recently, billionaire Babak Zanjani has been put on trial, accused of embezzling $2.7 billion from the government-owned petroleum company.The rare occasions when cases are brought to court are not part of a concerted effort to fight corruption. Instead, they appear to be a facade put on to alleviate people's frustration over the economic difficulties they face, which are exacerbated by corruption.Normally, such cases are closed, or the sentences are kept secret after months of trial with no legal explanation. These cases can also be due to political disagreement between factions of the system and the defendant, thereby used as a tool to warn or punish.If the government really wanted to fight corruption, the first step would be to properly enforce article 142 of the constitution, which states: The assets of the Leader, the President, the deputies to the President, and ministers, as well as those of their spouses and offspring, are to be examined before and after their term of office by the head of the judicial power, in order to ensure they have not increased in a fashion contrary to law. Human RightsThe government claims to be working to improve Iran's human rights records, but many have observed that Rowhani's promises have not even begun to be fulfilled.His office appears to have chosen not to challenge the three major institutions that set the boundaries for human rights, civil liberties and social justice: the IRGC, Iran's intelligence (Etela'at) and the judiciary.The judiciary recently executed a juvenile convicted for the death of her husband. According to a recent release by the U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in Iran, Ahmed Shaheed: ""These executions are disturbing examples of surging execution rates and questionable fair trial standards."" Iran ""must comply with its international law obligations and put an end to the execution of juvenile offenders once and for all.""Dr. Majid Rafizadeh, an American scholar and political scientist, is the president of the International American Council on the Middle East.

No injuries were reported.County authorities requested sandbags for homes being evacuated due to flooding and Interstate 45 was shut down in some spots in Navarro County due to rising waters, stranding drivers.Taylor Bates, 19, said she had not been home since Friday, when both of the roads to her home in an unincorporated area of the county flooded and partially washed away.""My mom is stuck at the house and she can't leave, but the house is OK,"" she said. ""But I can't get home. Both ways to get to our house are flooded.""Some 75 water rescues from vehicles, homes and businesses had been carried out in Navarro County since Friday, Sheriff Elmer Tanner said.There were no confirmed deaths from the deluge, but in San Antonio, a woman reported that her boyfriend was swept into a drainage ditch as he walked his dog early Saturday. Officials said he was considered missing.But as evening fell and the storm moved eastward, cities in the state's flood-prone Gulf of Mexico region, including Houston, braced for potential floods. Rain systems intensified by Patricia, now a tropical depression after crashing into Mexico's west coast as a powerful hurricane, were pushing across the state.Houston, the state's second-most populous metropolitan area with 6.1 million people, was under a tornado watch until 10 p.m. (0300 GMT Sunday).Saturday's rainfall led to the cancellation of about 100 flights at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, one of the country's busiest air hubs, according to tracking service FlightAware.In the Galveston area, authorities urged a voluntary evacuation of the elderly and residents with medical issues on the Bolivar Peninsula near Galveston Bay.The conditions could hinder transportation to and from the peninsula. Power outages are also possible as a result of gale force winds, authorities said.Forecasters predicted 8 to 12 inches (20 to 30 cm) of rain will hit the coastal area by Monday morning, combined with tides up to 5 feet (1.5 meter) and wind gusts up to 35 mph overnight on Saturday.Houston Mayor Annise Parker warned residents to stay away from wet roads after dark and be aware that flooding is likely. Even so, some residents eyed the coming storms with some indifference.""In Houston it's always like that when it rains; it's going to flood,"" said Vittorio Preteroti, owner and chef of the upscale Perbacco Italian restaurant in downtown Houston, before the eatery opened for dinner.Nonetheless, officials reminded residents of deadly flooding in the past and urged vigilance.""Unfortunately some people lost their lives in high-water incidents,"" said Harris County Judge Ed Emmett, whose county includes Houston. ""We're going to get a lot of rain tonight and it's going to result in some high water situations so for heaven's sake be careful out there.""Retailers in the area reported that locals made a run on supplies in anticipation of the floods.""We've seen a spike in the sales of bottled water, bread, milk, canned meats, fruit and even items such as charcoal, which customers use to barbecue if there's a power outage at their homes,"" said Kristal Howard, public relations manager for Kroger Southwest.The weekend deluge marked the second time in five months that severe weather hammered parts of Texas.

The photo was used as evidence during the trial of accused mob boss James ""Whitey"" Bulger, who is on trial for racketeering and 19 murders that occurred in the 1970s and 80s.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587d51ae1700009f0a92a6f1.jpeg?cache=xNCfwHQA3d&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ICYMI Health features what we're reading this week.This week, writers answered so many of our longstanding questions. Why do we admire mobsters? (Answer: They're dangerous, but not too dangerous.) And what, exactly, is social anxiety? (Answer: Being afraid of rejection by peers to an extreme degree.) And on a heavier note, we got answers to questions we didn't even know to ask, including: ""What is 'airborne cancer'?""One of our own Healthy Living editors also investigated the hypocrisy in blaming someone for a substance use disorder. We also read about the nature of adult friendships and, yes, becoming a 20-something nun in 2015.Read on and tell us in the comments: What did you read and love this week?Experts are calling multidrug-resistant tuberculosis ""airborne cancer.""'There's no question in my mind that I'd rather be treated for hepatitis C … or HIV' than contract MDR-TB today, said Dr. Randall Reves. 'We're stuck where HIV was in 1994.'One in four people will experience a mental health issue in his or her life, meaning it’s more important than ever to dispel the lingering stigma surrounding mental illness.When you have the flu, you go see a doctor. That same standard should apply to mental health. Romanticizing the Italian mob depends on psychological distance. The mobsters seem culturally similar enough to be relatable, but unlike serial killers’ antics, mobsters’ illicit activities don’t often directly endanger us. They’re presented as similar enough for sympathy, yet different enough for a false sense of safety to creep in. For reasons of language, culture, and race, members of the Chinese and Russian mob have proven harder to romanticize.People who suffer from true social anxiety become so distressed by socializing that it impacts their lives. He would say, ‘Hi, I like your face. Would you go out with me?” And she would say, ‘No, go away, you freak.’ And that would be perfect.For devout Catholic women, joining a convent is akin to playing in the NBA, according to the 36-year-old mother superior of an order in Minnesota.When a woman gets married, she leaves her family because that guy is better. That guy for us is Jesus.When the media portray substance use disorder like it's a lifestyle choice, it heightens the stigma surrounding addiction. Imagine saying those things about other diseases: 'Why can't Lamar beat cancer? Isn’t he rich enough to afford treatment?' or 'How come Lamar keeps having lupus flare-ups? He should know better than that.'Car deaths track along the same lines as poverty and political ideology.People in less advantaged states tend to drive older, less expensive cars. These cars are less likely to offer good crash protection and be equipped with the appropriate safety technology. In contrast, more affluent and knowledge-based states have smaller percentages of people who drive, and even those who do are often forced -- either by law or other factors like congestion -- to drive slower.Voluntary, non-contractual relationships require a lot of effort, from both parties.You find at the end of young adulthood, now you don’t have time for the very people who helped you make all these life decisions.The hostage negotiators during the deadly 1993 siege in Waco, Texas, had very different attitudes about whether or not ambiguous situations require closure. If there’s any takeaway, it’s that we’re programmed to get rid of ambiguity, and yet if we engage with it we can make better decisions, we can be more creative, and we can even be a little more empathetic.Also on HuffPost:"
9,SCIENCE,These Photos Show How The World Might Look To A Person With Autism,Carolyn Gregoire,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/autism-study-photos_us_562a51dfe4b0443bb563ad29,"""They don't look at most things in a typical way.""",2015-10-24,Researchers created photos to show how people with autism perceive their environments.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/562a892d1400002200c7abbd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Individuals with autism see the world through very different eyes than those who don't have it, which impacts how they interact with their environment.Research from Cal Tech, published online Thursday, found this is because a wide range of visual input is interpreted differently in the brain of a person with autism spectrum disorder.""It is known that people with ASD have difficulty often figuring out how other people feel or what their social gestures mean, from looking at their faces and body postures,"" Dr. Ralph Adolphs, the study's lead author, told The Huffington Post in an email. ""This may be because they pay attention to them differently.""In other words, when a person with autism exhibits repetitive or antisocial behaviors, doesn't make contact or has difficulty communicating -- the main characteristics of the disorder -- it could be because of their perception and attention focus in a given situation.""Among other findings, our work shows that the story is not as simple as saying 'people with ASD don't look normally at faces,'"" Adolphs said in a statement. ""They don't look at most things in a typical way.""The researchers explored this by creating a series of images that depict how a person with autism experiences their environment. For the study the research team showed 700 images to 20 individuals with high-functioning autism and 19 control subjects, who didn't have autism, while an eye-tracking device recorded their attention patterns on different objects within the images.Check out the renderings below to see what the researchers discovered. For each pair of images, the top image shows how it is perceived by an individual with autism, while the bottom shows how it is perceived by the control subject.In this set of images, note how the person with autism is more focused on the back of the referee's head, rather than the player's face. In these images, the person with autism pays more attention to the tree and the sky rather than the mother and baby elephant in the foreground.While in these images, the person with autism is not paying attention to the trajectory of the football in the same way that the control subject did. As you can see, the individuals with autism are less drawn to faces and other ""meaningful"" objects in the scene -- a tendency which can lead to challenges in social situations. ""This probably makes it more difficult for [people with autism] to socialize, especially in a complex environment like a party, because they may have difficulty knowing where to [direct their attention],"" Adolphs told HuffPost. The findings could in the future help clinicians identify autism disorder subtypes, which would enable them to better diagnose individual cases. ""The study is probably most useful for informing diagnosis,"" Adolphs said in a statement. ""Autism is many things. Our study is one initial step in trying to discover what kinds of different autisms there actually are ... Once we have identified those subtypes, we can begin to ask if different kinds of treatment might be best for each kind of subtype."" More and more, we're seeing that autism cannot be approached with a one size fits all diagnosis -- and further research may helpful in devising tailored treatments that target the many nuances of the disorder.

Today, we speak with Nataliya Rostova, a chronicler and critic of the Russian media. Days after Russian President Vladimir Putin committed his air force to a bombing campaign in Syria in support of President Bashar Assad, a weather forecaster on Russia's state-owned Rossiya24 TV channel positioned herself in front of a massive screen showing Russian fighter planes.Analyzing wind speeds and cloud formations, the woman reassured viewers that Syria's weather in October was perfect for Russia's aerial assault. ""Experts note the time for the start of the air operation [in Syria] is chosen very well,"" she said, reported Agence France Presse. The Oct. 5 broadcast was just the latest example of the way the Russian government uses the mass media to sell domestic and international political decisions to the public, a trend exacerbated since the start of the conflict in Crimea last year. Freedom House, which publishes the annual Freedom of The Press report, noted of the press in the country that: Russia’s occupation of the Crimean Peninsula and involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine helped to drive an increase in propagandistic content in the Russian news media and tighter restrictions on dissenting views in 2014. Media outlets became more firmly incorporated into the Kremlin’s policy efforts, moving from supporting the government with biased news to actively participating in an “information war” with its perceived adversaries. Ongoing insurgencies, corrupt officials, and crime within Russia continued to pose a danger to journalists who reported on them, and the remaining independent media outlets in the country came under growing pressure from the authorities. The WorldPost spoke with Nataliya Rostova, a visiting scholar at the University of Berkeley's Graduate School of Journalism and a senior correspondent at Moscow-based online magazine Slon.ru, about Putin's control of the press. Rostova is also the author of Gorbymedia.com, a research project about the birth of the Russian media in the era of former President Mikhail Gorbachev. How has the Russian media portrayed the Russian intervention in Syria? In general, the Russian media portrays anything going on from the point of view of Vladimir Putin. He has unlimited access to the media and they explain everything that's going on according to his official statement. It doesn't really matter if it's a war in Syria or any other topic. How does the Russian president manage to control the media with such great success? After Putin came into power in 2000, he established control over the three main TV stations. In 2001 and 2002, he took control of the two biggest TV channels, ORT (now First Channel) and NTV. The state broadcaster, RTR (now Rossiya 1), was already under his control.During his subsequent year in power, Putin moved more and more outlets under his influence until he controlled most of the major mainstream media. He appoints editors and general directors, either officially or unofficially. The director of VGTRK, the biggest [state] media holding, which owns Rossiya 1, Rossiya 2 etc., is appointed by presidential decree, for example. When it comes to so-called independent media, which are smaller and not owned by the state, there's often an agreement between the Kremlin, the owner and the editor-in-chief. Even Aleksey Venediktov, the editor-in-chief of Echo Moskvy, which is sometimes called the last remaining independent radio station in Russia but in reality isn't independent, says publicly that Putin is the only person who can fire him. The editors and directors have so-called weekly meetings with the presidential administration to talk about the upcoming events, what will be significant in the next week, what the administration wants to cover.Additionally, media outlets are dependent on state funding and the TV advertising market is almost monopolized as well. Do Russian citizens in any way ask for more objective coverage? We all - journalists, the state, and society - failed in terms of media freedom, because when you ask an average Russian if freedom of the press is important to him, he'll say no. In general, they're ok with the idea of censorship. They're ok with the idea of state-owned media. Until Mikhail Gorbachev opened up the Soviet Union at the end of the 1980s and started to allow TV and newspapers to report critically, Russian media was completely state-controlled. Does that history of censorship help explain the situation today? In my opinion, it's related to the fact that we got this freedom from above. Because it was given from above, people don't value it. We didn’t really fight for it. We didn’t demand it. It was just given to us and ""so what"" if it's taken. Journalists also really failed the people’s trust. It is a complex story, but to keep it simple: In the beginning of the 1990s journalists were considered messiahs, praised for telling the truth. Many of them even became deputies in parliament. But they turned out to be either biased or corrupt. During the oligarchs' information wars under the Yeltsin presidency, entire editorial staffs were taken and bought. Journalists were taking sides in a number of political events. A lot of people just saw that it was easy to buy them. Can social media play a role in critiquing the state version of events? On a personal level, sometimes, but in general, it’s not a trend. It doesn’t influence anything. The number of readers that receive information from media outlets that are critical to the state is no more than five percent and only a minority receives critical news through social media. You don't seem very optimistic about the future. I think that I’m realistic. I've been covering media since 2002 and I saw the landscape change step by step. I didn't want to believe it every time they'd take one more channel, every time another outlet lost its integrity. But I witnessed it anyway. Now, the last option for editorial integrity has been taken as well. A new law which takes effect next year will restrict foreign ownership of media outlets to no more than 20 percent. It was the last resort for independent journalism in Russia, being owned by foreigners. For example: Forbes Magazine, which is distributed in Russia by the German company Axel Springer, is a very good source for independent journalism. The magazine was founded in 2004 by Paul Khlebnikov, an American with a Russian background, and he was its first editor-in-chief. He was shot and killed a few months after the launch of the magazine, and the case still hasn't been fully investigated. Forbes remained an excellent media outlet, even after Khlebnikov's death. However, now it has been bought by a Russian owner. A few days ago he admitted publicly in an interview that Forbes readers are not interested in the information of officials running state-owned companies. Where will this situation lead? Most likely, honest journalists will have to quit their positions. I'm sending my deepest condolences to colleagues. They are not the first ones though, they are one of the last ones.The same fate awaits the best quality newspaper Vedomosti, which comes together with the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times. Russia is the only place where two competing companies issue one product together. But they won't be able to do that anymore. It means we may lose some of the last free media.

He turned around to find a tiger shark -- which he described as a ""big guy"" -- with both of his legs in its mouth. As the shark repeatedly pulled him under, Lee threw punches in a desperate attempt to fend off the animal, KITV reported.""I had goggles on, so I could see things really clearly, and I kept thinking that if I just kept punching him he would let me go,"" Lee said. ""He pulled me down one last time, so I just reached out and put my finger in his eye and pulled out his eyeball.""When Lee finally escaped to the surface, he said, ""I was holding his eyeball. So I let it go and was treading water."" A father and son kayaking in the area heard Lee's screams and came to his rescue, paddling him to shore. Lee lost so much blood, doctors said, that just a few more minutes without aid would have been fatal, according to KITV.""I could feel the blood leaving my body, and there was a big trail,"" Lee said.Lee, an avid athlete, lost one foot and likely will undergo surgery to repair the second. While he's eager to get back to his active lifestyle, he admitted it will be a while before he'll get in the water again.""I got a little PTSD, you know,"" he told KITV. ""Sometimes when I close my eyes, I can still see the shark.""Lee's encounter was the sixth shark attack off Hawaii's shores this year.

16,RELIGION,What Is Nostra Aetate And What Does It Have To Do With Catholic-Jewish Relations?,"Lauren Markoe, Religion News Service",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nostra-aetate-catholic-jewish-relations_us_562ac346e4b0aac0b8fd0ec0,Let us explain.,2015-10-24,"Jan 1 - Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God (Catholic)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55c216ae1d00002f00143e4a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"(RNS) Fifty years ago Wednesday (Oct. 28), the Vatican issued a declaration that established a new rapport between Jews and Catholics. On the eve of this anniversary, the Anti-Defamation League — founded to protect Jewish lives and rights — called the church’s approval of Nostra Aetate “arguably the most important moment in modern Jewish-Christian relations.” How so? Let us ‘Splain …Q: “Nostra Aetate.” Does that mean “Jewish people” in Latin?A: It means “In Our Time.” They are the first words of the declaration, which was written during the Second Vatican Council, the most far-reaching reform effort of the Roman Catholic Church in centuries. The document’s English title: “Declaration on the Relation of the Church to Non-Christian Religions.”In the fourth of its five sections, Nostra Aetate focuses in on the relationship between Jews and Catholics. By the way, the entire declaration is a quick read — little more than a page long.Q: Yeah, but could I have the Cliff Notes version?A: Nostra Aetate draws a poetic analogy between Christians and Jews, describing them as the “well-cultivated olive tree onto which have been grafted the wild shoots, the Gentiles.”Crucially, it rejects the charge that the Jewish people are responsible for Jesus’ death, an accusation used for centuries to justify the persecution of Jews. The document reads: ” . . . what happened in His passion cannot be charged against all the Jews, without distinction, then alive, nor against the Jews of today.” The church, it continues, “decries hatred, persecutions, displays of anti-Semitism, directed against Jews at any time and by anyone.”Q: Does Nostra Aetate mention the Holocaust?A: No, but it was born of it. French Jewish historian Jules Isaac survived the Holocaust and then immersed himself in Christian texts, trying to understand how Christians could participate in Hitler’s plan to murder the Jews, or stand by as millions perished. He concluded that a misinterpretation of the Gospels, a “teaching of contempt,” had provided an excuse to persecute Jews for centuries, and that it must be supplanted by a teaching true to Jesus’ message.In 1949, Isaac met with Pope Pius XII, whose response to Nazism is viewed by critics as too slow and too quiet, and remains a point of contention. Little came of the meeting. Ten years later, Isaac met with Pope John XXIII, admired for his efforts to save Jews during World War II. John, who had already thought deeply about Christian responsibility for Jewish suffering, entrusted Cardinal Augustin Bea, a champion of Jewish-Catholic relations, to lead the effort to draft a declaration on the church and the Jews.Q: Does Nostra Aetate talk about religions other than Judaism?A: As originally conceived, the declaration was to be about the church and the Jews only. Traditionalists, and Middle Eastern bishops unsympathetic to the new state of Israel, objected. Bea decided on a less contentious goal: a document that stressed ecumenism and discussed other faiths.Hinduism and Buddhism each get a complimentary line or two. And the third of Nostra Aetate’s five sections is devoted to Islam. “The Church regards with esteem also the Moslems,” it states. “They adore the one God, living and subsisting in Himself; merciful and all-powerful, the Creator of heaven and earth, who has spoken to men.”Q: So after Nostra Aetate, everything is hunky-dory between Catholics and Jews?A: Issues have arisen, including the Vatican’s reluctance to establish diplomatic relations with Israel, which occurred in 1993, and the pursuit of sainthood for Pope Pius XII. But since Nostra Aetate was signed, all popes have taken seriously its charge to improve Jewish-Catholic relations. And in 1998 the Vatican apologized for its inaction during the Holocaust.As for the current pontiff, even before he was Pope Francis, Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Buenos Aires enjoyed a close friendship with Argentine Rabbi Abraham Skorka. The pair co-hosted a television show and wrote a book together about interfaith dialogue. These days, when Skorka visits Francis at the Vatican, the pope himself is known to supervise their meals, so that the rabbi eats only kosher food.Also on HuffPost:"

There is one less person in the race for the 2016 presidency interested in disability advocacy, especially employment. If the national media is to believed, the leader of the Democratic Party will be Hillary Clinton. And if the national polls are to be believed, Sec. Clinton will be President Hillary Clinton. While this seems like a win for disability advocacy, I am worried. I do not see a strong advocate for individuals with disabilities in the former Secretary of State - yet.I believe Joe Biden would continue the work of Pres. Obama and he implored the democrats to run on his record. The 44th President of the United States has done more for the employment of individuals with disabilities than anyone other than Sen. Harkin in the past 10 years. Obama has enhanced the economic empowerment of our community more than any other president by writing Executive Order 13546, increasing federal employment for individuals with disabilities. On Tuesday, it was reported that the federal government hit an all-time high in the employment of individuals with disabilities working for Uncle Sam. Enhancement of the American with Disabilities Act, and specifically Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act has been working. By requiring federal contractors and subcontractors to have 7% of the workforce as individuals with disabilities, businesses are adding disability to their inclusionary practices. President Obama has us on the right path.Here is where we need further, future leadership. Future President Clinton, please promise to work with us to continue furthering opportunities for individuals with disabilities in employment, education and entrepreneurship. It is through these economic opportunities that we better our own individual lives.What should the next president do? They should further expand what has started with Section 503 by asking states to follow suit. States that accept federal vocational rehabilitation monies could be required to similarly higher employees with disabilities at state agencies with an increase of 5% as well as any companies working under state contracts having a 5 to 7% employment level of individuals with disabilities. A Clinton administration could strongly urge businesses to expand their supplier diversity base to include businesses owned by individuals with disabilities. Many times the loss of health care benefits hinders the individual with a disability from finding a job. It is a great personal burden to not lose your very important benefits. The next president could make Medicaid available to ALL individuals with disabilities regardless of employment/economic status. You may think that will cost our government more money, but the US would be adding to its revenue side in new income tax at the same time removing individuals from Social Security. Require individuals with disabilities who can to work/volunteer for the Medicaid funds - we all want to work if we can. There are creative ways to continue this expanding conversation of economic empowerment.I have concerns. Based on Clinton's web presence, there is little talk of disability employment. And while this is not a 'media-sexy' issue, it is very important to those of us living with disabilities. Statistically, one out of six Americans have or will have a disability in their lifetime.There is exactly one paragraph on employment for individuals with disabilities under the issues section on www.hillaryclinton.com. It is understandably in its own category. But, I noticed on Clinton's front page they are proud to say Katy Perry is coming to Iowa! Good for Iowa... I'm not sure how that will help Iowans with disabilities. Secretary Clinton is correct when she stated at the 25th anniversary of the ADA: ""So there's a lot of unfinished business - both at home, and around the world. But I personally believe that the progress and the landmark legislation - first on education then broadly opening up transportation and buildings and employment, everything that people should be able to pursue - that that legislation was one of the real highlights of the civil rights and human rights movements in America.There is unfinished business. It also appears there is unfinished business on her platform. More than just reaffirming the anniversary, real policy needs to be brought forth an enhanced similar to the Obama Administration's actions.Clinton's main Democratic rival Bernie Sanders has a troubling internet footprint on the issue. On his official website (berniesanders.com) there is no reference to disability issues. Under veteran's issues, there is no mention of employment. This is an extremely disappointing stance. This makes Clinton's 38 words seem very impressive.America deserves more. We do not need pretty pictures on the websites of candidates standing next to Individuals in wheelchairs. We do not need to be placated about the advancements made in the past 25 years. We do need further education, employment and entrepreneurship opportunities.The unemployment rate for Individuals with disabilities is over 15%, and yet four out of five people have left the workforce. The real unemployment rate is approximately 70 to 80% for individuals with disabilities. President Obama's policies have led us on the right path for increased employment of individuals with disabilities.Please President Hillary Clinton and others, work with our community. Listen to our real needs and actively engage on future advancements. Less Katy Perry, more employment opportunities. If you will do this then I will be happy to say, I was wrong."

Probably not. Christie needs one helluva ""break out"" moment, and it's hard to see that happening.

Micallef, ContributorBest Selling Military History and World Affairs Author and Key...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/substance-and-symbolism-i_b_8364312.html,There is a fundamental disconnect between the substance and the symbolism of President Obama's foreign policy. This is not a case of saying one thing and doing another. In the case of the Obama administration it is a case of saying one thing but delivering it in a style and with imagery that belies its authenticity.,2015-10-24,2015-10-23-1445568257-1915088-obamaforeignpolicyengagementmilitaryintervention722x479.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-10-23-1445568257-1915088-obamaforeignpolicyengagementmilitaryintervention722x479-thumb.jpg," President Barack Obama delivering speech on terrorism at the National Defense University, February 10, 2013The conduct of foreign policy contains both elements of substance and symbolism. The substance of foreign policy is easy enough to define. It is the enduring principles of American foreign policy and their translation into how the United States conducts its relations with over 200 independent countries and multilateral organizations around the world. It is the treaties, both bilateral and multilateral, that define the rights, prerogatives, and obligations of the United States with the corresponding parties. It is the unofficial agreements and guarantees that, over time, the U.S. government has accepted and which successive administrations have tacitly upheld. All of which is in turn supported by the sinews of power: military might, economic strength, deep pockets of money, and technological prowess. Symbolism on the other hand is less easily defined. It is not ""soft power,"" i.e., the power of ideas, of shared principals or cultural attractiveness, although such elements often manifest themselves as enduring symbols, universally recognized and understood. The Statue of Liberty is one such ""symbol,"" shorthand for the ideal of the ""American dream"" and the promise of economic opportunity and advancement that the U.S. has offered to millions of immigrants from around the world. If the substance of foreign policy is what we say and subsequently do then the symbolism of foreign policy is how we say it. Which foreign leader gets invited to the White House first by a new administration, whom do we send abroad to represent the United State at a multilateral conference, an inauguration, or a funeral? Which countries do a president or his ranking cabinet members visit, what message do they leave behind and where, how and with whom do they deliver it?When a president dispatches a carrier task force to a troubled corner of the world he is not just demonstrating the global reach of American military power, he is also invoking an important symbol of American military strength and sending a powerful message that what happens in this corner of the world matters to the United States, it is a symbol that we intend to honor whatever commitments we have made. Such are the elements of symbolism in the conduct of foreign policy. Presidents understand the meaning of symbolism. After all you do not get elected to the highest political office of the land without understanding how to create and manipulate powerful images and symbols. There is a fundamental disconnect between the substance and the symbolism of President Obama's foreign policy. This is not a case of saying one thing and doing another. Such practices are hardly new to government--they have a long and recognizable history independent of who is in power. No, in the case of the Obama administration it is more a case of saying one thing but delivering it in a style and with imagery that belies its authenticity. It is a case of affirming, or at least not reversing, enduring principles of American foreign policy while simultaneously invoking symbols that suggest the opposite. President Obama greets Speaker John Boehner, State of the Union speech 2011Consider the fact that there isn't a single key principal of American foreign policy that the Obama Administration has publicly disavowed, not a single security guarantee, either official or unofficial, that the Obama administration has said it would not honor. Yet in myriads of ways the Obama administration has insisted on sending out signals, created symbols that would raise doubts about the very policies that the administration, at least on paper, continues to support. This is not a question of America's willingness to deploy military force. It's true that the Obama administration moved quickly to reduce U.S. military forces deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan. Indeed, President Obama saw his election as a mandate to wind down the American role in those conflicts. Doing so, however, while it may have proven to be ill advised, did not, fundamentally, run counter to key objectives of American foreign policy. The United States is not an inherently militaristic nation. We do not go to war in some misguided pursuit of glory or as a measure of our national will or prowess. We go to war because a president has decided that the application of military force will best serve securing the American interest. Admittedly, of late, we have done so much too often and without exercising sufficient foresight to truly weigh or understand the consequences of those decisions. For America, however, war making is a tactic not an underlying principal of our foreign policy. Consider on the other hand the Obama administration's foreign policies in the Middle East. Officially we have not reneged on any of our commitments to our allies in the region, yet the Obama administration has consistently and symbolically conveyed the message that it wants to disengage from the region, that the turmoil in the region ""does not pose an existential threat to the United States,"" and that the region should find its own ""balance of power"" and sort out its affairs without reliance on American power, in all its various manifestations, and especially on our willingness to commit ground forces in the region. All the while leaving unanswered the question, if we disengage what does that mean for the security guarantees that we have made? Will we promptly come back if one of our allies is threatened or is our disengagement an implicit abrogation of those promises of security? The fact that when the Obama administration has engaged military power it has done so reluctantly, hesitatingly, and often times under rules of engagement that make it more difficult to accomplish the very objectives that military force was designed to achieve, further underscores the question of Washington's intentions and the reliability of its commitments. The examples are legion: the very public spat with Netanyahu, the cold shoulder to Egypt, our inconsistent support toward Kurdish military forces in both Iraq and Syria, the half-hearted air campaign against Islamic State, and most of all our insistence on negotiating an agreement with Iran that many of our Gulf allies felt was inadequate and only served to embolden Iranian aggression in the region. These are all telling examples.  USS Theodore RooseveltConsider the most recent case. On the week of October 20th, as both the United States and Europe began the process of dismantling the economic sanctions that had been placed on Iran, there wasn't a single American carrier in the Arabian Gulf. When questioned about that point, a Pentagon spokesman responded that the previous carrier, the Theodore Roosevelt, was scheduled for routine maintenance and was in fact already two months overdue and had been withdrawn from the Gulf the week before. The carrier Harry S. Truman, which is scheduled to arrive in a few months, will replace it. This was the first time since 2007, that the United States does not have a carrier task force on station in the region. The Pentagon spokesman went on to add that the U.S. had plenty of other air assets in the region should the need arise. In fact, the U.S. does have plenty of air assets in the Gulf. In addition, the French have a smaller carrier in the vicinity and there is considerable air power among our Gulf allies as well. Moreover, it is difficult to imagine that at the very moment when the EU and the U.S. were preparing to dismantle their sanctions against Iran, Tehran would want to stage a provocative incident in the Gulf. From a purely military standpoint, the absence of a carrier in the region might impose some constraints on Washington's options, but it should not dramatically affect America's military posture in the Middle East. In the Arabian Gulf, however, the absence of an American carrier task force was seen as ripe with symbolism. Was it a tacit nod to Tehran, a visual reminder that the U.S. would not stand in Iran's way as it sought to expand its influence in the region; another undisclosed side agreement among the many unofficial, and still largely secret provisions of the nuclear agreement? Was it telling that at a time when Russia was flexing its muscles in the Middle East, indeed at virtually the very moment that Russian ships were entering the Gulf, the U.S. was withdrawing?It is true that the Theodore Roosevelt was overdue for maintenance work. This is not in dispute. The fact is, a legacy of extended deployments combined with budget cuts has left the U.S. Navy straining to meet all of the tasks required by its carrier fleet. The unanswered question is, whether the subsequent absence of another carrier was a deliberate signal, a symbol of American intentions in the region, or was it simply an oversight? Is it possible that no one in the White House or the Pentagon noticed that by the end of October the U.S. would no longer have a carrier on station in the Gulf and that it would be several months until a new carrier arrived or was Washington simply oblivious to the symbolism it was conveying? Subtlety, ambiguity, and subterfuge are all elements in the tool chest of statecraft. No nation can conduct its foreign policy with complete transparency. Certainly no great power with its myriad of interests can conduct its foreign policy in such a manner, especially when so many of its opponents hold their cards close to the vest. The issue with the conduct of Obama's foreign policy is not that it's somehow overly ambiguous or vague in its intentions. Nor is it a question of competence. There are plenty of experienced foreign policy professionals in the White House that understand very well both the substance of American foreign policy and how to conduct its diplomacy. The issue rather is that there is a basic disconnect between the stated objectives of U.S. foreign policy and the symbolism with which the White House often surrounds it. That disconnectedness creates a sense of incoherence in American foreign policy that is marked by an indecisiveness, an inconsistency between the substance of U.S. policy and the symbolism which accompanies it, a hesitation that underscores the unwillingness of the Obama administration to lead and to behave as a great power would be expected to comport itself. In other words, the sense of incoherence that pervades Obama's foreign policy does not stem so much from its stated objectives as it does from the style in which it is carried out and, make no mistake, the ""style"" of this nation's foreign policy begins and ends in the Oval Office.President Obama has often been described as a ""weak"" leader by his critics. That isn't true. To begin with the trials of the presidential selection marathon are sufficiently grueling that weak leaders would be washed out long before they would have an opportunity to be elected to the White House. Moreover, the president has certainly not shown any weakness in the single-minded manner in which he has pursued his domestic agenda. The White House has shown little compunction about riding roughshod over its domestic opponents or stretching the very limits of executive authority in order to impose its will.  Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin at Putin's Dacha in Sochi, 2009Why is it that an administration that has shown itself to be such a tenacious, take no prisoners, competitor in domestic politics seem so ambivalent and hesitant in the conduct of its foreign policy? Why is Barack Obama so willing to defy John Boehner but hesitant to stand up to Vladimir Putin? House Republicans take note--maybe you should consider Putin for the Speakership, or at the very least Majority Whip! No, the problem is not the President's strength of character or willpower. Obama has plenty of both. The issue rather is in the Obama White House's view of the world and Obama's fundamental uncomfortableness with the role that the United States plays in it. For Obama the conduct of the United States on the world stage and the exercise of American power is part of a continuous line of Euro-American, political, economic, cultural, and military dominance over the rest of humanity that has endured for the better part of half a millennium. In this worldview, the behavior of the U.S. on the world stage in the 21st century is nothing more than the continuation of the historical legacy, the intellectual and moral descendent of 500 years of rapacious European imperialism and its subjugation and ruthless exploitation of the non-Caucasian people of the world. In that narrative, the United States may have been late to that party, but it has been a willing and enthusiastic participant since it joined the Euro-American imperialist club. That is why the Obama administration is fundamentally more comfortable in multilateral forums where it can just be ""one of the boys"" and that is why the Obama administration seems so hesitant in its exercise of American power, military or otherwise, around the globe.The Obama White House would like to live in a world where the lion lies down with the lamb--a happy occurrence that unfortunately has not happened since Adam and Eve were abruptly ejected from the Garden of Eden. In our world, sadly, lions don't lay down with lambs they eat them. The issue for this Administration is that the United States has long-standing commitments to protect the lambs of the world--which requires us to chase the lion off if it gets to close and in the worst case, if need be, shoot the lion. The problem for our allies, and for the conduct of U.S. foreign policy in general, is that the White House keeps signaling a hesitancy to drive the lion away much less shoot it. If you were the lamb wouldn't you be worried?  Barack Obama with leaders from Pacific Rim countries at the negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership , 2010The fundamental issue with the foreign policy of President Obama is that it is pervaded by a strong sense that the White House is fundamentally uncomfortable with being the leader of a superpower. The problem is that we are a superpower, and that the rest of the world, at least those countries that are not fundamentally opposed to us, look to Washington for leadership. When America declines or is hesitant about exercising that leadership the outcome is not a more democratic world but a more chaotic and unstable one. A world in which invariably the vacuum of leadership is taken up not by other like-minded countries but by ""bad actors"" whose actions are inimical to both American interests and those of our allies. This is the pattern that has emerged in places like the Middle East or the South China Sea. American disengagement from the world in general, and the Middle East in particular, will not produce a more stable or a more peaceful Middle East but one that is more dysfunctional and dangerous, one more prone to violence, one in which Russia and Iran will have a free hand to impose their will on their neighbors. Either you lead or you don't. But you cannot lead by half measures--you cannot lead part of the time and be absent otherwise. Contrary to the White House's assertion, you cannot ""lead from behind."" The glaring contradiction of Obama's foreign policy, the wellspring of its seeming incoherence, is that the leader of the free world seems fundamentally uncomfortable with leading it and in exercising the prerogatives of a superpower, which as its leader, he must sometimes do. The Obama administration needs to either change the world or change its style--sadly it has not been able to do either."

The examples are legion: the very public spat with Netanyahu, the cold shoulder to Egypt, our inconsistent support toward Kurdish military forces in both Iraq and Syria, the half-hearted air campaign against Islamic State, and most of all our insistence on negotiating an agreement with Iran that many of our Gulf allies felt was inadequate and only served to embolden Iranian aggression in the region. These are all telling examples.  USS Theodore RooseveltConsider the most recent case. On the week of October 20th, as both the United States and Europe began the process of dismantling the economic sanctions that had been placed on Iran, there wasn't a single American carrier in the Arabian Gulf. When questioned about that point, a Pentagon spokesman responded that the previous carrier, the Theodore Roosevelt, was scheduled for routine maintenance and was in fact already two months overdue and had been withdrawn from the Gulf the week before. The carrier Harry S. Truman, which is scheduled to arrive in a few months, will replace it. This was the first time since 2007, that the United States does not have a carrier task force on station in the region. The Pentagon spokesman went on to add that the U.S. had plenty of other air assets in the region should the need arise. In fact, the U.S. does have plenty of air assets in the Gulf. In addition, the French have a smaller carrier in the vicinity and there is considerable air power among our Gulf allies as well. Moreover, it is difficult to imagine that at the very moment when the EU and the U.S. were preparing to dismantle their sanctions against Iran, Tehran would want to stage a provocative incident in the Gulf. From a purely military standpoint, the absence of a carrier in the region might impose some constraints on Washington's options, but it should not dramatically affect America's military posture in the Middle East. In the Arabian Gulf, however, the absence of an American carrier task force was seen as ripe with symbolism. Was it a tacit nod to Tehran, a visual reminder that the U.S. would not stand in Iran's way as it sought to expand its influence in the region; another undisclosed side agreement among the many unofficial, and still largely secret provisions of the nuclear agreement? Was it telling that at a time when Russia was flexing its muscles in the Middle East, indeed at virtually the very moment that Russian ships were entering the Gulf, the U.S. was withdrawing?It is true that the Theodore Roosevelt was overdue for maintenance work. This is not in dispute. The fact is, a legacy of extended deployments combined with budget cuts has left the U.S. Navy straining to meet all of the tasks required by its carrier fleet. The unanswered question is, whether the subsequent absence of another carrier was a deliberate signal, a symbol of American intentions in the region, or was it simply an oversight? Is it possible that no one in the White House or the Pentagon noticed that by the end of October the U.S. would no longer have a carrier on station in the Gulf and that it would be several months until a new carrier arrived or was Washington simply oblivious to the symbolism it was conveying? Subtlety, ambiguity, and subterfuge are all elements in the tool chest of statecraft. No nation can conduct its foreign policy with complete transparency. Certainly no great power with its myriad of interests can conduct its foreign policy in such a manner, especially when so many of its opponents hold their cards close to the vest. The issue with the conduct of Obama's foreign policy is not that it's somehow overly ambiguous or vague in its intentions. Nor is it a question of competence. There are plenty of experienced foreign policy professionals in the White House that understand very well both the substance of American foreign policy and how to conduct its diplomacy. The issue rather is that there is a basic disconnect between the stated objectives of U.S. foreign policy and the symbolism with which the White House often surrounds it. That disconnectedness creates a sense of incoherence in American foreign policy that is marked by an indecisiveness, an inconsistency between the substance of U.S. policy and the symbolism which accompanies it, a hesitation that underscores the unwillingness of the Obama administration to lead and to behave as a great power would be expected to comport itself. In other words, the sense of incoherence that pervades Obama's foreign policy does not stem so much from its stated objectives as it does from the style in which it is carried out and, make no mistake, the ""style"" of this nation's foreign policy begins and ends in the Oval Office.President Obama has often been described as a ""weak"" leader by his critics. That isn't true. To begin with the trials of the presidential selection marathon are sufficiently grueling that weak leaders would be washed out long before they would have an opportunity to be elected to the White House. Moreover, the president has certainly not shown any weakness in the single-minded manner in which he has pursued his domestic agenda. The White House has shown little compunction about riding roughshod over its domestic opponents or stretching the very limits of executive authority in order to impose its will.  Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin at Putin's Dacha in Sochi, 2009Why is it that an administration that has shown itself to be such a tenacious, take no prisoners, competitor in domestic politics seem so ambivalent and hesitant in the conduct of its foreign policy? Why is Barack Obama so willing to defy John Boehner but hesitant to stand up to Vladimir Putin? House Republicans take note--maybe you should consider Putin for the Speakership, or at the very least Majority Whip! No, the problem is not the President's strength of character or willpower. Obama has plenty of both. The issue rather is in the Obama White House's view of the world and Obama's fundamental uncomfortableness with the role that the United States plays in it. For Obama the conduct of the United States on the world stage and the exercise of American power is part of a continuous line of Euro-American, political, economic, cultural, and military dominance over the rest of humanity that has endured for the better part of half a millennium. In this worldview, the behavior of the U.S. on the world stage in the 21st century is nothing more than the continuation of the historical legacy, the intellectual and moral descendent of 500 years of rapacious European imperialism and its subjugation and ruthless exploitation of the non-Caucasian people of the world. In that narrative, the United States may have been late to that party, but it has been a willing and enthusiastic participant since it joined the Euro-American imperialist club. That is why the Obama administration is fundamentally more comfortable in multilateral forums where it can just be ""one of the boys"" and that is why the Obama administration seems so hesitant in its exercise of American power, military or otherwise, around the globe.The Obama White House would like to live in a world where the lion lies down with the lamb--a happy occurrence that unfortunately has not happened since Adam and Eve were abruptly ejected from the Garden of Eden. In our world, sadly, lions don't lay down with lambs they eat them. The issue for this Administration is that the United States has long-standing commitments to protect the lambs of the world--which requires us to chase the lion off if it gets to close and in the worst case, if need be, shoot the lion. The problem for our allies, and for the conduct of U.S. foreign policy in general, is that the White House keeps signaling a hesitancy to drive the lion away much less shoot it. If you were the lamb wouldn't you be worried?  Barack Obama with leaders from Pacific Rim countries at the negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership , 2010The fundamental issue with the foreign policy of President Obama is that it is pervaded by a strong sense that the White House is fundamentally uncomfortable with being the leader of a superpower. The problem is that we are a superpower, and that the rest of the world, at least those countries that are not fundamentally opposed to us, look to Washington for leadership. When America declines or is hesitant about exercising that leadership the outcome is not a more democratic world but a more chaotic and unstable one. A world in which invariably the vacuum of leadership is taken up not by other like-minded countries but by ""bad actors"" whose actions are inimical to both American interests and those of our allies. This is the pattern that has emerged in places like the Middle East or the South China Sea. American disengagement from the world in general, and the Middle East in particular, will not produce a more stable or a more peaceful Middle East but one that is more dysfunctional and dangerous, one more prone to violence, one in which Russia and Iran will have a free hand to impose their will on their neighbors. Either you lead or you don't. But you cannot lead by half measures--you cannot lead part of the time and be absent otherwise. Contrary to the White House's assertion, you cannot ""lead from behind."" The glaring contradiction of Obama's foreign policy, the wellspring of its seeming incoherence, is that the leader of the free world seems fundamentally uncomfortable with leading it and in exercising the prerogatives of a superpower, which as its leader, he must sometimes do. The Obama administration needs to either change the world or change its style--sadly it has not been able to do either."
