Offices are abandoning cubicles in favor of shared desks and wide-open common spaces, and rather than sitting at their desks working independently, school children are placed in groups. It seems that a never-ending ""ping"" has become our culture's omnipresent background noise, instantly informing us of every text, tweet, and notification. Even something as mundane as cooking dinner has become worthy of social sharing.One result of all this social connection is that many of us rarely have any time alone. While we're told that this connectivity is a good thing and that being around other people is necessary for a fulfilled life, you can certainly have too much of a good thing.""All men's misfortunes spring from their hatred of being alone.""  - Jean de la Bruyere Solitude isn't just a professional plus; it's also good for your mental and emotional well-being. To get the most out of life, you must learn to enjoy spending time alone. The benefits of solitude are too numerous to catalog, but here are some of the best.You recuperate and recharge. All of us--even the hopeless extroverts among us--need time to recuperate and recharge. There's nothing like spending time alone to make this happen. The peace, quiet, and mental solitude you experience when you're by yourself are essential to recovering from the stresses of daily living.You can do what you want. As fun as it is to spend time with other people, it inevitably leads to compromise. You're constantly modifying your ideas to accommodate other people's desires and opinions. Being alone frees you up to do exactly what you want when you want. You can throw on whatever you feel like wearing, eat what you feel like eating, and work on projects that are meaningful to you.You learn to trust yourself. Freedom is more than doing what you want; it's the ability to trust your gut and to think clearly, without any pressure or outside influence. Being alone helps you form a clear understanding of who you are, what you know, and what's right for you. It teaches you to trust yourself. When around others, even when you don't realize it, you monitor people's reactions in order to gauge the appropriateness of your own feelings and actions. When you're alone, it's all on you. You develop your own ideas and opinions, without having them watered down by what anyone else thinks. Once you learn to enjoy being alone, you'll discover what you're truly capable of, without the constraints of other people's thinking.It increases your emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence (EQ) is your ability to recognize and understand emotions in yourself and others and your ability to use this awareness to manage your behavior and relationships. TalentSmart has tested more than a million people and found that 90% of top performers are high in EQ. Self-awareness is the foundation of emotional intelligence, and you can't increase your EQ without it. Since self-awareness requires understanding your emotions and how you react to various people and situations, this necessitates careful self-reflection, and self-reflection happens best when you're alone.It boosts your self-esteem. Enjoying your own company is a huge confidence booster. If you're bored and restless when you're by yourself, it's easy to start thinking that you're boring or that you need other people around to enjoy yourself. Learning to enjoy time alone boosts your self-esteem by confirming that you are enough.You appreciate other people more. Absence really does make the heart grow fonder. Time alone lets you see people in a whole new light, and it helps you to develop a renewed sense of gratitude for who they are and what they do.You get more done. It's said that ""more hands make light work,"" and while that might be true when it comes to raking leaves, it's a completely different story with cognitive tasks. Even the effectiveness of brainstorming is more myth than reality. Researchers from Texas A&M found that group brainstorming hinders productivity due to ""cognitive fixation."" Cognitive fixation is the tendency for people working in groups to get stuck on other people's ideas, reducing their ability to come up with anything new, and the bigger the group, the more fixated everyone becomes. Spending time alone not only eliminates distractions but also ensures that you don't have trouble with ""too many cooks.""Bringing It All TogetherEveryone benefits from solitude. Take the opportunity this week to spend some time alone.What does spending time alone do for you? Please share your thoughts in the comments section below as I learn just as much from you as you do from me."

Stock Photo. Pixabay.comOne of the tragedies of living in a country that is both a dictatorship and a hotbed of corruption is that many people never get a chance to realize their potential, even with top educations and skills.That's because a relative handful of the elite in such countries skim off much of the wealth, leaving the 95 percent of ordinary citizens fighting for the crumbs.One of the prime examples of this is the former Soviet Union since the fall of the Communist system 2.5 decades ago.And a key measure of the tragedy is the brain drain that's been occurring in most nations in the region since 1991.Most of those hoping that their leaders would embrace democracy so they would have more opportunity have had those hopes dashed.Several countries have become outright dictatorships. Examples are Kazakhstan, where Nursultan Nazarbayev has ruled since the fall of the USSR, and Uzbekistan, where Islam Karimov has been the only ruler.Both men have used their power to swallow chunks of entire industries, making them and their families rich.Other countries in the region have pointed to their leadership turnover to contend they are democracies. These include Ukraine, Russia and Armenia.In reality what is happening is not democracy, but just one autocrat being exchanged for another.Corruption goes hand in hand with autocracy, of course. If you hold unlimited power, you can steal your country blind.In fact, this practice is so common that a word has been coined to describe it -- kleptocracy, or rule by thieves.Ukraine has had a series of kleptocrats, starting with Leonid Kuchma and ending with the now-deposed Viktor Yanukovych.Because Vladimir Putin can tap as much of Russia's wealth as he wants, a number of international economists have labeled him the world's richest man, with a fortune three or four times larger than Bill Gates'.Like Russia and Ukraine, Armenia has had changes of leadership since independence. Each new leader has used his position not to help the public but to increase his personal fortune, however. Armenia remains one of the poorest countries in the region, with most people just scraping by.By syphoning off a lot of a country's wealth, kleptocrats rob the rank and file of opportunities to make their lives better.A much publicized example was the governor of Odessa Province in Ukraine demanding a huge bribe a few years ago before he would allow the Scandinavian furniture company Ikea to open a facility in the region. Ikea, which has a policy of not paying bribes, said no. It also noted that the bribe demand was so large -- tens of millions of dollars -- that if it had paid it, it would have made no profit in Ukraine for years. The big losers in the Ikea story were Odessa-region residents who were denied hundreds of jobs with the company.The kleptocracies in Ukraine, Russia and Armenia have led to millions of people leaving their homelands for opportunities elsewhere.Many have been skilled professionals, including scientists, mathematicians and computer experts -- the kind of brain drain no country can afford.There have been several waves of Russian emigration since 1991, with surges coming during economic crises and in response to increases in political oppression and the leadership vacuuming up more of the country's wealth. About 3 million Russians left in the decade from 2005 to 2015, estimates Lev Gudkov, director of the independent Levada Center polling agency in Moscow. They included many entrepreneurs -- people capable of building businesses and thus creating jobs -- who were fed up with corruption, red tape and crooked courts.One of the surges in Russian emigration came after Putin was re-elected president in 2012.More than 53,000 Russian professionals left for the United States, Germany, Israel and other countries in 2014 -- the highest figure in nine years, Bloomberg reported.""More than 90 percent of those (Russians) who now come to us for help obtaining Israeli citizenship are successful, wealthy people,"" Eli Gervitz, a Tel Aviv lawyer who helps Russian Jews obtain Israeli citizenship, told Bloomberg.Ukraine's brain drain has been steady because its economy has bumped along without the intermittent flashes of economic success Russia has had.The Maidan protests in 2014 that ousted the biggest kleptocrat the country has ever had -- Yanukovych -- have failed to live up to their supporters' hopes for a less corrupt society and more opportunity for the little guy.Proof of that are two recent political developments that show little has changed in Ukraine. One is that Viktor Shokin remains prosecutor general despite public howls about his refusal to bring corruption charges against a number of current and former officials.Another is Poroshenko's apparent decision to name a crony -- Volodymyr Groysman -- as prime minister, instead of a Ukrainian American, Natalia Yaresko, whom many consider the one leader who would mount a charge against corruption.Armenia is the former Soviet country with the worst brain drain as measured by emigrants as a percentage of the population.In 1991, when it became independent, it had 3.5 million people. It now has fewer than 2.5 million, demographers say. The majority of the emigrants have been laborers, construction people and others in trades work. But many are academics, technicians and other professionals who lacked opportunities at home.Armenia's national ombudsman, Larisa Alaverdyan, hinted at corruption's role in the process in noting that the way to stop the brain drain was for politicians to work with civil society on the roots of the problem.How long it will take for democracy, with its better opportunity for the little guy, to take hold in the former Soviet Union, is anybody's guess.But one thing's for sure: As long as autocrats and corruption rule the roost, the region's brain drain will continue.

Yes. It is.   Are you rolling your eyes?  If I read this 5 years ago, I would have felt that this was just another fluff saying for people who didn't live in reality.  Life was and is hard. It's nasty. Sometimes, experiences can haunt you so bad that they make horror films look like Saturday morning cartoon specials.   Now, things are different. Life has thrown me some ugly punches and I've been knocked down too many times to count. But my life continues on, and every day I'm reminded that one day I won't be here.   I am going to die. And I need to start living like it.   This proclamation is in large part due to my mastermind experience. Mastermind? Think of it as a business support group. It's a bunch of carefully selected people who hold each other accountable. It's the audience you know that will applaud you but also tell you where you veered off course. These people help plan your ideal life and give you the tools and support to get your there.   As I continue to grow and evolve with my fellow mastermind members, the one discovery I have found is that we are all our own biggest obstacle when it comes to success. I knew this before, but now, my theory has been solidified. It's our ever-present fear that holds us back. It's the stories we continually tell ourselves about who we are and who we should be that let our dreams fall by the wayside.   Are these stories true? Many of them are not. These tales are fabricated throughout the years, from random childhood incidents to something someone said to you long ago and in a snap, your mind believed it.  This ongoing tape recorder in your head can be so damaging. It is your decision to continue listening to it, and it's also in your power to acknowledge its existence. Take a hammer and smash the beliefs that hold you back.   Who am I to become something great? The question is, who am I not to? Jessica Young launched her own business in March 2015.

3,ARTS,"""Finding New Horizons for Korea in its Past: The Cultural Pioneering of Jin Yong Lee""","Emanuel Pastreich, ContributorDirector, The Asia Institute",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/finding-new-horizons-for_b_9549184.html,"For all the success of the TV series about the palace kitchen Dae Jang Geum and Psy's ""Gangnam Style"" there is an increasing cultural entropy in Korea and commercialization of cultural contents that has undermined the cultural creativity that so many have held high expectations for.",2016-03-26,2016-03-26-1458962832-5664511-seoulaestheticmovementtshirts.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-03-26-1458962832-5664511-seoulaestheticmovementtshirts-thumb.jpg,"The Korean Wave swept Asia a decade ago and put Seoul on the map as a cultural epicenter that no one had imagined was possible. But for all the success of the TV series about the palace kitchen Dae Jang Geum and Psy's ""Gangnam Style"" there is an increasing cultural entropy in Korea and commercialization of cultural contents that has undermined the cultural creativity that so many have held high expectations for. Jin Yong Lee is a young artist in Seoul who has actively set out to imagine a different potential in Korea and has pounded the pavement seeking out people who support his vision. He envisions a cultural metamorphosis that will shake Korea out of this torpid motif of rapid industrialization that dominates its received tradition. He has launched the Seoul Aesthetics Movement which aims to transform how the citizens of Seoul conceive of their city. Jin Yong refers to himself as an ""Imagineer"" (Image + Pioneer), someone who wants to move beyond the limited concept of ""branding"" which dominates Korean thinking about Korea's cultural value. ""Culture is about aesthetics, philosophy and literature, not 'branding' a soft drink. We need to create a transformative civilization, not a new commercial fad,"" Jin Yong explains. Jin Yong grew up in Korea, Taiwan and the United States and went on to study illustration at the Rhode Island School of Design. He came back to Korea with a clear vision for what he wanted to achieve. His concept of a cultural renaissance in Korea dates back to his studies with art historian Pascale Rihouet and digital media critic Richard Gann. He came to see the nature of material culture as the determining factor in true innovation, as opposed to ""innovation as a show."" Jin Yong has taken the first steps towards realizing a cultural Renaissance in Korea that reinterprets traditional culture and combines it with the potential of emerging technologies to create a compelling paradigm shift. Jin Yong argues that Korea can become the center for a new civilization not because of its strengths in the automotive sector, or even its domination in popular music, but rather by affirming its traditional ethical values and aesthetics. He notes that Korea's tradition of ""universal benefit"" (hongik Ingan) and of the ""compassionate intellectual"" (seonbi) is something the world seeks desperately if we want to create a globalism that is not alienating, but rather promotes collaboration and cultural diversity. Jin Yong explains, ""Often Korean philosophy is overlooked by Koreans because it seems old fashioned. Koreans felt compelled to conform to international standards and downplay traditional culture. We Koreans have not lost our identity, but we have lost our confidence in Korean culture's universal value.""  I met Jin Yong Lee two years ago in Seoul and learned of his big plans to revive Korean culture. I immediately invited him to join the Asia Institute and to contribute to our artistic efforts. We launched together a project to promote Seoul's culture and encourage pride among citizens in the history and culture of neighborhoods. In fact, I wrote a book about the cultures of Seoul in which I stress the importance of neighborhood cultures. I previously designed a T-shirt and a mug cup with a logo for the city of Daejeon that drew its inspiration from the city's ecosystem. We decided to create a series of logos for neighborhoods in Seoul that play on cultural and historical themes. We have released so far three T-shirts for the public and we have plans for at least five more T-shirts in the near future. One T-shirt features ""Seoul"" in both Korean and Roman letters in a stylized form. There is also a T-shirt for Itaewon featuring Sam Jok-o, the three legged phoenix accompanied by the triskelion that is a universal symbol for balance and eternity, and a T-shirt for the Cheonggyecheon River which flows through downtown Seoul which uses traditional Korean color patterns.We believe that this new emphasis on the cultural identity of neighborhoods will give a new pride to Koreans and draw attention to cultural complexity in Korea. Korean culture is often presented as a homogeneous whole made up of kimchi and bulgogi. We want to make it clear that towns and neighborhoods have their own spirits. That is so obvious in Europe, but in Korea it is a revolutionary idea."

Flipboard, the company that has revolutionized digital media, has partnered with the Academy of Art University's Fashion Journalism Program, becoming the first official platform for journalism students to present their work in a visually stunning and industry grade way; it's quality content presented in a beautiful magazine style format. The news and magazine application that's operable on a smartphone, tablet, and desktop will provide a visual voice for the students using cutting-edge digital and social media skills, quintessential to an increasingly image-driven culture. Digital magazines have an important place in the world of fashion and social media, says Mia Quagliarello, Head of Curation and Community at Flipboard. ""They are an effortless and beautiful way to package and share classwork and social media activity, publicly or in private groups.""  Mia Quagliarello. Photography by Ashleigh Maule-Ffinch The natural progression of print to digital has allowed for the emergence of a creative online community that reaches increasingly diverse audiences. ""With over 300 million Instagrammers and more than 1.5 billion active Facebook accounts, the market for quality visual content is exponential,"" says Stephan Rabimov, Director of Fashion Journalism. The Academy's Fashion Journalism magazine on Flipboard is a highly curated selection of the work of the academy's BA and MA fashion journalism students.Quagliarello talks with the Academy about the rise of Flipboard's use in education, the key elements to starting your own magazine on the platform, and how they've managed to create such an incredible user growth on a global scale. Hint: It's as easy as 1-2-3! 1. What impact does the print magazine world have on Flipboard's app/desktop presentation philosophy and process?Every impact! Flipboard was 100% inspired by print magazines and the desire to bring print's immersive layouts, breathtaking typography, full-bleed photography, and deep journalistic expertise to mobile devices. We were even inspired by print's advertising--our business model is centered around bringing beautiful print-style advertisements to phones and tablets. You might read VOGUE as much for the ads as the stories, right? Well, it should be the same on digital. Flipboard is that place. Photo: Flipboard hall inspired by print magazines2. How do you start a magazine on Flipboard? What element(s) is/are key?It's as easy as 1-2-3(4-5):1. Pick five or more topics of interest - this is the first step to personalizing your Flipboard 2. Create an account 3. Connect Flipboard to your social networks - this part is optional, but things like tweets, Instagram pictures and Tumblr posts can be creative sources of content for your Flipboard Magazines4.

Now that you've packaged up all these fascinating stories, photos, videos and songs, share your Flipboard Magazine with the world via email, text and social media. 3. What are the main drivers of Flipboard's phenomenal user growth and success around the world?Word of mouth. As Apple's App of the Year in 2010, Flipboard got off to a rocket start and that buzz continues today, but driven more from sharing than just awareness. Now we find people don't just use Flipboard to read and connect with things they are interested in following, but also as a platform to share ideas--which continues the great word of mouth. Our fans, from tech enthusiasts to teachers, are our best evangelists.Be everywhere your users are. Though we started as an iPad app, we have since launched on every major device and platform, including the Web. We've also localized the app for 25 regions, with unique content experiences for places like China, Japan, Russia, UK, Brazil and many more countries. Photo: Flipboard in the early daysA true valuing of great journalism and its creators. From the beginning, we partnered with the world's best publishers--outlets like The New York Times, National Geographic, Vanity Fair, WSJ, The New Yorker and so many others--to beautifully render their stories for mobile and to create a healthy ecosystem where great, definitive journalism is read, shared and supported well into the future. 4. Flipboard's use in Education is on the rise; can you share some of the (un)expected ways Flipboard is utilized in the classroom(s)?Absolutely, we're inspired by educators on Flipboard every day. There are so many ways they use Flipboard. (We cover a lot of them in our Flipboard for Educators blog and magazine).For one, there is the Class Curriculum magazine. These are magazines that contain articles that are the subject of class discussion or that supplement class discussions. Here's an example: Things AP Econ Students Should Know--this teacher's class is over, but he used his magazine to collect real-world examples of theories and concepts they were talking about in his classroom.There's the Collaborative magazine. This is a way students can curate content together and feel empowered to impact the conversations in their classroom. Here's an example out of the University of Central Florida: Cybersecurity. The teacher who started this magazine is also part of a research team that measured the effectiveness of Flipboard Magazines on class engagement. Here's an article about what they found. There's the Student Activity magazine, which packages up content around team sports, school newspapers and literary magazines, clubs, language learning and more. See this example from Palo Alto High. In fact, 'Paly' has all of its student publications organized into Flipboard Magazines. This not only creates a beautiful, sharable package for all of their hard work, but it also gets their stories into Flipboard's ecosystem of 34,000 topics--so anything they write that's applicable to those topics could be surfaced to readers interested in the very thing they're writing about. It's a smart, scalable way to distribute content. 5. You follow Academy's Fashion Journalism magazine; is there an article that particularly stood out for you?I really like getting to know the students and alumni and learning from them: how they got to where they are, how they use social media, what motivates them...It's fun and inspiring to learn about the real people who've emerged from the program.  Photo: Mia demos Flipboard with Ashton Kutcher6. In an era of cross-brand collaborations who would Flipboard be interested in collaborating with?We would love to partner with the companies our readers use and care about and that are natural extensions of where and how people use Flipboard. For example, Starbucks: ""Flipboard and coffee"" is a meme we hear a lot about on social media and partnering with a company like Starbucks would make a ton of sense.Working with Eventbrite, Yelp and AirBnB would be amazing. Not only are they companies our readers really use and love, but they create content and listings that would fit well with our many local topics.And of course we hope to partner with more organizations leading the conversation around education, like EdSurge. This will be a big part of our work in the year ahead.7. Outside Flipboard, where can one run into you? How do you spend limited free time?Probably in one of San Francisco's live music venues: last year, I saw 51 concerts. Not bad for a full-time working mom of 2! I'm obsessed with electronic music, and I probably use SoundCloud as much as I use Flipboard. 8. What was the best advice you got while launching your career?I had a first boss with a high bar from whom I learned so much. She taught me that the details matter--in your copy and in your attitude. She taught me you should be doing the next job up before expecting that you actually get that job. She showed me the joys of ""work hard, play hard"" and of a good sample sale. :)9. Do you have a daily mantra?""Go with the flow."" And ""Always be learning.""10. What is the most important question on your mind at this stage of your career?Good question! Well, I'm super passionate about media, pop culture, and technology, and I always want to be at the intersection of these industries. My job at Flipboard is squarely in this sweet spot: my world here involves knowing/curating the very best in journalism, social media content, music and so much more. It doesn't get much better than that! Also, for my whole career, I've been the ""voice"" of various companies--MTV Networks, YouTube and now Flipboard. Now I'm working on developing my own voice at places like Medium, on the Burning Man blog and my new blog Disco Nap.The most important questions on my mind right now are: how to 'do it all' and where is media going next so I can be right there with it.As we progress into the digital era of fashion, Flipboard has become an indispensable tool for journalists to read, support, and share their work.

Holy Saturday. The morning of the biggest evening in Christianity. I'm sitting over coffee considering how the world, how the people of this country, even the people of the town I sit in, are preparing for this great event. And my answer seems to be... well, quietly. Lent stormed into College Park (where I am a college chaplain) like an 18-wheeler full of beer on it's way to a frat house. Everyone showed up and they wanted to show their colors by wearing the ashes distributed so many Wednesdays ago. ""Yeah, I'm Catholic,"" their presence stated. ""Let me have some of them ashes!"" You see, people, no matter how 'individualistic,' want to belong, to be a part of something bigger than themselves - even those who pride themselves on being most individualistic - college kids. They displayed their ashes and many even went to confession that day, desiring to start over once again in their relationship with God (it is the Year of Mercy, after all!). And then something strange set in. Lent. So many days and nights of preparing for something bigger, greater, more important than ourselves. Christians spend Lent trying to 'get over themselves' (at least ideally that's what we do) - emptying ourselves of ourselves. It's a time of re-ordering ourselves and our lives, by means of giving up our false gods and allowing the one true God His rightful place - the top rung of our lives. And yet this is not easy to do at all. I struggle with this so very much. My friends and family struggle with this as do the students and others at University of Maryland I serve. Why do we struggle? Some say Christians should have it all figured out and if we don't, well then it's all a sham. Well, rest assured - we don't have 'it' figured out. We sin just like everyone else, we fall just like everyone else. And that's the problem for so much of the world - it's difficult to come to terms with what may seem like failure in the face of religion. Our world worships success, and this does not sound like success. But for the Christian who understands who they are and, much more importantly, who Christ is - we aren't worried about success. We are striving not for that temporal virtue, but rather for the true gift from God - the gift of faith. Which takes me back to the start. My coffee now cold, I still consider how our world prepares. Easter is not Christmas. Besides a few people complaining about the shape of their Reese's Easter eggs (I'll take em if you don't like em!), there's not much secular noise about Easter. I suppose that's because there's not much the secular world can celebrate with Easter. It's a call for us to see ourselves humbly - literally on the ground level. To see ourselves as not successful in this religion we call Christianity (and don't fool yourselves - we are NOT successful by any means) - but rather striving to rely clearly, passionately - and yet imperfectly - on no one but Jesus Himself. That's the reality of Easter. Not as slick as Christmas, but still more important. Because without it, Jesus is just another guy, and we are still without hope. But with it, with the Passion, Death and Resurrection of God made man - we're offered a share in his divine life. And that's a whole lot better than peanut butter eggs and Peeps."

These barbaric killers who commit these horrendous atrocities in the name of religion have no respect for human life. This time the target was Brussels, the heart of the European Union, frequented by people of many national origins. Although ISIS killers have murdered thousands of Yazidis, Arab Christians and Muslims who reject their murderous ways, the suicide bombings in Brussels were an attack on the world. What happened on Tuesday March 22nd was a coordinated multiple attack taking the lives of 31 people and injuring scores more.As expected, the condemnation, shock and horror expressed swiftly came from around the globe from ordinary people and leaders from all walks of life and religious affiliation. But, also as expected, there were outlandish statements by demagogic politicians to score short term political gains. The US presidential hopeful, Donald Trump, gleefully said I told you so and renewed his earlier call to ban Muslims from entering the US. I am not sure how he knew that Brussels would be attacked and why he did not share that information with law enforcement!Terrorist Organization Features Trump in Recruiting Video (photo: Inquister.com) Not to be outdone, another presidential aspirant, Ted Cruz, called for police to patrol Muslim neighborhoods in the US. This is not only outrageous, but it shows Mr. Cruz's total lack of understanding of American Muslims. Unlike France in particular and Belgium where the majority of Muslims live in separate areas outside the cities, American Muslims are well integrated and live mixed in with everyone else. There may be some cities like Dearborn, Michigan where the concentration of Muslims is higher.Ted Cruz: Empower Law Enforcement to Patrol Muslim Neighborhoods. We have seen and will continue to see terroristic acts by the sympathizers of ISIS like the San Bernardino attack which claimed the lives of 14 people and injured 22 others. The so called threat from Islamic extremists is mostly by individuals and is not community based. However, the despicable rhetoric by the demagogues like Trump and Cruz could conceivably create more ISIS type sympathizers. This is exactly what terrorist groups like ISIS want. They use these general inflammatory statements coming from our leaders as recruiting tools, telling the vulnerable that the West is against you, and that you must strike back if you want to be somebody.Despite the attacks of 9/11, Boston and San Bernardino, US Muslims are loyal, educated and productive members of society. The US has always been a country which has offered people hope and this powerful idea is behind the success of many immigrant groups, including Muslims. By the way, Islam is a religion spanning the world. Its adherents come in all colors, from different ethnic backgrounds, speak different languages, and so on. It is impossible to identify an individual or a group by one attribute. Islam like Christianity, Judaism, and other world religions, only provides one attribute which is insufficient for the definition of a human being.Immigration of North African Muslims to France and Belgium was a result of colonialism. Germany on the other hand initially brought in Turks as guest workers to rebuild the country in the aftermath of World War 2. Muslims like other groups came to the US because they believed in the ideals of this country and not because of some past baggage or specific need. That is why theirs is a success story unlike what is going on in France and Belgium. While no act of terrorism is justifiable, people who live in the margins of society plagued by crime, with no hope of getting out, are the ideal target by ISIS.The majority of these first generation immigrants who settled in France, Belgium and Germany were mostly illiterate peasants. They were therefore content to do the back breaking jobs of cleaning up the streets, picking up garbage, working as laborers in construction, and so on. But the situation is very different for the second and third generations. These young people, in the age of social media, are stuck in a life of hopelessness in the banlieues (suburbs) such as Sevran north of Paris and ghettos like Molenbeek in Brussels. Of course not all will succumb to the false advertisement of ISIS, but only a handful is sufficient to cause such carnage as just happened in Brussels.Banlieue of Sevran (Photo: www.lejdd.fr)Today ISIS is under pressure and on the defensive.  It is losing territory in both Iraq and Syria. Some ISIS leaders have been killed or captured. But the threat is still there to carry out more attacks anywhere they can, including in Europe and the US. This is a long term problem requiring long term solutions. Knee jerk reactions, playing on frightened peoples' emotions and demagoguery will not solve the problem, it will only alienate those people who should be part of the solution."

While no act of terrorism is justifiable, people who live in the margins of society plagued by crime, with no hope of getting out, are the ideal target by ISIS.The majority of these first generation immigrants who settled in France, Belgium and Germany were mostly illiterate peasants. They were therefore content to do the back breaking jobs of cleaning up the streets, picking up garbage, working as laborers in construction, and so on. But the situation is very different for the second and third generations. These young people, in the age of social media, are stuck in a life of hopelessness in the banlieues (suburbs) such as Sevran north of Paris and ghettos like Molenbeek in Brussels. Of course not all will succumb to the false advertisement of ISIS, but only a handful is sufficient to cause such carnage as just happened in Brussels.Banlieue of Sevran (Photo: www.lejdd.fr)Today ISIS is under pressure and on the defensive.  It is losing territory in both Iraq and Syria. Some ISIS leaders have been killed or captured. But the threat is still there to carry out more attacks anywhere they can, including in Europe and the US. This is a long term problem requiring long term solutions. Knee jerk reactions, playing on frightened peoples' emotions and demagoguery will not solve the problem, it will only alienate those people who should be part of the solution."

Graeme Phillip Harris admitted to a similar charge last year and was sentenced to six months in prison.Officials said Edenfield, then 19, along with Harris and one other person, hung a noose and a depiction of the Confederate battle flag on a statue of James Meredith, who integrated the school in 1962 amid violent protests and riots.Edenfield tied the rope around the statue's neck, after Harris was unable to do so, officials said.An attorney for Edenfield did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Edenfield withdrew from the school after the incident and returned home to Atlanta, the government said.Edenfield faces up to a year in prison, but the government is recommending probation because of his assistance in the case involving Harris, said Chad Lamar, assistant U.S. attorney in the Northern District of Mississippi.Harris is serving his sentence in a low-security prison in Butner, North Carolina and is due to be released in July, according to federal prison records.(Reporting by Letitia Stein; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)"

Users can click on streets in each city to see what kinds of sounds dominate in that area. Using what researchers call an ""urban sound dictionary,"" the maps trawl geo-located Flickr photos for tags associated with particular noises. Those sound-related tags are broken into five categories -- transport, nature, human, music and mechanical -- and create visual sound profiles. The maps also link those sounds to particular emotions, giving users a sense of what it might feel like to walk down a particular street. Though users can only see complete sound profiles for specific streets, the color-coded maps (red for traffic sounds, green for nature, orange for music, blue for people, gray for mechanical) helps give a general idea of what you might hear if you were to walk from street to street in a particular neighborhood. For instance, New York's Upper West Side, a wealthy residential area near Central Park, appears to be full of nature sounds: (Click here to play with interactive versions of the maps.)Researchers also used geo-located photo tags to attach sounds to specific emotions. They found, for instance, that streets defined by musical sounds were linked to feelings of joy or sadness, whereas traffic sounds were tied to fear and anger. The latter isn't surprising. Research on urban sound has found that noise pollution is correlated with everything from sleep impairment to cardiovascular disease.This section of New York's Park Avenue, a busy thoroughfare, is dominated by transport sounds associated with surprise, sadness and fear:But other urban sounds, from church bells to street vendors, can also calm, exhilarate or inspire.The sounds of St. Mark's Place, a street near The Huffington Post's New York City offices, come mostly from humans. The street also contains music, nature and transport sounds, giving it a joyful feel, according to Chatty Maps."
22,IMPACT,Monks And At-Risk Teens Run School Together With 98% Graduation Rate,Sarah Ruiz-Grossman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/school-succeeding-young-men-of-color_us_56f44274e4b014d3fe229cd9,"The school's motto: ‘Whatever hurts my brother, hurts me.’",2016-03-25,"Students (left to right) Bruce Davis, Andrew Brice, Khalil Flemming and Devionne Johnson.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56f44a06150000ad000b3235.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"At a time when many U.S. schools are failing students of color, one school stands out as an unusual success.St. Benedict’s Prep, an all-boys preparatory school in Newark, has a graduation rate of 98 percent, compared to a national rate of 82 percent.But when you realize that the majority of St. Benedict’s students are low-income male students of color, the numbers become groundbreaking. Nationwide around one in four black, Latino and low-income students does not graduate high school, according to the Department of Education.So how did a school in Newark, run by Benedictine monks, manage to break the mold and graduate almost 100 percent of its low-income students of color? “The counseling center is critical,” said Father Edwin Leahy, a monk and the school’s headmaster, to the Huffington Post on Tuesday. “I don’t know how people do this work without attending to the kids spirits, psyche and heart. It’s very rare that cognition is the reason for poor academic performance in our experience -- frequently it’s emotional distress.”In a school where 88 percent of the students are on financial aid, many of them are coming from poor households and neighborhoods, which can make it hard to succeed academically. Experts call it toxic stress: research shows that growing up in poverty often entails excessive exposure to stress and adversity, which can have long-term negative effects on children’s social, emotional and cognitive development, according to the Annie E. Casey Foundation. St. Benedict’s tackles this issue with deep psycho-social support for its students. “Counselors in most schools are just making sure kids have the right classes,” Father Edwin said. “We have a counseling center with two psychologists, and interns who are PhD or Master’s candidates in school counseling, and four to five different group sessions a week.”The group sessions are catered to students in specific adverse situations, Fr. Edwin said. The ""Blues Boys"" is for students who suffer from depression; ""Unknown Sons"" is for those who don’t have a relationship with their father; ""Anger Management"" is for those dealing with emotional control issues. “It works, I can tell you that,” Fr. Edwin said. “It’s about not giving up on yourself. You may fall on your back several times, but you can figure out a way.” The other secret to their success is to let students lead -- literally. The student body is divided into groups of about 25 kids each, in 7th to 12th grade, said Fr. Edwin. Each group has a student leader, and together with the other group leaders, they run the school. They know the grades of all of the kids in their section, and are involved in many of their discipline issues. They set the school schedules and coordinate events -- and they even interview the juniors in the Spring to recommend replacements to the monks for when they graduate. “When you give teenage boys responsibilities, sometimes it goes wrong, but you debrief them,” Fr. Edwin says. “It’s risky, and most people are afraid to take that risk, and allow kids [that responsibility]. A lot of guys of color feel like nobody pays attention, nobody listens -- so we create situations where they make the arguments, they change the schedule -- that’s important.”“Benedict's men are different than the guys you see outside,” said Bruce Davis, this year’s senior leader, to CBS’ 60 Minutes. “We learn what we're willing to accept, which is nothing but the best, finishing what we started. The boys press each other to study. The school motto [is] ‘Whatever hurts my brother, hurts me.’""The big question is, can the model be replicated? Fr. Edwin has gotten calls from all over the country asking that very question. The reality is, he doesn’t know.“This place is like a diner,” he said. “It’s open 24 hours a day, seven days a week -- because the monks all live here. It’s the same model as the boarding schools in New England: faculty sleeps on the grounds. That creates community. The person responsible for running the place needs to live there -- they have to feel it.” Financially it would be very difficult for other schools, particularly public schools, to replicate that full-time presence. St. Benedict’s recipe of deep psychological support, a trust in young men’s leadership, and monks on-call 24/7 is unique. “When you create community, there’s not a big hierarchy,” said Fr. Edwin. “Some call it chaos. But God made something out of chaos, so if it is chaos, well I believe great things can come of it.”H/T CBS 60 Minutes."
23,POLITICS,Why Raising The Social Security Retirement Age Could Hit Latinos Hardest,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/social-security-retirement-age-latinos_us_56f4982be4b0143a9b47dccc,Older Latino workers are far more likely to have physically stressful jobs than their peers.,2016-03-25,"Construction workers chat during their break at a building site in New York on March 24, 2016. Latinos are over-represented in physically demanding fields like construction.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56f49a471e0000b30070549c.jpeg?cache=8NlZ6AOrDW&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"More than four in 10 workers aged 58 or older have physically stressful jobs, according to a new report.A new study showing that more than four in 10 older workers are employed in physically stressful occupations or work environments gives fresh ammunition to critics of raising the Social Security retirement age.The report, “Still Working Hard: An Update On The Share Of Older Workers In Demanding Jobs,” released by the progressive think tank Center for Economic and Policy Research on Thursday, also found that workers in those jobs are disproportionately Latino, lacking a college degree and earning a low income.The findings support many progressives’ claims that raising the Social Security retirement age would discriminate based on race and class by forcing many older workers to continue jobs that are taking a toll on their health.""These data indicate that many workers would face serious hardship by working later into their life"" if policymakers raise the Social Security retirement age, wrote the report's authors, Cherrie Bucknor and Dean Baker.In total, 43.8 percent of workers aged 58 or older -- 10.2 million people -- worked in either physically demanding jobs or difficult working conditions in 2014, according to the report.Older Latinos are by far the most likely to work in these demanding jobs, but African-Americans and Asians also are more likely than whites to be employed in those stressful occupations. In 2014, 60.7 percent Latinos aged 58 or older worked in jobs that fit into one of the report’s two categories, compared with 49 percent of their black peers, 48.9 percent of their Asian peers, and 41 percent of older whites.The study defines “older” workers as those aged 58 or older, because that age neither overstates, nor understates the number of aging workers in physically demanding jobs or difficult conditions, according to Baker, who is also a co-director of the think tank.The study uses census data and other official figures to determine if older workers are employed in at least one of two categories of “demanding jobs”: “physically demanding” jobs or “difficult working conditions,” categories originally developed by Urban Institute labor experts for a 2007 study.“Physically demanding” jobs include everything from retail clerks and janitors who must stand and do repetitive motions for prolonged periods, to carpenters and construction workers engaged in heavy lifting. “Difficult working conditions” mean jobs that entail working in uncomfortable spaces, or being exposed to dangerous machinery, unusual temperatures, chemicals or disruptive noises.The share of older workers in demanding jobs closely corresponds to education and income levels. The lower an older worker’s education or earnings, the more likely that worker is to have a demanding job.In 2014, 81.4 percent of older workers without a high school degree and 61 percent of workers with only a high school degree worked in demanding jobs, according to the analysis. That compares with 43.1 percent of older workers with some college education, and 29.4 percent of workers with a college degree, who were employed in one of those occupations.Likewise, 63.5 percent of workers in the bottom one-fifth of the earnings spectrum worked in difficult jobs in 2014, compared with 22.1 percent of workers in the top one-fifth.The report’s authors made clear that their analysis aims to give policymakers pause before raising Social Security’s retirement age. Americans retiring now can claim full benefits at age 66; the retirement age will be 67 for people born in 1960 or later.Delaying retirement benefits would have effects that vary across the working population.""People who are shorter-lived tend to make less, which means that if you raise the retirement age, low-income populations would be subsidizing the lives of higher-income people,” Maya Rockeymoore, president and chief executive of Global Policy Solutions, a public policy consultancy, told The Washington Post in 2013. Among the Republican presidential candidates, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has proposed raising the age further for “younger workers.” Ohio Gov. John Kasich has said it's something he would “look at.” Donald Trump, the front-runner in the GOP field, has said he “would do everything in [his] power” not to change benefits, including raising the age.On the Democratic side, both Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have vowed not to cut Social Security benefits, promising to expand them instead.But President Barack Obama surprised many Democrats when his bipartisan fiscal commission in 2010 recommended a wide-reaching package of Social Security cuts, including raising the full retirement age to 69 and the early retirement age to 64. Obama later proposed enacting the chained consumer price index, one of the commission’s more modest benefit reductions, during failed negotiations for a “grand bargain” budget deal with Republicans. Raising the retirement age is “one of these proposals that I would like to think is dead, but there is a lot of openness to it among policy types, including some fairly center, even left-of-center people,” Baker said. “You get into these rooms where everybody just says, ‘Everybody knows we need to work longer,’ and they all have desk jobs and you just want to shake them.”Baker said he worried that a future President Hillary Clinton, her current assurances notwithstanding, could be tempted to adopt the policy, should she receive Republican cooperation on a major budget deal that eluded Obama.In addition to burdening older workers in demanding jobs, a higher retirement age penalizes poorer workers who have seen a much smaller share of the gains in life expectancy in recent years -- if their longevity has not declined.And critics note that any increase in the so-called full retirement age amounts to an across-the-board benefit reduction of nearly 7 percent per year. That’s because there is already a sliding scale of retirement ages from 62 to 70, in which workers receive roughly 7 percent smaller benefits for every year beneath the “full” age they claim benefits, and 8 percent more for every year above it.Baker rejected the notion that tailoring a retirement age increase to specific occupations -- an idea put forward by former Clinton White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles and former Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.), the co-chairs of Obama’s fiscal commission -- would resolve the concerns raised by the report about vulnerable older workers.Baker argued that the proposal would create a bureaucratic and political nightmare as every profession jockeyed to be covered by a hardship exemption. The challenges inherent in such an endeavor, he said, are exemplified by the patchwork system in Greece that made the country a laughingstock before recent reforms.“You are opening up a hole that you do not want to deal with by having occupational carve-outs,” Baker said."

She did, however, take time to call out businessman Donald Trump, the frontrunner in the Republican presidential primary race.‘‘Donald Trump claims that the reason he’s qualified to be president of the United States is that he is a very, very, very successful businessman.’’ Warren said. ‘‘Donald Trump is not a great business success and it’s time he’s called on it.’’‘‘He’s the one who quotes Mussolini,’’ Warren added. ‘‘That is really scary and the American people should pay very close attention.’’Warren also criticized Trump earlier this week, calling the real estate mogul a ""loser"" in a Twitter rant on Monday. She previously urged “decent people everywhere“ to stand up to Trump, arguing the businessman is a “bigger, uglier threat every day that goes by.”According to HuffPost Pollster, Trump still has a big lead over his remaining GOP challengers, Ohio Gov.

PREVIOUSLY: Robert De Niro has issued a statement for those who don't think the controversial anti-vaccination documentary ""Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe"" should be shown at the upcoming Tribeca Film Festival. De Niro, a co-founder of the festival, released a statement Friday on the film festival's Facebook page in which he explains why he wants ""Vaxxed"" to be shown. Grace and I have a child with autism and we believe it is critical that all of the issues surrounding the causes of autism be openly discussed and examined. In the 15 years since the Tribeca Film Festival was founded, I have never asked for a film to be screened or gotten involved in the programming. However this is very personal to me and my family and I want there to be a discussion, which is why we will be screening ""Vaxxed."" I am not personally endorsing the film, nor am I anti-vaccination; I am only providing the opportunity for a conversation around the issue.The doc, directed by disgraced anti-vax doctor Andrew Wakefield, has received a lot of pushback for its factually incorrect message that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention organized a conspiracy to cover up rising autism diagnosis rates allegedly caused by childhood vaccinations.There are currently no credible studies that corroborate these claims. In fact, the idea that vaccines can cause autism has been soundly discredited, time and again, by large, well-designed studies that show no link between vaccines and autism.To read more about the inaccuracies surrounding this film, check out HuffPost's explainer here."

The two golf-cart-sized crafts, stocked with scientific instruments, appeared ready for planetary exploration, but in a few hours, they would be winched down to the seafloor off the coast of Svalbard, about 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) from the North Pole. If all went well, the landers would stay there for a year, powered by half a tonne of lithium batteries, monitoring the methane bubbles seeping from the seabed.As a greenhouse gas, methane is 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide (CO2). Scientists have found that oceans absorb much of the methane bubbling up from seafloor seeps, but they don’t quite know how much. And their real worry is the 10,000 gigatonnes of methane trapped worldwide as a solid beneath the seafloor in the form of methane hydrate. With ocean temperatures on the rise, methane hydrates pose a threat far greater than the seeps. Although hydrates also exist on land beneath permafrost, 99 percent of known reserves are buried beneath the seafloor. Some of Norway’s largest reservoirs lie right along the continental shelf, where a slight rise in temperature could thaw the methane hydrates — and unleash vast quantities of the gas, slowly over time — or possibly quite quickly.“Methane hydrates serve as a kind of cement of the sediments. Our fear is that if the cement gets dissolved, sediment might slide down the [continental shelf] slope,” Peter Linke told me in the instrument room of the Hanssen. Linke, a marine biologist from the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel, Germany, works closely with researchers from Norway’s Centre for Arctic Gas Hydrate, Environment and Climate (CAGE), and was aboard the research cruise to supervise the deployment of the two landers, worth a half million dollars each. “If a large volume of sediment is moving, this might cause a tsunami, which has happened before.” Some 8,000 years ago, an earthquake along Norway’s southern coast triggered a catastrophic expansion of methane hydrates, unleashing a tsunami that washed over a landmass the size of Iceland.Where climatologists see great peril, energy companies see great promise. Methane hydrate can expand 160 times its volume when it is transformed to methane, a gas. Japanese scientists have succeeded in extracting methane from seafloor hydrates, but like oil extraction, this could be a risky business. Disturbing hydrates in the seafloor could destabilize them and initiate a vicious cycle: More methane in the atmosphere creates warmer oceans, which, in turn, further destabilize hydrates.Safely ContainedIn a methane hydrate, the gas molecule is actually trapped in a “cage” of water molecules. Hydrates look and feel like ice, but are not a frozen gas. They are actually more akin to minerals because they have a geometric architecture rather than a random structure like true ice. Another distinction: Unlike frozen water, a lump of methane hydrate can be set on fire.The deep sea’s low temperatures and high pressure keep hydrates safely locked away, but along Svalbard’s continental shelf, they occur in relatively shallow waters near the top of the seabed. Even a small change in water temperature near the seafloor there could initiate a meltdown. No one is sure how much methane the oceans can absorb before releasing excess gas into the atmosphere. It’s an important question the scientists on board the Hanssen hope to answer by studying the dynamics of methane in the water column.Surprisingly, some scientists say that, in certain cases, methane seeps might even be associated with removing other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. John Pohlman, a biogeochemist at the U.S. Geological Survey at Woods Hole, calls it the Seep Fertilization Hypothesis. “On this same survey last year, I noticed that where methane content was highest at the surface, there was also a depletion of carbon dioxide in the water,” he said. “The release of methane bubbles from the seafloor seems to stimulate uptake of CO2 from the water, which leads to uptake of CO2 from the overlying atmosphere.”Pohlman and his colleagues, including biochemist Helge Niemann of the University of Basel in Switzerland, are running experiments to measure the dynamics of methane and carbon dioxide along our survey route to better understand the fate of these greenhouse gases, and what might happen if methane hydrates buried in the sea floor become destabilized.According to Pohlman’s hypothesis, as methane bubbles upward, it pumps nutrient-rich deep water to the surface that encourages the algae there to grow. The algae consume carbon dioxide (as plants do), removing carbon dioxide from the ocean, which then absorbs more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.But not all of the methane makes it to the surface. Bacteria on the seafloor, called methanotrophs, consume some of the gas – and Niemann wants to know how much. “Think of it like a dinner table and our guests are methanotrophs,” Niemann explained. “We want to know how hungry they are, how many they are, and who they are.”To measure how much methane the bacteria can eat, Niemann and his assistant added radioactive methane to vials of methanotrophs throughout the week. When active, methanotrophs produce carbon dioxide and water. The amount of radioactive water produced in such samples reveals how much the bacteria eat.To tally his “guests,” Niemann added a fluorescing solution that lights up the bacteria’s DNA and allows him to count them under a fluorescence microscope. Later, he reconstructed his “guest list” by cloning tiny bits of DNA to identify individual species.TouchdownOnce we were in position off the coast of Spitsbergen island, Linke and several German engineers lowered the landers to the seafloor. Each machine held three separate sensors for measuring methane, carbon dioxide and pH (acidity), plus sonars to monitor gas bubbles, a meter to detect algal blooms and an instrument to track ocean currents.Each deployment seemed like a moon landing. As we watched live video from the ship’s command center, a screen of blue nothingness suddenly came to life with images of a rocky seafloor punctuated by the escape of methane bubbles.The challenge for Linke and his engineers was to position each lander among the methane seeps rather than on top of them so it could make the best observations. With a click of the computer keyboard, the explosives detonated, separating each launcher from its payload and allowing it to settle onto the seafloor.Over the next four days, scientists pulled deep water samples at 65 separate points, working continuously in rotating shifts, catching sleep when they could. By the end of the week, exhausted and bleary eyed, Pohlman had found several clear instances where the carbon dioxide levels noticeably dropped above methane seeps.Whether such seeps prove to be greenhouse gas sponges or not, the bigger concern remains their cousins, methane hydrates. Just a few miles further offshore, in deeper waters, CAGE has also been investigating methane hydrates along the continental shelf edge and found that they lie so close to the seabed surface under relatively marginal pressure, that the slightest rise in ocean temperature could destabilize them.Scientists have already seen this happen off Washington and Oregon. Last October, scientists at the University of Washington published a study showing that methane bubble plumes off the coast were emanating from depths where only methane hydrates occur. They speculated that anomalous warm currents from Siberia, which they had previously identified in the same location, might be melting the hydrates.As the oceans warm, researchers are racing to make informed predictions – and provide possible solutions. Linke and his colleagues at GEOMAR have a proposal. They have developed a way to replace the methane in the hydrate with carbon dioxide. They call it SUGAR, since the cage-like structure of that sweet molecule resembles the gas hydrate molecule. GEOMAR has successfully tested the method in their labs and is now running trials in the Black Sea. If successful, the swap would allow energy companies to harvest methane and bury carbon dioxide beneath the seafloor. The process also forms a compound that is more stable and heat tolerant than its original – the methane hydrate. If SUGAR bears fruit, hydrates could sweeten the energy pot for nations worldwide rather than wreak havoc on the atmosphere.As Arctic coal and oil lose their glow and petroleum giants like Royal Dutch Shell walk away from billions of dollars of investment in Arctic oil exploration, natural gas grows ever more attractive. It is widely seen as a cleaner fossil fuel used increasingly in power plants, home heating and vehicles. If extraction of methane hydrates on an industrial scale becomes viable, many nations will have access to substantial reserves along their coasts.

They speculated that anomalous warm currents from Siberia, which they had previously identified in the same location, might be melting the hydrates.As the oceans warm, researchers are racing to make informed predictions – and provide possible solutions. Linke and his colleagues at GEOMAR have a proposal. They have developed a way to replace the methane in the hydrate with carbon dioxide. They call it SUGAR, since the cage-like structure of that sweet molecule resembles the gas hydrate molecule. GEOMAR has successfully tested the method in their labs and is now running trials in the Black Sea. If successful, the swap would allow energy companies to harvest methane and bury carbon dioxide beneath the seafloor. The process also forms a compound that is more stable and heat tolerant than its original – the methane hydrate. If SUGAR bears fruit, hydrates could sweeten the energy pot for nations worldwide rather than wreak havoc on the atmosphere.As Arctic coal and oil lose their glow and petroleum giants like Royal Dutch Shell walk away from billions of dollars of investment in Arctic oil exploration, natural gas grows ever more attractive. It is widely seen as a cleaner fossil fuel used increasingly in power plants, home heating and vehicles. If extraction of methane hydrates on an industrial scale becomes viable, many nations will have access to substantial reserves along their coasts. With the Arctic warming twice as fast as the global average, Norwegian research on methane hydrates is very much on the front burner.Randall Hyman was a 2015 Alicia Patterson Foundation Fellow.This article originally appeared on Arctic Deeply.

Hussein, who was 18 years old when he was taken into custody on Jan. 25, 2014, after attending a demonstration against both military rule and the Muslim Brotherhood, has since spent over two years in detention without being formally charged. While Egyptian activists and government critics welcome his release, Hussein’s freedom has been met with muted jubilation. He should never have been jailed in the first place, they say. “To understand how bad things are in #Egypt: we’re celebrating news that a kid has been released from jail after [two years] for wearing a t-shirt,” one Egyptian blogger said on Twitter. Police stopped Hussein at a Cairo checkpoint on the three-year anniversary of Egypt's revolution that overthrew longtime dictator Hosni Mubarak. Wearing a t-shirt that said “a nation without torture” and a revolutionary scarf, police accused Hussein of participating in unlawful protests (any demonstration not pre-approved by authorities) and having connections to the banned Muslim Brotherhood.Those accusations alone were enough to land Hussein in detention for two years and two months. A Cairo court upheld his release on March 24, letting him go free at 1 a.m. the next morning. A small, overjoyed group of friends, family and activists were there to escort him out of the police station, snapping photographs and celebrating his newfound freedom on social media.“It's sad that our cause for celebration isn't actual positive achievements, but only the reversal of gross miscarriages of justice,” said Timothy Kaldas, a nonresident fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy. “There are so many more like him awaiting the end of their oppression. We can't rest until they're all free and the state's use of political imprisonments end.”Under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, thousands of political prisoners -- Islamists, secular activists, academics and journalists alike -- have been locked up. Many, like Hussein, are never formally charged.Security forces have also “forcibly disappeared” hundreds of people in recent months, holding them in secret detention centers where they are often tortured at will, according to survivors and human rights groups.The Cairo-based Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms has documented 340 cases of forced disappearances from August to November of last year alone. Eleven of them have reportedly been children.Egypt has recently come under fire for the grisly murder of 28-year-old Italian student Giulio Regeni who went missing on Jan. 25, the revolution’s five-year anniversary, after conducting controversial research on Egyptian labor unions. His body was found days later on the side of the road outside Cairo, bearing marks of torture commonly inflicted upon political prisoners by security forces.Egyptian authorities have repeatedly denied any responsibility for the student’s death. On Thursday, authorities said four gang members impersonating Egyptian police who were involved in Regeni’s death had been shot dead.The European Parliament passed a March 10 resolution condemning the country for what lawmakers describe as a “large-scale campaign of arbitrary detention of critics” in Egypt, a strategic U.S. ally. Hussein is lucky in that he survived detention and can get on with his life unlike the countless Egyptians who have simply never been heard from again following detention.Amnesty International demanded on Friday that all “absurd charges” against him be dropped. The rights group also called on authorities to release all political prisoners.Hussein’s brother Tarek Mohammed Ahmed, lovingly known as “Tito,” has been a staunch advocate ever since his younger brother was detained over two years ago.“Our parents are heartbroken that instead of building your future, taking exams and finishing your education, your life is on hold in a dark cell,” he wrote in a letter to Hussein on June 8.On Friday, roughly nine months after writing that letter, Ahmed tweeted a photograph: Two smiling brothers -- him and Hussein -- reunited at last."

In order to address cleft lip/palate disabilities, CURE International has launched CURE Smiles, in partnership with Smile Train, a non-profit organization that raises money primarily in the U.S. to fund the specialized surgeries in many third world countries. Nine hundred cleft lip and palate surgeries over the next year will be performed by CURE Smiles in Afghanistan while training local surgeons in conjunction. The treatment is free while Afghans are only charged a small registration fee.

Islamic State militants seized Palmyra in May 2015.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56f547571e00008e01711526.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syrian soldiers recaptured the old citadel of Palmyra overlooking the city's ancient ruins on Friday, state media and a monitoring group said, in an offensive which could open up much of eastern Syria to government forces.The recapture of Palmyra, which the Islamist militants seized in May 2015, would mark the biggest single gain for President Bashar al-Assad since Russia intervened in September and turned the tide of the five-year conflict in his favor.Palmyra is the site of some of the most extensive ruins of the ancient Roman empire, and temples and tombs were dynamited by Islamic State fighters in what the United Nations has described as a war crime.The city controls routes east into the heartland of territory held by the militants, who have proclaimed a ""caliphate"" to rule over all Muslims from swathes of Syria and Iraq.The scale of Friday's fighting reflected how much of a strategic prize the city represents, with jets launching dozens of air strikes and soldiers firing mortar barrages, while Islamic State fighters hit back with two car bombings.Russian warplanes have continued to support the Syrian army and its allies as they push their offensive on the desert city, despite Moscow's recent announcement that it was withdrawing the bulk of its military forces.Beirut-based television channel Al-Mayadeen, broadcasting from the edge of Palmyra, showed a low-flying jet carry out three air strikes against what it said were Islamic State fighters withdrawing from the old citadel back into Palmyra.State television and Al-Manar, the television station of Lebanon's Hezbollah group, later quoted military sources saying government forces had seized the citadel, located above the ancient ruins.The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights confirmed the citadel had been captured. It said there were 56 air strikes between dawn and early afternoon on Friday.A ceasefire backed by the United States and Russia covers most of Syria but not areas held byIslamic State. The first truce of its kind since war began five years ago has been accompanied this month by the first peace talks attended by Assad's government and most of the groups opposed to him. Meanwhile, Damascus has turned its fire on Islamic State.Moscow is the main ally of Assad's government, while Washington and other Western countries have backed foes trying to overthrow him during five years of civil war that has killed 250,000 people and led to the world's worst refugee crisis. Both powers are committed to fighting againstIslamic State and have backed a new diplomatic push to end fighting on other fronts.A Russian special forces officer was killed in combat near Palmyra in the last week, Interfax said, suggesting the Kremlin has been more deeply engaged in the Syrian conflict than it has acknowledged.Islamic State suicide bombers detonated two car bombs as they tried to repulse government forces who advanced into the hotel district close to the ancient ruins, said the Observatory which monitors Syria's war through a network of sources.Soldiers interviewed on Mayadeen and Syrian television said that the army was completing the capture of high ground overlooking Palmyra.""JOY AFTER TRAGEDY""Syria's antiquities chief Maamoun Abdulkarim said that driving Islamic State out of Palmyra would be a victory for the whole world.""After all the tragedy we have suffered in Syria for five years, and the 10 months in Palmyra after it fell...it's the first time we feel joy,"" Abdulkarim told Reuters.""We pray for victory soon, so that the damage is limited.

It said there were 56 air strikes between dawn and early afternoon on Friday.A ceasefire backed by the United States and Russia covers most of Syria but not areas held byIslamic State. The first truce of its kind since war began five years ago has been accompanied this month by the first peace talks attended by Assad's government and most of the groups opposed to him. Meanwhile, Damascus has turned its fire on Islamic State.Moscow is the main ally of Assad's government, while Washington and other Western countries have backed foes trying to overthrow him during five years of civil war that has killed 250,000 people and led to the world's worst refugee crisis. Both powers are committed to fighting againstIslamic State and have backed a new diplomatic push to end fighting on other fronts.A Russian special forces officer was killed in combat near Palmyra in the last week, Interfax said, suggesting the Kremlin has been more deeply engaged in the Syrian conflict than it has acknowledged.Islamic State suicide bombers detonated two car bombs as they tried to repulse government forces who advanced into the hotel district close to the ancient ruins, said the Observatory which monitors Syria's war through a network of sources.Soldiers interviewed on Mayadeen and Syrian television said that the army was completing the capture of high ground overlooking Palmyra.""JOY AFTER TRAGEDY""Syria's antiquities chief Maamoun Abdulkarim said that driving Islamic State out of Palmyra would be a victory for the whole world.""After all the tragedy we have suffered in Syria for five years, and the 10 months in Palmyra after it fell...it's the first time we feel joy,"" Abdulkarim told Reuters.""We pray for victory soon, so that the damage is limited. Palmyra, under their control, was the loss of a civilization,"" he said.
