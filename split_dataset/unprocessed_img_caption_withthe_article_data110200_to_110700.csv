0,QUEER VOICES,HRC Reboots Its Mission Toward Greater Trans Inclusion,"Dana Beyer, ContributorExecutive Director, Gender Rights Maryland",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hrc-trans-inclusion_b_5808146.html,"Last Thursday at the Southern Comfort Conference in Atlanta, HRC President Chad Griffin apologized for all the problems between HRC and the trans community for which HRC had been responsible over the years. He was specific and demanded to be held accountable. These are words the trans community has never heard before from HRC, certainly not in public.",2014-09-13,"WASHINGTON, DC - OCTOBER 28: Chad Griffin, 40, president of the Human Rights Campaign, sits for a First Person portrait taken at the HRC headquarters in Washington, D.C. on Oct. 28, 2013. (Photo by Joshua Yospyn/For The Washington Post via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafcd49210000e700c7086c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When I first came out after transitioning, I joined the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), because they had a women's holiday party coming up and it seemed a good place to start. I had been dating men, but they were universally skittish once I discussed my gender history with them. So rather than just being frustrated and angry, I looked for an outlet in activism, and HRC was the big kid on the block (literally so, since they were just then dedicating the D.C. headquarters, which I had previously visited when it was the B'nai B'rith building), so I joined them (and many other groups soon thereafter). This was also the time when HRC was discussing adding the ""T"" in ""LGBT"" to its mission statement, and after attending a few events I decided to join the local steering committee. I don't know if I was the first trans person they had on board, but it certainly seemed like it, based on the general lack of knowledge about trans issues. I wasn't surprised, because efforts by the trans community to join with the gay community in pushing for inclusive anti-discrimination protections had been very difficult and only occasionally successful over the previous decade. I understood where HRC's self-interest lay, as their membership was mostly gay and their money was almost entirely gay, so I kept to myself and spoke out only when asked.In those days certain organizations were more trans-inclusive than others. On the national level the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force was the most avant-garde, and I had made my first LGBT contribution to support their Trans Civil Rights Project, run by Lisa Mottet. On the state level the newly reconstituted Equality Maryland was led by Dan Furmansky, a dynamic executive director who was eager to develop a truly LGBT organization. Mara Keisling had just founded the National Center for Transgender Equality (NCTE) in D.C., as she saw the need for a professional presence on the federal scene, where previous incarnations of national trans organizations had never gained traction.As a result of all of this ferment, HRC, which, under the leadership of Elizabeth Birch, had discussed and then finally decided to add the ""T"" to the organization's mission statement, took the next step in 2004. It was that resolution, lobbied for by Donna Cartwright, Diego Sanchez, Mara Keisling and others inside the new building, while others, including me, demonstrated outside, that was the first tangible example of true inclusion. It dealt with the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), which was to become the lightning rod for HRC and the trans community for the next decade. There was immediate blowback in the gay community, presaging the upcoming battles of 2007.A few years later I joined the board of governors, at a time when Donna Rose was the only trans person on the board of directors. (To date, HRC has never had more than one trans director out of 45.) With the Democratic takeover of Congress, passage of ENDA through Congress became possible (though it would have been vetoed by President Bush, which lent a surreal atmosphere to all the tumult that occurred). HRC, as the leading LGBT lobbying group on Capitol Hill (but without any trans lobbyists, a condition that has still not been altered), had the opportunity to put inclusion to the test and ultimately failed. That experience has been recounted voluminously elsewhere, but suffice it to say that HRC was left holding the bag for the sexual-orientation-only ENDA. Virtually every other LGBT organization joined the United ENDA coalition. The LGBT community had a raucous debate, for the first time, about the difference between gender identity and sexual orientation and the value of true inclusion. It was extremely ugly, leading to the resignation of Donna Rose from the board and Jamison Green from the HRC Business Council. (I remained as a governor to serve as a bridge, since I was locally based.)The debate brought real change, but it occurred primarily in the national community and not in HRC. It was several years before they promoted another trans person, Meghan Stabler, to the board of directors, and they have still not added to that number. For many years Allyson Robinson was the only out trans staffer with any significant responsibility. Little changed in the culture at HRC under Joe Solmonese, including the reluctance to fund trans legislative work on the state level. Inertia was the name of the game within, while progress continued at large, with multiple state and local jurisdictions passing anti-discrimination ordinances, groundwork being laid to remove being transgender from the compendium of mental illnesses and to begin to provide access to health care, and trans persons winning very significant cases in federal courts, culminating in the 2012 Macy v. Holder decision.As those years passed, the leadership at HRC changed with the departures of Winnie Stachelberg, David Smith and Joe Solmonese. When Chad Griffin arrived in town, he promised me that he had been empowered to create real change in the staffing structure, and he has begun to fulfill that promise, particularly with his promotion of Hayden Mora to Deputy Chief of Staff. I was pleasantly surprised how informed he was about trans issues, both in D.C. and nationally.Last Thursday at the Southern Comfort Conference in Atlanta, where Joe Solmonese had promised HRC support for a trans-inclusive ENDA in the fall of 2007, only to make that a very hollow promise in just a few weeks, Griffin apologized -- not only for that misrepresentation but for all the problems between HRC and the trans community for which HRC had been responsible over the years. He was specific and demanded to be held accountable. These are words the trans community has never heard before from HRC, certainly not in public. While the president of HRC can only do so much, it's a major start. As has been said on many occasions, not only about HRC, these organizations take their direction from their board of directors. HRC's board has changed little over the years, with some members still present since the early years. As I've mentioned, there is only one trans board member, and given the importance of fundraising for an organization whose financial support is primarily gay, it's hard to believe that HRC's focus can change very much, even with Griffin's desire to do so.There is reason for optimism, however, with the winding down of the marriage-equality movement. As HRC and others, such as the Gill Foundation, turn their attention to anti-discrimination work in the South and Midwest, and as gender expression, as distinct from gender identity and sexual orientation, comes to the fore as a major issue for the younger generations, an increasingly trans-based focus makes sense for the nonprofit that bills itself as America's leading LGBT organization. Ironically, when gender conformity was of primary importance for both the gay and trans communities, a united front was both possible and desirable. It took a great effort to get here, but today's more diverse expression of gender is demanding greater flexibility within both the gay and trans activist communities. I hope this will help HRC make good on its promises. My colleagues and I will be watching with great hope."
1,SCIENCE,Ovulating Women Prefer Images of Penetration Over Images of Oral Sex,"Pere Estupinya, ContributorScience Journalist. Author of ""The brain snatcher"" and ""S=EX2;...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ovulating-women-prefer-pe_b_5804980.html,Canadian researchers found that during ovulation the female genitalia is more responsive to images of penetration than to images of oral sex. The difference is significantly reduced during non-fertile phases of the menstrual cycle.,2014-09-13,2014-09-11-31_04_2014_articulo_coito_sexo_oral.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-09-11-31_04_2014_articulo_coito_sexo_oral-thumb.jpg,"Canadian researchers found that during ovulation the female genitalia is more responsive to images of penetration than to images of oral sex. The difference is significantly reduced during non-fertile phases of the menstrual cycle.Vaginal photoplethysmograph used to measure women's genital response at the Sexual Psychophysiology Lab of the Kinsey Institute (credit: Pere Estupinyà)A couple's preferences and behavior and female reception toward sex changes during the menstrual cycle. Various studies have verified that during the ovulation period women experience higher levels of sexual desire and fantasies, masturbate more, dress in more seductive clothing, prefer men with more clearly defined masculine traits, enjoy sex more, and reach orgasm more easily, and for bisexual women their desire for men, instead of women, is more pronounced.Something that had not yet been established within this variability was whether women have more of an inclination for a certain type of sexual practice over another according to the moment in her menstrual cycle that she finds herself in.To verify this, Kelly Suschinsky from Meredith Chivers' Sexuality and Gender Laboratory at Queen's University in Canada conducted the following experiment: She selected a group of heterosexual women between the ages of 18 and 40, all of whom had normal menstrual cycles, were not taking prescription drugs, and had abstained from sex for at least 24 hours, and showed them various erotic films with images of penetration and oral sex. She conducted the same experiment twice during ovulation and days later during the luteal phase (non-fertile).While the women observed the different films, researchers measured the women's genital arousal with a vaginal photoplethysmograph. They were also asked about the level of subjective excitement that they experienced. The images, which had already been used in previous experiments, had proven to be arousing for the majority of women. In order to avoid any distortion in the information according to the order in which it was shown, half of the group started with images during their ovulation phase and the other half started with images during the luteal phase.The results were highly significant: When the films were shown for the first time during ovulation, the genital response was fives times greater while observing penetrative than it was while observing oral sex. In contrast, when they were shown during the luteal phase, images of both penetration and oral sex generated a very similar response to each other. It was clear that the women's vaginas during ovulation reacted more intensely to images of penetration than they did during more non-fertile phases of the menstrual cycle. The Mind and Genitalia Aren't Always Well-ConnectedCuriously, the statements offered by volunteers regarding their subjective perception of arousal did not vary as much. This corresponds with the results from a previous group tested by Meredith Chivers, a pioneer in research on sexual concordance of mind and genitalia. Chivers has demonstrated that physical stimulation of the clitoris and vagina does not always coincide with any mental stimulation experienced by women on a subjective level. There are images or sexual situations that, for various reasons, do not prove mentally stimulating or are, in fact, not liked but still generate an unconscious and uncontrollable response of excitement in their genitalia.The First Sexual Encounter Could Condition the RestAnother interesting result of the experiment showed that the testing order mattered and could establish certain preferences in the long run: The women who were shown the first set of films during ovulation showed a clear preference for penetration over oral sex, which diminished but remained during the luteal phase. Those who began in their non-fertile phase, in contrast, generated similar stimulation in response to images of both oral and penetrative sex, while after ovulation their preference for penetration grew considerably but without ever reaching the differences observed in the women who had begun during ovulation.In the article's conclusions, researchers speculate that a woman's menstrual cycle can influence a couple's sexual practices during their first sexual encounter, and that this can slightly condition preferences and levels of satisfaction later on.Clearly, the menstrual cycle isn't the only factor intervening in a woman's complex sexual behavioral response. But except for bonobos and humans, female mammals only experience excitement during ovulation, and it would make sense that this internal programming still exerts a certain unconscious influence in the sexual behavior of women today.Here is Pere's Facebook page and full bio."

The indie film stars Judith Chapman (The Young and the Restless), Max Adler (Glee, Switched at Birth), and Danny Mooney (Whip It, Ides of March). Chapman plays Maggie, the mother of Drew (played by Adler), who is gay and goes on an adventure to convert homosexuals into heterosexuals in order to raise money to help pay for his mom's cancer treatments.Is Saugatuck Cures controversial? Definitely. Fun to watch? Yes. Something to talk about with your friends? You tell me after you see it!I spoke with Ladensack, Deratany and Chapman. Our interviews appear below.* * * * *Ilana Rapp: Why did you choose to be in show business, and why did you choose directing?Matthew Ladensack: It's in my blood to tell stories. It's just one of those things that I have always known. Growing up, I was always a little of an outcast in parts of my life, and telling stories visually was a way for me to communicate how I saw the world and hopefully create an emotional reaction in people; it was a way to say, ""This is how I feel. This is who I am. Please listen to me."" I've wanted to be a director since I was 8 years old. I fit in with the proverbial story of my father letting me play with his video camera and creating short films and trying to create in-camera visual effects. Most films involved my sister getting murdered (sorry, Melissa!), because I was obsessed with the Scream movies growing up. Directing was something that always was appealing, because you have to be a leader; you have to be emotionally connected with the world but also be able to make arduous decisions and communicate. Directing is one of the most thrilling experiences.Rapp: Saugatuck Cures is your feature-film directorial debut. What differences have you seen between directing a feature film and directing a television show?Ladensack: Yep, this is my first feature, and outside of this I've directed independent pilots, shorts and Web series. I was very lucky to have Jay Paul Deratany trust me with his work and cannot thank him enough for the fantastic opportunity! Working on a TV pilot and indie are very similar, because you have to move so fast. That being said, the greatest difference is the companionship that is created on set of a feature film. It's been said before that making a film is like going to war, and those people become your family. You're pulling extremely long hours, bouncing ideas off of each other in the middle of the night, and opening up about your deepest insecurities and wishes. It's a shared experience, and when it's 2 a.m. and it's raining (or snowing), you have to come together and remember why you are telling this story and pull together as a team. There is a lot more prep that goes into a feature film -- mainly more locations, more actors, a larger budget, more crew -- and in the indie world sometimes you work longer ours and have to move a lot faster, since you have only so many days to get the film in the can.Matthew Ladensack directing Saugatuck Cures (photo by Dan Irving)Rapp: Which scene in Saugatuck Cures was the most complicated to direct, and why?Ladensack: Hands down, the Thanksgiving dinner-table scene. It's extremely complicated to have all of your leads at one table for a scene full of dialogue. Everyone has input and questions, and often at the same time. The cast was fantastic about listening to each other and feeding off ideas. There are so many angles to cover and little reactions to get and, of course, never enough time. We had to do a major recast and had to pick up the entire scene again, which meant recreating all of the food and dressing the scene. That was a blessing in disguise, since I could watch what we covered and put the scene together in my head and pick up anything that we missed. It turned out great, thank goodness, and I'm really proud of the entire cast and crew for sticking it through.Rapp: Were you involved in the casting of the actors? Describe the casting process.Ladensack: Casting was very complicated, since I live in Los Angeles and everyone outside of Max, Danny and Judith came from either Chicago or Michigan. We held auditions in Chicago and found amazing talent there, and thankfully Luke Jaden came on and assisted with finding the right people in Michigan for the roles. Luke is very talented and well-connected with actors; I really couldn't have done it without him. The coolest part about casting was casting Max Adler and Danny Mooney together. They are real-life friends, and Max and I went to high school. When I approached Danny (through Max) to be a part of the project, Max wanted to jump on. Their chemistry made the film what it is, and it's truly something special. I couldn't be happier with all the performances from everyone. I am extremely proud of Judith Chapman, Amanda Lipinski, Matthew Klingler and Julianne Howe; they just brought so much life to their characters and the film!* * * * *Ilana Rapp: Are you a lawyer who's a writer or a writer who's a lawyer?Jay Paul Deratany: Ha! I think once a writer, always a writer. I've always loved writing, but I chose law because, frankly, it was more pragmatic to earn a steady income. My earliest memory of writing was a poem I wrote about the holidays that was published in our junior-high news. I thought it was good, and so did others, but because I poked a bit of fun about the holidays, my teacher did not give me a good grade. I guess that was my first experience with critics as well.Rapp: Saugatuck Cures has a gay theme, as did your play Haram Iran. What made you decide to incorporate gay themes into your work?Deratany: The treatment of gays. I read a human-rights story about two boys, age 15, who were hanged in Iran for allegedly being gay, and that disturbed me greatly. For Saugatuck Cures the motivation was seeing right-wing politicians talk about how gays could be ""cured"" and I thought, ""How absurd. What exactly do we need to be cured of?""Rapp: You also executive-produced Saugatuck Cures. What exactly were your responsibilities as an executive producer?Deratany: Wow, I didn't know how hard a job producing really was! In an indie production it's everything. I raised funds, met with investors, hired directors, helped cast, reviewed casting and location agreements, worked through flight schedules with the actors, etc. I was even the last on the set, emptying the garbage at night.Rapp: You've done acting, and you're in the union SAG-AFTRA. How and when did you get your union card?Deratany: I got my union card with a small role on a Lifetime show called Strong Medicine about 15 years ago. It was so exciting being on that show. I've always loved the whole process of acting. I love stage acting the best. There's nothing like the jittery feeling you get when you are about to go on stage.Danny Mooney, Max Adler, and Jay Paul Deratany (photo by Dan Irving)* * * * *Ilana Rapp: How did you become involved with Saugatuck Cures?Judith Chapman: Producer/screenwriter Jay Paul Deratany and I were asked to do a reading of a short film for a mutual friend, Chad Everett. We had never met but so enjoyed playing mother and son in script. By the time we had finished, Jay Paul told me about his film Saugatuck Cures. He asked if I would be interested in reading it. He thought I would be perfect for Maggie. I loved the script, the character, and Jay Paul. Deal done!Rapp: What's the difference between working on a soap opera and working on a feature film?Chapman: When working on a soap, you pretty much know your schedule, location, time into work, time out, etc. A feature film, however, especially when shot on location, is a whole different situation. Locations, weather, even time of day can change everything overnight. On Saugatuck Cures all of the craft services and meals were homemade, which gave a wonderful sense of camaraderie, everyone eating in the kitchen of the B&B or at the dining-room table. Soap meals and craft services? The cafeteria!Rapp: Your character in Saugatuck Cures has cancer. Did you do any research for the role? Did you have your character in your head a certain way, and that's how you portrayed her, or were you directed differently from what you came up with?Chapman: I did do research on cancers and talked to close friends, survivors. I knew what I wanted; the director, Matthew Ladensack, and Jay Paul knew what they wanted. Thank heavens we all agreed. I trusted their comments; they trusted me. Wonderful.Rapp: You've been in several soap operas. What's the worst experience you've ever had working on a soap?Chapman: Worst experience on a soap? Having to work with an actor and do love scenes when you didn't get along. We won't mention any names. Love my day job: It has given me so much freedom to pursue my outside projects, like Saugatuck Cures.* * * * *To learn more about Saugatuck Cures, visit the website, saugatuckcuresmovie.com, and follow them on Twitter @SaugatuckCures.Follow Matthew Ladensack on Twitter @LifeOfLadensack.Follow Jay Paul Deratany on Twitter @deratany.Follow Judith Chapman on Twitter @VivienThePlay."

4,RELIGION,Is It Time for Government to Recognize the Rights of Pastafarians?,"Clay Farris Naff, ContributorScience and Religion Correspondent for the Humanist Magazine",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/is-it-time-for-government_b_5815088.html,"Whether or not you think the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster is a joke, the stakes are quite serious.

Last September, when I attended Apostacon, an Omaha-based freethought conference celebrating the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, the mood was all ribaldry, mockery and piracy. (Pirates, of the ""arrrr, matey"" variety, are considered misunderstood divine beings.) Today, as Pastafarians prepare to make sail for Omaha once again, the church that Bobby Henderson founded as a poke in the eye for Creationists subverting science education is itself struggling with heresy, even as government authorities struggle over whether to recognize religious freedom claims by its followers.It's not easy to blaspheme in a church whose only dogma is the rejection of dogma. Yet, Bill Whatcott seems to have turned the trick. The evangelical activist crashed a pride parade in Vancouver under an FSM banner to hand out fake condoms and anti-gay propaganda. Invoking its unique ecclesiastical language, the FSM Church has denounced Whatcott as ""a douche.""Meantime, authorities in Oklahoma are ""reviewing"" the driver's license issued to Shawna Hammond , a Pastafarian from Enid. Hammond courageously insisted on wearing a colander on her head for the license photo. (The spaghetti strainer is a devotional nod to His Noodliness.)Hammond's effort is likely a first in Oklahoma but not in the nation. Eddie Castillo, a student at Texas Tech, broke ground in 2013, and several others have taken similar stands, with varying success. However, the license photo turns out to have been only the antipasto. In my hometown of Lincoln, Nebraska, an inmate is suing over claims that as a Pastafarian he has been denied his religious rights. According to an account in the Lincoln Journal Star: Stephen Cavanaugh, 23, filed the federal civil rights lawsuit against the Department of Correctional Services and Nebraska State Penitentiary officials, saying penitentiary staff repeatedly discriminated against him by not allowing him the right to meet for worship services and classes, or to wear religious clothing and pendants.Here's where the snickering must stop. Should government at any level in the United States accord members of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster the same rights they would grant, say, the Amish, Orthodox Jews, or Catholic nuns? Absolutely and unequivocally yes.The simple reason is this: The Constitution prohibits the government to pick and choose which religions it likes and which ones it doesn't. Without that prohibition, freedom of religion has no meaning.You might think that every American would recognize this, but no. A powerful wing of the Republican party seeks to impose its ideas of Christianity on all Americans. North Carolina, for example, recently passed legislation to permit public school teachers and administrators to take part in school prayers. In their Orwellian way, proponents of the theocratic agenda call it ""the defense of religious liberty.""Hence, the Journal Star story attracts comments like this: ""Great, just what prisoners need -- to recognize the worship of evil. Isn't anyone in authority allowed to use their better judgment and common sense?""So, whether or not you think the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster is a joke, the stakes are quite serious. Indeed, they go right to the heart of two essential questions: What is nature of religion, and what is the role of government? Religion is not, as some dictionaries would have it, the worship of God or gods. That's like saying music is the performance of symphonies, or poetry is haiku. In short, it is mistaking an instances of content for the much broader underlying concept. Actually, as I explain in my book Free God Now, religion consists of organized cultural and institutional responses to shared perceptions about ultimate reality.That being so, who in government has the right to decide what is a legitimate instance of religion and what is not? No one. The First Amendment specifically prohibits the official establishment of religion. Whether it be a lowly DMV employee, a prison administrator, or the governor of a state, no government official has the right to establish one religion's legitimacy over another. I'd go further and argue that the establishment clause, properly interpreted, protects all worldviews, whether religious or not. Does this mean that anyone can do anything and ""get away"" with it by claiming that it's part of his or her religion? Not at all. Freedom of religion is a bounded freedom; it ends where it infringes on the rights of others or violates neutral public policies. Christians have a right to practice ""spiritual healing,"" but not to withhold medical treatment from diabetic children. Pastafarians have every right to hold pirate parties, but no right to make anyone walk the plank -- not that any any follower His Noodliness would.Can I have a ""ramen""?"
5,POLITICS,Ted Cruz: The Dangers of Not Listening,"James Zogby, ContributorPresident, Arab American Institute; author, 'Arab Voices'",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ted-cruz-the-dangers-of-n_b_5815044.html,"It is generally known that Ted Cruz can be a demagogue, a quality that makes him immensely disliked by his colleagues.

And so as I have attempted to understand why he did what he did, two distinct scenarios come to mind.",2014-09-13,"UNITED STATES - MAY 21: Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, appears at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in Dirksen Building on oversight of the FBI, May 21, 2014, featuring testimony by FBI Director James Comey.

If you do this, she would say, ""you will be able to speak with people and not at them.""What happens when you don't follow this simple rule of communication was on display during the ""In Defense of Christians"" conference that was held in Washington from September 9-11.Addressing an audience of 900 mostly Arab Christians, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) launched into a passionate defense of Israel arguing that ""Christians have no better ally than the Jewish State"". The audience booed. Undeterred, Cruz continued, to more booing, ""Those who hate Israel hate America"" and ""those who hate Jews hate Christians."" When the audience would not stop, Cruz cut short his remarks charging, ""Some here are so consumed with hate... if you will not stand with Israel and Jews, then I will not stand with you."" He then walked off the stage. It is generally known that Ted Cruz can be a demagogue, a quality that makes him immensely disliked by his colleagues. He is also considered to be quite bright and calculating. And so as I have attempted to understand why he did what he did, two distinct scenarios come to mind. It is possible that he went to the IDC conference to provoke a ""Sister Souljah"" moment -- which he could then exploit with his supporters on the fundamentalist right as evidence of his political courage. It is more likely that he had no clue about the reaction his taunting remarks would receive and was, therefore, stunned by the audience reaction -- and that it was only mid-stream that he decided that he could use the audience reaction to his political benefit. In either case, Cruz displayed a shameful insensitivity to the concerns of Middle East Christians and a total lack of awareness of their history and current needs. Like too many of his colleagues, he can only see the Middle East through then lens of what is good for Israel. Because he comes out of the Christian fundamentalist world and now operates in the bubble of Washington politics, he simply had no understanding of his audience and no desire to listen to them and learn from them. Immediately upon leaving the event, he issued a statement to Breitbart (a far-right website) calling the audience reaction ""a shameful display of... ignorance and bigotry."" He lamented that while he had wanted to lay out a litany of examples of Christians and Jews persecuted by ""Islamic radicals,"" his efforts to do so were upended by ""bigotry and hatred"" and ""the corrosive evil of anti-Semitism.""In fact, in this entire sad and sordid affair, the only ignorance and bigotry on display was that of the Senator, himself. He cared not a bit for the feelings of Arab Christians. Blinded by his own lack of understanding and concern, Cruz appeared to be more interested in scoring political points with his conservative base, than in taking the time to know what Christians in Lebanon, Palestine, Jordan, Syria, Egypt and Iraq really feel and want. If he had listened to the six Patriarchs of Eastern churches (as President Obama did in a lengthy meeting with the prelates on Thursday), all of whom also addressed the conference, he would have heard them speak of their history of coexistence with Muslims. They, of course, are deeply concerned with the rise of extremism and horrified by the brutally violent excesses of those who are using a distorted Islam to create the terror they use to consolidate political power. But far from wanting to pour fuel on the fires of a ""clash of civilizations"" that pits Jews and Christians against Muslims, the leaders of these Eastern churches seek the defeat of extremism and the creation of a social order that can build societies based on equal rights for all and reconciliation among all faith traditions. But Cruz wasn't listening. He came to the event with preconceived notions and prepackaged message. He was speaking at Middle East Christians, using them as a prop to promote his own agenda. Unfortunately, he is not alone. For decades now, American politicians have paid scant attention to the realities of the Arab World and the history and needs of its people. Their awareness of the region has been framed by Israel and oil. One, they felt was necessary for their electoral ambitions, the other was important for our economic well-being. Seeing the world through this narrow lens produced a ""willed ignorance"" about broader regional realities. It was not just that politicians did not know about what Arabs were saying or what they wanted, they did not want to know -- since they felt that there was no benefit in knowing. This has created a dangerous state of affairs. In the past four decades since the end of the war in Vietnam, we have spent more money, sent more weapons, fought more wars, lost more lives, and have more interests at stake in the Middle East than anywhere else in the world, and yet we still have too little understanding of its people, their history and culture, and their needs. Because we have had no understanding of Egyptians, Palestinians, Lebanese, Syrians and Iraqis, we have engaged in tragic and costly foreign policy blunders that have taken a terrible toll in human life and the prestige of our country across this critical region. In my polling, I find that Arabs like our values and culture, our science and technology, our products and our people. What they hate is our policy, because they see its impact on their lives and the insensitivity it demonstrates to their concerns. They want to like us, but feel that we reject them. It appears that policymakers want to have it both ways. They want to pass insensitive anti-Arab legislation and make outrageous statements about Arabs and Muslims -- all for politically expedient ends -- and yet they are confounded by the Arab reactions to these taunts and insults. So it was with Ted Cruz on Wednesday night. Despite his reputation, he was set to deliver a speech with which I am certain many of his congressional colleagues would have concurred. After all, they might say, what could anyone find offensive in praising Israel and denouncing radical Islam -- especially to an audience of fellow Christians? But it was not the message this audience needed or wanted to hear, precisely because they are suffering -- and because many of them have suffered at the hands of Israel. Because he didn't really want to help them, or care to know them or to listen to them they booed and booted him off the stage. There is a lesson in this, for those who care to learn. And it's not only about the importance of communicating. With the Israeli-Palestinian conflict simmering on low boil; with violent extremists gaining ground in the heart of the Arab East; with Lebanon on the brink, overwhelmed by refugees and in danger of being engulfed the sectarian conflict brewing next door; and with ancient Christian churches threatened with extinction -- the President has announced that we are now about to reengage militarily in Iraq and Syria. Before we do, it is important that we not repeat the mistakes we made in Iraq and Afghanistan. We need to be certain that we understand the people and the cultural and social dynamics at work in each of these countries before it's too late and our efforts to help become yet another in a series of fatal errors that have marked our history of involvement in this region about which we know so little.

NASA on Wednesday unveiled the first images from the new satellite designed to predict disruptive solar storms, and scientists say they're already learning new things. (AP Photo/NASA)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5baec19f2600003600814c72.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Earlier this week, two solar flares aimed in earth's direction erupted on the sun. What a spectacular picture from NASA has been making the rounds of the Internet; it's literally the muzzle flash of a stellar particle beam cannon looking right at us. Angling slightly above our planet's orbit, a gigantic blast of matter weighing many times our own earth called a coronal mass ejection or CME flies by in a cloud of charged particles. We will catch just the edge of it. It will make pretty aurora, an unhappy satellite or two, maybe a line of airliners following paths along the southern edge of the aurora instead of going the great circle route over the pole and you might even spot a savvy geek sporting a tin foil hat fashion statement this weekend.It's not all fun and games. This particular solar flare was classified X1.6. X means intense but 1.6 is a number ranging from 1 to 9 where each number doubles the intensity. Above X9 are the super X storms; there's no upper limit number. According to NASA, the largest storm recorded since we've had satellites as an X28 in 1976. X1.6 is pretty small in the grand scheme of things, noteworthy but not dangerous. Catastrophic would be something like what's known as the ""Carrington Event"" that occurred in 1859, a super massive solar storm that maybe measured in the X40 range. It hit the earth dead center. It was powerful enough to cause telegraph stations to spontaneously catch fire from the excess energy it fed into the transmission lines of the era.A direct hit by a little CME can cause temporary power outages. Protecting the grid from even these low level storms involves lowering the amount of power supplied via long distance transmission networks to reduce the load on the lines and transformers then filling in the demand as best as one can with more costly local coal and gas powered generating stations. It works to a certain extent although there are still the odd blackouts here and there.A really big X storm hitting the earth head on strikes fear into the hearts of space scientists and U.S. power companies alike. There's so much energy dumped on the planet that power lines will heat up and sag to the ground starting fires. That energy can saturate the cores of transformers burning out the insulation literally welding the innards of railroad car sized electrical equipment into useless scrap. A Carrington-class CME could fry a large fraction of the power grid in as little as 90 seconds. It takes between six months to a year to make one of these main line transformers. Most of the factories that make them are overseas and in a worldwide emergency the U.S. would likely be wait listed. The sheer number required to repair the grid could mean vast areas would be without power for years.Protecting key nodes is actually very doable. It involves installing surge protectors -- monster-sized ones -- and what's called a shunt to divert excess power that keeps the transformer cores from melting down. The U.S. military infrastructure -- long ago hardened for nuclear war -- is fully protected. Countries such as Russia and China have most of their grid protected as do a number of smaller nations. The U.S. commercial power grid is not presently so protected. Vulnerability studies of the U.S. commercial grid indicate that the older Eastern U.S. grid and Pacific Northwest grid are particularly vulnerable to large X-class CME's. The Texas and Western U.S. grids that use less susceptible direct current (DC) long distance transmission lines are less vulnerable.Why hasn't the U.S. grid been hardened is a good question to consider asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Bypassing the trade associations of the industry that will tell you they cannot get to this because they are too busy dealing with carbon offset quotas and other what not, here's the one question you need to ask your local power company. ""Will my family still have reliable electricity after a Carrington-class CME hits?"" Tell them you'd really like it if they'd please report on this at least annually in the Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) and Sustainability sections of their financial reports to shareholders. Tell them you want the answer to be ""Yes we are confident your family will have power even after a major solar storm."" You know, just like in Russia and China.In case you are wondering how remote a possibility this science fiction threat is, NASA's satellites picked one up on July 23, 2012 that was estimated to be as large or larger than the 1859 Carrington solar storm. A solar storm cleared out a region of space followed a few days later by a second large CME that was able to shoot particles even faster than normal. Fortunately, the sun aimed that blast at a point in space the earth was not in the path of at the time. According to some calculations, there's a 16 percent chance that a significant CME will hit the earth dead center in the next decade. You might want to tell your power company to think about hurrying up with that surge protector and shunt.If you are interested, there's a website that has more information on this as well as other threats to the U.S. power grid at securethegrid.com  "

Just like the lyrics of Mrs. Robinson, a lot of us wonder what has happened to our country. Where is the pride, the honor, the love for our fellow countrymen? Most Americans have had their fill with politicians and the mudslinging tactics of what some people would refer to as the slimiest people in our country. Even the highest offices in the land seem to be filled with slick-tongue, never-had-a-real-job, out-of-touch elitists looking out for their own best interests.But there was one man who rose above the pettiness. His name is John McCain, a man who, in my view, brought dignity to the Senate. I would say that John McCain is a true American hero, not just for his service to our country, not just for spending six years as a prisoner of war, but also for being the congressional voice of reason for a quarter of a century.John McCain was the most bipartisan senator of all. He reached across the aisle more than any other. He judged a bill not by who wrote it, but by its contents and how likely it was to help the American people. He touted these things. He was proud of that record. I was proud of it.Even during the 2000 preliminaries when people from George W Bush's campaign made horrible innuendoes like McCain being crazy from the torture of being a POW, or that his wife was a drug addict, or that he had fathered an illegitimate black child, not once did McCain stoop to retaliation. And in 2008, during the campaign against Barack Obama, at a city hall-style rally in Lakeville, Minnesota, when a woman referred to Obama as an Arab, we all remember when John McCain took the microphone away from her and said, ""No ma'am. He's a decent family-man citizen that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues."" Wow. That moved me. How often do you see a politician display that kind of integrity? It would have been so easy for him to agree with this lady, and in fact most of his supporters, and jump on the Barack Hussein Obama bandwagon. It would have won him points across the conservative spectrum. Yet he chose principle over popularity.But -- where has he gone? Unfortunately that man no longer exists. Maybe the current became too strong with all his fellow Republicans rushing hard to the right. Maybe he got too tired to try to stand tall in that current. Maybe it was the fear of the Tea Party or of his constituency. Maybe it was a combination of all of it.Whatever the reason, this once proud and defiant senator has now blended in with the rest of the fray, melted and merged into the conglomerate of conservatives that make up the present-day members of the party. You can't tell him apart from the rest of the fifth-grade level politicians who whine, complain, point their fingers, and refuse to support anything bipartisan.This once noble fellow so full of character now joins in on the childish games. He now looks for any chance to get in front of the camera to trash-talk the other side. He accuses, mocks, and belittles everything from across the aisle. In his final chapters of service to this country, he has become the very thing he stood against for so long.Was it fear? Is our hero now a coward? It is a sad thing for sure. Where has the Maverick gone? We need him now more than ever."

Unlike a traditional union, this labor group for people who aren't union members doesn't have a large base of dues-paying members to fund its programs and politics.What it does have now is a deal with GoHealth, a private insurance exchange, to guide its members and would-be members into health plans available under the law better known as Obamacare. Working America, in turn, will receive a piece of the commission paid out by insurance carriers for each plan issued.The Affordable Care Act strategy is Working America's most promising funding lead yet, said Karen Nussbaum, the group's executive director.""The non-collective bargaining organizations are all dependent on unions or foundations. None of them are within a whisper of becoming self-sufficient,"" said Nussbaum. ""So this becomes a really rare opportunity to achieve that.""Nobody has to use a private broker to obtain health coverage under Obamacare. People can simply go to HealthCare.gov or a state online exchange and shop for themselves. But Working America is betting that its members will appreciate the hand-holding of agents, who come at no extra cost, as they assess a complicated product in a confusing new marketplace. That sort of assistance could be good for Obamacare, too. Outside brokers and agents were critical in helping early enrollment under the Affordable Care Act surpass expectations, with a lot of customers turning to one-on-one guidance to navigate the exchanges. For Working America, this is one way to get more people enrolled in Obamacare and more people enlisted in the labor movement. According to Nussbaum, about two-thirds of the group's roughly three million members would qualify for some sort of subsidy under the law -- that is, if they lack employer-sponsored health coverage.Nussbaum wouldn't say how much Working America expects to fill its coffers through the program, deeming that premature. The total amount could end up being fairly modest, considering that commission fees tend to be small on a per-policy basis and that Working America would capture only part of the commission going to GoHealth.But Robert Laszewski, a health policy consultant and former insurance industry executive, suggests that the money could be significant depending on Working America's reach. He compared the arrangement to the brokering of health plans by AARP, the massive advocacy group for retirees.""The amount per policy is very small. But if you look at the AARP, it adds up very quickly,"" Laszewski said. ""You have to get into the hundreds of thousands or a million [policies] before it becomes seven-figure money. But maybe it's worth it to them.""Laszewski said such a program could have ""added value"" for some people looking to buy insurance on the exchanges.""Obviously, anyone can go directly to the exchanges,"" he said. ""Having said that, people still seem to have an appetite for going to professional counselors and brokers because this is really complicated.""Cem Varon, vice president for Chicago-based GoHealth, said the company's agents have no vested interest in steering customers toward particular plans since they are paid by salary and per-plan commissions. Many customers, he argued, can't get all the help they need through officially designated navigators under the Affordable Care Act. ""We are recognizing that a lot of these consumers need very specific help that requires a discussion,"" Varon said. ""It really is about customer service and access to a licensed agent.""Even if the returns for Working America are a disappointment, any new source of outside funding would be welcome.The underlying purpose of the group, which was launched in 2003, is to bring non-union workers into the labor movement. That mission is critical to organized labor as a whole, given that unionism has dipped below 7 percent of private-sector workers in the U.S., with few signs of an impending turnaround. Working America makes its home inside the headquarters of the AFL-CIO, which, according to Labor Department disclosure forms, devoted at least $9 million to it last fiscal year.""You can't mistake dues-paying for power, but it's really hard to have power without dues-paying,"" Nussbaum said. ""Creating a stream for becoming self-sustaining is the bête noire of all worker organizations outside of collective bargaining.""Despite its growth over the past decade, the group hasn't found a reliable revenue stream beyond its union benefactors. Nussbaum said Working America receives voluntary dues from about 18 percent of its membership, but that's not nearly enough for the group to stand on its own legs. Other non-union labor groups -- such as Restaurant Opportunities Center United, Retail Action Project and OUR Walmart -- similarly rely on big-brother unions and other progressive groups to keep them afloat.Depending on how it goes, Nussbaum said Working America could extend the health program to some of its non-union labor allies. (Of course, not everyone within the labor community is pleased with the Affordable Care Act. Unions such as UNITE HERE have blasted the health care reform law for the damage they say it will do to the multi-employer health plans their members have.)Though Nussbaum is cautious about any predictions -- ""Maybe it doesn't work, who knows,"" she said -- she also has a hard time suppressing her excitement about the possibilities.""While I've had a lot of promising things to say about moving to self-sufficiency, nobody has been able to figure it out yet,"" Nussbaum said. ""We see this becoming a big, big deal in the next several years."""

The nuns were reportedly beaten and killed with a knife. At least one nun was decapitated. There were conflicting reports about whether they had been raped.While mourning their deaths, Sister Enelesi Chimbali, general secretary of the Nairobi-based Association of Consecrated Women in Eastern and Central Africa, said such women left their comfortable homes, convents and native countries to serve the poor and downtrodden.The nuns were buried in Bukavu town in the DRC, where the order has a cemetery. The order’s district covers both Burundi and parts of neighboring DNC. The sisters had wanted to be buried in Africa according to the Xaverian order’s former regional superior, ​Sister Delia Guadagnini, to mark their love for the continent to the end.The nuns had lived in Burundi for the last seven years, offering health care, spiritual and social support to the local communities. They had served in Africa for more than 50 years, spending most of the time in the DRC.Thousands attended their requiem Mass on Wednesday in Bujumbura, where church officials called for thorough investigations and the truth about the deaths.On the same day police said 33-year-old Christian Butoyi Claude, a suspect in their custody confessed, to the killings, saying the convent was built on his family’s land.The suspect had in his possession two keys the sisters used to enter the convent and a mobile phone belonging to one of the sisters, according to the police.But the nuns of their order are questioning the police version of events. Guadagnini said the crime was not committed by one person and the police arrest was an excuse to divert attention.“We don’t believe in the police’s version,” Guadagnini told the Fides news agency. “We do not think this horrible crime was committed by a single person,” she said.This is not the first killing of Catholic clergy or religious order members in the small East African country where a majority of residents are Christians.In 2011, a Croatian nun working with an Italian charity was killed in an attempted robbery. In 1995, two Italian priests and a lay female volunteer from the Xaverian mission were killed for allegedly backing a Hutu tribe militia. "

There is truth in the saying ""Keep Korma and Curry On."" India is a controlled and chaotically enriching assault on the senses which has altered my perception on reality forever. I would go as far as to say that it quite literally blew my mind. There are so many things to love about a place that holds the most wonderfully vibrant and alive cuisine in the world, coupled with an ancient system of healing and not to mention the traditional home of downward dog.My biggest takeaway from India was meeting a myriad of wonderfully genuine and generous people who I felt had a strong sense of kinship and community, perhaps I noticed it more because I could see people's dependency upon one another. It wasn't just the kind of dependency which involved getting a step further ahead in business or a personal advancement. It was more of a matter of sticking together for the sole purposes of survival. Being immersed in the human element of India and its people gave me an insight and a sense of perspective that can't be found on a Instagram highlight reel.One of the many lessons I learnt in India was that life is not about living your dream. It's about living your purpose and for me these two things are very different. For some people living your purpose may be enjoying a simple, happy and uncomplicated life engulfed in personal meaning. For others it may mean the difference between a job and a calling. For me it is both.The external chaos of India compels you to explore your internal world, let go of the extrinsic and live in the intrinsic to be able to cope with all that is happening externally, the people with leprosy, the snake charmers, a herd of cows on the road, bustling and beeping traffic and a lack of sanitation. It makes you try to want to understand more than who you are and what your values are, but what your true purpose on this planet is. For me being in India meant being comfortable with feeling uncomfortable most of the time which helps you to find your purpose sooner.Speaking of takeaway, the initial reason for my food safari was an urgent craving to delve into the richness and healing properties of Ayurvedic nutrition and cooking and to sink knee-deep in learning about how to eat right for your constitution or dosha.One of my first stops was Kerala in South India where I studied Ayurvedic nutrition and a practical cooking course in order to research for my next book, Eat Right for Your Shape.I've always had a soft spot for Indian cuisine in particular curries and pretty much any Saag I can get my hands on, but I hadn't really experienced the taste of true Indian cuisine until my visit to India. A big attraction of the food for me is that it is mostly vegetarian yet so full of flavour and created with simple ingredients. It was exciting to unearth some of the mysteries of Indian food and learn the art of creating sweet delicacies seasoned with cardamom, saffron, nutmeg, and rose petal essences.One of the simplest and most magical dishes I came across was a Keralite dish called Vegetable Thoran, a dry vegetable curry. It literally only took a couple of bites for me to fall head over heels in love. Part of the magic of cooking traditional Indian cuisine is that it doesn't have to be about hunting down specific ingredients to make it authentic in a Western sense, such as powdered garam masala, you can use just a handful of ingredients at hand to whip this up quicker than you can say; Holy Haryana. If you're into curries then try my Jolly Good Butter Chicken, or Eggplant and Green Bean Curry if you're vegetarian.In a nutshell the base ingredients to create a thoran are finely chopped or grated vegetables tempered with mustard seeds and cooked with curry leaves, shallots or onions, freshly grated coconut and spices. You can use any kind of vegetables that are around, carrots, zucchini, cabbage and you can add chili depending upon your preference.The absolute key to this dish is in your knife handling skills; to create a carefully chopped and constructed pile of goodness it takes calmness and patience and being in the moment, some other facets of Indian wisdom. Start with good quality organic vegetables where possible and play around until you get the flavours that work for you.Vegetable ThoranServes 4Ingredients: 2 TBS coconut oil 1 TBS black mustard seeds 1 tsp cumin seeds 1 inch piece of ginger minced 1 small onion chopped fine 2 garlic cloves chopped 1 green chili chopped (optional) 1 TBS turmeric 8-10 small curry leaves (one sprig) 4 carrots grated fine 500 gms green beans chopped on angle very fine Pinch Celtic sea salt 1/2 cups grated coconut 1/2 tsp freshly cracked black pepper 1 TBS filtered water  Method: Heat the coconut oil in a pan over medium-high heat Place in mustard seeds and fry until they pop Add cumin and continue cooking until the colour changes Add ginger and onion and garlic and sauté until translucent If using chili pop it into the pan now and cook for a minute Stir in turmeric and curry leaves Pour in green beans and a pinch of salt Stir and cook for a couple of minutes Add carrot and stir and cook for another couple of minutes Now pour in coconut and stir, season to taste Cover the pan with a lid and reduce heat to low and continue cooking until vegetables are soft you may need to add a tablespoon of water here if the mixture is too dry to help the cooking (steaming) process Garnish with coriander leaves (optional)"

The trend may be driven by market calculations and also, possibly, reality TV. Or maybe it's that the world has gotten so weird no fiction can compete with it. I locate this turning point with Bob Dole's endorsement on TV of Viagra.Some of us, however, continue to prefer stories that emerge whole cloth, with all their quirks and flaws, out of a filmmaker's vision and imagination. In fact, such films are often truthier. The Clouds of Sils Maria by Olivier Assayas is not only a magical journey -- it tells me more about the bonds between women than any fact based tale.A standout at this year's Toronto is Foxcatcher by Bennett Miller (soon to appear at the New York Film Festival). Here's yet another feature based on a sensational true life story -- yet this mesmerizing film (which won Best Director for Miller at Cannes) engages on so many levels, it practically reinvents the genre and renders the whole question of reality-based or not moot. A hybrid of true crime and sports drama, Foxcatcher delves into the disturbing story of wrestling champions Mark and Dave Schultz (Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo) and their fateful encounter with billionaire coach John du Pont (Steve Carell, cast against type), heir to the vast chemical fortune. When we first meet wrestler Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum), he's already won the gold at the 1984 Olympics. His life is now a lonely round of training routines and solitary evenings in shabby quarters among his wrestling medals. No endorsements for this champ. Opportunity knocks when Mark's invited by John du Pont (Steve Carell) to join the U.S. team preparing for the 1988 Olympics in Seoul and train at Foxcatcher, Du Pont's estate near Valley Forge. Du Pont also wants Mark's beloved brother Dave on board as a trainer but Dave refuses to uproot his family. Mark moves to a sleek chalet on du Pont's sprawling estate, a luxe world of rolling hills, polished interiors, and a top notch wrestling center, all of it forming a stark contrast to Mark's old life. Du Pont spoils Mark with gifts and praise, at the same time pushing his limits with relentless training -- and introducing him to coke. There's something seriously out of joint, though, namely the psyche of Mark's benefactor. A turning point is reached when Dupont calls his protégé ""an ungrateful ape"" and never seeks to apologize. Eventually he coaxes Mark's brother Dave into joining Team Foxcatcher and the stage is set for disaster. The three men are each meticulously drawn. Channing Tatum's hunkiness serves him well. In a fully invested turn, he looks brutalized and almost simian, with a forward thrust jaw and wrestler's gait, pulling off his matches with authority. He burrows deep into inarticulate rage, a keg of dynamite ready to explode. The main center of sympathy is Ruffalo as Dave, a family man and all round good guy who's struggled to reach a rung in the middle class, props up his brother, and believes reason can smooth out the kinks. But the film belongs to Steve Carell in a transformative turn as Du Pont, his every moment on screen racheting up a sense of dread. The dead eyes and bloodless smile, along with peculiar pauses in his speech, suggest derangement held in check. His attachment to Mark skirts the homo-erotic; that he comes on like a father figure is beyond grotesque. Du Pont is also an ornithologist - with his prosthetic beak he resembles an eagle sighting his prey -- and self-styled patriot, who laments America's lack of values -- ""I want to see this country soar again."" With acidic irony, this portrait of a sicko is set against footage from promos made by the Du Pont family to celebrate its illustrious history.Foxcatcher weaves its spell through the cunning use of pregnant silences to build an ominous mood. Scenes veiled in a gray mist are shot from behind the looming black head of a statue; foxes look like jackals. Miller brilliantly meshes social critique with a B horror movie. Some viewers may wonder why the Schultz brothers didn't spot Dupont's craziness. Maybe as blue collar types with limited social exposure they just wrote it off as eccentricity. Others may see Dupont's villainous one-percenter as emblematic of his caste. I don't think the director wants to go there quite; that would be too on the nose and for all its tabloid overtones Foxcatcher is too elegant for that. Certainly, though, it's a cautionary tale about the dangers of limitless cash allied with arrogance and delusion."

The Islamic State group is often described as the most fearsome jihadi outfit of all: a global menace outweighing al-Qaida, with armies trembling before its advance. But while the group has been successful at seizing parts of Iraq and Syria, it is no unstoppable juggernaut. (AP Photo, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13d352300004d00d0bce8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As the United States begins to deepen ties with moderate Syrian rebels to combat the extremist group ISIS, also known as the Islamic State, a key component of its coalition appears to have struck a non-aggression pact with the group. According to Agence France-Presse, ISIS and a number of moderate and hard-line rebel groups have agreed not to fight each other so that they can focus on taking down the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad. Other sources say the signatories include a major U.S. ally linked to the Free Syrian Army. Moreover, the leader of the Free Syrian Army said Saturday that the group would not take part in U.S. plans for destroying the Islamic State until it got assurances on toppling Assad.The deal between ISIS and the moderate Syrian groups casts doubt over President Barack Obama's freshly announced strategy to arm and train the groups against ISIS. The AFP report cited information from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based group monitoring the Syrian civil war, which said parties to the agreement ""promise not to attack each other because they consider the principal enemy to be the Nussayri regime."" The term Nussayri refers to the Alawite ethnic group that Assad and many of his supporters belong to. AFP said the agreement was signed in a suburb of the Syrian capital, where ISIS has a strong presence.Charles Lister, a fellow at the Brookings Institution's Doha Center, cited a report from the anti-regime Orient Net website to suggest on Twitter that the signatories of the ceasefire include a U.S.-backed coalition called the Syrian Revolutionary Front. According to the U.K.-based outlet Middle East Eye, that same Orient Net report says the ceasefire between groups described in the U.S. as ""moderate rebels"" and the Islamic State was mediated by the al-Nusra Front, al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria.As recently as March, the Syrian Revolutionary Front and its leader were described in Foreign Policy as ""the West's best fighting chance against Syria's Islamist armies."" As of that report, the group controlled 25,000 fighters and its leader had close ties with the Western-friendly Syrian National Coalition. Its leader initially won Western favor by successfully fighting ISIS in northern Syria.""He proved his mettle in a sense and that's what endeared him to the Americans,"" said Joshua Landis, a prominent Syria expert at the University of Oklahoma. ""The Americans are looking for people who can actually fight. That's been their problem: they've gone with people who are moderate but they don't know to fight. This guy appears to be both moderate and he knows how to fight.""The Orient Net report on the ceasefire identified the Syrian Revolutionary Front as part of the Free Syrian Army, the loose array of non-jihadist rebel brigades that the U.S. has directly supported since last year. Obama asked Congress to approve $500 million to train and equip ""vetted"" Syrian rebels this summer. He repeated his request in his address Wednesday about ISIS.Despite its reputation as a palatable ally, the U.S.-backed Syrian Revolutionary Front has previously said that its chief goal is not to stop the rise of extremists, but to topple Assad. In April, its leader told The Independent, ""It’s clear that I’m not fighting against al-Qa’ida. This is a problem outside of Syria’s border, so it’s not our problem. I don’t have a problem with anyone who fights against the regime inside Syria.""The prospect of a group once supported by the U.S. now sitting down with ISIS raises fundamental questions about U.S. strategy in Syria. Why support Syrians who have a very different, clearly stated goal and who will act as they see fit to achieve it? What assurance does the administration have that fighters it trains and arms in Syria won't ally with ISIS if it seems like the most effective anti-Assad force? The White House argues that its ability to spotlight and support reliable rebel groups has been heightened by improved and expanded intelligence. In an interview with The Huffington Post before news of the pact broke, deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes expressed confidence in U.S. allies in the region. ""We have been working with the Syrian opposition now for a couple of years, providing them assistance, non-lethal at first but then we [now] provide them with some military assistance, so we know them better today than we did a year, two years ago,"" Rhodes said. ""There are people who have been vetted who we have relationships with, who we deliver assistance to, so we're not starting from scratch.""Many of those groups, the administration acknowledges, have not passed a vetting process, which explains the delay in expanding assistance. But the news that the Syrian Revolutionary Front, a major player in the moderate coalition, has now chosen to stop fighting ISIS may inspire other groups, either already vetted or still waiting for aid, to determine that a deal with the extremist group is worthwhile. Given reports that Assad avoided fighting ISIS in order to crush the moderate rebels -- his calculus being that the West would eventually combat the extremists, as it is now doing -- potential U.S. partners may decide that instead of being prey to both extremists and the government, they should settle one battle.""These guys are all starved for arms,"" Landis said. ""They don’t want to go get themselves killed by fighting ISIS until they figure out where Obama is.""That turns a conflict that the White House hopes is three-sided -- with radical Sunnis, moderate Sunnis and Assad all battling each other -- into a sectarian, two-sided war of Sunnis against Assad. Reports already suggest that Syrians who entered the civil war opposing Assad are now turning to ISIS as their best bet for a different kind of government.Rhodes warned that a wrong move by the U.S. may lead to that precise perception and reality. ""If we were to try to run a play with Assad, we would ensure that they"" -- all Sunni rebel groups -- ""were turned against us, and in fact we would be taking sides in a sectarian war against one side. We need a Sunni partner in these countries,"" he said. ""That's why we need this inclusive government [in Iraq] and that's why we need a Sunni opposition partner in Syria.""This news suggests that partners will be hard to find. Lister said the pact is a product of failed U.S.-led Western policy in Syria.""This underlines serious frustration w. lack of US-backing to [Free Syrian Army] opposition in fight vs Assad,"" he tweeted.If true, Landis said, the news of a ceasefire proves Washington does not know who it can support or trust within the fractured country.""We don't know who the moderates are,"" Landis said. Describing a recent interview in which a Free Syrian Army commander told an Arab outlet that the U.S. wanted to make Syrian rebels ""slaves,"" he added, ""These guys are supposed to be our buddies?""UPDATE: September 14 -- The Hill reported Sunday that, according to a Syrian National Coalition official, no U.S.-vetted Syrian opposition groups have entered a ceasefire agreement with the Islamic State. However, the official said he could not speak on behalf opposition groups that have not been vetted by U.S. officials.Sign up below to get an email when Ryan Grim publishes a new story"

Bush smiles as he delivers the commencement address 11 May 2007 at Saint Vincent College in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. AFP PHOTO/Mandel NGAN (Photo credit should read MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d5e5260000350083bac9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The current public debate and wave of articles about how colleges can do a better job of providing access to students from low-income families -- including my own article, ""Making Top Colleges Less Aristocratic and More Meritocratic"" (with Richard Kahlenberg) in Friday's New York Times -- reminds me that for over a century, most colleges have had an affirmative action policy for rich, well-connected white kids. It is called ""legacy"" admissions.Former President George W. Bush was an affirmative-action beneficiary, at Yale University and then at Harvard Business School. But that didn't stop him from opposing affirmative action based, in part, on race. Bush once said that considering applicants' race in college admissions ""amounts to a quota system that unfairly rewards or penalizes prospective students based on their race.""Bush was admitted to Yale in 1964 under an affirmative-action policy for children of alumni -- what colleges call a ""legacy"" system. ""Legacy"" policies -- preferential treatment of children of alumni -- are the quintessential example of the ""old boys network."" Colleges view them as a way to get into the pockets of rich alumni. Admit my child and I am more likely to increase my donations to my alma mater -- or at least maintain whatever level of giving worked to help get my child in there. Legacy preferences still exist, of course, at most selective schools. But they no longer carry quite the same weight they did at schools such as Yale, Princeton University and Harvard University when Bush was applying to colleges in 1964.Bush never released his high-school grades from Andover -- an elite New England prep school that his father had also attended -- or his SAT scores. But when The New Yorker got hold of Bush's Yale records, it discovered that he scored a 566 on the verbal SAT and a 640 on the math SAT -- 180 points below the median score for his Yale classmates. From what is known about Bush's academic performance at Andover, it is doubtful that he would have been admitted to Yale unless his father (at the time a Texas businessman running for the U.S. Senate in a race he eventually lost) and grandfather (Prescott Bush, a former Republican U.S. senator who represented Connecticut from 1952 to 1962) had been Yalies (from, respectively, the classes of 1948 and 1917). In fact, as a student, Bush studied in the Yale library's Prescott Walker Bush Memorial Wing.Back then, Yale's student body was disproportionately made up of white, upper-class students from the nation's most elite prep schools. But without a Yale legacy, even a student from the most select private high school needed excellent grades and SAT scores to get in. Like other Ivy League colleges, Yale at the time had its own criteria for ""diversity."" It looked for students with strong athletic abilities or special skills such as musical or theatrical talent, as well as students from different parts of the country. These non-legacy students had to meet Yale's basic academic standards, of course, though the college no doubt rejected plenty of one-dimensional students who may have had higher grades and SAT scores but lacked other qualities Yale was looking for. (At the time, however, Yale made little effort to recruit minorities. In the fall of 1964, there were only 28 African-American students out of 4,093 undergraduates.)Other than being a legacy, Bush had no qualities that would have gotten him into Yale. Had he been a National Merit Scholar finalist, an outstanding athlete or actor or editor of the Andover newspaper, or had he perhaps organized his fellow students to tutor underprivileged kids, we probably would know by now. In fact, he was a mediocre student -- he never made the honor roll -- and demonstrated no particularly outstanding talents to warrant being admitted to Yale. He was head cheerleader during his senior year, organized the school's stickball league and played baseball, basketball and football. But, unlike his father, who was an outstanding baseball player, W. was not a star athlete, and certainly not good enough to be recruited by Yale's coaches. Perhaps Yale was looking for students from west Texas to add some cultural and regional diversity, but, if so, why accept a kid from Midland, Texas, who had attended prep school in Massachusetts? It probably didn't hurt that three of the seven members of Yale's admissions committee who reviewed Bush's application had been in Skull and Bones, the exclusive college club that also included W.'s grandfather and father among its members (and would later ""tap"" W. for membership during his junior year). The fact is that, just a few years later, when Yale began admitting women and tightened its legacy policy, it is unlikely that Bush -- even with all his connections -- would have gotten in.And has anyone asked George W. how he got into Harvard Business School, the nation's premier training ground for corporate executives? We like to think that the school selects students based on meritocratic criteria: college grades, scores on the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) or some experience in the real world of business that would demonstrate the skills necessary to run a major corporation.But Bush's Yale transcript shows that he was a C student. He got particularly poor grades in political science and economics. In his freshman year -- the only year for which The New Yorker obtained rankings -- Bush was in the 21st percentile of his class. In other words, 79 percent of the students had better grades than he did. Indeed, when he gave a speech at Yale's 2001 commencement ceremony, he joked, ""To the C students I say, you, too, can be president of the United States."" Bush has never released his GMAT scores. During the five years between his graduation from Yale in 1968 and his application to Harvard Business School in 1973, he had no obvious career trajectory or major accomplishments. In 1970, he worked on his father's second unsuccessful campaign for the U.S. Senate. He had never worked in the business world except for nine months in 1971, when he was a management trainee with Stratford of Texas, an agricultural and ranching company. In 1973 he worked for nine months as a counselor at the Professional United Leadership League, a program that provided mentors from professional sports leagues to Houston's inner-city children.During this five-year period, Bush served part-time in the Texas National Guard. And even his acceptance to the National Guard's pilot-training program required special treatment. Bush scored only 25 percent on a pilot-aptitude test, the lowest acceptable grade. Nevertheless, commanders of the Texas Guard, aware that Bush's father was then a U.S. congressman from Texas, swore W. in as an airman the same day he applied.In 1973, he was discharged from the National Guard in order to enter Harvard Business School. By that time, Bush had already been rejected in his home state by the University of Texas' law school because of his lackluster performance at Yale. So when the admissions directors at Harvard Business School looked at Bush's transcript and application, they must have seen something that allowed them to take a chance on an applicant who could charitably be labeled an ""at-risk"" student. (And it probably wasn't that he'd been president of his fraternity, Delta Kappa Epsilon, known as the hardest-drinking jock house at Yale.) At the time, Bush's application landed at Harvard Business School, Bush Senior -- who had recovered from his defeated bids for U.S. Senate in 1964 and 1970 and was by then a former congressman from Texas, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and former U.S. diplomatic liaison to China -- was chairman of the Republican National Committee. Might Senior's fame have played a role?It isn't clear if the business school's forms asked if applicants had ever been arrested. But if so, Bush's application might have stood out -- for the wrong reasons. He was not arrested for protesting for civil rights or against the Vietnam War. Rather, as a 20-year-old Yale junior, Bush was arrested for stealing a wreath from a New Haven hotel. He was charged with disorderly conduct, though the charge was later dropped. Perhaps Harvard's admissions committee saw this experience as good training for someone who might later run a Texas oil company or, as president, have to decide how to deal with such corporate law breakers as Enron and WorldCom executives. Regardless of his own privileged background -- and the obvious ways that Yale and Harvard ignored his grades and test scores when admitting him -- Bush was and is entitled to his opinions about affirmative action. What he seemed to misunderstand is that the University of Michigan's affirmative-action policy -- which he criticized in the statement quoted above -- did not allow the admittance of students who are unqualified or unable to handle the academic work. No selective university or college simply uses grades and test scores in deciding which students to accept. Colleges accept students whose high-school grades and SAT scores meet a basic threshold, and then give extra points to students with various characteristics, based on such factors as athletic or artistic ability; urban, suburban or rural background; demonstrated commitment to public service; attendance at public, private or religious high schools; and ethnic and racial backgrounds. All of this is done merely in the name of creating a diverse student body, a goal that Bush said he supported.Bush, a mediocre student, likely got into Andover, Yale, Harvard Business School and the Texas National Guard's pilot-training program because he was rich and well-connected. His subsequent business career -- including his early efforts to start an oil company, the financial favoritism that allowed him to buy part of the Texas Rangers baseball team with hardly any of his own money, the political favoritism that allowed him to persuade the city of Arlington, Texas, to subsidize a new stadium -- was due in large part to his family and social connections. These connections laid the groundwork for Bush to enter politics and helped catapult him to the presidency.Affirmative action programs were designed to help qualified students without these sorts of connections -- indeed, to help some students who have had to cope with considerable economic and social disadvantages, including racism -- in order to level the playing field. But the Supreme Court has tied the hands of colleges and universities. In Fisher v. University of Texas, the Supreme Court last year held that universities ""bear the ultimate burden of demonstrating, before turning to racial classifications, that available workable race-neutral alternatives do not suffice."" Colleges and universities still can, however, put a new emphasis on affirmative action for economically disadvantaged students of all races as a way of indirectly promoting racial diversity. But some of the wealthiest private universities still demonstrate little commitment to this goal. For example, at Yale -- which has one of the largest endowments of any university in the country, the equivalent of over $1.9 million per student -- only 13 percent of the students come from low income families (reflected in the number of students with federal Pell Grants), according to the New York Times. Perhaps the current debate over which colleges walk the walk on providing access to low-income students -- including the New York Times new project, led by David Leonhardt, to look more closely into these issues -- will push colleges to do away with affirmative action for the children of rich alumni and just focus on providing access for the many talented students from disadvantaged backgrounds.Like the Supreme Court, Bush said he wanted college admissions to be ""race neutral"" because racial background isn't something you earn, it's something into which you're born. So the question for Bush is whether he would also have wanted college admissions to be ""legacy neutral"" for the same reasons -- and where in life he would be right now if they were. --Peter Dreier is a professor of politics and the chair of the Urban and Environmental Policy Department at Occidental College.

The attack launched last Saturday in Pakistan seems to have targeted the wrong ship.Fighters of the Islamic terror group branch that was unveiled two weeks ago had planned to storm an American aircraft carrier at a Karachi port, but found a Pakistani Navy ship in its place, The Telegraph reports. The attackers suffered heavy casualties as the Pakistani Navy easily overpowered their attempt. Three of the al-Qaeda fighters were killed and seven were arrested according to Pakistani officials. Two Pakistani Naval guards were wounded. ""It was a complete failure, they did not do any kind of damage, some were captured and we caught more, seven so far and may be more to come. They were well-equipped and came with the intention of taking a ship into their custody but they were caught in the initial stages,"" an investigation source told The Telegraph.Al-qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) claimed responsibility for the attack on Thursday, the anniversary of September 11. ""The Naval officers who were martyred on Saturday in the attack in Karachi were al-qaeda members. They were trying to attack American marines and their cronies,"" a statement from the group's spokesman said. The group's statement alleged that attackers were able to take brief control of a frigate, contrary to what the investigation source Telegraph spoke with said. AQIS also asserted that the attackers were former Pakistani Navy officers.Pakistani officials refuted AQIS' claim that all the attackers were former Pakistani Navy members, saying only one fighter who was killed in the battle had served. Officials were also skeptical that AQIS was even behind the attack at all.Al-qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent was announced earlier in September by the group's leader Ayman al Zawahri, who claimed the new branch would spread Islamic rule and ""raise the flag of jihad"" across the subcontinent. It was seen as a move to impress the terrorist organization's prominence among Islamic militant groups, at a time when much of the world's attention is on the Islamic State, also referred to as ISIS or ISIL.CORRECTION: A previous version of this article stated that militants intended to attack an American aircraft. The intended target was an American aircraft carrier according to reports.Also, a previous headline for this article, ""New Al Qaeda India Branch Attacks Wrong Ship,"" was updated to make clear that Al-qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent is not solely based in India."

If Sweden elects a center-left government, as it is projected to do on Sunday, the country could deliver a rare rebuke to fiscal belt tightening even as leaders across Europe continue to set strict monetary policy.Since it took power in 2006, Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt's center-right coalition has instituted dramatic income and corporate tax cuts, trimmed welfare benefits, rolled back labor laws and privatized state-owned companies, particularly in the areas of education and health care. The result -- GDP growth of 12.6 percent, a rise in disposable income and a sizable budget surplus -- stands in stark contrast to the rest of Europe, which continues to face economic turmoil brought on by the 2008 recession. Yet Swedes seem ready for a change. Polls conducted Friday indicate that the Scandinavian country's opposition parties, led by the Social Democrats, lead the ruling coalition by 6 to 8 percentage points.Why the voters' change of heart? Concern that pro-market reforms are tearing into the nation's famed social safety net, a point of great national pride, appears to be the primary reason. ""They have sold out our country,"" one Stockholm resident said of Reinfeldt's government, according to the Associated Press. ""The rich are getting richer and things are getting worse for the poor.""Income inequality is on the rise, unemployment hovers stubbornly high around 8 percent, and the nation's GDP growth has slowed. Moreover, many Swedes aren't particularly taken with the ruling party's policy on privatizing schools and hospitals -- an issue that has come to the forefront with recent media reports on overcrowded hospitals and people mistreated in elder care.Sweden's election may not actually be the first sign of changing winds in Europe. In a surprise decision, the European Central Bank announced last week that it was cutting its main interest rate and beginning a round of quantitative easing in hopes of boosting economic growth."
