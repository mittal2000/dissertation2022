The millionaire was an eccentric named John Beresford Tipton, Jr. who sat in front of a roaring fire with his back to the viewer. You never saw his face. He was the prototype of the social experimenter. It wasn't so much that he necessarily thought money was everything, but more that he wanted to see what money did to people. Every week he handed an envelope to his amanuensis, Michael Anthony (Marvin Miller) who then changed people's lives. The Millionaire made millionaires, but the show was a form of Mephistophilian reality TV. Good fortune didn't necessarily befall those who sold their souls for maybe not the knowledge but for the power that money confers. While The Millionaire played, another show with a similar structure, but a totally different payoff also aired. That show was Crossroads and it began with two intersecting paths followed by a beam of light towards which a man of God walked. ""Each Crossroads story is based on the actual experiences of American clergyman, pastor, priest or rabbi, the men who give inspiration and guidance to people at the crossroads of life,"" ran the narrator's voice over. Like in The Millionaire, the cleric was a deus ex machina (literally in this case) who intervened into the lives of your average Sally or Joe and sometimes these clerics had their own problems too. However, the gift in this case was not a million dollars, but God. Oedipus of course attempting to escape fate ended up slaying his father, Laius, at the crossroads and marrying his mother Jocasta when he got to Thebes. Neither the script writers for The Millionaire or Crossroads aspired to the that level of tragedy, though most of their characters suffered from hamartia or a tragic flaw that neither money nor God was always able to solve. It would have been fun if the two shows could have mixed and matched with God, for instance, taking up where the powers of money left off.photo: Marvin Miller and Inger Stevens in The Millionaire (CBS Television){This was originally posted to The Screaming Pope, Francis Levy's blog of rants and reactions to contemporary politics, art and culture}"

I picked up the images and stared at my parents and strained to imagine the young couple in love.My father stood in his Army fatigues in front of a row of tanks in Japan. While he served overseas after World War II, his wallet contained the photo of my mother in a swimming suit. My earliest images of her are quite different. I remember her in a large flowered dress, waving to me with plump arms while admonishing me to ""be good"" because my father was coming home from work. I'm amazed that she once was a charming young woman, smiling to her fiancé, wearing a bathing suit in front of a flower garden. I wish I had known her then.  Another photo from 1948 was a self-portrait, taken long before instant selfies were available on cellular telephones. Their young innocence intrigues me. I imagine my mother sewing linens for her hope chest while listening to the Glenn Miller Orchestra on the radio. I see my father coaxing an old tractor to complete one more row in the field before dark. They married on a cool day in late November 1948 with nothing but determination and grit. The years brought prosperity and heartache. Dad passed away in 1989 after receiving a cancerous, transplanted liver. Mom slipped into dementia a few years ago and died last November, just short of what would have been their 66th wedding anniversary.I never saw them hug and kiss. I guess the stress of several businesses and bad health depleted their romantic energy. For several years, my father lived in another state during the week, where he operated a trucking business. Every year, Dad would give me money to buy Mom presents for Christmas and other special occasions. She would always buy him a patio lounge chair for Father's Day. The fabric rotted, unused, in the sun.  Of all the faded photos I've examined, none are as profound as the ones of the young couple in love. That's how I choose to remember them. They were beautiful, before the trauma and drama of life cheated them out of growing old together. I want them to know their legacy is strong, and lives on through their amazing grandchildren and great-grandchildren. I have a request for my middle-aged friends: Are your parents still living? If so, maybe you could take a few hours and visit with them. Ask them about their courtship and their first years together. I predict they will open their hearts and their scrapbooks and begin to talk. Help them celebrate the memories of their young love. Otherwise, you may never know about their passion until a wrinkled photograph falls onto the floor after they're gone. This weekend, I'll play Glenn Miller's ""String of Pearls"" and open another album."
7,ARTS,The Lomax Connection,"Stephen D. Winick, ContributorFolklorist, Music Critic, Editor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-lomax-connection_b_6907390.html,The group's challenge was familiar to anyone in traditional music: interpret source recordings in an interesting way while remaining true to the spirit of the originals.,2015-03-20,2015-03-20-1426838181-1041886-LPwithTimOBrienBlog.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-20-1426838181-1041886-LPwithTimOBrienBlog-thumb.jpg," Wade Ward listening to playback with Alan Lomax at the Ward home in Galax, Virginia, August 31, 1959. Photo by Shirley Collins. AFC Alan Lomax Collection. Used by Permission. As I've mentioned before, 2015 is the centennial year of the great folklorist Alan Lomax. The American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress, the Association for Cultural Equity, and other organizations are celebrating with a variety of programming incorporating archival work, online presentations, conference appearances (including SXSW!), lectures, symposia, and public performances of the great music Lomax collected.  Jayme Stone's Lomax Project. By Lindsay McWilliams. Courtesy of Jayme Stone.But that's not the only way to hear Lomax's legacy. From Miles Davis in the 1950s to Moby at the turn of the century, and on to the Inside Llewyn Davis soundtrack a little over a year ago, folk, blues, and pop musicians are always riffing on the iconic songs Lomax collected. Jayme Stone's Lomax Project is the most conscious recent example; it celebrates the centennial by recording new versions of songs Alan Lomax (or, in some cases, his father John Lomax) collected in the field. Stone's international and intergenerational cast of musicians includes Bruce Molsky (fiddle, voice), Tim O'Brien (guitar, mandolin, voice, fiddle), Brittany Haas (fiddle), Margaret Glaspy (voice, guitar), Moira Smiley (accordion), Drew Gonsalves (voice), and many others; they're a distinguished crew of both seasoned veterans and fresh faces on the traditional music scene. The album's style is thus a nice mix of the lived-in old-time sound with the edgier feeling of today's scene, which you can really hear in the vocals passed between Glaspy and O'Brien on ""Goodbye, Old Paint"": The group's challenge was familiar to anyone in traditional music: interpret source recordings in an interesting way while remaining true to the spirit of the originals. Since Lomax's field recordings from the late 1950s and later are of such good quality, overly faithful renditions rarely match the originals, and Stone's version of ""Sheep Sheep Dontcha Know the Road,"" (the original is here) might fall into this trap. But in most cases, the ensemble adds welcome variety to the sound: on ""The Devil's Nine Questions"" (original here), a chorus sings the refrain and adds hand-clapping. ""Shenandoah"" (original here), adds a jazz-influenced instrumental jam that allows Stone's banjo and Haas's fiddle to shine. The moving lyrics of ""Before This Time Another Year (original here) are augmented by some beautiful new verses written by O'Brien:Most importantly, a lot of the pieces they've chosen to record aren't commonly covered. ""T-i-m-o-t-h-y,"" a sweet little ballad about courtship that Lomax recorded in St. Eustatius (original here), is given an engaging setting, as is ""Bury Boula For Me,"" a kalenda learned from calypso singer Neville Marcano (original here). ""The Lambs on the Green Hills,"" a mournful version of the song often known as ""The False Bride,"" was learned from one of the great oddities of Lomax's collection, a session of folksongs sung by Robert Graves, the poet, novelist, and mystical scholar who wrote The White Goddess and I, Claudius. (Graves's recording is here.) By arranging these unusual gems, this work expands our awareness of the collection's scope and variety. More importantly, it places new wonders alongside old favorites, for a listening experience that's fresh and fun no matter how familiar you are with Lomax's collection. Watch the album trailer below!Another album with Lomax connections is Can't Hold the Wheel by The New Line. ""Train on the Island,"" which opens the disc, was first recorded commercially in 1927 by both J.P. Nestor and Crockett Ward and his Boys. John Lomax recorded Ward and ""his boys,"" Fields Ward and Wade Ward, ten years later; Alan Lomax and his young intern Pete Seeger recorded them again in 1939; and Alan Lomax visited them again, with a CBS radio crew and a photographer in tow, in 1940. He kept visiting the Wards until 1959, when he finally recorded ""Train on the Island"" (original here). ""The Old Churchyard"" is a hymn that Lomax was among the first to record (original here). The New Line learned the version by Almeda Riddle, whom Lomax was also among the first to record (session here). Lomax never recorded Riddle's version of this song, but he and his sister Bess Lomax Hawes encouraged my teacher Roger Abrahams to do so. Finally, the very first recording of Lead Belly's classic ""Goodnight Irene,"" which closes the disc, was made by John and Alan Lomax.  The Bog Trotters Band, Galax, Virginia, January 1940. (L-R): Doc Davis, with autoharp; Uncle Alex (""Eck"") Dunford with fiddle; Crockett Ward with fiddle; Fields Ward with guitar; Wade Ward with banjo. This photo was taken by a CBS photographer to publicize an ""American School of the Air"" radio show with Alan Lomax. It's a Library of Congress photo in the public domain. The New Line's arrangements of these traditional American folksongs (plus a few others) are unusual for integrating the African mbira into an American string-band context. The mbira (a lamellophone often called a ""thumb piano"") looks deceptively simple but stymies most who try to play it; bandleader Brendan Taaffe, it turns out, is a masterful player who spent time in Zimbabwe learning the technique. The result is that he doesn't stand out in a flashy way, but blends artfully into the ensemble, adding rhythm and harmony. It sounds especially natural with the gourd banjo, which is after all another African import. The idea works remarkably well, giving some great old songs a laid-back vibe with gentle mesmeric depth. If you like old folksongs with unusual acoustic arrangements, this is a treat. Another Lomax Connection: with his mbira, Brendan Taaffe performs a solo rendition of Texas Gladden's version of ""The Devil's Nine Questions,"" which Lomax recorded in 1959. Elizabeth LaPrelle and Anna Roberts-Gevalt. Photo by Lisa Elmaleh. Courtesy of Anna & Elizabeth.Anna & Elizabeth, the duo of Anna Roberts-Gevalt and Elizabeth LaPrelle, has returned with a second CD of (mostly) traditional ballads, hymns, love songs, and fiddle tunes from the Appalachians. Two young women with a lot of projects both together and separately, they're known as a musical duo, as co-hosts of the Floyd Radio Show in Floyd, Virginia, and as two of the foremost ""crankie"" artists in the country. Musically, LaPrelle's powerful vocal delivery is supported Roberts-Gevalt's gentler and more lyrical sound. Between them they also play banjo, fiddle, and guitar. Their approach can be very traditional, as on hymns like "" Long Time Travelin'"" and country classics by the Carter Family and the Stanley Brothers. But they also enjoy avant-garde touches, like the discordant droning underlying their harrowing version of ""Greenwood Sidey,"" a song about infanticide and ghost-babies from Hell. Other highlights include the old Scottish ballad ""Orfeo,"" and ""Father Neptune,"" a song by the mysterious Connie Converse. LaPrelle and Roberts-Gevalt give each song and tune what it needs to thrive. When LaPrelle's tight voice sings ""God sent to Hezekiah a message from on high,"" while Roberts-Gevalt's guitar chops along like a train gathering steam, you know you've found the real thing! What about Lomax? One connection is their rendition of ""Poor Pilgrim of Sorrow,"" which they learned from a 1937 field recording of Kentucky singer Martha Williams made by John Lomax. Another is their whole attitude and approach: by visiting old folks and recording their songs, producing their own art and music, hosting radio, and thinking about what these old songs mean, they're leading a life like Alan Lomax's. By spending time in archives (including Lomax's beloved Library of Congress, where LaPrelle had a fellowship years ago), they're ensuring his work and the work of others like him will remain relevant forever. The names Anna and Elizabeth even have a special resonance: they're also the names of Lomax's daughter and his wife. Thanks to musicians like these two, and the others I've talked about here, Alan Lomax can rest easy and be proud of those he inspired. (Dicslosure: My day job is in the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress, which is the home of Lomax's original field recordings. However, these reviews are my personal opinions only. They don't reflect my government role, and don't constitute an endorsement by the Library.)"
8,TRAVEL,5 Reasons You Should Quit Your Job To Travel Now,"Clayton B. Cornell, ContributorTravel Blogger, Global Citizen, Cleantechie",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/5-reasons-you-should-quit-your-job-to-travel-now_b_6907720.html,"Stop kidding yourself. How long has it been since you said, ""If I just get to X, I will take that trip""?",2015-03-20,2015-03-20-1426838125-7508335-USDeuroexchangerategraphe1426835459563.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-20-1426838125-7508335-USDeuroexchangerategraphe1426835459563-thumb.png,"There are a million great reasons to quit your job to travel the world, but here are five things that matter right now. There's never been a better time to get out and experience the world.#1 The US Dollar-Euro Exchange Rate is at a 10-year best. Source: Xe.comWhile traveling in Europe is the quintessential trip--and much cheaper than most Americans tend to think--the catch has always been the 25-30% 'tax' on travelers coming from the U.S. in the form of the Euro-Dollar exchange rate.But things have changed in the last 6 months, and dollar is now as close to the euro as I've ever seen it. As I write this a dollar is worth about 0.94 euro.That means your USD are going a lot further, not just in Europe but everywhere.But currencies fluctuate, and who knows how long the current trend will last.#2 Air travel may be as cheap as it will ever get. Alright, people say things like this every decade, but I'm not really making predictions about the price of oil here.Check this out: In December I flew from Budapest to Las Vegas to Mexico to San Francisco and back to Budapest over a 6-week period for about $300.This might not be a surprise if you've read how I flew around the world for less than $220 or how my friend Scott booked $30k in airline tickets for $1,000 (punchline: by accruing and using frequent-flyer miles), but the moral of the story is just as relevant today: gas is cheap (oil is down to $51.14 a barrel as I write this) and airline miles will never take you further.Even paying cash you can currently book a last-minute (for tomorrow) round-trip ticket half-way around the world (Budapest to Bangkok) for $600. Whether or not that seems expensive to you, the good news is, analysts are saying the price of airfare will continue to drop in 2015.While the future is impossible to predict, it's hard to imagine flights getting cheaper than they are right now. Add to this the ubiquitous discount airlines that can get you around a region (like Europe or in SE Asia) for as little as $12, and you can get all over the world for next to nothing.Yes, the price of oil will go up again, the dollar will probably lose value, and flights will probably be more expensive in the future.#3 Traveling has definitely never been easier. [Photo: When travel time was advertised as weeks, not hours.]Some people will argue that we already missed the Golden Age: a time before everything was exploited, when travel was harder, there were fewer tourists, and it was easier to get lost.Sure, while I would have loved to join Sir Richard Burton for one of his expeditions, I'll skip the high-percentage chance of death or being carried away from my discoveries by porters because of disease-caused temporary blindness and paralysis.While ridiculous convenience can cheapen the experience of travel, it also means more people can travel. It also brings a huge number of new possibilities for those of us who live and work around the world.Last month on the Budapest metro I booked the following on my iPhone: airfare, accommodation, and tickets to a concert in Amsterdam. It took about 15 minutes. When I arrived in Holland a group of friends and I used Uber to book a private driver to the event, at less than half of the cost of a regular taxi. [That's an all-electric Tesla Model-S Taxi in Amsterdam. WTF?]I can get phone calls at a U.S. number routed to my phone anywhere on earth. I pay no fees to withdraw money anywhere, and ATMs are everywhere. I can work from a hut in Indonesia while using my iPhone as a WiFi hot spot. Airbnb has opened up a whole new class of accommodation options. I've got more books on my 6-ounce kindle than the book shop at the airport. And so on.And just in terms of places to go it feels like more of the world is accessible to travelers and unrestricted by governments, warfare, disease, sanctions, or other issues than ever before.Sure, technology will get even better, but the party might not last forever. Things will probably get more crowded and more expensive, not counting the potential for large catastrophic events that may change the game.It's impossible to predict what will happen in the next 5 years, but in my perspective we're living in a time of incredible prosperity.Don't miss the window while it's open.#4 You've put it off long enough. Stop kidding yourself. How long has it been since you said ""if I just get to X I will take that trip""?As Americans we've been trained to fixate on goals and endpoints as tangible objects, like 'when I have another $10,000 in the bank I'll take that trip.'But most of us have learned by now that the endpoints are illusory, and as soon as we 'arrive' the rules have changed on us. The need for $10,000 becomes $20,000. Something else comes up. Too much time has passed and our interests have changed (or we think we're too old).This is all a normal, expected part of life, and it's only disappointing if we aren't kidding ourselves that someday we'll do something we actually care about.That being said, maybe it's time to play your own game. In the long run, authenticity is more important than money, and if you've been putting off travel all these years it's time to sit down and seriously contemplate what you think is stopping you.My advice: Buy a plane ticket.

9,TRAVEL,5 Reasons You Should Quit Your Job To Travel Now,"Clayton B. Cornell, ContributorTravel Blogger, Global Citizen, Cleantechie",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/5-reasons-you-should-quit-your-job-to-travel-now_b_6907720.html,"Stop kidding yourself. How long has it been since you said, ""If I just get to X, I will take that trip""?",2015-03-20,2015-03-20-1426838209-9418613-hawaiianairlinesspartantraveler_crop1.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-20-1426838209-9418613-hawaiianairlinesspartantraveler_crop1-thumb.jpg,"There are a million great reasons to quit your job to travel the world, but here are five things that matter right now. There's never been a better time to get out and experience the world.#1 The US Dollar-Euro Exchange Rate is at a 10-year best. Source: Xe.comWhile traveling in Europe is the quintessential trip--and much cheaper than most Americans tend to think--the catch has always been the 25-30% 'tax' on travelers coming from the U.S. in the form of the Euro-Dollar exchange rate.But things have changed in the last 6 months, and dollar is now as close to the euro as I've ever seen it. As I write this a dollar is worth about 0.94 euro.That means your USD are going a lot further, not just in Europe but everywhere.But currencies fluctuate, and who knows how long the current trend will last.#2 Air travel may be as cheap as it will ever get. Alright, people say things like this every decade, but I'm not really making predictions about the price of oil here.Check this out: In December I flew from Budapest to Las Vegas to Mexico to San Francisco and back to Budapest over a 6-week period for about $300.This might not be a surprise if you've read how I flew around the world for less than $220 or how my friend Scott booked $30k in airline tickets for $1,000 (punchline: by accruing and using frequent-flyer miles), but the moral of the story is just as relevant today: gas is cheap (oil is down to $51.14 a barrel as I write this) and airline miles will never take you further.Even paying cash you can currently book a last-minute (for tomorrow) round-trip ticket half-way around the world (Budapest to Bangkok) for $600. Whether or not that seems expensive to you, the good news is, analysts are saying the price of airfare will continue to drop in 2015.While the future is impossible to predict, it's hard to imagine flights getting cheaper than they are right now. Add to this the ubiquitous discount airlines that can get you around a region (like Europe or in SE Asia) for as little as $12, and you can get all over the world for next to nothing.Yes, the price of oil will go up again, the dollar will probably lose value, and flights will probably be more expensive in the future.#3 Traveling has definitely never been easier. [Photo: When travel time was advertised as weeks, not hours.]Some people will argue that we already missed the Golden Age: a time before everything was exploited, when travel was harder, there were fewer tourists, and it was easier to get lost.Sure, while I would have loved to join Sir Richard Burton for one of his expeditions, I'll skip the high-percentage chance of death or being carried away from my discoveries by porters because of disease-caused temporary blindness and paralysis.While ridiculous convenience can cheapen the experience of travel, it also means more people can travel. It also brings a huge number of new possibilities for those of us who live and work around the world.Last month on the Budapest metro I booked the following on my iPhone: airfare, accommodation, and tickets to a concert in Amsterdam. It took about 15 minutes. When I arrived in Holland a group of friends and I used Uber to book a private driver to the event, at less than half of the cost of a regular taxi. [That's an all-electric Tesla Model-S Taxi in Amsterdam. WTF?]I can get phone calls at a U.S. number routed to my phone anywhere on earth. I pay no fees to withdraw money anywhere, and ATMs are everywhere. I can work from a hut in Indonesia while using my iPhone as a WiFi hot spot. Airbnb has opened up a whole new class of accommodation options. I've got more books on my 6-ounce kindle than the book shop at the airport. And so on.And just in terms of places to go it feels like more of the world is accessible to travelers and unrestricted by governments, warfare, disease, sanctions, or other issues than ever before.Sure, technology will get even better, but the party might not last forever. Things will probably get more crowded and more expensive, not counting the potential for large catastrophic events that may change the game.It's impossible to predict what will happen in the next 5 years, but in my perspective we're living in a time of incredible prosperity.Don't miss the window while it's open.#4 You've put it off long enough. Stop kidding yourself. How long has it been since you said ""if I just get to X I will take that trip""?As Americans we've been trained to fixate on goals and endpoints as tangible objects, like 'when I have another $10,000 in the bank I'll take that trip.'But most of us have learned by now that the endpoints are illusory, and as soon as we 'arrive' the rules have changed on us. The need for $10,000 becomes $20,000. Something else comes up. Too much time has passed and our interests have changed (or we think we're too old).This is all a normal, expected part of life, and it's only disappointing if we aren't kidding ourselves that someday we'll do something we actually care about.That being said, maybe it's time to play your own game. In the long run, authenticity is more important than money, and if you've been putting off travel all these years it's time to sit down and seriously contemplate what you think is stopping you.My advice: Buy a plane ticket. Make a ""worst case scenario"" disaster plan, sell all your shit, and do something new because:#5 You are too comfortable (and this will only get worse). [On the train in Vietnam. What your friends think you're doing / what you're actually doing.]""Comfort is death."" -- My dad.People comment all the time that traveling ""must get easier for someone who travels so much.""Actually, it gets harder.By definition, real travel is uncomfortable and based on shaking routines up, and while this always has tremendous value it's less and less appealing as a long-term practice.What extensive travel ends up teaching is the importance of a fixed location: every day I stay in one place I get stronger, healthier, smarter, and my business does better.

He's aiming to premiere it in New York City in late 2016.""People will sing along and leave happy,"" Simmons said. ""So many of these songs will reach everybody in the audience. That almost never happens.""Simmons, who won a 2003 Tony for producing ""Russell Simmons Def Poetry Jam,"" said the new musical will have a love story, contain a fight-the-power element and be a ""celebration of hip-hop.""

Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred told The Wall Street Journal Thursday that the league would likely organize an exhibition game on the island sometime in early 2016. The MLB’s efforts to start playing in Cuba come as the two countries work to restore diplomatic relations, which the U.S. severed back in 1961. The Barack Obama administration loosened travel regulations in January, making it easier for athletes to travel to the island to participate in sporting events. “To the extent that we can play a role in helping the United States government effectuate a change in policy, that we’re following their lead and we’re acting in a way that’s consistent with what they want us to do, that’s an honor for us,” Manfred told the Journal. While the MLB is optimistic, Cuban officials say they have yet to enter into negotiations.""That may be their will, but we have not had any conversations,"" Antonio Diaz, a spokesman for Cuba's National Baseball Directorate said, according to Reuters. ""There is no agreement.""Cubans have long excelled at the game, which was first introduced to the island in the 1860s, when Cubans studying abroad in the United States returned with a passion for the game, according to the History channel. The island’s first national league was created in 1878. Several MLB stars, including Yoenis Céspedes, Yasiel Puig and José Abreu, were born and raised on the island and later defected or immigrated to the United States. The last time an MLB team played in Cuba was when the Baltimore Orioles played the island’s national team in 1999 in an exhibition game, according to The New York Times. The Cuban team then played the Orioles in the United States. That 1999 game marked the first time that a major league team played in Cuba since the revolutionary government took over in 1959. Then-President Bill Clinton made the games possible by loosening the restrictions on travel to Cuba enforced through the embargo. But former President George W. Bush, who took office in 2001, strengthened travel restrictions once more. Obama and Cuban head of state Raúl Castro simultaneously announced on Dec. 17 that they would work toward restoring diplomatic relations. Since then, a series of three high-level diplomatic talks have taken place, but the two governments have yet to finalize the details that will allow them to reestablish embassies. "

Canon 1382 in the Code of Canon Law dictates that a bishop who ordains another bishop without papal consent incurs a latae sententiae, or automatic, excommunication. By canon law, Faure, 73, will also incur automatic excommunication for participating in the ceremony.Vatican officials did not respond to The Huffington Post's request for comment on Friday.The excommunication is only the latest bump in the bishop's controversial career. Williamson was previously excommunicated in 1988 for receiving his own unsanctioned consecration from French Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, who founded the Society of St. Pius X. Lefebvre, and three other bishops he ordained on the same day as Williamson, were also excommunicated.The Society of St. Pius X was formed in 1970 in response to what Lefebvre saw as unwanted modernizing reforms introduced by the Second Vatican Council. The society has been called ""ultra-traditionalist"" and has been on tenuous terms with the Catholic Church since the 1988 consecrations. In 2009, Pope Benedict XVI lifted the excommunications in an effort to initiate reconciliation with the Society of St. Pius X. Williamson subsequently caused an uproar, however, when he appeared in a television interview saying he believed no Jews had been killed in gas chambers during the Holocaust.The Society of St. Pius X expelled Williamson in 2012 for criticizing the reconciliation efforts with the Vatican, saying the bishop had failed “to show due respect and obedience to his lawful superiors."""

In 2014, Danielle Lei chose to think outside of the cardboard cookie box and looked to a new market. Lei and her mother sold cookies outside of The Green Cross on President's Day, Mashable reports, employing two really brilliant tactics at once: Find hungry people, and find them on a holiday where they can stuff themselves silly. Lei sold 117 boxes outside of the dispensary within two hours. Her mother said that this was 37 more boxes than she sold during the same time period outside of a grocery store on the following day. The Girl Scouts Organization did not seem to condone this sales tactic, but a business girl's gotta do what a business girl's gotta do. One Scout acquired an untapped group of clientele.  Typical Scouts tend to knock on neighbors doors, host booths in the parking lot of grocery shops and sell at community events. One 10-year-old seller in Minnesota found some previously unsolicited clientele: Ice fishers. Inga Heinecke and her friend Ruby bundled in hooded winter gear and transported their supply by sled. The girls sold 30 boxes on their first expedition because fishermen like snacks, too.  "

What you may not know is that Monsanto and our United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) are among them. That's right: for decades, Monsanto and its enablers inside the USDA have denied the central tenets of evolutionary biology, namely natural selection and adaptation. And this denial of basic science by the company and our government threatens the future viability of American agriculture.Third Grade ScienceLet's start with interrelated concepts of natural selection and adaptation. This is elementary school science. In fact, in Washington D.C. it is part of the basic third grade science curriculum. As we all remember from biology class, when an environment changes, trait variation in a species could allow some in that species to adapt to that new environment and survive. Others will die out. The survivors are then able to reproduce and even thrive under the new environmental conditions. For example, if a drought were to occur, some plants might have traits that allow them to survive while other plants in the same species would perish. The drought-resistant plants then become the ""evolved"" species, and they are able to reproduce in the drought environment. Obvious, you are thinking. But let's explore how Monsanto's top scientists and government regulators would have failed a third grade science class in D.C. and the dire consequences that it is bringing to us all.Biotech's Dirty Little SecretFirst a little background. Since the early 1980s, Monsanto has endlessly hyped genetically engineered (GE) crops they claim could reduce hunger, reduce pesticide use, and survive droughts. In reality, no such ""miracle"" crops exist. No significantly greater yielding crops, no more effective drought resistance crops. And as for the claim of less pesticide use, behind this myth lies the ""dirty little secret"" of agricultural biotechnology. Namely, that GE crops actually add hundreds of millions of pounds of pesticides to our fields and crops, and create greater agrochemical residues on our food. Why? Because around 85 percent of all genetically engineered crops in the United States and around the world have been engineered to withstand massive doses of herbicides, mostly Monsanto's Roundup. Usually, if toxic weed-killing chemicals such as Roundup come into contact with a crop they will destroy it as well as the weeds around it. But Monsanto scientists genetically engineered a cassette of bacterial and viral DNA into plants that allowed them to tolerate these herbicides. So the weeds are killed, but the crops remain. In the United States, more than 50 percent of all our cropland is devoted to GE corn, soy and cotton. They are commodity crops that feed cars, animals in industrial meat production and are used for additives like high fructose corn syrup. Almost none directly feeds people. So rather than feeding the hungry, this technology is about chemical companies selling more chemicals, a lot more chemicals. So as noted, each year 115 million more pounds of Roundup are spread on our farmlands because of these altered crops. Profits versus Science: Science losesIf half of our nation's cropland is doused year after year with a particular herbicide, that is a significant change in the environment. The accompanying problem of adaptation and selection has probably already occurred to you. Wouldn't that massive increase in Roundup use over that huge a portion of our cropland cause some weed populations to develop resistance? Wouldn't weeds with natural resistance thrive in this new environment? Wouldn't these new ""superweeds"" eventually become a major problem for U.S. farmers, overrunning their crops?As government regulators were considering whether to approve these plants in the mid-1990s, they asked Monsanto just that question. No doubt considering the billions they were going to make selling more Roundup, this is a moment when Monsanto's scientists seemed to find it convenient to their bottom line to deny basic evolutionary science. They stated, ""Evolution of weed resistance to glyphosate (Roundup's active ingredient) appears to be an unlikely event."" They also suggested that massive use of Roundup would lead to ""no resistant weeds."" Independent scientists were aghast. They mocked Monsanto's view that Roundup was somehow ""invincible"" from the laws of natural selection, and pointed out that the company's scientists purposely ignored numerous studies that showed there would be weed resistance. But incredibly, despite the strong contrary evidence, the USDA regulators just nodded in science denying agreement with Monsanto.Of course, adaptation and natural selection did take place. As a result, in less than 20 years, more than half of all U.S. farms have some Roundup resistant ""superweeds,"" weeds that now infest 70 million acres of U.S farmland, an area the size of Wyoming. Each year we see major expansion of this ""superweed"" acreage. Texas has gone so far as to declare a state of emergency for cotton farmers. Superweeds are already causing major economic problems for farmers with a current estimate of $1 billion lost in damages to crops so far.Last year in a panel discussion with Robert Fraley, Chief Technology Officer for Monsanto and a founder of these herbicide tolerant crops, I confronted him. How could he and the other Monsanto scientists have claimed that natural selection would not take place? How could they ignore basic evolutionary science and clear contrary evidence? He just shook his head and said ""You're right, weeds have evolved resistance."" But apparently, Monsanto and their government regulators still haven't learned this third grade science lesson. They're denying science once again, and the stakes are even higher.""Agent Orange Crops"" and More Science DenialNow Monsanto and Dow Chemical have received government approval to market new genetically engineered corn, soy and cotton, that are ""stacked"" with engineered DNA that make them resistant to Roundup as well as 2,4-D (one of the chief elements of ""Agent Orange""). Monsanto has also gained approval from the USDA for the same three crops that can tolerate Dicamba. 2,4-D and Dicamba are older, more toxic herbicides than Roundup, and these companies are reverting to them because they have brought us to the point of peak herbicides. They simply don't have any new ones, similar to the current crisis in antibiotics. But won't the weeds simply become resistant to these herbicides as well? Not according to the science deniers at Monsanto and Dow Chemical. Despite predictions that their new crops will add hundreds of millions more pounds of these herbicides each year, they say not to worry. They claim -- as they did 20 years ago -- that natural selection will not happen; that it is extremely unlikely for weeds to survive simultaneous attacks from two or more different herbicides with different methods.Weed scientists have shredded this argument, noting that weeds in the past, through adaption, have done this and will almost certainly do it again. So in a few years we will be overrun with ""superweeds"" that are virtually indestructible by any known chemical. But by then Monsanto and Dow will have made billions selling their chemicals and can leave the ""superweed"" agronomic nightmare for others to solve. Nor will they have to deal with the other nightmares that could possibly occur: increased rates of cancer and diseases like Parkinson's associated with exposure to these herbicides. A Better WayA science-based, and safer, way forward is to abandon this doomed-to-fail chemical arms race against weeds and use ecologically based weed control. There are proven organic and agroecological approaches that emphasize weed management rather than weed eradication, soil building rather than soil supplementing. Crop rotation and cover crops can return productive yields without ridding the land of genetic biodiversity, and could reduce herbicide use by 90 percent.So it's long past due that our government required real and rigorous science when regulating GE crops. It's time for them to say ""no"" to these herbicide-promoting crops, and prevent the looming agronomic disaster they will inevitably bring with them. In the meantime, the next time you read hear about ""GMO science deniers"" -- think of 70 million acres of superweeds; think cancer, Parkinsons and other diseases caused by this growing use of herbicides; think Monsanto and its enablers at the USDA."

Officials are Investigating allegations that two senior Secret Service agents drove a government car into White House security barricades after drinking at a late night party last week. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5c61024000050009802cb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- Marc Ambinder did something Friday that's quite rare among journalists: He admitted to being wrong. Ambinder's piece -- ""How I unfairly maligned two Secret Service agents in Politico Magazine"" -- served as a public apology for an earlier story of Ambinder's that appeared in Politico Magazine this past Sunday. That story was based on an inaccurate report that a pair of agents had ""crashed"" into a White House barricade on March 4 after a late-night party. ""I have no excuse other than that I was basing my opinion on the facts that other news outlets had reported,"" Ambinder wrote Friday for The Week, where he's a contributing editor. ""Because I've long admired the Secret Service, I went off the deep end when I read about the latest incident. I should have slowed down and waited until we knew more.""The Washington Post reported on March 11 that two Secret Service agents, possibly drunk, had crashed into White House barricades and interrupted an investigation of a suspicious package. Several media outlets confirmed that account, which only seemed to grow more chaotic the next day when the Post reported that the pair appeared to have driven over the suspicious package itself. But a less dramatic picture began to surface in the days that followed. On Tuesday, a source who watched surveillance video of the incident told The Huffington Post that the agents' car was moving at only 1 to 2 mph and appeared to deliberately nudge a traffic barrel in order to pass through the White House complex. Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy confirmed the source's account Thursday, telling lawmakers there was ""no crash"" evident in the video. At this point, there is also no evidence the agents were drunk. Ambinder wrote Friday that Politico Magazine stands by his original piece ""and doesn't think an apology is necessary -- but I think I was wrong."" In an email to HuffPost, Ambinder referred questions about why the follow-up didn't run in Politico Magazine to that publication's editors. Politico Magazine editor Garrett Graff told HuffPost he could not discuss conversations with individual writers. In an email, Graff pointed out that Ambinder's original story for Politico now includes a clarification noting that subsequent accounts described the incident as being ""milder"" than originally reported. While the available surveillance video appears to show there was no ""crash,"" lawmakers weren't pleased to learn this week that footage from other angles was taped over after 72 hours, per protocol. And there are still unanswered questions around the incident, including how, if at all, the agents disrupted the group of technicians investigating a suspicious package left outside The White House. Clancy has referred the investigation to the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of the Inspector General."

Indoor sunglasses optional.Did you know you can take a water bottle through security? Or you could even take a tour of the cockpit if you wanted? Here are some tips and strategies for making the most out of your flight experience. Information is power and, in this case, we've got it in spades.10. Decide Whether You Should Check a BagIt's easier to go without checked bags but should you have to, it's hard to even know where or what airline to begin with. Even worse, most airlines hide the cumulative cost of bags after the first checked bag. Hopper has built a handy airline fees calculator that reveals the true cost of flying on any airline. Traveling with two checked bags? Maybe don't purchase that $80 flight on Spirit. Only have a carry-on? Well, that Spirit fare is looking pretty good now.9. ...or You Could Just Gate CheckMost gate agents are willing to gate check your bag for free to free up overhead space if it's an especially full flight (which is almost like every flight). It's a quick way of bypassing the checked bag fee if you don't want to haul your giant bag through a connecting airport, but don't bet the farm on being able to do it every time.8. Beat the Gate Agent When Times Get ToughDon't be at the mercy of your flight if it gets delayed. Certain apps like WorldMate and TripIt offer the ability to search for alternate flight schedules in case something like this happens. If you've really got to get somewhere on the time, this way you can request the gate agent to put you on a specific flight or departure that you want to take and have all the details handy.7. You Can Still Bring That Water BottleLiquids, shmiquids. You can actually still bring that water bottle through security but the catch here is that it has to be empty when you pass through the scanner. There's no law that says you can't refill it at a water fountain or ask the flight attendant to top it off for you during the plane. Besides, no one should go un-hydrated.In general, collapsible water bottles like the Vapur Element or the Platypus PlusBottle are less likely to raise eyebrows from the TSA officers but they're also great to have around because they're extremely portable.6. Try To Get an Entire Row with a FriendIf you want the Holy Grail of seating, try grabbing the aisle and window seat in a row with a friend. With some luck, if the flight's not too full, no one will opt for the middle seat... and if they do, just ask to trade seats. Chances are they won't say no.5. Get Some Passable Sleep with an EyemaskIt's one of the no-brainer tricks in the book but it's amazing how many people forget that an eyemask can work wonders for getting some rest. The biggest impediments to sleeping well -- besides being forced in an upright position all the time -- are noise and light. The quality of your sleep can improve drastically once you begin stowing a pair away in your carry on. In fact, there's a whole set of things you can bring that makes a substantial experience in improving your overall comfort level on a flight.4. Be Nice and SmilePeople respond to kindness -- and can you imagine how many irate customers and travelers airline people have to deal with day in and day out? It's not easy being in customer service and a little courtesy and appreciation goes a long way. Because when something doesn't work out in your favor, you want someone on the other side standing in your corner to bat for you.3. You Might Not Need to Pay for Wi-FiThough you can opt in for Wi-Fi, certain apps have been proven to have limited functionality without needing to pay for the in-flight Wi-Fi. (You still need to be connected, however.) The list, though not expansive, mostly pertains to Google apps. But don't expect miracles and for the apps to work as well as they normally would.2. There Are Still Free Things on a PlaneIt just might not be the peanuts anymore. But you can ask for a range of things that include medicines, wingpins and some basic babysitting if you just need a minute or two for yourself away from the little ones. How does a tour of the cockpit sound to you?1. Let Hopper's New Mobile App Do Your Flight Shopping for YouOK, so we're a little biased. But with the average traveler visiting 38 websites before booking a trip, purchasing a flight is clearly a pain point for a lot of travelers. What Hopper's app does is automate that comparison shopping experience by finding travelers the absolute best deals on flights and offering useful tips and predictions on which way the price is going to move. If the price isn't great, we'll tell you and we'll watch the flight for you. Then we'll notify you when the prices reach their lowest point.In 95% of cases, Hopper can save travelers money on their flights (up to 40%), and a cheaper flight is definitely a better flight experience.Liked this article?

(Photo by Chelsea Lauren/WireImage)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4a13b2100000001c8140f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"To Pimp a Butterfly has me excited to make music. It reminds me how important music is to my everyday existence. It's an inspiring record, an incendiary lyrical tour de force and a stylistic mashup that's elevated the G-Funk era with a set of more organic twists. Kendrick's cabinet runs deep: although the producer/collaborator count runs close to two dozen, the album's sonic expansiveness is cohesive, dynamic and jammed with live instrumentation. Intros and outros snake through song forms, paving a road both perfect for low-riders or your MTA of choice. When was the last time you heard clarinet on a hip-hop record? This is it.If a little Googling is correct, that's Pedro Castro, a clarinetist with four YouTube videos and a solid writeup in the Pasadena City College Courier. But his performance on ""Institutionalized"" is not as anonymous; rather it's part of the deep musical fabric that Kendrick, a decidedly hands-on foreman, has curated on his third full-length. To Pimp a Butterfly paints with colors that resemble, if I may use the C word, classic hip-hop -- the album feels more like De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest and 2Pac, all of whom made records that duck and weave in their bounce. While the latter's brilliance obviously inspired the Kendrick behind 2011's Section.80, the emcee of this week's surprise release is more worldly, part of which owes to the feeling that he's become a true bandleader.From the jump, we get a mood beyond that of 2012's good kid, m.A.A.d city -- the last time we heard George Clinton like this was on ""Synthesizer,"" from Outkast's 1998 masterpiece Aquemini. The Atlanta duo remains a major influence throughout, and their perpetual collaborations with production team Organized Noize mirrors the setup at Kendrick's label, Top Dawg Entertainment, which employees an in-house production crew that's all over To Pimp a Butterfly. Neal Pogue, who engineered Aquemini said of those sessions, ""It was almost like a Motown, that's what we had. Or like a Stax Records thing. That's what I loved about it. It brought back that whole feeling of making records. It was organic."" That feeling pervades To Pimp a Butterfly, which owes much to Thundercat's bass playing, more nuanced than ever, and Bilal's vocals. The Bay Area singer has been making genre-smashing R&B for years, and his style surely informed this album.Organic is nothing new in hip-hop, a genre we often imagine being made on machines from choppy chunks of music that already exists, but in 1993 a little band called The Roots independently put out Organix, which changed my world. The idea that such a powerful genre, one that saw a concentration of incredible music that year, could be created with live instruments connected hip-hop to the spheres of jazz, funk and rock, which seemed to live disparately in my musical mind. The career trajectory of that little band is just as inspiring - they've pushed envelopes on every stage, including that of latenight television, not failing to get political when necessary.Of course, hip-hop has seen live instrumentation elsewhere, but it wasn't billed as the work of a band (e.g. Ron Carter, on the bass). The same arrangement is true on To Pimp a Butterfly, which combines the LA languidity of The Pharcyde with Dr. Dre's aggressive bounce, so emblematic of the West Coast. But there's also a spirituality, one learned from the coastal feuds of the '90s that took hip-hop's co-rulers, one that pays homage to the past yet looks squarely towards the future. It feels at times like a Soulquarians opus or a J Dilla joint -- collective musicality and compromise triumph over ego, themes that echo in Kendrick's words.""Egos kill. Not only you but everybody around you,"" he said at 24. ""The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it. Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it in order to protect itself form this mad city... the butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness and the beauty inside the caterpillar,"" says present day Kendrick, sounding as thoughtful as ever.I like thoughtfulness in my music. I like to hear collaboration, which is why I love jazz, or, if I've read my Nicholas Payton*, Black American Music (#BAM -- do I need the hashtag?). ""From a genealogical standpoint,"" says Payton, ""It becomes very clear to a knowledgable listener whose music has been informed by the Black tradition and whose hasn't. That will never happen with jazz because it's a bastardized tradition that has no foundation outside of a commercial structure. It's not a communal language, it's a capitalist one."" Hip-hop has certainly been speaking that language, and it's refreshing to hear something serious that stops putting materialism on a pedestal. Although flashiness and braggadocio have been essential to the art form since the beginning, the past decade has been overly concerned with material gain.Or, as Kendrick notes in ""Hood Politics"": Critics want to mention that they miss when hip hop was rappin' / Motherfucker if you did, then Killer Mike'd be platinum / Y'all priorities are fucked up, put energy in wrong shit / Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since.There's hints of an A Love Supreme vibe here, and in a way some of the work is devotional. No surprise from the man who said, ""All I am is just a vessel, doing his [God's] work."" That attitude, notes pianist Ethan Iverson, ""seeks ecstasy through communion, not just with God but with every one in the immediate vicinity. You don't practice it. You plug into the ancestors and your reason for living and it's there.""Also no surprise that multi-instrumentalist Terrace Martin, who produced much of the album, compared Kendrick to ""Coltrane, man. Mild-mannered, soft-spoken, always practicing. New harmonic approaches, different techniques, falls in -- there's not a mistake on that stage with him. If the turntables fall, he gon' -- like, it's weird. It's like water.""**""I think that's why a lot of motherfuckers fuck with me,"" the rapper said, ""Because the shit I put out on my music is me not knowing everything. It's me trying to figure out the world just like you."" Although he's gained confidence in the past three years, his allowance for musical sensitivity, nuance and harmonic richness gives the album weight, which makes for a statement not without its warts. The inclusion of the live version of ""i"" is a conscious illustration of this (Kendrick is certainly striving for Black Thought status in his ability to front a band) and his willingness to perform an untitled song on national television that was written the day before ""cause we didn't want to do nothing that's already been done"" - these things explain why To Pimp a Butterfly was streamed almost 10 million times in one day.I'm on board with Kendrick. I would've loved an Elmer Bernstein sample somewhere, but I'll live.*Payton collaborators from Virginia band Butcher Brown are all over the record. **In that same interview, Martin mentions Snarky Puppy, whose drummer Robert ""Sput"" Searight can be found on the album."

Now, as a physician-scientist who has been involved in basic gene therapy research and the development of clinical trials since the 1980s, it is exciting to witness gene therapy making a comeback.  1. What is gene therapy? Genes provide the blueprints that instruct cells to make the various proteins needed for all normal bodily functions. If a critical gene is mutated or absent, disease may ensue. In gene therapy, we use a vehicle, called a vector, usually a specially modified virus, to deliver the correct gene to the patient. Think of this as the viral vector acting like an unmanned drone delivering a package to fix, for example, the broken furnace in your house.This is possible only in conditions for which we know which gene causes the disease and can also deliver the correct gene into the cells that cause the disease. With some diseases, we collect the patient's stem cells, add the gene-carrying vector in the laboratory, and then give the cells back to the patient. In other diseases, we deliver the vector directly into the bloodstream or affected organ. Candidates for gene therapy trials include patients with diseases lacking effective standard therapies, as well as patients who are not good candidates for standard therapies - for example, patients who lack matched sibling donors for the conventional hematopoietic (blood) stem cell transplants used to treat some conditions.2. What problems dramatically slowed progress in gene therapy after it debuted with fanfare more than two decades ago. Why is it experiencing a comeback now? Two main issues needed to be overcome. The first was the transition from animal models to humans. In the early days, optimism was very high because we were curing disease in mice, but when we applied the technology to humans it wasn't always up to the task. In particular, we found the efficiency with which our vectors could deliver their payload to the correct cell (like the correct address in the example above) was much less in humans than in mice. The second problem was the occurrence of serious adverse events related to the technology itself. In 1999, Jesse Gelsinger, who had been treated at the University of Pennsylvania with gene therapy for ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, a genetic disease of the liver, died from the vector's toxicity to the liver, into which it had been delivered. Other gene therapy trials in Europe, which used a different approach to treat X-linked severe combined immune deficiency (SCID-X1 or ""bubble boy"" disease), one quarter of patients developed leukemia directly due to the vector itself. Likewise, leukemia developed in several patients in trials using a similar viral vector to treat Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome, a disease that affects immunity and decreases the body's ability to form blood clots, and chronic granulomatous disease, an immune deficiency disorder that affects the body's ability to fight fungal and bacterial infections. In all of these cases, the vector used to deliver the gene therapy inadvertently ""turned on"" tumor-promoting genes known as oncogenes. Gene therapy is now experiencing a comeback because both the safety and technological efficiency of the vector systems have improved. For instance, scientists, including some here at Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, have identified and removed the viral sequences from the vector that activated the oncogenes that appeared to trigger the leukemia seen in the earlier trials. In a recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine, my colleagues and I reported that the new vector appears to be both effective and safe. Researchers have also developed new viral vector systems that significantly reduce the type of toxicities associated with the death of Jesse Gelsinger. In addition, as scientists' basic understanding of stem cell biology has improved over the past two decades, so has the ability to safely and effectively manipulate hematopoietic stem cells outside the bone marrow and prepare them to accept the gene transfer.3. What diseases have been in clinical trials for gene therapy? Proof-of-principle successes in the application of gene therapy targeting hematopoietic stem cells has been shown in multiple severe, fatal genetic diseases that affect children, including the disorders noted above as well as childhood cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy and metachromatic leukodystrophy, two degenerative neurological disorders. There is currently a great deal of attention and excitement about T-cell immunotherapy for leukemia patients - using gene therapy to reeducate the immune system's T cells to be more effective against antigens (foreign substances) expressed in tumor cells. The trials have produced strikingly positive results in both adults and children with treatment-resistant leukemia. In addition, gene therapy using a different viral vector system that targets non-stem cells has been reported successful in treating Leber's congenital amaurosis (a retinal disease that causes blindness) and hemophilia B. Clinical trials in one genetic form of SCID -- adenosine deaminase deficiency or ADA SCID -- proved so successful that some insurance companies have recognized it to be as effective as the enzyme replacement therapy typically used to treat the disease and are beginning to cover treatment with gene therapy.4. What are we learning and what's next? We're learning which diseases you can potentially cure with gene therapy. We're starting to learn the parameters by which you can predict that someone with a given disease can or cannot be cured. We're starting to learn the dosages of cells and genes that are needed to be effective. We're also learning which vector technologies or platforms work best for particular diseases. These are things that you can't study in an animal model. You have to study in humans. I think we'll soon learn that for some diseases gene therapy may be even better than conventional stem cell transplantation, the standard of care for several diseases now in gene therapy trials, because we can actually express the missing gene at higher levels than in normal donor cells. This may lead to more effective treatment. We're still early in the field, so even in diseases for which the outcomes from gene therapy appear as good as standard therapies, until we have more experience with gene therapy we will continue to rely on standard therapies."

Before Michael Jordan was like Mike and Usain Bolted in front of all other sprinters, Edwin showed what it meant to dominate a sport. Edwin basically ruled the 400 meter hurdles from the mid-1970s through much of the 1980s. This included gold medals at the 1976 Montreal and 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games and the 1983 Helsinki and 1987 Rome World Championships. In 1984, he was ABC's Wide World of Sports Athlete of the Year and Sports Illustrated's Sportsman of the Year (along with gymnast Mary Lou Retton) in 1984. ESPN ranked Edwin number 47 in their SportCentury 50 Greatest North American Athletes, right above tennis legend Pete Sampras.True to form, Edwin remains ahead of the curve in his work as chairman of the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation USA, trying to encourage children to engage in more physical activity. Doing so faces its own set of hurdles that Edwin and his colleagues are trying to overcome. Michelle Wong of our Global Obesity Prevention Center (GOPC) recently caught up with Edwin at the 2015 Aspen Institute's Project Play Summit to talk about his efforts:Michelle: What have you been doing since you retired from track and field?  Edwin: I've been doing quite a few things: I went back to grad school to get my MBA, then I worked for a Wall Street company as a money manager for about five years. I've been highly involved in the non-profit entities, from the United States Olympic Foundation, Olympic committees, and sports organizations such as Laureus. I've been with them for quite a few years now. Also, I've worked with the US Anti-Doping Agency as the Chairman of the Board. Michelle: Are children and adults getting enough physical activity? If not, why not? Edwin: I think that the policies have changed. When I was in grade school and high school, we used to have gym class -- very organized physical education classes. Two days a week you had to dress up and you had to complete a whole roster of exercises: basketball, volleyball, baseball, calisthenics, running. We had to do and pass tests for all these different subjects -- everyone did everything. If you couldn't make a basket from the free-throw line, they would move you up to the half-circle, and you would shoot until you made it. It was very well organized, for a full period and a half or perhaps two periods, twice a week. I think that this is gone now. Michelle: What are some of the benefits of physical activity of which people may not be aware? Edwin: For kids, they may do better in school; they may develop a more appropriate appetite. Physical activity is an opportunity to teach kids about nutrition and help them develop better nutritional habits. A lot of kids grow up in households where they eat fast food all the time -- these kids may be latchkey kids, and their parents aren't home when they get home. Their parents may be working two or three jobs, and might not come home until 10 or 11 at night. Physical activity can help, as well as things like tutoring, for kids who are in these situations. We support a project with kids in the Bronx. Most of the kids' parents are working multiple jobs. No one is home when they get home. No one is there to make sure they do homework. If they're lucky, they have people who have graduated from high school, but probably no one has ever graduated from college to give them some guidance. Physical activity presents an opportunity to be in a positive environment and using the sporting aspect to impart some important details that may be missing in their life. That's where we come in at Laureus -- this is exactly what we support. Michelle: Have the trends in physical activity changed from before and if so how and why? Edwin: Just less of it! Education budget has decreased. Governments have been trying to cut costs. In urban areas, there has been a decay of the urban tax base and real estate values. This has had a lot to do with the demise of physical education and education in the school system. They just can't afford it and the tax base is low. Also, there seems to be a lack of political will to make these changes. Michelle: What changes do you think need to be made? What are the biggest priorities? Edwin: Personally, I think -- and I know it may not be possible -- that they just need to dramatically change the amount of physical education that kids get. They need to restructure the diets, lunches at school, nutrition at school, and the physical education requirements. It just needs to be radically restructured. We know a lot more now than I did when I was growing up. We didn't have lunch at school when I was growing up until I got to high school. We walked to school. However, today, kids take public transportation, school buses, or the parents take them. The whole dynamic of living in the United States has changed. Michelle: What strides have been made over the past several years? Edwin: There's been a lot of thinking about it. A lot of research has been done, but the political will and use of political capital to make significant change has not been as good as it could be. There is a lot more research that needs to be done out there. Michelle: What role can other top athletes play to encourage physical activity? Edwin: A lot of top athletes simply don't have the time. Those of us at Laureus do have the time because we're all retired. Athletes can help to build awareness. Not just representing a retail manufacturer or fast food organization that pays them a lot of money to help them sell their products."
31,HEALTHY LIVING,Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients Need Help,"Barbara Jacoby, ContributorAward winning blogger, two time Breast Cancer Survivor, Patien...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/metastatic-breast-cancer_b_6836818.html,"If you ever meet a woman dealing with metastatic breast cancer, you will know what real courage is.",2015-03-19,2015-03-10-1425969794-9503020-FemalePatientGurney.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-10-1425969794-9503020-FemalePatientGurney-thumb.jpg,"Breast cancer in the breast is not life-threatening. However, when breast cancer travels outside of the breast (usually to the brain, liver, lungs or bones), it becomes metastatic or Stage IV. Approximately 5 percent of newly-diagnosed breast cancer cases are metastatic or Stage IV (interchangeable designations) but even more startling is that approximately 30 percent of early stage breast cancer will become Stage IV. So with more than one-third of all breast cancer patients having to deal with metastatic breast cancer, why don't we hear more about it, and why is it not receiving more attention?If you ever meet a woman dealing with metastatic breast cancer, you will know what real courage is. These women go through regimens of all sorts of chemotherapy, most often with a combination of chemo drugs. If a certain combo works, it may work for a couple of weeks or months and then stop working altogether. A new combo is then tried, which may not work at all or perhaps may stop the spread of the cancer and perhaps even diminish it for an undetermined amount of time. The side effects of these chemicals can be so devastating to the sufferers both internally and externally. And sadly, most members of this community have to look to fellow sufferers for help and answers of what can be done to lessen the pain and other effects. That leads me to understand that we don't know nearly enough about this cancer when the sufferers have to rely on each other for answers.Nearly 40,000 women in the U.S. alone will be diagnosed with advanced breast cancer this year. While those of us who were fortunate enough to have our breast cancer treated and removed before hopefully it spread outside of the breast, those women whose breast cancer has spread know that at this moment, there is no cure for metastatic breast cancer. The effects of treatment are costly on all fronts. Nearly two-thirds of personal bankruptcy filings in the United States are due to medical debt, according to the nonprofit National Patient Advocate Foundation. Families run up overwhelming medical bills treating a seriously ill loved one, and although I can't determine at this moment exactly how many are due to metastatic breast cancer, knowing the extremely high cost of the drugs and the devastation wreaked upon those who are being treated that can no longer work or take care of their families, we can get a pretty good idea of the financial costs to each person.This doesn't even begin to address the emotional and psychological treatment that should be afforded to these patients. Living a life plagued with the uncertainty of whether treatment can be found to help, wondering for how long it will work, suffering pain physically, financially and emotionally, etc. demands a recognition of the need of this additional treatment. And what about those who have a doctor who really doesn't care and dismisses a patient with the words like, ""We can't do anything else for you; you have three months to live.""We are humans, and taking on this fight for life alone makes these people superhuman, and that is before they even begin treatment. In addition to the treatments are finding the ways to get to and from chemo treatment appointments, regular doctors' appointments and testing locations. How do we expect them to manage all of the day to day expectations like child care, making a living, providing food, clothing, shelter and education for other family members? And what about the emotional and psychological needs of the spouses, partners, children, relatives, other family members and friends who will be providing for the patient and her needs?We need to do more. We need to allocate more money and resources to research and education. We know that the researchers are out there looking for answers but often do not have the funds necessary to pursue certain theories or do the clinical trials necessary to determine the success of a certain treatment. We have lots of efforts throughout this country raising monies to find the cure and every single donation made and all of the funds raised are needed for so many programs to help those in need. But we need the research to make the long-term difference. We can keep putting Band-Aids on the problems but sooner than later, we need to eliminate the disease entirely. I do believe that we have the talent and the minds and the dedication of those needed to find the answers. Now we need to give them the means to do so."

You can scuba, surf, windsurf, or grab a snorkel and dive in just offshore for an impromptu plunge among the island's friendly, approachable turtles. The sailing, as you would expect, is world-class, the fishing, too. The waters brim with sea creatures hauled ashore daily. The pleasure of reeling in a prime specimen is matched only by the enjoyment you get from pulling up a chair at a seaside restaurant and sampling the day's catch. While Barbados attracts a high-end crowd, choose your location wisely and you can enjoy all the Caribbean pleasures you can handle on a surprisingly modest budget.

To some though, they are one in the same. Teja Yenamandra is the CEO Gun.io. They are a technology company that connects high quality freelance developers to well paying projects. He has used the hip-hip ethos to take his company from an idea to one that generates tens of millions of dollars in revenue each year. As a big fan of hip hop growing up he felt that starting his company seemed like starting out as a new artist in the hip-hop industry. In each step of the company he found parallels to the music industry, and used them to make decisions about how to run the company. I had a chance to sit down with him this past week to see how he has built his company up brick by brick using the mentality of a hip hop mogul.According to Teja, starting a new company is the same as being a new artist because you're both building a business. In technology, your company is the business you're building, and in music you are the business yourself. You are using your Minimum Viable Product, either your technology or your music as the basis of your new company. On starting out his company he said,""When my partners and I started the company, we knew that it was going to be hard. We were a company no one had heard of so it was going to be an uphill battle, but I always remembered the words of my favorite artists. These were people who came from nothing, and rose to heights of success many people can only dream of. When difficulties arose, I always remembered that challenges were speed bumps, not roadblocks. Building up a company from the ground up is a difficult process. That applies whether you are an artist or starting a company. You are in a place where no one knows who you are, and your resources are lower than established brands. Also, finding ways to get creative press is a necessity, and that is just the beginning of it. Teja always analyzed the careers of different artists. He even said his best inspirations in work came from listening to hip hop music. Especially artists like Meek Mill, Rick Ross, and Jadakiss.Technology companies these days are in a craze for raising money from venture capitalists. It seems like you always hear news about some new company that raised countless millions. It is always a group of twenty something's that a venture capitalist gave millions to for their fledgling idea. As Teja's company started to generate actual money, venture capitalists started to reach out. He took some of the meetings, but the team soon realized it was not what they wanted again drawing from his understanding of hip-hop. The music industry has changed over the past decade. It used to be that to record music, you needed expensive studio equipment. There was also no way to distribute your music without signing to a major music label. This meant getting onto the radio was impossible as well. The Internet changed all that though. It ushered in an era of independent acts and labels that were successful without the old business model. Some examples include the label Funk Volume, Rostrum Records, and people like Macklemore. They have achieved heights of unimaginable success without the backing of any label. These people just found a way to add value to their listeners, connect with them, and built a business around that. Teja saw that was the way to go about his company as well.When thinking about whether it was a good idea taking funds from venture capitalists, he gave a long hard look at the music industry. He realized getting funding in music and technology companies were similar. Major industry music labels and venture capitalists both provided the same thing. Some of those include access to a salary and other expenses to grow the company. There are also intangible resources like the connections to important people. He gave it a good deal of thought, and after discussing with his cofounders realized raising money was something he did not want to do. They realized not only was it unnecessary, it was detrimental to idea of independent success they desired. He wanted to stay independent like so many in the music industry are doing now.Teja wanted to bootstrap his company. In other words, find a way to create a self-sustaining business that did not need outside funds. That is exactly what Gun.io has been able to achieve. Starting in 2012 with nothing but an idea, they found a way to add value to their users, and monetize successfully on it. The Internet has ushered in an era that has completely changed how jobs work. No longer is it necessary to go into the same office everyday with a 9-to-5 job. People can run businesses or work from the comfort of their own home, make good money, and maintain the freedom that many can not. That is what Gun.io allows for their users. They even created a term they are popularizing as their company continues to ascent, ""digital nomad"". It means being someone who roams city-to-city claiming his or her bounty using only your computer. Hip-hop started as a small idea in the Bronx in the late 1970's. The influence it has had is more far reaching than anyone could have ever imagined. It was an outlet of creative expression for kids in parks. Now the ethos it created is building multimillion-dollar companies out of thin air. And it is doing it in industries that have no connection to music itself. Gun.io and Teja are powerful examples of what positive things hip-hop can bring about, and it is for sure that we will hear about examples like this in the future."

Their captivity is part of a plan by the Zimbabwe government to capture and sell dozens, perhaps hundreds, of young elephants to unidentified foreign buyers.Sources in Zimbabwe say the elephants, estimated to be about four years old, will be exported imminently.Elephant behavioral expert Joyce Poole, who examined the photographs, says that some of the young elephants in the images appear to be stressed and alarmed. Of one shot of a female calf, Poole wrote in an email: ""She is clearly frightened by what she sees, smells, hears on the other side of the bars.""Zimbabwe's plan to send the young elephants overseas has drawn criticism from many wildlife conservationists. They see the government's plan as a cynical and cruel move against an animal that is being slaughtered at alarming rates for its ivory, especially to satisfy demand in China. Poachers killed 100,000 elephants from 2010 to 2012.Kelly Landen, the program manager for Elephants Without Borders--a Botswana-based organization that monitors elephants' cross-border migrations in Angola, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe--wrote in an email that considering ""present global efforts, campaigns and support to combat poaching, illegal wildlife trafficking and animal welfare, the world has remained largely silent about this, an issue that must be the most notorious case of wildlife abuse in recent history.""Zimbabwe has cast its plan--which is legal under CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora--as a lawful effort to cash in on a natural resource. A January 20 paper by the Ministry of Environment, Water and Climate, titled ""Zimbabwe's Position on Live Sales of Elephants and Other Wildlife Species,"" elucidates the country's new plan to aggressively cull, capture and export elephants (Read: Zimbabwe's The Herald: ""Live Elephant Sales Better Than Culling."") Zimbabwe officials say the elephants will be sold for $40,000 to $60,000 each.Last week, Saviour Kasukuwere, Zimbabwe's Minister of Environment, Water and Climate, reportedly said that the funds raised by exporting the elephants will help provide salaries to the country's wildlife rangers, who otherwise would themselves turn to poaching elephants for money.Biologist Mike Chase, the founder of Elephants Without Borders, opposes Zimbabwe's approach: ""Capturing wild elephant calves is counterintuitive to raising funds for conservation. It is a gross violation of animal welfare and might repel would-be visitors to a national park that has an exemplary ecotourism reputation.""The new photographs of the captured elephants in Hwange were obtained recently by a U.S. security firm that is orchestrating an undercover information-gathering operation about Zimbabwe's elephant export program. The images were provided to National Geographic by the security firm. The firm's president has requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.Wendie Wendt, the former executive director of the Big Life Foundation, a conservation organization in East Africa, and former vice president and fundraising director for U.S. Friends of the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, has been the driving force behind the operation. Wendt engaged the help of the security firm in January and has been trying to learn when and how the elephants will be shipped out of Zimbabwe and where they might end up.The security firm Wendt hired is working closely with a primary source in Zimbabwe. National Geographic has been in contact with this source through the firm. The president of the firm says the source is trustworthy, based on previous work with the source.According to the firm's president, the sources providing information to him about Zimbabwe's elephant sales program are doing so with fear of reprisal or even death.The 'Pinched Look' of Orphaned ElephantsPoole, the co-founder of ElephantVoices, a research and advocacy organization based in Kenya, has been speaking out against the capture of baby elephants since the 1990s, when she went to court in South Africa as an expert witness in a case that involved the capture of 30 babies in Botswana.Poole says the young captives in Zimbabwe appear to be about four years old.""For the most part,"" she wrote in an email, the elephants ""do not look thin in their bodies, but they do look thin in their faces. Their faces have the pinched look that we recognize in young elephants who have lost their mothers or have been captured. I have seen this look many times in wild elephants who have been orphaned.""The source in Zimbabwe reports that the capture facility in Hwange National Park is being monitored by 15 national park guards equipped with AK-47s, radios, flashlights, and handcuffs. The property is also under surveillance by hidden cameras.""Some guards,"" the source wrote in an email ""spy on other guards as well, being paid $5,000 a month and some allowances to keep mum on activities.""According to the source, some elephants are being held in groups of two in a separate facility closer to Victoria Falls, near the border with Zambia. The source also says that at least one elephant there has died in a fight with another elephant.The destinations of the young elephants--as well as their buyers--are still a mystery.This story is the fourth in a series on the captured Zimbabwe elephants.

Their captivity is part of a plan by the Zimbabwe government to capture and sell dozens, perhaps hundreds, of young elephants to unidentified foreign buyers.Sources in Zimbabwe say the elephants, estimated to be about four years old, will be exported imminently.Elephant behavioral expert Joyce Poole, who examined the photographs, says that some of the young elephants in the images appear to be stressed and alarmed. Of one shot of a female calf, Poole wrote in an email: ""She is clearly frightened by what she sees, smells, hears on the other side of the bars.""Zimbabwe's plan to send the young elephants overseas has drawn criticism from many wildlife conservationists. They see the government's plan as a cynical and cruel move against an animal that is being slaughtered at alarming rates for its ivory, especially to satisfy demand in China. Poachers killed 100,000 elephants from 2010 to 2012.Kelly Landen, the program manager for Elephants Without Borders--a Botswana-based organization that monitors elephants' cross-border migrations in Angola, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe--wrote in an email that considering ""present global efforts, campaigns and support to combat poaching, illegal wildlife trafficking and animal welfare, the world has remained largely silent about this, an issue that must be the most notorious case of wildlife abuse in recent history.""Zimbabwe has cast its plan--which is legal under CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora--as a lawful effort to cash in on a natural resource. A January 20 paper by the Ministry of Environment, Water and Climate, titled ""Zimbabwe's Position on Live Sales of Elephants and Other Wildlife Species,"" elucidates the country's new plan to aggressively cull, capture and export elephants (Read: Zimbabwe's The Herald: ""Live Elephant Sales Better Than Culling."") Zimbabwe officials say the elephants will be sold for $40,000 to $60,000 each.Last week, Saviour Kasukuwere, Zimbabwe's Minister of Environment, Water and Climate, reportedly said that the funds raised by exporting the elephants will help provide salaries to the country's wildlife rangers, who otherwise would themselves turn to poaching elephants for money.Biologist Mike Chase, the founder of Elephants Without Borders, opposes Zimbabwe's approach: ""Capturing wild elephant calves is counterintuitive to raising funds for conservation. It is a gross violation of animal welfare and might repel would-be visitors to a national park that has an exemplary ecotourism reputation.""The new photographs of the captured elephants in Hwange were obtained recently by a U.S. security firm that is orchestrating an undercover information-gathering operation about Zimbabwe's elephant export program. The images were provided to National Geographic by the security firm. The firm's president has requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.Wendie Wendt, the former executive director of the Big Life Foundation, a conservation organization in East Africa, and former vice president and fundraising director for U.S. Friends of the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, has been the driving force behind the operation. Wendt engaged the help of the security firm in January and has been trying to learn when and how the elephants will be shipped out of Zimbabwe and where they might end up.The security firm Wendt hired is working closely with a primary source in Zimbabwe. National Geographic has been in contact with this source through the firm. The president of the firm says the source is trustworthy, based on previous work with the source.According to the firm's president, the sources providing information to him about Zimbabwe's elephant sales program are doing so with fear of reprisal or even death.The 'Pinched Look' of Orphaned ElephantsPoole, the co-founder of ElephantVoices, a research and advocacy organization based in Kenya, has been speaking out against the capture of baby elephants since the 1990s, when she went to court in South Africa as an expert witness in a case that involved the capture of 30 babies in Botswana.Poole says the young captives in Zimbabwe appear to be about four years old.""For the most part,"" she wrote in an email, the elephants ""do not look thin in their bodies, but they do look thin in their faces. Their faces have the pinched look that we recognize in young elephants who have lost their mothers or have been captured. I have seen this look many times in wild elephants who have been orphaned.""The source in Zimbabwe reports that the capture facility in Hwange National Park is being monitored by 15 national park guards equipped with AK-47s, radios, flashlights, and handcuffs. The property is also under surveillance by hidden cameras.""Some guards,"" the source wrote in an email ""spy on other guards as well, being paid $5,000 a month and some allowances to keep mum on activities.""According to the source, some elephants are being held in groups of two in a separate facility closer to Victoria Falls, near the border with Zambia. The source also says that at least one elephant there has died in a fight with another elephant.The destinations of the young elephants--as well as their buyers--are still a mystery.This story is the fourth in a series on the captured Zimbabwe elephants.

Those challenging the authenticity of this ancient relic point to carbon dating tests done at three independent labs in 1988 that dated samples of its cloth to AD 1260-1390, which coincides with the first appearance of the shroud in France in the 1350s. Believers in the shroud's authenticity have questioned the authenticity of the tests.What many do not know is that we do in fact have an unquestionably authentic burial shroud from a tomb in Jerusalem that has been carbon dated to the 1st century. Any consideration of the ""Shroud of Turin"" should begin with a comparison of what we know rather than what we might want to believe. How this shroud was discovered, tested, analyzed, and with what results is a fascinating chapter in the history of recent Jerusalem archaeology in which I was privileged to play a small but ""accidental"" part. Many of the most interesting archaeological discoveries are accidental. There seems to be an unwritten axiom, those who seek never find, and those who find were not seeking.It was June 14, 2000. Archaeologist Shimon Gibson and I were hiking just south of the Old City with five of our students, showing them some of the abandoned 1st century tombs of that area. We suddenly and unexpectedly came upon a freshly robbed entrance to one of the many 1st century tombs that are in that area--many of them still sealed. We could see broken ossuaries, scattered bones, and displaced soil where the invaders had removed the blocking stone to the tomb and tunneled inside.The rest is now history. This amazing three-level tomb, cut into bedrock, contained in a lower niche or kokh, the partially preserved skeletal remains of a male with a badly deteriorated cloth burial shroud still visible! We could hardly believe our eyes.We had the cloth dated at the University of Arizona C-14 lab. Douglas Donahue, the same scholar who tested the Shroud of Turin, dated our cloth--it came out 1st century CE. Although 1st century cloth has been found at Masada and in caves in the Judean Desert, nothing of this sort had ever been found in Jerusalem. Apparently that niche, sealed with a blocking stone, had a geological fissure that kept water from seeping in and rotting the material.The tomb had any number of interesting features. DNA studies were done on all the individuals represented in the tomb--the first time, so far as we know, that this had even been done in an ancient Jerusalem tomb of this period. Textile analysis was done on the cloth--it turned out to be a mixture of linen and wool, not woven together but layered with a separate head piece. It had a distinctive 1st century weave--in contrast to the Shroud of Turin. Perhaps the most surprising find was that our shrouded individual, a male, had Hanson's disease--leprosy--the 1st documented case from the ancient world in this region, see more on this aspect of the discovery here. In 2009 a complete scientific study of the tomb appeared in the on-line journal PLoS One, and is available for download here.One of the more fascinating finds in this tomb, one that has not received much attention, was the preservation of a sample of Jewish male hair. The hair was lice-free, and trimmed or cut evenly, probably indicating that the family buried in this tomb practiced good hygiene and grooming. The length of the hair was medium to short, averaging 3-4 inches. The color was reddish.The Tomb of the Shroud continues to offer more surprises. We recently noticed that the mitDNA tests of two of the individuals in this tomb match the polymorphisms of two individuals in the Jesus family tomb--namely skeletal materials taken from both the Yeshua and the Mariamene ossuaries. What the implications of this might be, and whether there is any possible relationship between these two families, remains to be explored."
