Then, to top it off, Carson admitted he would have preferred another candidate.The retired neurosurgeon offered the strange reassurance on Monday during an interview with Steve Malzberg of Newsmax TV. Carson also said he would serve in an ""advisory capacity"" in a potential Trump administration. Carson raised eyebrows last week when he made the endorsement, given that Trump had previously called him ""pathological"" and compared him to a child molester. But on Monday, Carson said Trump would ""surround himself with very good people."" And if Trump was a failure, Carson said don't worry -- we only have to get through four years:""Even if Donald Trump turns out not to be such a great president, which I don't think is the case, I think he's going to surround himself with really good people, but even if he didn't, we're only looking at four years as opposed to multiple generations and perhaps the loss of the American dream forever.""Carson admitted that backing Trump was more about what was ""practical"" than what was ""preferred."" ""I have to look at what is practical. I didn't see a path for (John) Kasich, who I like, or for (Marco) Rubio, who I like,"" Carson said. He added that unless there was a ""miraculous change,"" Cruz couldn't win independent and Democratic voters.""So I have to look at what is practical and what is going to save this country and the American dream for the next generation,"" Carson said.

6,POLITICS,EPA Official Says 'False Allegations' Forced Her Resignation Over Flint Water Crisis,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/susan-hedman-flint-water-crisis_us_56e81159e4b0b25c918335c8,"Susan Hedman says ""there wasn't time"" for a fuller explanation of her actions before now.",2016-03-15,House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform ranking member Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) and Chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) at a hearing in February. The committee is now holding hearings on the Flint water crisis.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Environmental Protection Agency official who resigned in the wake of the Flint water crisis blamed ""false allegations"" for her downfall.In testimony before a congressional committee on Tuesday, Susan Hedman said stories in The Huffington Post and other outlets misrepresented her actions as the EPA administrator for the midwest region. ""By the third week of January,"" she said in prepared remarks, ""I was widely portrayed in the media as someone who 'sat on the sidelines during the crisis' and 'downplayed concerns raised by an EPA scientist about lead in the water.'""An EPA scientist named Miguel Del Toral wrote an alarming memo in June 2015 warning that Flint's failure to treat its drinking water correctly had resulted in high lead levels in the city's water. Asked about the memo by Flint's mayor at the time, Dayne Walling, Hedman said it was a ""preliminary draft report that should not have been released outside the agency."" The mayor subsequently said the report's author didn't speak for the agency. State officials claimed the memo had been the work of a ""rogue employee.""After that, the EPA said little about the alarming report. State officials didn't tell Flint residents to stop drinking the water until last October, after a local pediatrician reported that Flint kids had elevated lead levels in their blood. In a January interview, Hedman told HuffPost the EPA stayed quiet about the memo because it contained identifying information about a private citizen whose children had been exposed to lead. ""It seemed the best course of action for us at the time was not to talk about the report per se,"" she said. In her testimony, Hedman repeated essentially the same thing she said in January, saying she had demanded that state officials issue a private apology to Del Toral for the ""rogue employee"" comment.""There wasn’t time for these explanations in January, in the wake of all the emergency declarations,"" she said. ""Flint residents had lost trust in governmental institutions -- and the false allegations about me gave the people of Flint less reason to trust EPA."" That said, Hedman acknowledged her resignation wasn't solely prompted by the purported false allegations.""That was one reason for my resignation, but there was another: Quite simply, this tragedy happened on my watch,"" she said.Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House oversight committee, said in his opening remarks Tuesday that Hedman had dismissed lead concerns and that she ""rightfully"" resigned.Marc Edwards, a Virginia Tech civil engineering professor who helped expose high lead levels in Flint as well as Hedman's emails downplaying the June memo that warned about them, joined Hedman at the witness table -- and said she deserved blame for the crisis.""She allowed Flint children to be harmed,"" Edwards said. At the end of the hearing, HuffPost asked Walling, Flint's former mayor, whether it was fair to say Hedman's July email had been an effort to downplay lead fears raised in Del Toral's report.""The communication was pretty straightforward and clear,"" he said.This story has been updated to include comment from Walling.

The Kalamazoo County Prosecuting Attorney's Office declined to release the documents when asked on Monday. Dalton's attorney, Eusebio Solis, could not immediately be reached to comment.Dalton, 45, told police that when he would press a button on his phone screen, the horned cow head of a devil would appear and give him an assignment that he said would ""literally take over"" his body, WZZM reported.""When I logged onto site (the Uber app), it started making me feel like a puppet,"" Dalton told police during an interview, according to WZZM.The broadcaster reported that Dalton told his wife during the night of the shooting spree that she would not be able to go to work and their children would not be able to go to school, and that if she turned on the news, she would know why.Dalton is charged with shooting eight people, killing six of them, over a five-hour period on Feb. 20 in between driving customers for the Uber car service in Kalamazoo, which is about 150 miles west of Detroit. Police said last month that Dalton admitted to the shootings.Prosecutors said earlier this month that a judge granted a request by Dalton's attorney for a competency exam.Kalamazoo County Prosecuting Attorney Jeffrey Getting said weighing a person's competency to stand trial had no bearing on the person's criminal responsibility for a crime and that the move was not to determine whether Dalton was legally insane.He faces 16 charges, including six of murder that can bring life in prison."

12,PARENTS,New Study Shows Just How Dangerous It Is To NOT Vaccinate,Catherine Pearson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-study-shows-just-how-dangerous-it-is-to-not-vaccinate_us_56e70e45e4b065e2e3d6d5a5,A significant percent of people affected by recent measles outbreaks weren't vaccinated -- by choice.,2016-03-15,A new study shows that more than half of measles cases in recent outbreaks were among people who were unvaccinated.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56e70fea1e000087007041f9.jpeg?cache=PinmJ0j1vM&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Measles -- a disease that was completely eliminated in the United States 15 years ago -- has captured national attention recently, thanks to outbreaks among unvaccinated travelers who have contracted the disease abroad. At the same time, anti-vaccination sentiments have found footing among some parents worried over unfounded safety concerns. Now, a new study shows just how closely the two phenomena are intertwined.More than half of reported measles cases in recent outbreaks in the U.S. were among unvaccinated individuals -- most of whom were intentionally unvaccinated for philosophical, rather than medical, reasons. In a third of the cases, researchers did not have enough information about the person's vaccination history to tell if they'd been immunized. A similar pattern held true for individuals who contracted pertussis, or whooping cough, another vaccine-preventable disease that hit its low point in this country in the late 1970s.While previous studies have examined how anti-vaccination sentiments may contribute to localized outbreaks, Dr. Varun Phadke, a fellow in the division of infectious diseases with the Emory University School of Medicine and an author on the new investigation, told The Huffington Post that this latest investigation is much broader.""Our study adds to this work by looking at the contribution of vaccine refusal to outbreaks of measles and pertussis in the U.S,"" he said.And that contribution, Phadke and his colleagues found, is significant.In the study, published in JAMA on Tuesday, the researchers analyzed 18 published reports on measles outbreaks in the United States since the country declared it eliminated in 2000. Outbreaks since that time have generally been caused by visitors bringing the disease from overseas, and have grown in recent years, from 63 cases in 2010, to 667 in 2014. In 2015, there were 189 documented cases, many linked to the much-publicized California outbreak that began at a Disney theme park, though those numbers are not yet final. Overall, the researchers considered more than 1,400 measles cases in their new study, 57 percent of which were in unvaccinated people. (Though measles is generally considered a childhood condition, and many of the cases were young children, there were cases in individuals as old as 84.)In instances where the researchers had detailed information about why individuals who contracted measles had not been vaccinated, 71 percent cited non-medical reasons, like religious restrictions or philosophical arguments. That, Phadke said, caught his team's attention.""It is not that surprising that unvaccinated, and therefore non-immune, individuals comprised a substantial proportion of the measles cases in our review,"" he said. ""However, it was notable to us that most of the unvaccinated individuals who developed measles were intentionally unvaccinated.""Fortunately, measles vaccination rates in this country remain relatively high, at about 92 percent of young children. But there is significant geographic variability in vaccination rates, and many states allow for religious and philosophical exemptions. As for whooping cough, the researchers found that the five largest recent statewide outbreaks included a significant portion of unvaccinated individuals, or people who had not received the full, recommended dose on the recommended timeline -- many for non-medical reasons. But several outbreaks did occur in areas where vaccination rates were high, suggesting that waning immunity may also be at play.Taken as a whole, the study provides a clear message to public health officials about the importance of promoting vaccination in children, and spreading information about vaccine safety.For parents, the message is also clear.""Measles is a highly, highly contagious disease, and there's a tremendous chance of your child being infected if they haven't been protected through immunization,"" said Dr. Carol J. Baker, executive director of the Center for Vaccine Awareness and Research at Texas Children’s Hospital, who did not work on the new study.Because it has been eliminated, parents in this country do not remember how bad measles can be, she said, adding that it leads to symptoms such as high fever and red, painful eyes that are extremely sensitive to light. It can also lead to complications, like pneumonia, and even death in extreme cases. Some children cannot get the vaccine, because they have health problems, like cancer, that compromise their immune system, or because they are too young. In that case, Baker said, they depend on others around them to be immunized to ensure their own safety, an idea known as herd immunity.

Bernie Sanders' message in this Democratic primary -- ""The issue of wealth and income inequality is the great moral issue of our time,"" his campaign website states -- you might assume that he's doing well in places where the economy is faring poorly. An analysis by The Huffington Post using state unemployment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the opposite is actually happening.In states with high unemployment that have held primaries and caucuses this year, Sanders has received a very low percentage of the vote. In states with below-average unemployment, the Vermont senator has done well.Here's how Democratic voting breaks down in the earlier states. Anything to the right of the center on this chart is a win for Hillary Clinton. The farther right, the larger percentage of the vote she won. Anything to the left is a Sanders win. The higher unemployment is, the better Clinton did.The reason for this counterintuitive result may be race. While the overall unemployment rate is 4.9 percent, the unemployment rate for blacks in this country is 8.8 percent. So it's not surprising that states with high unemployment typically have higher numbers of minorities. And minority voters, particularly African-American voters, overwhelmingly support Clinton. Despite the improving national economy, the black unemployment rate still remains above 10 percent in seven states -- Alabama, California, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Three of those states have voted so far. Clinton won Alabama and Louisiana in landslides.She narrowly lost Michigan to Sanders. Though it has the second-highest black unemployment rate in the country at 12.4 percent, Michigan also has fewer African-Americans as a proportion of its population than most states in the South.""The data clearly tells a story that is consistent with what we've seen with Clinton having a higher percentage of black support than Sanders,"" said Valerie Wilson, director of the liberal Economic Policy Institute's program on race, ethnicity and the economy. ""Whether that support is necessarily driven by economics or unemployment, it's not clear,"" she said.Indeed, the chart below shows that among the early voting states, Clinton has generally done better in states with higher percentages of minority voters. Conversely, in states with lower percentages of minority voters, Sanders tended to win bigger. A key point to note is that this pattern seems to be almost entirely about the black vote. When HuffPost isolated specific minority groups, we found barely any correlation between the percentage of Hispanic voters and either candidate's margin of victory (and there wasn't a high enough percentage of Asians in the populations of any of these states to give us good data). Thus, the relationship between a high number of minority voters and a Clinton win is based almost entirely on the choices of African-Americans. This underlines something we already knew: The black vote is essential to Clinton's campaign.The question it raises is why Sanders' economic message isn't resonating with those who might benefit from his progressive policies most.Natalie Jackson contributed to this report."

16,TECH,This Device Lets You Test The Air Pollution In Your House,Casey Williams,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/libraries-lending-air-pollution-sensors_us_56e8173ee4b0b25c9183384a,"And it's free, if you have a library card.",2016-03-15,"Fow now, the Speck air quality monitors are available at public libraries in just one city: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56e84fe81e0000c600710425.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The air inside our homes might not be as fresh as we think. Tiny, invisible pollutants from wood smoke, household cleaners, building materials and other everyday items can put people at risk for asthma, heart disease and more. For people who can't afford expensive indoor air quality monitors, detecting these particles is next to impossible. But researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have developed a new in-home sensor, called Speck, and plan to make it available to people virtually for free.The researchers want to place these Speck monitors in 100 libraries across the country. People would be able to check out a device -- just like they'd check out a book -- and use it to measure air quality in their home. ""There's a lot of debate ... about outdoor air quality, but we don’t have a direct ability to control outdoor air,"" Illah Nourbakhsh, professor of robotics atCarnegie Mellon told The Huffington Post on Tuesday. ""We wanted to empower people to see these invisible particulates [in the home].""Carnegie Mellon researchers, along with Nourbakhsh's company, Airviz, developed the Speck air quality monitor several years ago. Speck uses machine learning to ensure the data it collects is accurate and free of noise, according to Nourbakhsh.The device displays data, along with a description of the air quality level, on a screen. Since it's small, users can carry it into different parts of the house to check how the air quality differs, running mini experiments to uncover sources of air pollution.""You can put it in the dining room for a couple of days, or put it in a bedroom and review overnight how was the air quality while the infant was sleeping,"" Nourbakhsh said. Researchers initially hoped Speck could help people who don't traditionally have access to information about their home's air quality. But at around $150 per device, Nourbakhsh said, the sensors are still too expensive for many people with low incomes -- people who, as a group, tend to suffer the worst effects of air pollution. Putting the Speck in public libraries is a way to get the device in the hands of people who couldn't otherwise afford them. Researchers ran a pilot test of this idea last year, putting Speck devices in 16 branches of the public library system in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, home ofCarnegie Mellon and a former steel town with a history of grappling with air pollution.The initial experiment was a success, said Sara Longo, operations manager at Airviz. ""We've reached over 400 people just in the last few months,"" Longo told HuffPost. ""Every time we go to take photos of an actual Speck, we can't because they’re checked out."" As the program prepares to expand, researchers are still deciding where to send the next batch of devices and are accepting applications from interested libraries. They will put three Speck devices in each of the 100 libraries they select. ""There are many ways tech can make life better, but it needs to do that equitably,"" Nourbakhsh said. ""Libraries have become places for creating more equity in society.""Letting people check out monitors -- as opposed to conducting routine tests in people's homes -- also allows users take control of their own health. If they discover that their air is polluted, they have to decide what additional steps to take to address the problem. ""We want people to really become their own experimentalists, because they know their lives best,"" Nourbakhsh said. ""The last we want to do is to tell you what to do.""The Huffington Post is on Amazon Echo!

17,BUSINESS,Etsy's New Parental Leave Policy Is Basically Perfect,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/etsy-parental-leave_us_56e70667e4b0860f99d9de0c,Six months paid time off for all new parents sounds like a dream.,2016-03-15,Etsy's headquarters in the Dumbo neighborhood of Brooklyn.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56e70762150000ad000b1fb4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Etsy just increased the amount of parental leave it offers. Starting April 1, all workers at the Brooklyn-based company known for selling hipster-precious, hand-crafted goods will be able to take 26 weeks off after the arrival of a child via birth or adoption. That’s a big increase from the company's old policy, and follows examples set by a bunch of other tech companies that are racing to improve benefits as the war for talent continues. But what truly makes Etsy’s announcement notable? It's gender neutral. Men and women at the 800-person company will be eligible for six months leave and -- this is key -- Etsy will no longer give more time off to ""primary"" caregivers, a falsely neutral designation that companies effectively only apply to heterosexual women.Previously, Etsy gave ""primary"" caregivers 12 paid weeks off, and ""secondary"" parents five paid weeks.""It was playing out in a gendered way,"" Juliet Gorman, Etsy’s director of culture and engagement, told The Huffington Post.""Male employees read the policy and thought, 'I must only be eligible for secondary,'"" she said, adding that there's no established definition of what constitutes a primary or secondary parent. The company is following on the heels of Netflix, Spotify and Facebook, which now offer men and women equal paid time off. The United States has no paid leave policy, but does guarantee 12 weeks of unpaid leave regardless of gender to some new parents.Gorman pointed out that most millennials are raising their kids in dual-income households where the expectation is that both parents share responsibilities. Designating one of those parents the primary caregiver seemed like a ""dated concept,"" she said.Although she didn’t know how many Etsy workers fall into the millennial age bracket, Gorman said the company adheres to a ""millennial ethic,"" which apparently means it has a progressive bent and is concerned about the well-being of its workers. Etsy also offers such benefits as six-week sabbaticals and paid time off to volunteer.""Etsy, regardless of age, is a very kind of plugged-in, ear-to-the ground, socially progressive company,"" she said.Of course, we don't know how Etsy's new policy will play out in real life. At Facebook, for example, new fathers still reportedly take about half the time off that's offered to them.""In many places the idea of a man taking time off at all is stigmatized. For a man to say he’s a primary caregiver, it’s downright impossible,"" said Josh Levs, author of All In, a book that looks at how fathers are treated in the workplace.Primary and secondary parent designations are basically just ""coded language"" that reinforces traditional gender stereotypes, Levs said. Using a policy based on these designations is harmful is a couple of ways. First, it puts women at a disadvantage at work, as colleagues and supervisors tend to either consciously or unconsciously expect them to stop prioritizing their jobs after the arrival of a child. This typically means that new mothers aren't promoted as much, or aren't asked to take on extra responsibilities like traveling. Indeed, one study found that women’s salaries decrease with every new baby they have. Men, on the other hand, see their incomes rise when they become fathers. However, they’re put on unequal footing at home, deprived of key bonding time with their children and the ability to provide support to their coparent. Men who take leave are less likely to have partners who suffer from depression, one study found.A couple of years ago, Etsy CEO Chad Dickerson tweeted about taking a five-week paternity leave and encouraged other dads to follow suit.Oh, and giving men and women different amounts of time off for caregiving -- beyond the time it takes a birthmother to heal from childbirth -- is considered discriminatory, said Peter Romer-Friedman, a Washington-based civil rights lawyer.""Policies that give disproportionate amounts of parental leave are vulnerable to legal attack under sex discrimination laws,"" he said.Levs knows this better than anyone. When he was working at CNN a few years ago, he tried to use the 10 weeks of parental leave his parent company Time Warner offered, but was told he wasn’t eligible. Men could get the 10 weeks if they adopted a child with their partner or used a surrogate, but fathers whose partners gave birth could only get two weeks paid time off. Ultimately, Levs filed a complaint against the company and Time Warner changed its rules.Still, plenty of other firms hold fast to the ""primary"" caretaker concept, including Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Adobe.When Levs asked Goldman if a heterosexual man with a wife who gives birth to a child would ever be eligible for paid leave, the company declined to comment. When HuffPost asked about this again recently, a Goldman spokeswoman said she didn’t have anything to add."

""I took the opportunity to recommend to him that no matter who may be triggering these violent, uh, expressions or conflict that we've seen at some of these rallies, it might be a good idea to condemn that and discourage it, no matter what the source of it is.""In recent weeks, Trump has encouraged his supporters to rough up protesters at his rallies, and volunteered to pay the legal fees of those who are arrested for assaulting protesters.The top Republican in the Senate declined to say how Trump responded to his advice. But a McConnell aide said the senator's use of the word ""might"" was merely a figure of speech, and that he firmly advised Trump to condemn the violence.McConnell also opted not to answer a question about what it says about Trump's temperament that the billionaire had to be reminded to reject violence. ""One of the things I thought you guys had learned,"" McConnell told reporters, ""is that I'm pretty good at not answering questions I don't want to answer."" McConnell is one of the most powerful Republicans so far to criticize, even if only mildly, Trump's increasingly brazen attempts to rile up his crowds and turn them loose on protesters.Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) told reporters after McConnell's press conference that the Republican caucus would be open to having Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and other candidates speak at the weekly GOP luncheon. He clarified that they would welcome Trump as well.Asked about McConnell's advice to Trump, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said, ""That's really big, isn't it? Why didn't they start worrying about this when they helped create the problem we have with the man himself?"" Reid was referring to the idea that Republican politicians created a fertile environment for a candidate like Trump by ratcheting up their anti-Obama and obstructionist rhetoric in recent years.""It's nice McConnell said something publicly, but it should have started a long time ago,"" Reid added. Laura Barron-Lopez and Jen Bendery contributed reporting.Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."
