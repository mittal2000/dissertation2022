1,POLITICS,Grassroots Dems Love Bernie Sanders.

That's why The Huffington Post has been reporting on a different kind of survey, focusing on the people who are tuning in: the party activists who hold local office, work on campaigns or make significant volunteer commitments. Their opinions shouldn't be considered a prediction of who'll end up winning, but they do provide a better snapshot of where the campaigns stand right now.Unlike the grassroots Republican activists, who are still making up their minds, their Democratic counterparts are mostly decided about the 2016 primary. Nearly three-quarters of those surveyed say they already have a good idea whom they'll vote for. As of early July, that's mainly former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who has a commanding lead among her party's faithful. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has rapidly emerged as Clinton's most serious rival.The Democratic activists surveyed are significantly more liberal than the party as a whole -- exactly the kind of people who've rallied around Sanders as the de facto alternative to Clinton. But most of the activists see Clinton as the Democrats' only viable option for winning the presidency.Very few remain undecided at this stage or favor a candidate other than Clinton or Sanders.Although the Republican activists surveyed by HuffPost tend to resemble the GOP as a whole, the Democratic activists surveyed -- those who have run for or held office, served as party officials, worked on campaigns, or volunteered their time or money before elections -- look very different from the much larger pool of Democratic voters. The vast majority (83 percent) are white, 78 percent describe themselves as liberal, and 6 in 10 have college degrees. The Democratic rank-and-file, on the other hand, is roughly 60 percent white. Only about half describe themselves as liberal, and fewer than half have college degrees.Like their Republican counterparts, Democratic activists are highly attentive to politics. Nearly all (85 percent) say they follow news about government and public affairs ""most of the time,"" compared to just 39 percent of all adult Democrats surveyed in recent Economist/YouGov polling.These differences between the activists and other Democrats extend beyond demographics, political labels and levels of attention, covering nearly every issue of consequence in the national political debate. Close to 90 percent of the activists, for example, favor gay marriage, legal abortion, greater regulation of financial markets and an expansion of the health care law. Ninety-four percent say that the U.S. economic system ""unfairly favors powerful interests."" Although a majority of Democrats as a whole share the same positions (on recent YouGov surveys that asked identical questions), their support for these progressive planks registers significantly lower. In other words, the Democratic activists should be the perfect base of support for Sanders, a candidate calling for a “political revolution” to combat income inequality and champion progressive causes. Yet even with these voters, Clinton is the favorite.Even among the most liberal of the activists -- the 38 percent who describe their politics as ""very liberal"" -- Sanders runs just a few percentage points ahead (49 to 44 percent). Clinton leads among all other Democratic activists by a 2-to-1 margin (60 to 29 percent).  If Sanders can only manage to eke out an edge of a few points among the most liberal Democrats, he faces far greater problems with the overall Democratic electorate, which includes a far larger share of the minority voters with whom he's often struggled to connect. The activist survey included just 83 non-white respondents, but they broke overwhelmingly for Clinton over Sanders (67 to 17 percent), with just a quarter saying they are looking for an alternative to Clinton.That said, the Vermont senator has experienced a remarkable ascent. Virtually all of the activists (85 percent) rate him favorably -- a level of popularity nearly as high as those of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren (86 percent), Hillary Clinton (89 percent) or her husband, former President Bill Clinton (90 percent).Sanders' fans are also unusually ardent in their regard for him. Nearly two-thirds of the activists give Sanders a very favorable rating, compared to 50 percent for Hillary Clinton. Sanders' rating makes him more intensely popular among his party's grassroots than any of the Republican candidates are among the GOP's core voters.So why does Sanders still trail? His biggest problem is viability. Although nearly 9 out of 10 activists see Clinton as able to win the nomination and the general election, just under half see Sanders as able to win the nomination and only 36 percent think he can triumph in November.Even some of his supporters have reservations. Twenty-nine percent of those who call Sanders their top choice still don't think he could win in November. By contrast, just 4 percent of Clinton's backers express similar doubts about her.This is a judgment about more than Clinton's campaign machinery or fundraising advantage. Just 56 of the activists say Sanders would be ""acceptable to most Democrats,"" compared to 84 percent who say the same about Clinton.But the second and perhaps more significant challenge to the Sanders candidacy is Clinton's broad appeal to the activist wing of the Democratic Party. A whopping 90 percent of the activists surveyed say they would be at least satisfied if Clinton were the 2016 nominee, with 58 percent, including more than a quarter of Sanders' current backers, saying they could be enthusiastic about her nomination. Only about a third of the activists say they would prefer to see someone who's not Clinton chosen as the party's nominee. Their reticence is largely focused on her politics -- 49 percent who'd prefer another nominee say they have concerns about her positions on issues, while just 22 percent cite concerns about her character. Another 9 percent worry that she isn't electable. Yet even those who'd rather see a different candidate win don't tend to be deeply opposed to her candidacy. Just 5 percent of the activists say they could never support Clinton, and just 6 percent say they would be angry if she were nominated.If this presents an uphill battle for Sanders, it's a nearly insurmountable challenge for Clinton's other rivals in the party. Taken together, the rest of the Democratic field -- including former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb -- represent the first choice of less than 10 percent of the activists surveyed.These other candidates aren't exactly unpopular -- few Democrats say that they'd be angry to see Chafee, O'Malley or Webb as their nominee or that they'd be unwilling to support any of them in the general election. But most activists view that as exceedingly unlikely to happen. Fewer than 1 in 10 think that anyone besides Clinton or Sanders is capable of winning either the nomination or the presidency.With months still to go before anyone casts a primary ballot or votes in a caucus, it's premature to write off any candidate's chances.

But that's not typically the case for the 23,000 children who",2015-07-28,<p>Participants in Homes for the Homeless' summer camp program taking part in swimming lessons.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55b7fa3c1d000030001430e4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For most kids, summer is a time of year to look forward to.But that's not typically the case for the 23,000 children who live in New York City’s homeless shelter system. With children out of school, shelters and temporary housing alike often become more crowded and stressful and the kids themselves are left with little to do during the day.But Homes for the Homeless, a New York-based nonprofit, offers an alternative for over 500 homeless children each summer. Since 1989, the organization has brought hundreds of children each summer for three 16-day sleepaway camp sessions on the grounds of Harriman State Park in upstate New York. For many participants, the experience marks their first time traveling outside of the city.At HFH’s Camps Lanowa and Wakonda, the children -- who range in age from 6 to 13 -- are assigned a bunk in a cabin and take part in a range of activities, including swimming, volleyball, beadwork, dancing, drama, fishing, singing and hiking. In addition, activities like journal writing and bug hunting have an educational component disguised as summer fun.The impact of the campers taking part in these activities in a bucolic setting can be huge for both the participants themselves as well as their families, Sarah Herold, then-program coordinator, explained to the Queens Chronicle in a 2013 interview.“It provides kids with a break from shelter life and helps combat summer learning loss,” Herold told the Chronicle. “We give the kid a break by sending them into the natural world and it gives the parents a reprieve because living in a shelter can be a stressful situation. For them to know that their child is in a safe space really allows them to relax.”A break is much needed for these youth. According to the National Center on Family Homelessness, children experiencing homelessness go hungry at twice the rate of other kids and have three times the rate of emotional and behavioral problems when compared to their non-homeless peers. By age 12, an estimated 83 percent of homeless children have witnessed at least one serious violent event.An additional component of the camps is the “Teen Leader” program, which allows past campers to return to the camp to help counselors keep a watchful eye on campers and act as a mentor to them.The camp is free of charge to children whose families are receiving public assistance and priority is given to children currently living in a shelter or those who have done so within the past year. Children in foster care can also take part.In addition to the camp, Homes for the Homeless operates three family shelters -- two in the Bronx and one in Queens -- and offers educational and job-training programs.Homes for the Homeless isn't the only organization offering such a program to the city's homeless youth. New York's Coalition for the Homeless has run Camp Homeward Bound in Harriman State Park since 1984.According to the latest report issued by the NCFH, the number of homeless children nationwide in the U.S. has surged to an all-time high in recent years. Earlier this year, New York City’s homeless population also reached a record high."

It has been keeping track of the pro-Confederate flag events in the past month and found that 132 have occurred since the Charleston shooting, with another 29 in the works.Dylann Roof, a racist who admired symbols of the Confederacy, is facing federal hate crime charges for allegedly targeting the nine worshippers at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, a historic black church in downtown Charleston, because of their race. The shooting reignited a debate over the Confederate battle flag, leading South Carolina government officials to finally remove it from the state capitol grounds this month. The Alabama governor also took down the Confederate-era flags on the grounds of the capitol in Montgomery.But there has been a backlash as well. On July 18, the Ku Klux Klan held a rally at the South Carolina statehouse, protesting the removal of the Confederate flag.A few days earlier, a group of protesters with Confederate flags gathered near an Oklahoma high school to greet President Barack Obama, who was visiting to give a speech about expanding economic opportunity.And on Saturday, a group of white individuals in pickup trucks with Confederate flags clashed with partygoers at a celebration for a black child's birthday.The Southern Poverty Law Center has also called on Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia and Mississippi to stop honoring Confederate leaders with official holidays."

""The average citizen goes about their life seven days a week enjoying it, everybody working together, eating in restaurants together and socializing,"" he told The Washington Post in a story published Monday. ""I just don’t think it exists.""""Black lives matter to Glenn Smith,"" added Smith, who likes to refer to himself in the third person.On July 10, a police officer pulled over Bland, 28, for a minor traffic violation (not signaling a lane change). The situation escalated after the officer ordered Bland to put out her cigarette, and he then arrested her for allegedly assaulting him. The stop was captured on video: Three days later, Bland was found dead, hanged in her jail cell in Hempstead, Texas. Officials have called her death a suicide, but protesters have demanded answers about how it could have happened. Just because restaurants are no longer segregated doesn't mean there's no more racism in Waller County. In 2007, the predominantly black Hempstead City Council voted to suspend Smith, who was then Hempstead police chief, for two weeks without pay following allegations of racism against him and four other white officers. Waller County is still one of 28 counties in the country monitored by the Justice Department under the Voting Rights Act, and Hempstead still has separate cemeteries for white and black residents. It also had a disproportionate number of lynchings in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 2007, DeWayne Charleston, then a Waller County judge, told a black funeral home to help bury an unidentified white woman. There was an outcry over his order, and activists said officials intervened to make sure the white woman wouldn't be buried next to black people.""This is the most racist county in the state of Texas, which is probably one of the most racist states in the country,"" Charleston told The Guardian.Read more on Sandra Bland at the links below:"

Jeff Merkley (D-OR) and Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) introduced the sweeping, comprehensive Equality Act.The bill would amend the 1964 Civil Rights Act to include protections for LGBT people in housing, employment, public accommodations, education and other areas, without the kind of broad religious exemption that caused much concern with the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), which passed the Senate in 2013 but didn't get a vote in the GOP-controlled House.But not all LGBT activists, at least before the introduction of the Equality Act, were on board with this approach. Heather Cronk of the direct action group Get Equal, had told the Washington Blade her group was “not sure” about amending the Civil Rights Act. Cronk, in addition to believing the Equality Act doesn’t go far enough (for example, she pointed to the detention and deportation of LGBT immigrants, something not addressed in the bill), told the Blade that she was concerned that the Civil Rights Act could be opened up to hostile amendments, which made this strategy “way past dangerous.”That’s actually a claim that has been made in years past, and, ironically, more so by those considered part of the gay political establishment. As far back as 15 years ago, when activists and progressive Democrats like former New Jersey senator, Bill Bradley, suggested amending the Civil Rights Act to include gays, openly gay Congressman Barney Frank expressed fierce opposition, calling it ""very controversial.""Merkley explained he and his colleagues’ approach to the Equality Act, which was backed by major LGBT and other civil rights groups and corporations like Apple and Dow Chemical, and responded in depth to the concerns about it in an interview with me on SiriusXM Progress.“We looked at this question very, very carefully,” he said, explaining first the reasoning as to why the Civil Rights Act is the best place to include protections for LGBT people. “The first point that we considered was the application of legal precedent. And by utilizing the Civil Rights Act, there is a whole body of law that has been adjudicated and that helps understand exactly what terms mean and what the results would be. So, that’s very valuable. The second thing we looked at was really about the frame of taking on discrimination in a comprehensive fashion. Does it make sense to have over here in one box, if you will, gender and race and ethnicity, and then put in a separate box LGBT issues? And it just didn’t feel right to have that separation when essentially we’re talking about the same fundamental issues in all of these areas, of housing and accommodations and financial transactions and so forth.”Merkley responded specifically to the claim that expanding the Civil Rights Act would open it up to hostile amendments and thus made the approach dangerous.“There are already bills out there that seek to attack the ’64 Civil Rights Act, and they can be done on any amendment on any bill,” he explained. “We don’t have a restriction to a single topic here in the U.S. Senate or House. Amendments don’t have to fit the general title of the bill. And so, those attacks are going to come regardless. If you do a separate bill that’s just as much of an opportunity to change the Civil Rights Act as a bill that is [attached to] the Civll Rights Act itself. So after talking to many different individuals about this, we decided that it just wasn’t any greater risk in utilizing the Civil Rights Act, and there were fundamental reasons of law and, really, of fairness, to utilize it…Over 25 members of the Congressional Black Caucus are original co-sponsors of this bill and I think that does help address that point powerfully.”"

Figuring this out now doesn't mean that you shouldn't be fluid and open to change, but it helps to at least start with some objective in mind. I'm not going to try to turn you into some high-maintenance, hyper-picky naysayer. I just want to help you stop kissing frogs and start finding your man. So let's set some standards and start learning to reject those guys who fall so far below the bar that they make inmates look good. This is all about beginning with the end in mind (as Dr. Stephen Covey would say) and not bothering with a hound dog when what you really want is someone with a pedigree -- or at the very least, someone who's housebroken and won't gnaw on the furniture!Look, I understand the appeal of the hound dog. I've heard that ol' boys' song and dance many times before. You have to understand: The qualities that initially attract you to a man are not necessarily the ones that will make him a good long-term partner. If you are genuinely looking to settle down and you still don't understand that the guy chasing you may not be the person you want raising your children or being there for you through thick and thin, then it's time we get you a plan, an emotional compass, and start changing your selection criteria immediately.The One Thing You Must Do Before You Can Find True LoveDoes that mean there's anything wrong with somebody who's fun on a date, a good dancer, handsome and supercool? Absolutely not. In fact, you may consider these conditions to be necessary and they may be, but that certainly does not mean those traits are sufficient to sustain what you're looking for.I don't mean to make this sound like a job with no fun, spontaneity or intrigue -- because this should be an exciting process. But we might as well make sure you are enjoying yourself with the right kind of guys, that is, those who have at least some chance of being ""the one."" That means you need to stop spending time around people who you absolutely, positively, drop-dead know for sure are not going to lead you anywhere.Don't go barhopping just because you are scared to be alone. If what you are looking for is a meaningful, committed partner, then you are going to have to stay on the relationship highway and quit going down the doesn't-call-you-back dirt roads, the better-than-nothing dead-end streets, and the he-ain't-much-but-he's-mine detours. If you want what you want when you want it and what you want is a real, no-kidding, quality partner and when you want it is now (or yesterday before noon) instead of five years from now or never, then you don't want to confuse aimless social activity with social productivity.Here's an attitude adjustment for you: Decide right now that you would rather be happy alone than miserable with somebody else. Decide that you will not choose some guy out of fear that you may not get a better choice later. For example, if you know a guy who drinks too much, has a difficult personality and hates kids, he's no good to you unless you're writing a country song. He may be fun for the night, but there's no chance for a future, because he has deal-breaking characteristics or values. And you need to be paying attention to those and hitting the door even if it means going home alone.How To Fall In Love With Yourself -- So That Someone Else Will TooIf you haven't stopped to give your needs and wants some serious thought, you probably wouldn't know Mr. Right if he walked up to you wearing a name tag. You don't fit with everybody, and not everybody fits with you. There are people out there who will drive you crazy and vice versa. I want to make sure that you have a clear vision of what you want and what you don't want -- what you absolutely cannot live with versus, ""Yes, this is the foundation on which I can build a future.""Here's a hint: What you want is not necessarily Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Gandhi and Bill Gates rolled into one. After all, as he gets older, he's likely to have Bill Gates's looks and Gandhi's money. You're not going for some dream guy here, because going for a dream guy is a good way to excuse yourself from the game -- just set the bar so high that nobody measures up, then shrug your shoulders and say, ""That's why I'm alone."" No, we are going to get in there, and be realistic and find somebody who has a chance of being the right kind of guy. Then we'll create the right kind of experience.Modified excerpt from Love Smart: Find the One You Want - Fix the One You Got by Dr. Phil McGraw (Free Press, 2005).Also on HuffPost:"

Hailey pointed to Hutchinson's track record of support for anti-gay legislation, saying the website asahutchinson.com now redirects to a chat forum for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals.""I purchased it due to the anti-gay record he's had over his career and because he let it go up for renewal rather than sitting on the domain like most politicians do,"" Hailey told The Huffington Post.

This is a commitment I cannot make,” Walsh said at the press conference, which he called amid reports that the United States Olympic Committee was pressuring him to sign a contract that includes the so-called taxpayer guarantee.“I’m not signing an agreement that’s going to cost the taxpayers if there are overruns,” he said.Walsh did not rule out the possibility of signing a contract that includes the guarantee eventually, but both he and Gov. Charlie Baker (R) have remained hesitant to fully back requirements that could shift costs to taxpayers, at least until a commission to analyze the bid's finances and potential impact is complete.And with the USOC scheduled to meet Monday to discuss the future of Boston's bid, the public hesitation from Walsh could throw the city's effort further into jeopardy little more than a month before the International Olympic Committee deadline to formally submit a proposal.If Walsh sticks to his position, he may find it impossible to fully back an Olympic bid's requirements.The taxpayer guarantee, which the IOC requires as part of a bid, has been at the center of the controversy around Boston’s effort since the winter, when grassroots groups like No Boston Olympics and No Boston 2024 began organizing against it.The groups have highlighted research showing that every Olympics between 1960 and 2012 exceeded initial projections -- by an average of 179 percent, according to the University of Oxford -- to challenge the notion that city and state taxpayers should hand “a blank check” to the USOC, IOC, and Boston 2024, the private group organizing the city’s bid.With the latest polling showing that a near-majority of state residents oppose hosting the Olympics, Boston 2024 has revamped its proposal. In June, it released an updated $4.6 billion bid that it said would include private financing and an insurance plan to limit potential financial risks."

But with their recently released fourth album, “Amanecer,” the group’s Cumbia-infused songs take the backseat as new high-powered electronic dance tracks call shotgun.That’s not to say that the Latin Grammy-nominated group, comprised of singer Liliana Saumet and multi-instrumentalist Simon Mejía, have forgotten their roots as evident by the album’s lead single “Fiesta,” which is inspired by Barranquilla’s colorful carnival. The duo recently finished the first leg of their mostly sold-out U.S. tour, which included a performance at New York City’s Highline Ballroom Friday. The group will return to Colombia this week and come back to the U.S. for a final appearance in November at Fun Fun Fun Fest in Austin, Texas.Mejía recently spoke to The Huffington Post about how “Amanecer” sets itself apart from their past albums and how he’s seen their audience grow in the United States.“Amanecer” was released a bit over a month ago. How do you describe this album?We’re very happy with the result. It’s an album that we made in a very different way than what we have done in the past, it has a very different sound. We’re exploring other rhythms, other sounds -- we could say that Cumbia isn’t as present and that we went off that script and that style. It’s an experimental album.We worked with Los Angeles producer [Ricky Reed], so he also gave a lot of his input and his experience and brought a lot of new things to Bomba Estéreo’s sound. And also conceptually it’s an album that has a very positive message, very spiritual.Speaking of that shift from Cumbia to a more electronic sound, “Fiesta” is a very upbeat first single.We chose the song as the first single because we thought it summarized all of the record’s energy and the essence of Bomba Estéreo, which is to combine folk music with tropical music. In the case of “Fiesta,” it’s an homage to Barranquilla’s Carnival in Colombia, and it’s about Liliana’s particular experience of being a part of one of the comparsas [or Carnival groups] that performs in Barranquilla every year. Some of the lyrics talk about that experience of being in Carnival and transforming yourself to go out, do a musical and dance performance and then in a radical cut going to another party. Like jumping from Barranquilla’s Carnival to any other electronic music party in the world with the same costume, so we thought it’d be cool to present it that way [in the video].What other tracks stand out in “Amanecer”?My favorite song is called “Caderas” and I love it because of its rhythm, it allows you to really dance and it has a lot of power. And it also sounds incredible live.Bomba Estéreo was invited to Coachella in 2011. What was it like to be a part of such a big music festival in the United States?Fortunately, the public welcomed us very well. We performed during the day but it was an honor to be there and a part of that lineup alongside great and important artists. We’re very grateful.This tour wasn't the first time you performed in New York City. But how does The Big Apple set itself apart from other cities?Playing in New York is like playing in London, they’re music epicenters. There is a lot of energy and a lot of vibrations in the air.Have you noticed any changes in your audience? Do you find that Americans make their way to your concerts? Increasingly our audience is more mixed, every single time there are more North Americans. Colombians -- especially the women who live here in the U.S. -- generally have boyfriends that are North American and they bring them along. Then the boyfriends tell their friends and by word of mouth it’s grown and now a Bomba Estéreo concert can be half Colombian and half Americans.Also on HuffPost: "

All nine women and their children who appeared for bond hearings at the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas, on Monday were ordered released without bond or an ankle monitor, according to the immigrants’ attorneys. The outcomes marked a sharp turnaround from the long waits and burdensome bonds that judges often issued prior to last week’s ruling by a federal judge that families should be released.“That’s the first time this has happened,” Andrew Free, an attorney who represents women and children locked up at the largest U.S. family detention center, told The Huffington Post. “This is groundbreaking.”Brian Hoffman, an attorney who coordinates pro bono lawyers representing women at Dilley, said Friday’s ruling by U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee makes it difficult to justify continuing to detain women and their children. Instead, judges in Miami hearing arguments via webcam ordered women and children released on “conditional parole,” which doesn’t require a bond payment.“In the past, we’ve been able to get conditional parole for extreme hardship ― medical cases, family unification,” Hoffman said. “Today, we got it for everybody. No monetary bonds at all were set and we think that’s all the judges can do in light of this federal court ruling that it’s illegal for these people to even be detained here.”The orders followed Friday’s ruling that locking immigrant mothers and their children in family detention violates the 1997 Flores Agreement. The agreement, which settled a class-action lawsuit first filed in 1985, sets guidelines for holding minors in immigrant detention. It mandates that authorities hold undocumented children in the “least restrictive setting” possible and adopt a “general policy favoring release.”The government has until Aug. 3 to argue why women and children in family detention shouldn’t be released within 90 days. DHS spokeswoman Marsha Catron said in a statement that department officials “are disappointed with the court’s decision and are reviewing it in consultation with the Department of Justice.” She said they plan to respond to the court by the deadline. The ruling was another setback for the Obama administration’s attempts to use family immigrant detention as a deterrent to keep migrants from violence-plagued Central American countries of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador from crossing into the United States. The administration had largely done away with family immigrant detention back in 2009, but revived its use after some 68,000 family units were apprehended along the U.S.-Mexico border last year.In response, the administration expanded the capacity to house families at a detention center in Karnes City, Texas, and constructed the new 2,400-bed South Texas Family Residential Center at Dilley. The Dilley family detention center is operated as a for-profit enterprise by the country’s largest private prison contractor, the Corrections Corporation of America. The Karnes City facility is privately operated by the GEO Group, the second-largest private prison contractor.Most of those who have wound up in family detention centers have applied for asylum, often saying they’d face gang threats or domestic violence if returned to their home countries. Despite the Obama administration’s commitment to family detention, asylum officers routinely approve applicants “credible fear” interviews ― the first step toward establishing an asylum claim.The administration had argued that detaining women and children ― even those eligible for asylum ― was necessary to deter more from coming to the U.S., until a judge blocked the detention of asylum-seekers as a deterrent in a February preliminary injunction.Despite that ruling, many women and children eligible for asylum or other relief remained stuck in detention for months, often because they can’t afford bond. After an outcry from Democratic lawmakers, human rights groups and immigration attorneys, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson announced last month that families determined eligible for relief would be released in most instances.Immigration and Customs Enforcement began to implement that policy earlier this month, and immigration attorneys said they have seen an uptick in families being freed over the past two weeks. During that time, though, Hoffman said ICE agents have given women conflicting information about when they will be released and have been unclear with attorneys about standards for who will be let out of detention.Hoffman works with the CARA Pro Bono Project, which organizes volunteer attorneys for women and children in detention. The project laid out a slew of complaints about the state of affairs in the detention facilities in a letter Monday to ICE Director Sarah Saldaña, including ICE agents pressuring women to agree to ankle monitors and not allowing them to speak to attorneys.ICE did not respond to a request for comment on the letter.“It has been chaos,” Hoffman said. “Ever since they started to implement their own release policy, it’s sort of been one failure after another.”"
14,POLITICS,Newt Still Owes His 2012 Campaign Vendors Millions,Arthur Delaney and Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/newt-2012-campaign-debts_us_55b65859e4b0224d8832dbcc,"""Who's going to contribute to Newt 2012?""",2015-07-27,<p>Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich owes millions from his failed 2012 presidential bid.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Much like Donald Trump today, at one point Newt Gingrich held the frontrunner position in the 2012 Republican primary election. His campaign plodded on using borrowed money for months after most people realized Gingrich didn't have a chance, and when Newt 2012 finally ended, it crashed in a heap of debt that may never be repaid.The campaign still owes $4.6 million to dozens of businesses that provided things like transportation, voter canvassing and yard signs. The former speaker of the House’s debts put him in company with fringe weirdo Lyndon LaRouche, a perennial presidential pretender since the 1980s who owes $3.2 million across four campaign accounts.The next-highest accumulator of debt among non-active presidential campaigns is President Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign committee, which owes $2.4 million in debt. The big difference: The Obama campaign can bring in big money by renting its massive voter data base. Federal Election Commission records show that the Gingrich campaign’s list has only brought in a little more than $1 million since he dropped out of the race, and his debt has only declined by $300,000.Gingrich did not respond to requests for comment sent to multiple spokespeople.There are still a number of open campaign accounts by past failed presidential candidates with large debts, but none reach the heights of Gingrich’s. Former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, a Republican and Libertarian Party candidate in 2012, owes $1.4 million, and MSNBC host Al Sharpton owes $925,714 from his 2004 presidential bid. Even disgraced former Democratic Sen. John Edwards still owes $331,586 from his 2008 campaign.So, what exactly does Gingrich owe so much money for? The biggest service that he has not paid for yet was personal air travel during the campaign. He owes $1.8 million to charter jet service provider Moby Dick Airways, business travel provider AirPlus and to himself for jet fare. (Candidates can receive reimbursement from their campaign committee to cover their own costs for things like travel.)Gingrich’s largest debts are to a host of consultants and firms that helped him with strategy, polling, advertising, telemarketing and all of the other routine activities needed to run a presidential campaign.Bo Harmon said Newt's campaign still owes him about $25,000 from services rendered in 2012. Harmon said he organized volunteers who made phone calls and knocked on doors in Iowa, South Carolina, Nevada, and Arizona. Harmon himself spent three months living out of hotels, paying for his rooms, airfare, rental cars and meals. He expected the Gingrich campaign would pay him back. It didn't.""I contacted them regularly for two years after the campaign ended to find out if there was a way to be paid, all with no reply from the campaign,"" Harmon said. ""Especially with someone like Newt, you hope they conduct themselves in a different way than that. So it's very disappointing. He's not the first politician to disappoint his supporters, and he won't be the last.""Campaign documents filed with the FEC say the debt to Harmon is $5,639.99 for travel. The campaign documents also indicate a debt of $50,500 to 4 Components Strategies LLC, a firm for which Harmon says he was one of four principals.Harmon said he used to be much angrier, but his anger has faded with time and the sad realization that he will probably never get his money back.""Who's going to contribute to Newt 2012?"" Harmon asked.Gordon James of Phoenix, Arizona, figured someone who had loaned Gingrich even more -- Moby Dick Airways, for instance, to which Gingrich owes $1 million -- would initiate a lawsuit of some kind that he could join. It's the main way that companies and individuals could go after the money they are owed, but it hasn't happened.The FEC forms show that Newt 2012 owes $127,727 to James' company, which employs 14 people and handled event planning, media outreach and logistics for the campaign. James said it wasn't easy to absorb the loss.""My life was upended. I had to make a lot of financial adjustments to survive,"" he said. He added that he stopped paying himself a salary and used savings to cover his bills.Massive campaign debt does not appear to have hampered Gingrich's lifestyle -- including exotic vacations and fancy events -- glimpses of which he is continuously sharing on social media. As HuffPost's Christina Wilkie reported in 2012, Gingrich has a long history of launching political organizations and moving on as they collapse under a pile of debt. Legally, Gingrich himself is never liable for the money owed.James said he doesn't harbor bad feelings toward Gingrich. He regrets that he didn't pull out of the campaign before the Florida primary.""I let my emotions get away from me,"" he said. ""I wanted him to win. I thought he was going to win. I thought it was going to be a great ending to a hard-fought battle."""
