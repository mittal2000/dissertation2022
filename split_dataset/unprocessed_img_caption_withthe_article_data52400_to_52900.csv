At least four security officers were killed.No group has claimed responsibility but Islamic State has carried out similar bombings in the U.S.-allied kingdom in the past year, targeting Shi'ites and Saudi security forces.Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights and a member of the Jordanian royal family, delivered his remarks via a spokesman in Geneva.""This is one of the holiest sites in Islam, and for such an attack to take place there, during Ramadan, can be considered a direct attack on Muslims all across the world,"" he said, referring to the Islamic holy month.""It is an attack on the religion itself.""Militant attacks on Medina are unprecedented. The city is home to the second-holiest site in Islam, a mosque built by the Prophet Mohammed, the founder of Islam, which also houses his tomb.Attacks on Mecca, the most sacred place in Islam, have also been extremely rare. The Al Saud ruling family considers itself the protectors of both sites. Islamic State says the Saudi rulers are apostates and has declared its intention to topple them.Saudis were rattled by the rare, high-profile attack.""I apologize to everyone if I don't congratulate you this Eid,"" Khaled bin Saleh al-Shathri, a Saudi businessman, wrote on Twitter.""I am shocked by the deaths of five of my brothers and the wounding of four others as they guarded the holiest places.""Iran also condemned the attacks.Saudi Arabia's crown prince and anti-terror tsar, Mohammed bin Nayef bin Abdul-Aziz, sought on Tuesday to reassure Saudis of the country's security.""The security of the homeland is good, it is at its highest levels and thanks be to God it gets stronger every day,"" the state news agency SPA quoted him as saying during a visit to some of the wounded in the Jeddah attack.Prince Mohammed has been credited for successfully ending a bombing campaign by al Qaeda in Saudi Arabia between 2003-2006.Monday's bombings came days before the end of the holy month of Ramadan when Muslims fast from dawn until dusk.Saudi security officials say the Islamic State's supporters inside the kingdom mainly act independently from the group in Iraq and Syria.Salah al-Budair, the imam of the Prophet's Mosque, warned young people about being lured by the ""malignant"" ideology of Islamic State.""(The bomber) is an infidel who has sold himself to the enemies of his religion and his country.""(Reporting by Stephanie Nebehay, Sami Aboudi and Tom Finn; Writing by Noah Browning; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky)"

Fifty-four bulls typically die during the festival.According to PETA, activists from Australia, Sweden, Russia and the UK joined Spaniards in the graphic protest against bullfighting -- a longtime and controversial tradition in Spain. PETA explains that the fake blood was chosen to “mimic the drunken revellers” who “douse themselves with sangria at the Running of the Bulls, oblivious to the fact that every single one of the terrified animals they chase through the cobbled streets will be dead a few days later after being stabbed to death in a bullfight.”Scroll down for more photos from the protest:A version of this post first appeared on HuffPost Spain.

The zoo's former director declined to do so, saying the animal was too old.Arturo had lived in the zoo since the age of 8 before his death on Sunday due to what the officials called complications from old age, The Associated Press reports. While wild polar bears often die in their teens, those in captivity can live into their mid-30s.Despite the animals hailing from regions north of the Arctic Circle, temperatures in Arturo's heavily concreted enclosure often soared higher than 100 degrees Fahrenheit and he was said to live in ""deplorable conditions.""Animal rights groups marked Arturo's passing with some calls to end the existence of zoos in their current form.Greenpeace Argentina released a statement saying Arturo's time in the zoo ""prioritized the exhibition for commercial and recreational purposes over conservation and animal welfare.""""Remember that [Arturo] was not the only animal in captivity and in poor condition,"" Soledad Sede, a campaigner for the group, said."

The third militant detonated his explosives outside at the entrance to the international arrivals terminal.""There are people from Dagestan, from Kyrgyzstan, from Tajikistan,"" Erdogan said, referring to a mainly Muslim province of Russia's North Caucasus region, and two former Soviet states in Central Asia. ""Unfortunately, people from neighboring northern Caucasus countries are involved in this business.""The 17 remanded in custody early on Tuesday included 11 foreigners. All were accused of ""membership of an armed terrorist organization"", the private Dogan news agency said. Thirteen others were jailed on Sunday, including three foreigners.The state-run Andolu news agency said last week that two of the bombers were Russian nationals. One government official has said the attackers were Russian, Uzbek and Kyrgyz nationals.Moscow says that thousands of Russian citizens and citizens of other former Soviet states have joined Islamic State, traveling through Turkey to reach Syria. Russia fought two wars against Chechen separatists in the North Causcasus in the 1990s, and more recently has fought Islamist insurgents in Dagestan.Russia and Turkey have been at odds over Moscow's support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Turkey's backing of rebels opposed to him, especially since last year when Turkeyshot down a Russian warplane near the border.But recent weeks have seen a thaw in relations between the two countries, with both citing a need to bury their differences to fight the common Islamic State foe.The pro-government Yeni Safak newspaper has said the organizer of the attack was suspected to be a Chechen double-amputee called Akhmed Chatayev. He is identified on a United Nations sanctions list as an Islamic State leader responsible for training Russian-speaking militants.SUSPECTS DENY ALLEGATIONSDuring questioning in court, as reported by Dogan, the suspects denied links to the bombers.One of them, identified as a Russian citizen named as Smail A., said he stayed in a crowded house where he thought he would be able to read the Koran.""When the police caught us they said terrorists had stayed there previously, but we didn't know. I was in that house at the wrong time,"" he was quoted as saying during questioning.A suspect identified as Kamil D., also a Russian citizen, denied knowing one of the bombers, who has been identified as Rahim Bulgarov.""The people constantly changed in the house where we stayed. Maybe he came and stayed but I don't know him,"" he said.A third suspect, Turkish citizen Cengizhan C., said he embraced the views of Islamic State after following related groups on Facebook.""I learned Daesh ideas. I bonded with them idea-wise. I believed what they stood for,"" he said, adding he traveled to the border province of Sanliurfa with the aim of joining them in Syria but had been dissuaded from doing so.In the wake of the attack, Turkey has beefed up security at airports and train stations, Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said on Monday ahead Eid al-Fitr, which continues until Thursday.Turkey is a member of a U.S.-led coalition fighting against Islamic State.

And just last week, $445,000 of Olympic broadcasting equipment was hijacked from an in-transit truck, drawing headlines all over the world.The government has been unable to pay police largely due to the nationwide recession, leading to both the airport protests and an $895 million emergency loan extended to Rio in the hope of assuaging some of the security fears -- and appeasing the officers who’ve threatened to strike.Even Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes told CNN last week that the national government was doing a “terrible, horrible job” as the calendar inches closer to the opening ceremony, admitting that “[the state is] completely failing at its work of policing and taking care of people.”And even while Rio expends energy and resources trying to quell its crime problem and security issues, the host city must also worry about biological factors threatening the health of athletes, tourists and locals alike.In addition to ever-present concerns over the mosquito-borne Zika virus, a “super bacteria” has been discovered at beaches that neighbor the bay slated to host the Olympic sailing competitions. The current theory is that the drug-resistant bacteria made its way into the water when “sewage coming from local hospitals got channeled into the bay,” per local expert and lead researcher Renata Picao.The athletes themselves are all too aware of the potentially perilous pollution. German Paralympic sailor Heiko Kroger told CNN that he attributes a teammate’s recent “severe skin infection” to this newly detected bacteria -- and that he keeps his nose and his lips sealed as much as possible when near the contaminated water.""It's a nice sailing area but every time you get some water in your face, it feels like there's some alien enemy entering your face,"" he said.As of now, the sailing competitions will go on as planned, despite the fact that Picao admits that no one fully knows the “risks” of getting infected by this bacteria -- and despite the fact that Picao refuses to take her own children to the beaches in question."

First she pointed to his record of hiring women:My father is a feminist. He’s a big reason I am the woman I am today. People talk about gender equality. He has lived it, he has employed women at the highest levels of the Trump Organization for decades, so I think it’s a great testament to how capable he thinks women are and has shown that his whole life.Then, she pointed to her own childhood, which she says was full of strong women, thanks to her father:He always told me and showed me that I could do anything I set my mind to if I married vision and passion with work ethic. He’s also surrounded me with strong female role models who have done just that since I was a little girl.These are certainly nice sentiments. It's wonderful that Ivanka feels like her dad surrounded her with women role models. And it is absolutely true that Trump has a record of hiring whoever he believes will be the best in a job -- er, make him the most money -- regardless of gender. That's great.But that still does not make him a feminist -- not least because the presidential campaign he is running stands in direct opposition to the advancement of women's rights (and really, the rights of anyone who is not a straight, white, cisgender, Christian man). Treating a handful of women like human beings deserving of jobs and independent thoughts does not make you a feminist. And for Ivanka to casually throw around labels that have real meaning without us questioning those assertions is problematic.So, here's a quick refresher on what feminism is: The belief in and advocacy for the social, political and economic equality of all genders. (Something much more expansive than giving a few select women limited power within one space that you, a man, ultimately control.)And here's a quick refresher of what it is not... You are not a feminist if you routinely call women ""fat pigs,"" ""dogs"" and rate them on a numeric scale by how sexually attractive you personally find them.You are not a feminist if you comment on the bodies and weight fluctuations of the women you employ.You are not a feminist if you publicly say you are annoyed that your wife has a job because that cuts into her ability to prepare you dinner each night (Marla Maples), or because you are upset that she talks about said job (Ivana Trump). You are not a feminist if you pay the male staffers on your presidential campaign 35 percent more on average than your female staffers, as a June analysis by the Boston Globe found. You are not a feminist if you incite online harassment against female journalists who you don't agree with. You are not a feminist if you say women should be punished for having abortions and vow to appoint Supreme Court judges who will overturn Roe v. Wade. You are not a feminist if you have said so many offensive things about women that a publication has created a Sexism Tracker dedicated to you!Basically, if anyone truly believes that Trump is a feminist: Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Photographer Virginie Rebetez decided to tell her story.,2016-07-05,"A photo of Suzanne Gloria Lyall, presented by Virginie Rebetez.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577bf8fb1800002400fa3f43.jpeg?cache=h2Y9hUfhBS&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"On March 2, 1998, Suzanne Gloria Lyall walked home from her usual bus stop, on the way to her campus dorm room. That’s the last time anybody saw her.Eighteen years later, she still hasn’t been found, in spite of the search efforts of police, her parents, and those enlisted by her parents, including a psychic who hovered her hands above old photos, hoping to form a connection. Although Suzanne’s parents, Mary and Doug Lyall, were able to channel their grief towards a good cause ― in 2001 they founded the Center for Hope, a community providing support and resources to the parents of missing children ― they never stopped searching for their daughter.Their story of tenacity, and of a relentless search for traces of evidence, caught the attention of photographer Virginie Rebetez, whose previous work centered on the way missing and unidentified people are described and depicted in police reports. “In all my photographic projects I am interested in the invisible, the meaning of identity, the traces we leave behind after death or an absence, in unfinished stories, in the materiality we, as humans, need for closure,” Rebetez said in an interview with The Huffington Post. “I can say, in a way, that I use photography to give consistence, materiality, to the invisible, to give a shape, a form to what is not there anymore.”She’d hoped to tell the story of a single missing person, and the individuals whose lives are shaped by that absence. When she met Mary and Doug Lyall, she knew she wanted to photograph the materials and emotions surrounding their daughter’s case. The resulting series, which Rebetez is hoping to turn into a book titled Out of the Blue, is a patchwork of haunting images. In many of them, Suzanne is depicted, but her face is obscured, demonstrating visually that her disappearance is the cause for the strife shown in the rest of the collection’s photos, which consists of landscape shots, portraits, and a police composite of what Suzanne might look like today.“I found the different use of the photographs of Suzanne by all the different people involved in the case quite interesting. Psychics used the portraits of her not for the representation of her but as an object they handled and touched in order to get a connection,” Rebetez said. “The more you read these files, the more your head is filled with stories, but the less you know. After 18 years, Suzanne’s case is still unresolved.”The project, then, is a thoughtful commentary on the need we have for closure, which, unlike other forms of comfort, like hope or faith, often must come in the form of something physical. Rebetez hopes viewers will feel provoked by her meditation on loss, but more than anything she hopes the project will raise awareness for Suzanne’s story. “She disappeared in a time lapse of five minutes,” Rebetez reflects, reiterating the mystery and tragedy of the case. “The distance between the bus stop to her university campus dorm.”You can donate to Virginie Rebetez’s Kickstarter campaign here."

The deficit stood at 4.3 pct of national output in the first half of 2016, up from 2.6 pct last year and against 0.5 pct in 2014.At current rates of spending, it has been clear for some time that the Reserve Fund - which at the start of 2014 stood at $87 billion - would run out around 2017.The fact that assumption is now included in the finance ministry proposal shows officials have not been able to find savings or sources of additional revenue elsewhere to stop that happening.SPENDING CUTSFinance ministry officials have been pressing for some time for spending cuts to reduce the budget shortfall, but implementing cuts could be politically damaging because Russia votes in a parliamentary election in September and a presidential election in 2018.The finance ministry proposal states that there will be 980 billion rubles ($15.27 billion) in the Reserve Fund by the end of this year, dwindling to zero at an unspecified point in 2017.The proposal also assumes an average Urals oil price of $40 per barrel in 2017-19, and a freeze in budget expenditures at 15.8 trillion rubles per year.The National Wealth Fund, which at the start of July contained $73 billion, is not intended for covering budget shortfalls. It was originally intended to pay for future pensions but a portion of the fund has been committed to investment projects.According to the finance ministry proposal, Russia would spend 783 billion rubles from the fund in 2017, followed by a further 883 billion rubles in 2018 and 87 billion rubles in 2019.A sizeable part of the fund is already invested in long-term projects, limiting the amount that can be spent on covering the budget deficit.Once those investments are excluded, Russia would have just 500 billion rubles left in the National Wealth Fund by the end of 2019, according to the finance ministry proposal.(Reporting by Darya Korsunskaya; Writing by Lidia Kelly and Alexander Winning; Editing by Christian Lowe and Gareth Jones)"

""As we always have the capacity in New York to put out a lot of resources, that's the name of the game, in dealing with terrorist threats,"" Bratton said.Police in Chicago, which has seen a spike in gun murders this year, announced a stepped up presence with more than 5,000 officers on patrol over the long weekend, traditionally one of the year's most violent, said Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson.

Both the president and vice president have long sought to raise awareness about the issue, and Biden told the Post he'd like to take away federal money from colleges and universities that fail to ""put the pedal to the metal.""A group of 31 U.S. senators recently warned colleges and universities may be underreporting sexual assaults and domestic violence on campus. Just 9 percent of 11,000 schools required to report the number of assaults on campus said they had any occurrence of such crimes.As The Huffington Post's Tyler Kingkade reported, those numbers directly conflict with peer-reviewed research that show 1 in 5 female students will experience such violence by the time they graduate college.In June, Biden wrote a letter to the woman sexually assaulted by Stanford swimmer Brock Turner, who was sentenced to just six months in prison for the crime.""I am filled with furious anger — both that this happened to you and that our culture is still so broken that you were ever put in the position of defending your own worth,” he wrote.Biden is a spokesman for the White House's ""It's On Us"" campaign to end sexual assault before it takes place. More than 344,000 people have pledged their support for the initiative."

The former secretary of state's criticism was echoed by hordes of Twitter users.The most powerful Republicans in the U.S. stayed silent, though.Instead, House Speaker Paul Ryan (Wis.) and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (La.) tweeted about their tax reform plan.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) released a statement on the death of Wiesel, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning author who survived Auschwitz. Wiesel died on Saturday, the same day Trump published the Star of David tweet. During the Holocaust, Nazis forced Jewish people to wear Star of David badges to identify themselves.McConnell's statement read:""We knew Elie Wiesel as a survivor, an advocate, and an award-winning author. Though he saw the worst of humanity, he also showed us the enduring power of the human spirit. The mark he left on our world will continue to be felt for years to come.""Priebus also tweeted about Clinton's meeting with the FBI over her use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state. All four of them wished Americans a happy July Fourth. Representatives for Ryan, McConnell and Scalise didn't return requests for comment. RNC Communications Director Sean Spicer didn't respond, either, but he did tweet about dry shampoo:Ryan and McConnell (among several other Republican politicians) have in the past criticized Trump's racist and xenophobic remarks. They are still, however, endorsing him for president. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) also didn't have a response. None of the politicians on Trump's rumored short list of VP candidates -- including Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie or former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich (Ga.) -- spoke out either.Fox News barely addressed Trump's tweet, and when the network did, it defended him.Trump denied the tweet was anti-Semitic and blamed the ""dishonest media"" for making him look bad.UPDATE: July 5, 12:30 p.m. -- Over 72 hours after Trump's tweet went out, Ryan responded to it during an interview with local Wisconsin radio station WTMJ.“Look, anti-Semitic images they’ve got no place in a presidential campaign,” Ryan said. “I don’t know what flunky put this up there.""He’s got to clean this up,"" he added, referring to Trump's Twitter account, which has on several occasions broadcast racist memes.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Trump included the hashtag ""#AmericaFirst"" with the image. The phrase, which he has adopted as a campaign slogan, was first used in the 1940s by those who thought the U.S. shouldn't go to war against Nazi Germany.Trump adviser Ed Brookover claimed the image was harmless, telling CNN there's ""nothing to see here.""""There was never any intention of anti-Semitism,"" he said. ""Not every six-pointed star is a Star of David.""Late Monday, Trump also addressed the controversy on Facebook, calling the shape ""a basic star, often used by sheriffs who deal with criminals and criminal behavior.""The statement included a message from social media manager Dan Scavino, who said the image ""was lifted from an anti-Hillary Twitter user."" Scavino wrote he ""would never offend anyone and therefore chose to remove the image."" Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who now works for CNN, also denied the image was meant to attack Jews. He called the backlash over the presumptive Republican presidential nominee's tweet ""political correctness run amok.""Clinton weighed in on the image Monday.""Donald Trump's use of a blatantly anti-Semitic image from racist websites to promote his campaign would be disturbing enough, but the fact that it's a part of a pattern should give voters major cause for concern,"" she said in a statement.The CEO of the Anti-Defamation League on Sunday criticized Trump's tweet and his campaign's denial reaction.""We've been troubled by the anti-Semites and racists during this political season, and we've seen a number of so-called Trump supporters peddling some of the worst stereotypes all through this year,"" Jonathan Greenblatt told The Daily Beast. ""For those people who say that you can write this off, and that calling it out is simply political correctness, it's crazy.""Trump has used offensive stereotypes about Jewish people before. In a speech to a Republican Jewish group last year, he said that the crowd probably wouldn't support him ""because I don’t want your money.""The tweet was sent out the same day that author and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel died. During the Holocaust, Nazis forced Jewish people to wear the six-pointed star to identify them as lesser humans. Trump later praised Wiesel.“The world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil!” he tweeted on Sunday.One can only hope that track record continues.This post has been updated with comment from Clinton and the Anti-Defamation League, as well as an example of offensive comments previously said by Trump.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

Still, Juno was traveling some 130,000 mph before it reached Jupiter.""We've only got one shot,"" Guy Beutelschies, director of space exploration systems at Lockheed Martin, the company that built and operates Juno, told NPR. ""If we miss this flyby, we're assuming the mission's over.""But the Fourth of July arrival proved successful.Now, Juno will continue a lengthy dance with Jupiter, circling the giant planet 37 times over a 20-month period and swinging as close as 2,600 miles of the planet's cloud tops, NASA said. It will mark the first time a spacecraft has orbited Jupiter's poles, NASA added, ""providing new answers to ongoing mysteries about the planet’s core, composition and magnetic fields.""The mission is also expected to provide scientists with a better understanding of our solar system as a whole. ""It just so happens, deep inside this body are the secrets we're after,"" a voice-over says in the NASA video below. ""Secrets about our early solar system."" The heavily armored spacecraft has been built to withstand the planet's extreme, radiation-rich environment. But the costly mission is full of unknowns. ""When you sail into terra incognita, that is always going to make you sit on the edge of your seat, because you don’t really know for sure what you’re facing,"" Heidi Becker of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory told National Geographic. Juno is expected to begin scientific observations following a final engine burn on Oct. 19, after a lengthy phase in which the spacecraft will be captured in the planet’s orbit and all scientific instruments will be turned on. The spacecraft is set to meet a fiery death when it burns up in Jupiter's atmosphere in February 2018.For more information about the Juno mission, visit its NASA page."

Check out the previous features with CeCe McDonald, Kate Bornstein, Laura Jane Grace, Buck Angel, Calpernia Addams, Ts Madison, Amos Mac, Candis Cayne, Tiq Milan and Caroline Cossey.Andrea James may not have a name as instantly recognizable as Laverne Cox or Caitlyn Jenner, but there are few activists who have done as much to connect, educate and help the trans community as this writer, producer and educator has over the past several decades.James, along with other prominent activists like Kate Bornstein, used the internet to connect trans and gender-nonconforming people to facilitate discussions about trans experiences long before the online space became regulated or corporatized. Her own site, Transsexual Road Map, became one of the first websites to focus on and educate individuals on the practical aspects of transition.Calling herself a consumer activist who works with trans issues, much of James' work has been out of the public eye but monumental in its significance for the queer community. In this interview with The Huffington Post, James reflects on her journey from rural Indiana to where she is today, the current state of trans politics and her legacy as a writer, producer, educator and so much more.The Huffington Post: Can you pinpoint the beginning of your career? What were some of the first defining moments for you as a trans activist, writer, film producer and mainstream voice?Andrea James: My career as a writer started in middle school in rural Indiana. Two remarkable teachers chose four students at our school to collaborate on a book about the history of a local military camp. That expanded into an amazing collaborative project. From there I got increasingly interested in writing and journalism. I started working with computers in 1979 and have remained an early adopter since. I won my college’s Phi Beta Kappa Prize for digitizing production of all student publications. They had been literal cut-and-paste productions when I took over. I was planning to teach English, but once I got to grad school, I didn’t like the stifling political climate. Ironically, working at the Chicago Tribune convinced me to walk away from journalism as a full-time career. Even in 1990 I knew that newspapers were not sustainable businesses as they operated. So I got into advertising, where I really learned how to write and made enough money to transition successfully while keeping my ad job.A college friend started working at America Online in 1993, and the Tribune was collaborating with them on a localized content delivery service, so I started to see that the internet was going to change everything. The first time I got online, I knew without a doubt that it was going to be the most historically significant invention of my lifetime, and the most important for trans people as well. Back then it was a violation of AOL’s Terms of Service to set up discussion groups with names containing “transsexual” or “transgender.” Many prominent activists were on AOL in those early days, including Kate Bornstein and Gwen Smith, who led the efforts to change AOL policy and set up a Transgender Community Forum. Concurrently, several activists were expanding discussion groups for trans people on Compuserve, BBSes, and Usenet, which was much more freewheeling and lively.I consider myself a consumer activist who works on trans issues, not a trans activist. I believe Ralph Nader is the greatest living American. As I was transitioning, I wrote what I wished I’d found as a child looking for practical transition information. Before that, our community’s collected wisdom was largely an oral tradition. My site, Transsexual Road Map, grew into one of the first major consumer websites on the practical aspects of transition, and I helped a generation transition efficiently and keep their jobs. I helped thousands of people save time and money and avoid the heartache of getting ripped off. I popularized facial feminization after putting pictures of my results online. For about ten years, I was answering emails several hours a day trying to provide information and resources for readers. My thinking was that if we had a large enough population of financially stable trans people, we could support a professional class of lobbyists, activists, legal and health professionals, and artists. That turned out to be true!I even like to write for fun. Here’s a little trivia: I’m one of the most prolific contributors in Wikipedia’s history. I haven’t edited in years, and I am still in the Top 40 for articles and redirects.My career as a filmmaker started in 2002 as a complete career shift at age 35. I had been filming ads I wrote in LA for many years, but the two industries operate very differently. At the time it seemed like the next major challenge facing our community.What role has Hollywood and the entertainment industry played in your journey to live as your authentic self? It’s hard to imagine how difficult it was to find information on trans issues growing up in the '70s and '80s, let alone see ourselves in mainstream media. My local library had nothing, and I wasn’t about to ask the librarian. Once in a while there would be something in a magazine, but our local newspaper never discussed it, unless a syndicated column like Dear Abby had a letter about it. I knew it was possible to transition but had no idea how. The only two books I found that mentioned trans people were Everything You Wanted To Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask and The Book of Lists 2. The former had a couple of very grim and dismissive pages at the end of the “homosexuality” chapter, and the latter had a list of 10 Renowned Transsexuals. I would read that list almost every day. We got five TV channels on a good weather day. No way to record the TV. Not even a remote control to change channels. The only hope was that ""TV Guide"" would mention something. Usually it was a daytime talk show like ""Donahue"" when I was at school. One time ""Real People"" or one of its competitors featured a trans couple where both were transitioning. That’s the only time I remember seeing anything except an occasional mention of tennis player Renee Richards. Of course, I was watching with my parents, so I just sat completely still, hoping they didn’t notice how intently I was watching.I’ve always loved movies, and I watched a ton of TV as a child. It was the best escapism available. Once I moved to Chicago, I saw ""Paris Is Burning"" and ""The Crying Game"" and loved both. Someone at my agency left to be a filmmaker, and director John Hughes had famously started in Chicago’s ad world, so I had it in my mind that advertising was preparation for a film career. Around the time I transitioned, two films came out that had a profound effect on me: ""Ma Vie En Rose,"" and ""Boys Don’t Cry."" Both were deeply moving, but ""Boys Don’t Cry"" truly inspired me. It made me think, “I should be doing this.” I’ve since had the honor of meeting director Kimberly Peirce, and I thanked her for being such an inspiration.You founded Deep Stealth Productions alongside Calpernia Addams. Why did you two take on this endeavor? What was the initial goal? How has that vision grown and changed?I met Calpernia in 1999, shortly after her boyfriend was murdered by soldiers in his unit. We had mutual friends in Chicago, and she needed to get away from everything in Nashville. She had been treated so disrespectfully by the media, and she had no experience dealing with any of that until she was under the media glare. The more we hung out, the more I thought, “Why am I selling cereal and beer when trans people are constantly mistreated and misrepresented by the media?” Eventually she moved to Chicago and we started talking about creating some instructional videos for trans people. Showtime was also preparing to produce Soldier’s Girl, and I saw how art could transform a horrible tragedy into an opportunity to change hearts and minds about trans people and those who love us.I took a 90% pay cut, we bought a bunch of gear, and we moved to LA. We produced the first all-transgender Vagina Monologues with Eve Ensler as our first major project. That was covered in the documentary ""Beautiful Daughters."" Felicity Huffman contacted me after seeing my instructional video ""Finding Your Female Voice,"" and we ended up working with her on ""Transamerica."" We spent a couple years doing pitches and getting used to rejection, eventually making a short film about it called “Casting Pearls,” excerpted from one of our feature screenplays. When Logo TV launched as a channel, ""Beautiful Daughters"" and “Casting Pearls” were both early acquisitions. During the writer’s strike in 2007, Logo passed on a scripted series pitch, but they were interested in unscripted programming, including a trans version of ""The Bachelor."" There had been a really exploitative British version, and we wanted to do one with an out trans bachelorette.I'd like to talk about the unique work you've done over the years helping businesses become more sensitive and accommodating to the needs of trans and GNC people. How did you get into this line of work? What does it entail? What have your experiences been like?A lot of the corporate trans advocacy I do is covered by NDAs, but I can share a little. My corporate activism has two parts. One is to help people keep their jobs during and after transition. That means outreach to organizations and companies working to make that happen, whether it’s speaking engagements at nonprofits like Out & Equal or going on-site at companies like Warner Brothers or P&G. I believe trans people are especially adept at jobs that require both analytic and creative thinking. That’s why trans people index higher in fields involving languages: writing, music, computer coding, engineering, visual arts. Once employers see that trans people are good for their bottom line, it’s a win-win for everyone. I’ve been proud to participate in some cultural diversity training programs over the years, so trans employees will have an easier time at work. The other part of my work is to help consumer-facing companies improve their products and services so they are more trans-friendly. That includes consulting on a lot of media projects, checking them for red flags, but it also means educating companies on the benefits of trans customers. Transgender Americans have an estimated buying power of around 50 billion dollars, maybe as high as 70 billion. The hair removal and cosmetic surgery fields are both much more trans-friendly because of efforts by myself and others. Right now I’m working with Tinder to improve the user experience to reflect the modern diversity of sexualities as well as gender identity and expression. Thanks to trans people who went public with their experiences on Tinder, I was able to work directly with Tinder developers on this. Effective activism requires outside agitation as well as diplomatic face-to-face work internally. This is a very exciting project, because there are about 50 million active Tinder users, so this will have an enormous impact on attitudes about trans people, and it will likely help reduce the stigma and shame some feel about being attracted to trans people.What are your thoughts about the ""trans community,"" especially as it's seen by the mainstream? How do you view where ""the community"" is right now and where it's going?The trans community entered a decadent phase of activism in 2014. We got bloated, lazy, and we took our eyes off what mattered. In 1999 we came together to do something about the epidemic of anti-trans violence, which evolved into the Transgender Day of Remembrance. In 2003 we joined together to fight the academic exploitation of trans people. The community has devolved from presenting a unified front into balkanized petty fiefdoms. We’ve always had internecine squabbles, but trolls were always a fringe element, and we’d never really had an issue with opportunists until recently. Those distractions and errors meant we were caught flat-footed on the inevitable backlash that came in the form of “bathroom bills.”I worry that the mainstream currently thinks the “trans community” is Caitlyn Jenner and her entourage, when most of the community is a lot more like the women on ""Transcendent,"" a show on which I’m a consulting producer. They are dealing with serious challenges around healthcare, housing, employment, and personal safety. I’ve been pleased to see other unscripted shows chipping away at how we’re viewed by the mainstream, and now more scripted shows are in development. As someone who lived through the Renee Richards era backlash, I see a lot of parallels with the Caitlyn Jenner era backlash. We lost so much ground in 1979 that it took about 15 years to recover. I don’t think it will happen as badly this time because we are more organized and have greater numbers. Still, when things go south, they tend to go south quickly. Historically, trans and gender-variant people are often among the first to get persecuted in times of national crisis. We are constantly engaged in asymmetrical information warfare with the forces of intolerance, so we have to work harder and smarter to prevail.You haven't been afraid to very publicly challenge those that you disagree with -- even other trans people. Why do you think it's so important to be vocal about what you believe in, even if your view isn't always the most popular or widely agreed upon.I don’t challenge people simply because I disagree with them. I challenge people who are causing significant harm to the trans community. I only go after charlatans, bigots, self-righteous posers, scammers, trolls and other assorted idiots who are causing what I consider palpable damage to trans people, even if they are trans people themselves. My philosophy is afflict the comfortable, and comfort the afflicted. I have learned some hard-earned facts. You can give no quarter to charlatans. You can get so much more done if you don’t care who gets credit. And, as RuPaul says, ""what other people think of me is none of my business.""I’ve been sued and threatened with litigation by all kinds of scumbags. I filed my first police report for a credible death threat in 2002. I’ve been doxxed, called every name under the sun, misquoted, libeled, you name it. I’ve been misrepresented and vilified by people of every political or ideological persuasion who don’t like what I have to say or how I say it. That kind of stuff makes me dig in deeper. I cut my activism teeth in the world of direct action: Coalition for Positive Sexuality, women’s clinic defenses against Operation Rescue, registering hundreds of voters in the wake of Alan Dixon’s vote to confirm Clarence Thomas, picketing the American Psychiatric Association. Media activism and online activism are no substitutes for boots-on-the-ground, in-your-face activism. Changing your avatar color or signing an online petition doesn’t do shit. It’s entertainment masquerading as activism. Get out in the street and stop pretending like activism is a fucking video game.What do you want the legacy of Andrea James to be?Hmm. Like an epitaph? Maybe something like “She did what needed to be done, said what needed to be said, and helped as many people as she could.” Some people who saw my film ""Alec Mapa: Baby Daddy"" started the foster-adopt process. I can’t think of many better legacies, except maybe when readers write to say they found my information as teenagers and started transition earlier than I did. I am very proud to have helped raise funds for restoring some amazing LGBT cinema as part of the Outfest UCLA Legacy Project. And this may seem weird given all the serious work I do, but I still take great pride when someone says, “You’re one of the filthiest, most hilarious people I’ve ever met.”Check Huffington Post Queer Voices regularly for further conversations with other significant and historic trans and gender-nonconforming figures.

Where should Steve's loyalties have been when he was growing up--as a Southerner, as a Jew, or as his own independent self? Later, when he came of age, should he have chosen to be a responsible wage-earner or free-spirit entrepreneur? Having made the choice to become a club impresario, what should Steve's priorities have been as he attempted to cultivate and showcase writers, artists and musicians, many of them unknowns and many of whose needs could be peculiar, clandestine, demanding and illicit? As he simultaneously struggled to create and lead a tribe and fashion an image of himself, to promote and manage his club, to stay afloat financially and wrestle with his own personal demons, what were the standards and values to be? Like Mudd's place in the orbit of Lincoln's assassination, Steve's place in the club scene swirl of arts, culture, sex, drugs and money remains open to speculation. Pardon of Dr. Samuel Mudd by President Andrew Johnson, who succeeded Lincoln and was later impeachedAnother doubtless unintended association with Dr. Mudd may have been an awareness of our Dad's role as a pathologist and medical examiner in a time and place of segregation, when and where racist crimes of omission as well as commission were common. In Macon, and throughout the South, segregation was total. Separate bathrooms, schools, entrances, water fountains. The bus I took to go downtown had a sign up front that read: ""White people seat from front. Colored people seat from rear."" Though Dr. Mudd's place in the assassination of the President was never clarified, he came from a family of slave-owners and was known to have hated Lincoln. Though our Dad never evinced any racism that we were witness to, he performed his medical duties, never otherwise directly addressing the politics or social circumstances surrounding them, at least so far as we ever knew. We were children, of course, but not so unlike his Jewish family's tacit complicity in the status quo racism of the South that Tony Kushner exposes in Caroline or Change, our family's responses to the pervasive racism in the South that is likewise the subject of the Kathryn Stockett novel and film, The Help, were hardly in the forefront of social activism, which scarcely existed in those years in any case. In fact, apart from my mother forbidding us ever to use the word ""nigger"" that everybody used at school and most everywhere else in Macon, except in the Temple and Schul, I don't remember Mom or Dad ever really discussing the still festering racism of the South that otherwise felt like home to us, the only home we kids had ever known. Such was the depth of that Stephen Foster and Ray Charles sense of home that when I learned we were to move to Chicago in 1958, when I was 11 and Steve was 17, I cried. We retained our home in Georgia for another 50 years. To this day, I still experience a heartfelt comfort in the South and in the presence of Southerners that can only be described as primal. As with my initial heimat love of Wagner, no matter how far down the road I've traveled, my heart still sometimes longs for the old folks at home, even as my head knows I can never go home again.Nor did our parents ever discuss the other behemoth in our living room, the Holocaust, the worst of which was unfolding during Steve's childhood. It wasn't until I was 12, in Chicago, that my mother first said something in my presence about Hitler having murdered millions of Jews. While it may have registered for the future, at that young age of assimilationist youth, of trying to be as un-Jewish, as ""cosmopolitan,"" as ""American"" and ""normal"" as I could get away with while otherwise getting bar-mitzvah'd and socializing in a predominantly white middle-class Jewish milieu, I had no questions or interest in hearing anything more about what had happened to those people, old people from history, old Jews in Europe, not real living modern people like us. Such was this disconnect during those years of deeply internalizing anti-Semitism that when I got to know our East German cousins, who survived the Holocaust as kindertransportees--and whose close friend was Szymon Goldberg, the first violinist of the Berlin Philharmonic who likewise fled Nazi Germany never to return--it still didn't occur to us kids that their relatives were our relatives, and that they were not just ""those people,"" but us. Meanwhile, I don't remember anyone in our family, including our relatives in Chicago, or anyone at Temple or Schul discussing or even mentioning the Holocaust during the years of our upbringing in Georgia. Periodically, though, my parents spoke Yiddish, which they both grew up with and which I did not understand, apart from a few words. Steve doubtless knew more. Could it be that some of their ""crazy Jew talk,"" as my sister once referred to it and I myself tended to think of it, were times when they spoke of what happened in Europe?Around the time my clearly dismayed father caught me trying on a pleated lamp shade as a kind of ballet skirt (I must have been 5), adolescent Steve was invited to join Dad and several of Dad's golfing buddies and their sons on a fishing trip off the Georgia coast. I remember my mother saying something about one of the best-known of the resorts there being ""restricted,"" the term that was used for No Jews Allowed. Dad was an outstanding golfer and I recall some issues around the best golf courses there and their policies of restriction, issues I recalled a short time later when we were among the first Jews to be invited to join the beautiful Idle Hour Golf and Country Club in Macon. Although I had no real interest in fishing or golf (my big sports interest was swimming), I was jealous that Steve, as the older brother, got to go on that Sea Island jaunt and I didn't. Steve, meanwhile, had his own jealousy of me as the younger brother now displacing so much of his family's time, attention and affection. Although I never experienced any of the primal Cain-and-Abel physical violence that can erupt in these circumstances of rivalry among siblings, of the older chick trying to push the younger one out of the nest, one incident stayed with me.At age 5 or so, I acquired a little plastic change holder, a toy version of the metal ones our bus drivers wore on their belts, a gift from my uncle in Chicago who managed a convenience store or from the Macon toy store owned by the Kaufmans, one of the town's oldest Jewish families. (Marian Kaufman, the matriarch and a Weslyan graduate, compiled a history of the Jews of Macon.) Press the various levers and the change holder would dispense quarters, nickels, dimes and pennies. Steve was jealous and after first threatening to destroy it if I didn't stop goading him, he grabbed this favorite toy from me, threw it on the floor and stomped on it as hard as he could and repeatedly, breaking it into many little pieces. I remember crying.  Our Daddy, Dr. Max MassWhatever the incidents, rivalries and other challenges, Dad, a stern disciplinarian, didn't seem partial to any one of his children. Later, I would learn that he was a closet journalist who eventually gave up his writing--except for medical publishing and writing and illustrating children's stories in letters to nephews and nieces--to more fully embrace his calling of medicine. Beyond his gift for literary expression and illustration, he was a skilled visual artist who continued to paint and create even after losing fingers from the skin cancers that were a high risk of the radiologists of his era who handled Cobalt 60 and other radioactive materials in early efforts to treat cancer patients. A heavy smoker, Dad died from cancer of the pancreas at the young age of 63. Whether that cancer was likewise a consequence of radiation exposure we will never know.Beyond a polymathic creativity, there was another of Dad's traits that Steve and I shared. Moreso than our similarly creative sister, and notwithstanding our skills at getting on well with people, the Mass men harbored a notable distrust of humanity, a weltanschauung of humankind as prone to relentless and endless aggression, marauding, plundering and pillaging, which is how Dad characterized history in the journal fragments he left behind. While my sister ardently believed in the promise of progressivism and socialism, Steve and I, like our Dad, and though far from uncaring, were a lot more skeptical of humankind's potential to transcend its baser inclinations.In his last years, Dad became my close friend, to the extent that he was the first relative I came out to. Responding to my inquiry, Dad didn't recall any homosexual inclinations he had ever had as a young amateur boxer and wrestler, and he did express his concern that in professional and social circles I'd be ""found out."" This was 1969, the year of the Stonewall uprising that sparked the modern Gay Liberation Movement in America, but which was still 4 years prior to the declassification of homosexuality as a mental disorder by the American Psychiatric Association. In those days, laws against homosexuality were still universal and there were no civil liberties protections anywhere. Being openly gay was still limited to a handful of very brave activists, like my life partner Arnie Kantrowitz, who I wasn't to meet for another decade. Coming out as I did to my Dad was still highly unusual. A distinguished physician and mammography pioneer who specialized first in pathology and later in radiology and after whom they named the Macon Hospital library the Max Mass Library, Dr. Max Mass died 2 weeks before I was accepted to medical school. By contrast, and though I later came out to him without any discomfort, such was the distance between Steve and me that he was not one I would seek out very often to confide in. The problem was never any level of prejudice or judgment on Steve's part so much as an absence of any genuine or reliable relationship with him, some of this perhaps attributable to his being 6 years older than me. While this failure of bonding might seem a source of enduring enmity, it didn't seem personal because even in those early years of growing up Steve's self-absorption, his remoteness, his closed-offness to intimacy, his reclusiveness, his secrecy, seemed global.  Helen Mitsios with her mother, Rasia KliotThough Steve seemed to know everybody, the only sustained relationship I ever knew him to have had was with an ex-girlfriend, the writer and anthology editor Helen Mitsios, whose collections of Japanese and Icelandic fiction have been praised and who co-authored with her mother a bracing memoir, Waltzing With The Enemy.Waltzing is the story, in her own words, of Rasia Kliot's (Helen's mother) experience of Holocaust survival, and likewise in her own words, of Helen's story of her own coming of age and awareness. The book is divided into two parts, Rasia's Story and Helen's Story. Hiding her Jewishness was the great secret that her mother had kept, so tightly that not even Helen, who she raised as Catholic, knew of it during her own childhood. Helen's loyalty to Steve sustained itself, even as he moved to Berlin and she went on to marry another, architect and landscape artist Tony Winters. Was Helen's enduring relationship with Steve best explained by attraction, codependence, genuine friendship, because of his connections and intersections with the worlds of writers and artists, or a deep empathy that withstood and transcended the not-thereness from which so many of those who knew Steve eventually detached? As described by Helen in Waltzing, ""Like my mother, [Steve] kept the fact that he was Jewish a secret. Like [her], he had a totally different private and public persona. He didn't trust people and assumed everyone was out to take advantage of him...[he] had little faith in human nature. However, in public, his persona was completely different. He was gregarious and an iconoclast, so stylishly oblivious with his beard and plaid flannel shirts that he became the very essence of hip."" Waltzing With The Enemy In the film, Driving Miss Daisy, Patti Lupone plays the 1950's daughter-in-law who, dressed in red-and-green plaids, overdoes Christmas as her way of blending in, just as Miss Daisy (Jessica Tandy) would likewise defuse the surrounding anti-Semitism by being the genteel Southern white lady who, in the wake of the bombing of a local synagogue, must inevitably face her minority kinship with her black chauffeur (Morgan Freeman). Miss Daisy reminded me of our own mother, Mignon Masha Segal Mass Thorpe (after Bill Thorpe of Chester, Pennsylvania, her second husband), who delighted in being called ""Mz. [Mays]"", a pronunciation that made her feel more Southern. For the Mass family children, the drive to assimilate was to take alternate routes. For me, there was opera, Wagner and gay life. For my sister, progressive politics and environmentalism. And for my brother, the enterprise of creativity.Recently, after all those years of estrangement and as facilitated by Helen, Steve, Helen and I had a reunion. Looking remarkably youthful and healthy at 75, ever-observant Steve, on a visit from Berlin where he still resides, had trenchant observations about Germany today. It seems obvious to him that there is no longer any real controversy about Wagner's preeminent and surpassing esteem in German history and culture. Perhaps the most important and influential of those contemporary Wagner lovers and defenders cited by Alex Ross, Chancellor Angela Merkel is a bellwether of Wagner's current place in Germany. So much so that even Steve--whose milieu was pop culture but who majored in philosophy with an emphasis on such German heavies as Marx, Engels, Hegel and Jaspers, and who was once something of a Wagnerite himself--couldn't help but take note of it. Yes, Germany and Bayreuth have done much to distance themselves from the past. So has the American South. But scratch the surface, as Donald Trump has done, and the old prejudices, values and racial loyalties are right there. Though Mrs. Merkel has been scrupulous in distancing herself from overt xenophobes, racists and anti-Semites, and welcoming to immigrants, her championing of Wagner, even with articulate qualifiers, arouses concern in a time of far-right resurgences. When I first became aware of her Wagnerism, I found it troubling. In my fantasies of change in postwar Germany, I somehow imagined that a figure like Merkel, even if she shared a nearly universal appreciation of Wagner as composer and artist, might, as Chancellor, want to keep her distance from the citadel of Hitler's Reich that was Bayreuth; but that, as it turns out, was wishful thinking.Clearly, Helen Mitsios gleaned in Steve Mass some of the same deep wounds, secrecies and honed instincts of survival, and specifically Jewish survival, that were hallmarks of her mother's story. But is her perception of Steve as a kind of survivor and indirect, impassive victim of the Holocaust fully explanatory? Or are the keys to a broader understanding likely to be found as well in other contexts and viewpoints, such as the Japanese literature and sensibility Mitsios, who edited the NYT editor's choice anthology, New Japanese Voices: The Best Contemporary Fiction from Japan, has otherwise shown such an affinity for? Indeed, the story of Steve Mass, which he himself is now endeavoring to write, may be more redolent of the legendary Japanese tale of Roshomon, originally from a medieval Noh play and eventually a Kurosawa film classic.As we finished our pleasant mid-afternoon get-together over coffee and pastry at Greenwich Village's Marlton Arms Hotel, Steve, Helen and I took our leaves cordially. Helen and I embraced. When I turned to embrace Steve, my open arms were met with a two-handed handshake that was at once warm and distancing. When he and I had dinner a few nights later at the Knickerbocker, with its large collection of Hirschfeld portraits of celebrities, neither of us initiated an embrace or handshake, despite the apparent good will on both our parts. Steve had to cut the dinner short, rushing off, as he was always wont to do, this time to catch what he said was the last train to his suburban hosts. The following week I got an email from him that was signed ""Warm Regards."" It was not only the warmest but also the only written expression of well wishes I can recall ever having received from my brother. to be continued"

When you find yourself believing the negative, distracting, and pessimistic things your inner voice says, it's very hard to slow down the momentum of your thoughts.Edward Hallowell, a therapist who helps people deal with disorganized minds, describes what happens when someone falls victim to his myriad of invasive thoughts: ""He makes impulsive judgments, angrily rushing to bring closure. He is robbed of his flexibility, his sense of humor, and his ability to deal with the unknown. He forgets the big picture and the goals and values he stands for. He loses his creativity and his ability to change plans.""An organized mind, on the other hand, falls into a state of flow. Flow is a blissful state of balance, where you are fully immersed in a task, completely free from distracting thoughts. Flow states enable you to enjoy your work and perform at the peak of your potential. Research shows people working in a state of flow are five times more productive than they'd otherwise be.""May what I do flow from me like a river, no forcing and no holding back, the way it is with children."" -Rainer Maria Rilke Here are five steps that I use to organize and declutter my mind, find flow, and keep myself on track for a productive day.Step 1: Find the Right Amount of Challenge in What You DoWhen you're trying to get work done, it's easy to lose focus and succumb to intrusive thoughts when the task at hand is too challenging or too easy. We thrive on a healthy challenge--something that simulates us without being so difficult that it produces anxiety or so simple that it induces boredom. When you consciously and carefully choose a task, you greatly increase your chance of achieving flow.Step 2: Take Control of Your EmotionsWhile it's impossible to control how things make you feel, you have complete control over how you react to your emotions. First, you need to be honest with yourself about what you are feeling and why you are feeling it. From there, it's much easier to channel the emotion into producing the behavior that you want. The key is to identify and label your emotions as you experience them. Associating words with what you are feeling makes the emotion tangible and less mysterious. This helps you to relax, figure out what's behind your emotion, and move forward. If you try to stifle your emotions and tackle your work without addressing them, they will slowly eat away at you and impair your focus.Step 3: Sustain Your FocusWe all know that frustrating feeling of sitting down to tackle something important, only to quickly lose focus when we expected to dive right into the task. It takes time for your mind to become fully immersed in an activity. Studies have shown that it takes five to twenty minutes before people start to focus. If you can force yourself to persist in the activity in spite of any distractions for twenty minutes, the chances are much higher that you will be able to sustain your focus and find a state of flow. The best way to do this is to put away or turn off all of your typical distractions (phones, e-mail, social media), then keep an eye on the clock until you've done nothing but your task for a good 20 minutes, even if you aren't getting much done. Chances are that things will really start cooking for you once you hit the twenty-minute mark.Step 4: Take BreaksOur brains and bodies simply aren't wired for prolonged periods of work. While it might seem as though sitting at your desk for eight hours straight is the best way to get all of your work done, this can work against you. Research has shown that the most productive work cycle tends to be fifty-two minutes of uninterrupted work, followed by seventeen-minute breaks. While it probably isn't realistic to structure your schedule this rigidly, for most people, the battle is won by just remembering to take breaks. Just be certain to pepper several short breaks throughout your day.Step 5: Shift SetsOnce you've taken a break, you must shift your focus back to your task. No matter how ""in the zone"" you were before taking a break, you'll sometimes find that you're back to square one when it comes to focus. To do a proper set shift, you have to reorganize your thoughts by following steps one through four above, especially if you're having trouble diving back into the task. You'll find that getting back into flow quickly after a break is very doable, but it must be done purposefully.Bringing It All TogetherOrganizing your mind to experience flow isn't particularly difficult, but it does require attention and monitoring. Lean on these five steps any time you need to get more done.Have you experienced flow? Please share your thoughts in the comments section below as I learn just as much from you as you do from me."

Aiming to ride this wave of momentum is a new photography exhibition by Denver-based artists Thomas ""Detour"" Evans and Tya Alisa Anthony. In They Still Live the two artists present a series combining DNA, African relics and African Americans in Denver.Credit: Tya Alisa Anthony of They Still Live/Model Willie Watkins wearing a Kpwan mask of the Baule peopleFor the project, Evans and Anthony had each model conduct DNA testing, provided by Ancestry.com. Based on the results models were then photographed with pieces from the Paul Hamilton collection of African art that corresponded with their lineage. The series aims to question assumptions about identity, inspire research into one's heritage and promote global unity. We spoke with Evans and Anthony to learn more about their project, which runs June 30 to July 24 at RedLine in Denver, Colorado. Recently there have been many stories on African Americans who are doing genetic tests to trace their roots. In this way your series is very timely. What cultural, social and/or political factors do you think has brought about this renewed interest?Tya Alisa Anthony: Advancements in technology have finally caught up to the desire of many African Americans looking to discover their heritage due to our complex history here in America. Where it would seem other cultures typically have the ability to trace their ancestral paths through documentation for example, African Americans typically have not possessed this tool. But now the affordability and process to submit a DNA sample has never been so convenient with the help of technology and the Internet.Thomas ""Detour"" Evans: I would also add that the initiative by people like Henry Louis Gates, Jr. has made a profound impact on the views of many. Gates' testing of hip-hop legends has created a narrative that learning about oneself is possible, liberating and cool.Credit: Thomas Evans of They still Live/Panama Soweto with Kota ReliquaryHow does this project address the reality of the uneasy relationship some black communities have with genetic technology due to the legacy of eugenics?Evans: During the process of bringing the project to life, I actually found that the opposite was true. I found that every individual I discussed the project with was ecstatic about the possibility of learning more about their lineage. Each person had stories that were passed down through generations and in a way became their unofficial identity. Although there has been a history of healthy skepticism towards anything related to genetics in the African American community, I see a shedding of the protective armor. I believe not only time, but the inclusion of African American owned DNA testing companies have played an important part in rebuilding trust in the industry.As creators of the project you both submitted to DNA testing. What were those findings and how did they impact your approach to self and the series?Evans: The results of my test revealed that I was estimated to be 91% African (29% Cameroon/Congo, 29% Ivory Coast/Ghana, 13% Mali, 11% Senegal, 3% Nigeria, 3% Benin and Togo, 2% other) and 9% European (4% Great Britain, 4% Ireland, 1% Scandinavian). The results were something that I expected, but to know the regions and the percentages was very liberating. Looking into the mirror I feel like I know myself a little better. I want to actually visit those regions, walk the land and experience the environment. Knowing that my identity is more than just the broad label of African American, I have a deeper connection with others around me. Anthony: DNA results revealed my ethnicity is of West African descent from Benin and Togo. As a community driven visual artist exploring the theme of identity, the results have inspired me to continue to connect and research not only traditional but contemporary art and culture of my origins.

Aiming to ride this wave of momentum is a new photography exhibition by Denver-based artists Thomas ""Detour"" Evans and Tya Alisa Anthony. In They Still Live the two artists present a series combining DNA, African relics and African Americans in Denver.Credit: Tya Alisa Anthony of They Still Live/Model Willie Watkins wearing a Kpwan mask of the Baule peopleFor the project, Evans and Anthony had each model conduct DNA testing, provided by Ancestry.com. Based on the results models were then photographed with pieces from the Paul Hamilton collection of African art that corresponded with their lineage. The series aims to question assumptions about identity, inspire research into one's heritage and promote global unity. We spoke with Evans and Anthony to learn more about their project, which runs June 30 to July 24 at RedLine in Denver, Colorado. Recently there have been many stories on African Americans who are doing genetic tests to trace their roots. In this way your series is very timely. What cultural, social and/or political factors do you think has brought about this renewed interest?Tya Alisa Anthony: Advancements in technology have finally caught up to the desire of many African Americans looking to discover their heritage due to our complex history here in America. Where it would seem other cultures typically have the ability to trace their ancestral paths through documentation for example, African Americans typically have not possessed this tool. But now the affordability and process to submit a DNA sample has never been so convenient with the help of technology and the Internet.Thomas ""Detour"" Evans: I would also add that the initiative by people like Henry Louis Gates, Jr. has made a profound impact on the views of many. Gates' testing of hip-hop legends has created a narrative that learning about oneself is possible, liberating and cool.Credit: Thomas Evans of They still Live/Panama Soweto with Kota ReliquaryHow does this project address the reality of the uneasy relationship some black communities have with genetic technology due to the legacy of eugenics?Evans: During the process of bringing the project to life, I actually found that the opposite was true. I found that every individual I discussed the project with was ecstatic about the possibility of learning more about their lineage. Each person had stories that were passed down through generations and in a way became their unofficial identity. Although there has been a history of healthy skepticism towards anything related to genetics in the African American community, I see a shedding of the protective armor. I believe not only time, but the inclusion of African American owned DNA testing companies have played an important part in rebuilding trust in the industry.As creators of the project you both submitted to DNA testing. What were those findings and how did they impact your approach to self and the series?Evans: The results of my test revealed that I was estimated to be 91% African (29% Cameroon/Congo, 29% Ivory Coast/Ghana, 13% Mali, 11% Senegal, 3% Nigeria, 3% Benin and Togo, 2% other) and 9% European (4% Great Britain, 4% Ireland, 1% Scandinavian). The results were something that I expected, but to know the regions and the percentages was very liberating. Looking into the mirror I feel like I know myself a little better. I want to actually visit those regions, walk the land and experience the environment. Knowing that my identity is more than just the broad label of African American, I have a deeper connection with others around me. Anthony: DNA results revealed my ethnicity is of West African descent from Benin and Togo. As a community driven visual artist exploring the theme of identity, the results have inspired me to continue to connect and research not only traditional but contemporary art and culture of my origins. I have found a spiritual and emotional connection to my heritage and look forward to where it will lead me in the future as a visual artist.Credit: Thomas Evans of They still Live/Ietef Hotep Vita in Great Sand Dunes National Park and PreserveIn what ways do you hope this project challenges the concept of race in America?

Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential candidate headlines the 2016 Western Conservative Summit at the Colorado Convention Center in Denver, July 01, 2016. It is the 7th annual Western Conservative Summit.

After I saw the amazing show, the sound track kept reverberating through my head. And in a parallel universe, I kept thinking about Donald Trump as a historical travesty. So I started writing hip-hop songs, for what became Drumpf: the Musical My son, Gabriel Kuttner, who is an actor, director, and producer, thought it wasn't half bad. Gabe reached out to an acclaimed hip-hop artist who he knows, Miguel B. Hart, who raps as Virtuoso. Miguel, a multi-talented composer, producer and rapper, set the songs to music, and assembled a cast of other rappers. He also plays Trump, with a wig that needs to be more disheveled. Gabe further connected us to Ron Wyman, an indie filmmaker celebrated for his films about politics, world culture and the arts. Ron directed and shot our videos.I did all this at first as a lark, or sometimes as procrastination from my usual deadlines, but it became kind of an obsession and the songs almost kept writing themselves. There is something serious here, too. Conventional politics and media are failing to get to the essence of Trump as fraud, thief and huckster. Maybe parody can do it.The great thing about writing a musical about Trump is that you are never short of material. The challenge is to keep it on the level of parody--because whenever you come up with a premise that seems completely over the top, Trump goes and does it.The first video from the show that we put online is a song called, ""It Couldda Been Us,"" in which Trump is mercilessly humiliating Chris Christie, dangling the possibility of making Christie his running mate.  A few hours after our video went live last Thursday, the headlines were reporting that Christie had become a major Trump adviser and was a leading candidate for Trump's veep. You can't make this stuff up.Trump seems invulnerable to stumbles that would sink an ordinary politician ten times over. The one thing that manages to pierce his armor is ridicule. Our genre is homage to Hamilton, but our title is homage to John Oliver. I'm not giving up my day job, as editor, political writer, and college professor. But at least the Trump phenomenon, which is so ominous for our democracy, is producing some black humor, maybe even humor that will have some impact. Writing a musical seems out-of-character for me, but not quite totally. I've been writing skits and comedy bits since high school. I produced and co-wrote a political comedy radio show in college. I also write a lot of poetry. My mom and dad met in high school, working together on musical theatre, and my son is the genuine actor and director in the family.Hip-hop is a stretch, though at my 25th reunion at Oberlin, an outpost of idealism in the tundra of northeastern Ohio, I wrote and presented a new, hip-hop version of the College alma mater, which has the hilarious, earnest, late 19th Century title, ""Oberlin, Brave Mother."" (Sample lyric: ""The wind and the rain here/drive me insane. But I'm the bravest mutha/from Elyria to Lorain.""We hope to premiere Drumpf at a venue near the DNC the last week of July in Philadelphia, and then to bring a one-hour version to several cities. Our expectation is that the show will have a short, intense run, and then, mercifully, close November 8, after which it will be of mainly historic interest. Here is the script to one of my favorites, a song called Cognitive Dis. And there are 20 more, and counting.Cognitive DisReporter: Brother Falwell, will you please explain This man is a serial adulterer, sex on the brain He invokes Jesus and the Gipper But his casino has strippers He goes through contortion To 'splain his flips on abortion When he tried to cite Corinthians  To get your vote He messed up the quote He never prays He's soft on gays I always thought evangelists Were Biblical literalists He doesn't love his brother How can you support this mutha?Rev. Falwell. Sir, you don't need to shout Reconciliation's what it's all aboutReporter: (exasperated) But he praises Planned Parenthood, for Chrissake!  Uh, excuse me.Falwell. He no longer backs abortion. Don't you see?Reporter. But that's posturing, pretention.Falwell. No sir, it's redemption. We welcome sinners back to the flock That shouldn't be a shock.Reporter. You don't see hypocrisy?Falwell. We need to save democracy. And my people are with Trump They have a thirst  for redeeming the country; that comes first. If they see him as a prophet, who am I to refuse? I don't feel used. I feel blest. He'll save the Christian West. He represents a righteous wave at its crest (candidly, stage whisper) And if I didn't back Trump I would be dumped. I would be swept.Reporter: Jesus Wept!Trump (to audience): Is that beautiful, or what? You see what I've got? If the people feel flattered Contradictions don't matter I once studied psych, I learned a phrase that I like A phrase that just stays With me. It's called cognitive dissonance. It makes all the difference Cognitive dis It works like this:Woman: I'm voting for Trump, he speaks his mind.Reporter. But he calls women fat pigs. Is that kind?Woman: Not a deal-breaker. He's not a faker. The times are tough. We need someone a little rough.Trump. Cognitive dis! Hey, honey, give me a kiss. Man. Trump will fight big money. He's for regular folk.Reporter. But that has to be a joke.  He's a billionaire! He screwed his workersMan. They were probably shirkers. You see he understands the bankers, he knows how to deal And he knows how I feel.Reporter. I see you've given it some thought.Man. More than you, media fool. [beat] He can't be bought Can you relate? He tells it straight, he's cool.Trump. Cognitive dis, you gotta love it. And cognitive dis is deep in our soul If you are honest about America's role Our national myths are built on fictions We have a flair for contradictions.All men created equal, it's emblazoned on Jefferson's grave. But he had slaves. And he loved his slaves. Well, he loved Sally Hemmings. My God, Americans are lemmings! All men are equal except the African Who is three-fifths of a man. In every war we were united So we could fight it For the United States...and United Fruit America was pleased to prostitute Our ideals for corporate appeals In Iran we staged a coup back in 53 Was that for you, was it for me? Naw, it was all about oil The place is still at a boil (slowly) So before you hiss, consider this America is built on cognitive dis.And a Happy Fourth of July to all!!Robert Kuttner is co-editor of The American Prospect and professor at Brandeis University's Heller School.

It was about country, non-partisan and without overt religiosity, and for a kid, the only time blowing stuff up was celebrated by your parents. I loved seeing American Flags everywhere and walking my childhood neighborhood that hosted ghosts from The War of Independence.I lived in a two-story red brick row house wedged between Kings Highway, Flatlands and Flatbush, a historic location where British General Cornwallis in 1776 camped his massive troops. I loved the historic church at that location with moss covered cemetery plots. I attended Boy Scout events there as well as walked by this sacred ground going and coming from school at PS119 every day. I loved contemplating how old the dates were on the headstones. Blowing up stuff on July 4th in this neighborhood was cool with history.Later in life, living with dogs, my love of fireworks turned into anticipation, anxiety and awkward reminders of the ugliness of war. Yet just as the New York Times proudly posts in its July 4th newspaper a full version of the Declaration of Independence, I have a quiet ritual of reflecting on how lucky I have been to live my life in this country. Today, as I write this, I am aglow with celebrating how many glass ceilings have shattered lately, freeing us all from historic restrictions, and honoring vital words enshrined in our founding documents.I lamented most of my educated adult life the fact that our Founders were privileged white men protecting their privilege. Although they were married to women and had daughters, some had slaves, some became biologically interconnected with their slaves, and in the context of their world, despite such intimate experiences, failed to see their own hypocrisy of establishing a society legalizing depriving equal rights to all classes of people.Today, because of the stubborn vigilance and unwavering passion of activists relentlessly pushing our society to actualize and legalize the implied spirit of our founding documents, President Barack Obama prepares to become our first Black Ex-President, Hillary Rodham Clinton has become the first woman nominee for the presidency who hopefully will be the first woman president, and the LGBT community has full and equal rights.But, there is much more work that needs to be completed. None of which will occur if the guy who broke another glass ceiling by being the first totally non-qualified ""man-baby"" huckster to win his party's nomination for president wins in November. In the land of the free and brave on July 4th we celebrate the full scope of ""independence"" including the risk that ""any one"" can become president and blow stuff up."

Americans marched in star-spangled parades, ran relay races, gathered for fireworks shows and crowned a new world hot dog eating champion as they celebrated Independence Day in traditional style on Saturday. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/60d421aa2600005b2b51eb7d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On public holidays, Americans salute their military. This Fourth of July will be no exception. In big cities and small towns across America, families will line the streets to watch Fourth of July parades, and sports stadiums around the country will bring veterans of all ages to center field, lighting up the skies with fireworks and paying homage to our military heroes. Then the fireworks will be over, the parades will have passed by, and most Americans will return to their daily activities, with little attention paid to veterans and families until the next parade.With less than one percent of American having served on the battlefield, most don't have personal connections to those who have served. And hundreds of thousands of those who have served are coming home: some 250,000 men and women in uniform are now transitioning each year to civilian life. Veterans and their families want a return to normalcy when they return home. But the military culture that serves to protect men and women while in service does not mesh with nor well- prepare them for civilian life. For far too many, their new neighborhoods are foreign, their families are estranged, and they are out of sync with what used to be home. Ask veterans what they want and most will say that a return to normalcy starts with meaningful employment. American corporations and small businesses have admirably set significant targets for hiring our returning veterans and veteran unemployment continues to fall. Yet 50 percent of veterans leave their jobs within a year and 65 percent do so within the first two years. Forty seven percent of post 9/11 veterans report they are not working in their preferred career field. San Diego's Operation REBOOT started by the National Veterans Transition Services, has become a model for how to help veterans achieve what they are looking for. The focus is not just on hiring but on finding the right fit. REBOOT personnel understand both the military culture from which veterans are emerging and the civilian culture that they are about to enter. At the heart of REBOOT's Centers for Military and Veteran Reintegration is a free, three-week workshop, designed to holistically address transition from military to civilian life. Going far beyond typical career transition programs, participants are given in-depth re-socialization training that culturally prepares them for civilian life after the military. They also undergo career assessments to help determine what career after the military is their best fit, and participate in mock interviews with real human resource professionals to hone their newly acquired skills. The results: for the past six years, REBOOT's graduates have shown a 97 percent placement rate into gainful employment or post-secondary education, and 89 percent second-year job retention.REBOOT works with many local partners to achieve their goals. One such partner is Vets' Community Connections (VCC), a new national initiative with pilot community programs in San Diego, Maricopa County (Phoenix), Arizona and St. Joseph's County (South Bend), Indiana. VCC is based on the premise that many more Americans, from all walks of life, can devote whatever limited time they have to help veterans and military families build the new community networks they need to succeed in civilian life. Within the three pilot communities, VCC is stitching together effective community coalitions - local Chambers of Commerce, elected officials, VISTA volunteers, SalesForce databases, local veteran and military family organizations, media outlets, civic groups and community volunteers from teachers to dentists to Little League coaches - all working together. Local 2-1-1 call centers are the force multipliers, linking veterans and families with those in the community ready to take their calls to answer reintegration and relocation questions. Taken together, REBOOT and VCC are addressing the small but very real needs of veterans and family members -- how everyday Americans can use what time they have to help returning vets and their families translate interests into careers, and linking vets and spouses with fellow citizens already pursuing those careers: new local contacts who can help veterans or family members decide whether a particular career path is really for them (and, if so, how best to pursue it).Almost eighty percent of all new jobs are never advertised, but found thru personal connections. REBOOT and VCC are just two of the new initiatives taking root in communities to help bridge the civilian-military divide with practical, pragmatic steps that give veterans and their families tangible links to real people, meaningful employment and new community networks.Who are those real people? That's all of us. Something not just to think or talk about but to act on between the parades.Retired US Navy Master Chief Petty Officer Maurice Wilson is co-founder of OPERATION REBOOT. Former Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Doug Wilson and organizational management specialist Kari McDonough are co-founders of Vets Community Connections."
