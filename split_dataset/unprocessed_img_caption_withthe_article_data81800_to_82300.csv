Police In The Wake Of The Boston Marathon Bombings",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55bb97691400002f002e1935.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale," This police department knows how to keep it cool.Officers in Warner Robins, Georgia, issued ice cream treats instead of tickets to residents on Thursday, the Telegraph reported. The initiative was part of a fundraiser for a nearby children’s hospital -- and the results were pretty sweet.“Traffic Stops For Blizzards” was the city’s effort to support Dairy Queen’s Miracle Treat Day -- an annual event with the company that partners with the Children’s Miracle Network Hospital. For every treat sold on July 30, 1 dollar or more was donated to hospitals in the network, among them Macon’s Children’s Hospital Navicent Health, in an effort to raise awareness for pediatric health.However, recipients first had to make a violation to merit the sweet treat. “If I don’t follow procedure, I’m violating [the]Fourth Amendment rights of the people I pull over, officer Ed Smith told the Telegraph. But the offenses were minor, and resulted in ice cream over a fine.“I’m kind of glad I got pulled over now,” Logan Watson, who was pulled over for faulty tail lights, said to the news outlet.The police department’s sweet act comes a month after a Minnesota officer spent his last day on the job handing out gift cards to people in his community. Cmdr. Brian Peters, of Brooklyn City, surprised residents with $50 certificates to Target and a local grocery store, ABC News reported. ""My goal was to walk around the city and just find people that could maybe use a little extra cash or income to buy the kids some toys,” Peters told the news outlet.According to the Miracle Treat Day website, nearly $2 million will be donated to children’s hospitals across the country.Also on HuffPost:"

He qualified, barely, to take part in the main event.The real focus, of course, will be on Donald Trump, the gold-toned billionaire whose fact-free populist spiel is winning him support now -- even as it makes a mockery of political debate. The format tonight should limit his ability to trump the field, but the sheer number of people on stage will also make any true discussion all but impossible.It seems all too appropriate that the Fox News/GOP show will air on the very same night that Jon Stewart ends his 16-year run as host of ""The Daily Show,"" the chief aim of which was to make sense of politics by making ruthless fun of it. ""The Daily Show"" didn't create the public's cynical attitude, but it crystallized a whole generation's sense of politics as tolerable only if seen at an ironic distance.And what of the people of Cleveland, a Democratic, union-oriented stronghold that Republicans think is ripe for the taking? Do the GOP's leading candidates have new proposals that are serious and that could work -- other than cutting taxes for the better-off and government services for all?People will be listening, even if there is no Jon Stewart to parse what the candidates say, or don't say."

And taking tenofovir tablets instead of the gel doesn't have the same benefit,"" he said. ""You see some protection with tablets, but the levels of protection are much lower.""HSV-2 virus infects about one in five sexually active adults worldwide, or about 417 million people aged 15 to 49 years old, the study team writes in the New England Journal of Medicine. The virus is the most common cause of genital ulcers, and in South Africa, the estimated infection rate is 50 percent to 60 percent. Throughout Sub-Saharan Africa the rate is thought to be as high as 80 percent in women and 50 percent in men.Condoms provide the best protection, but even that is limited because the virus can be shed and acquired by other parts of the groin not shielded by a condom, Abdool Karim said.Oral tenofovir is used to prevent and treat HIV. The test of its ability to protect against genital herpes was grafted onto an existing study, which ultimately demonstrated that the gel reduced the odds of getting HIV by 39 percent.Among the 422 women enrolled in the herpes study, half were given applicators with the drug-infused gel and the rest were given a placebo gel. They were told to insert the gel within 12 hours before they expected to have sex and as soon as possible within 12 hours after sex. The women were tracked for an average of 18 months.The study results indicate that topical tenofovir can reduce HSV-2 acquisition by almost half, said Dr. Connie Celum, director of the International Clinical Research Center at the University of Washington in Seattle, by email.""This is significant, given the lack of other interventions to reduce HSV-2 acquisition other than condoms,"" said Celum, who was not connected with the study.The drug worked best among women who used the gel religiously. When drug levels in the vagina were high, the annual rate of herpes-2 infection was less than 6 percent compared to almost 16 percent when there was no detectable tenofovir in the vaginal fluid.The study did not detail side effects, although an earlier report available online says the drug can increase the risk of mild diarrhea.""Because it's in the gel formulation, it leads to very high levels in the genital tract and very low levels in the blood, so very little is absorbed and you get very limited side effects,"" Abdool Karim said. ""We did see a slight increase in mild diarrhea and it wasn't statistically significant.""There was also concern that the gel might show adverse effects in the kidneys and bones, he said, but ""with the gel formation, we didn't see either of those problems.""A key question is whether women will actually use it when the gel gets to market.""We've had a mixed bag of results in trying to get women to use tenofovir gel for HIV protection,"" said Abdool Karim. ""The main concern has been many of these young individuals who are at highest risk for herpes and HIV don't actually consider themselves at risk. They don't appreciate their risk. It's the same for alcohol consumption, dangerous driving or smoking or any of these things.""SOURCE: http://bit.ly/1DgJ5jF New England Journal of Medicine, online August 5, 2015.Also on HuffPost: "

He's written a few movies along the way, but it's ""The Gift,"" which opens on Friday and marks Edgerton's directorial debut, that will put him on the auteur map.A taut thriller in the same vein as ""The Hand That Rocks The Cradle"" and ""Fatal Attraction,"" the film follows a married couple, Simon (Jason Bateman) and Robyn (Rebecca Hall), who have just moved from Chicago to a lavish home in the Hollywood Hills. While shopping for housewares one afternoon, they encounter one of Simon's high-school classmates, formerly nicknamed Gordo the Weirdo (Edgerton). The old acquaintance later deposits a harmless bottle of wine on their doorstep, but after Simon and Robyn invite him over for dinner, Gordo's presence quickly becomes a bit too pervasive. Gordo says he wants to ""let bygones be bygones,"" and with that, hidden pasts begin to emerge. The Huffington Post sat down with Edgerton, now a 41-year-old triple threat, at our offices last week to discuss what went into crafting his first project behind the camera.It's been a while since you started working on this movie.Yeah, it was 2010 when I started writing. But I think the evolution of screenplays for me tends to be about that much time. They wouldn’t take as long if I wasn’t doing other work in between. I think if I was just a dedicated writer, it would hopefully be a quicker evolution, because it is a long time. I’m happy this one took the time it took. I think if I’d have made the movie a year ago or two years ago, it would not be the piece of work it is today. Particularly for such a carefully plotted and paced movie, it probably really benefited from that gestation period. Did it start with a desire to tell a stalker story?It started with the story of a bully and his wife. What’s interesting is it’s always been, from the very first draft, seen through the eye of Rebecca Hall’s character, Robyn. My instinct was that an audience needs something to hold on to, and that needs to be something that they can trust -- and she’s the only person they can really trust in the movie. So the second draft became even more about seeing things through her eyes. Only for a couple of very important moments do we deviate from that.The tension does stem from Robyn's perspective. What guideposts did you use in writing a movie from the viewpoint of the triangle's outsider, seeing as the conflict is primarily between your and Jason Bateman's characters?I learned a very important lesson by watching “Caché,” the Michael Haneke movie, and a lot of lessons from great stalker movies like “Fatal Attraction.” The great fear actually doesn’t come when the person pops out of the cupboard; the great fear is waiting for the person to pop out of the cupboard. In “Caché,” that person kind of stayed in the cupboard. Essentially they were in the shadow, actively taunting this couple -- or this man -- in a way that I was like, “Wow, I don’t even know who the villain is and I’m kind of terrified.” I wanted to take those triangle thrillers that we’re all so familiar with and hold the audience’s hand going down that road for the first third of the movie, and then just start messing with those conventions. In our case, it's about bullying and the idea of what roles we play and how we can affect each other with words and stories, how we can plant seeds that can destroy a person, and also who’s your partner and how well do you know them, which I think resonates with a lot of people.Much of the film takes place inside the couple's glass house. How important was finding the right aesthetics for the home where Simon and Robyn are stalked?What was beautiful about that house is it’s the kind of place where you want to live. We wanted the lifestyle of this couple to feel aspirational. They’re not out of touch with us, but it’s a nice life they’re living. It’s a house we’d like to move into. And then we allow it, throughout the film, to transform into a place where you don’t want to be, particularly at night, with that fishbowl where lights are on inside and people lurking outside can see you. It’s an unsettling place to be. I knew that 75 percent of the movie was in that house. Giving the house a beauty and giving the audience something beautiful to look at is very key. You wrote movies before ""The Gift."" What made it the one you wanted to direct?For very practical reasons. I’d written a movie, “Felony,” when I wasn’t quite ready to direct. It had a lot of moving parts in it. It felt like it wasn’t the right thing for me to do, and my responsibility as an actor in that film was a bit too large to play double duty. This one, I’d written with the intention of playing Gordo. It was once I started writing the screenplay that I thought, given the whole villain-recedes-into-the-shadows aspect of it, Gordo was only in a third of the movie and it may be possible to do both duties. And, if anything, I could always cast another actor in the role of Gordo and sit back and direct. But the practical limitations I had making my first movie were always in my mind.What were those limitations? I needed to find something that wouldn’t cost too much money because first-time directors don’t get a bottomless pocket full of change. And it’s something contained in the amount of locations and the amount of characters -- something I felt like I could hold in my head without it causing me too much chaos and stress. Once I started writing this, I thought, “This is actually quite a contained movie. It shouldn’t cost us too much money."" Then the only obstacle left was: Would anybody finance it? And, could I get over my fear of directing, which was definitely preventing me from doing it sooner?You're distributing the movie through a brand-new studio. Does that mean finding financing was difficult? We tried all sorts of things early on to finance the film. It was a real chicken-or-the-egg scenario. It’s like, do you get the actors and allow the strength of having the actors onboard to raise the finances? Or do you raise the finances and then use it to make offers to actors? It’s almost complete opposite versions of making movies.Which do you think is the main model in Hollywood right now?I feel like it’s a bit of both. There are benefits to both. If you go actor-first, you’re actually usually lucky because that actor who comes on board, if you’ve made the right choice, is an independent, self-confident person. They’re the person who says, “I’ll partner with you and together the money will come.” Any actor partnering up with a first-time director -- I know this as an actor -- is taking a big confidence risk. It’s sometimes the most wonderful risk to take, but you can also fall on your face. So I really respect Jason and Rebecca for taking that risk with me.So you found the actors first?Well, I had talked to Jason and Rebecca, and I knew they were both interested. They were both willing to take the plunge, and very soon after that, Jason Blum read the script. He knew it wasn’t his usual red-title, buckets-of-blood horror-type movie, but just something about it really grabbed him -- something about the suspense of it. He said that he just loved the script, and to his credit, that first day he told me he wanted to make the movie with me and he’d let me make it however I wanted to make it and he wouldn’t get in my way creatively. With a first-time director, he doesn't usually make that plunge. But he felt that my experience as an actor kind of equated to having more experience than an otherwise first-time director would have on set. They came to the party and it started to roll down the hill quite easily.You seem more invigorated than discouraged by this experience, which is great. What's the biggest thing you've learned about Hollywood? It's the idea that, as an actor, when you finish a movie, you’ve been responsible for one part of the puzzle. You arrive a third of the way through the process, which is the production phase. When an actor turns up and checks out their trailer and asks for a latte, there’s a whole world that’s gone on -- a whole world of thinking and decision-making that’s arrived at that moment. When the whole puzzle doesn’t come together, you can just stand back and go, “Well, I did my bit.” And if the puzzle comes together incredibly well, who’s the first standing in line, waving their hand and pointing at themselves? It’s a very luxurious position as an actor. You’re on the front battle line because it’s your head on screen, but you have the choice to pick up your sword or wave the white flag, depending on how it all turns out. As a director, there is no white flag. You just have a sword. Especially as a writer and director, you built the sword. You better hope the sword works in the battle. And I love that responsibility. I love a crew now more than I ever loved a crew, and I’ve always loved a crew.I’m very pleased to know that so far the reception of it has been good, too, because otherwise I would feel a little deluded. I finished the movie and said, “I think we’ve made something really great.” Like all movies, it’s not going to be for everybody. But for what we set out to achieve, we’ve really kind of landed in a place where we’re going, “Well, fuck, how did we do that?”I assume there's more directing in your future.Absolutely. Absolutely. I loved it. I’ll definitely be doing it again.Also on HuffPost:For a constant stream of entertainment news and discussion, follow HuffPost Entertainment on Viber."

The Pennsylvania attorney general is also suing Think Finance, a Texas-based finance company connected to Plain Green, in federal court for alleged violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.""None of the Plaintiffs in this action can access any of the records relating to their loans from Plain Green, including any purported arbitration agreement,"" the complaint states.The complaint says that the Chippewa Cree laws that the loans are subject to are not available online, and that ""organizations -- like law school libraries -- will not provide a copy... by remote access"" because Plain Green executives ""have not granted them the right do to do."" Plain Green's loan agreement states that the loans are governed by the laws of the Chippewa Cree tribe of Montana, which owns the company. However, as The Huffington Post recently reported, the tribe’s ownership of Plain Green is nominal at best: The company is part of a growing trend of ""rent-a-tribe"" operations, where off-reservation finance companies use tribal sovereignty as a shield to try to evade state lending regulations and consumer protection laws.Company documents, which HuffPost first published in June, have now been filed in the Vermont class action case. They show that the tribe receives just a tiny fraction of the company’s revenues and plays little part in running the business. The Chippewa Cree tribe only receives between 4.5 percent and 5.5 percent of the revenues generated by the company. (A term sheet outlining the deal notes that the company was to be 51 percent owned by the tribe. A recent tribal resolution submitted in court states that Plain Green is ""wholly owned"" by the Chippewa Cree.)The bulk of the operation’s incoming cash -- an estimated $500 million to $700 million a year -- flows off the reservation to Think Finance and to other third parties, including an anonymous Cayman Islands limited liability company.The latest complaint adds Ken Rees, the former chairman and CEO of Think Finance and current CEO of Elevate, a lending company spun off of Think Finance last year, as a defendant, along with the venture capital firms Sequoia Capital and Technology Crossover Ventures, both investors in Think Finance.The complaint points to Sequoia and TCV's intensive due diligence processes, which include an analysis of legal risk. It alleges that they were ""fully aware"" of how Think Finance and Plain Green operated, and that they ""knew that the practices violated the law"" before they decided to invest.  ""The very purpose of an online lender affiliating with a tribe is specifically and expressly so that they can lend in violation of state laws,"" Ellen Harnick, a payday lending expert at the Center For Responsible Lending, told HuffPost in June.In a statement to HuffPost, Plain Green CEO Joel Rosette said the amended suit ""is a transparently desperate attempt to inject new life into a baseless lawsuit full of allegations that are not only false but are also disparaging to all members of the Chippewa Cree Tribe.""The amended lawsuit claims that the complex structure of its subsidiaries is an effort on the part of Think Finance and Rees ""to isolate and decrease any liability they may face.""Think Finance and TCV declined to comment for this article. Sequoia did not return requests for comment.CORRECTION: This article previously stated that the Pennsylvania attorney general is suing Plain Green in federal court. They are in fact suing Think Finance, a related company. Language has also been amended to reflect that Plain Green's loans are governed by tribal law because of language in the loan agreements themselves, and not solely due to the tribe's ownership role with the company."
7,POLITICS,Why Republicans Can't Convince People They Care About Inequality,Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-care-inequality_us_55c3ac57e4b0f1cbf1e4280f,"""It's the one form of bigotry that is still allowed in America, and that's bigotry against the successful.""",2015-08-06,<p>Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55c3acdf1d00006e0014413c.jpeg?cache=z1RqHDoJkj&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"American income inequality is a disaster for Republicans. Not for their donors, who are the principal beneficiaries of the new Gilded Age -- but for their politicians. Consider Phil Gramm. Last week, the former Republican senator from Texas was the principal GOP witness at a hearing before the House Financial Services Committee. His task was, essentially, to spout Republican-friendly econ talk for a couple of hours, and blame all of the nation's economic woes on Democrats.Gramm used this platform to bemoan the plight of the super-rich.""It's the one form of bigotry that is still allowed in America, and that's bigotry against the successful,"" Gramm declared.He went on to describe his ""good friend Ed Whitacre,"" a former AT&T CEO who was pilloried for accepting what Gramm described as a $75 million retirement package (it was actually $158.5 million). According to Gramm, the payout should have been even bigger.""He added billions of dollars in value,"" Gramm said. ""He was exploited! It was an outrage!""Hear Gramm's comments, and learn about his role in the 2008 financial crash, in The Huffington Post's ""So That Happened"" podcast below. The action starts at 29:27.Gramm isn't some random voice howling in the wilderness. He taught House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) economics in college, and did the same for former Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R), who is again seeking the GOP presidential nomination. He was also co-chair of the 2008 presidential campaign for Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) -- until he claimed the U.S. was suffering from ""a mental recession"" due to the country devolving into ""a nation of whiners.""But Gramm keeps getting invited back to major GOP platforms, because a lot of Republicans love what he has to say. At last week's hearing, GOP lawmakers were fawning all over him.Gramm's inflammatory testimony makes two basic points, which can ultimately be reduced to the same grotesque idea. One: Rich people deserve to be rich. They get paid a lot because they are valuable. Two: People who complain about their station in life have no grounds to do so unless they are rich, because rich people take too much flak from an envious public.Behind both of these is the same idea: The economic world is fair. If you make a lot of money, it's because you are talented and work hard. If you don't make a lot of money, it's because you really don't have that much to offer society. The determinations of the market are the just distributions of a free, democratic nation.This is, of course, wrong. All kinds of people get rich -- smart and stupid, virtuous and vile. J.K. Rowling is rich. So is Donald Trump.This is a problem for Republican presidential contenders, not only because some of them may actually believe the Gramm Doctrine. They also have to deal with a donor base and crowd of primary voters who very much want to believe that the world is fair. If they work hard enough, they can make it, and nobody deserves their hard-earned money in a welfare check. Obama has been giving away the farm while they've been out working the fields.But if you want to deal with economic inequality, there are only two real options. One is to dramatically restructure markets so that private sector outcomes are less inegalitarian -- for example, by enforcing antitrust laws, breaking up the monopolies and oligopolies that dominate the U.S. economy, giving workers more say in how companies are managed, cracking down on predatory finance, and curbing the political influence of wealthy managers and shareholders.The other option is to accept inegalitarian market outcomes, but redistribute the winnings of the top tier, elevating those who didn't win big.GOP orthodoxy has been opposed to both of these strategies for decades. Ask a Republican member of Congress what's wrong with the American economy, and they'll echo other elements of Gramm's testimony, saying that too many meddling regulators are holding back The Job Creators. So much for restructuring markets.But the GOP also hates policies that redistribute wealth. In the 1970s, it was Ronald Reagan railing against welfare recipients. In 2012, it was former Massachussetts Gov. Mitt Romney and the incorrigible ""47 percent."" Today, it's former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker bashing the very existence of a minimum wage (though Bush toned down his attack after some negative press).But that hasn't stopped Walker and Bush from portraying conventional conservative policies as a cure for today's inequality, even as they have fueled a new Gilded Age. Bush's Super PAC is called ""Right To Rise"" -- suggesting that he alone has the prescription for helping the poor vault out of poverty. His campaign has hired Glenn Hubbard, a chief architect of George W. Bush's tax cuts benefiting the wealthy.

""And what I mean is destroy the phone so that no one can ever, you know, reset it or do something where I feel like the information is available to anybody.""In upholding the suspension, Goodell cited in part Brady's decision to get rid of the phone on the same day he was interviewed by Ted Wells, a prominent attorney hired by the NFL to probe the scandal.During the 10-hour hearing, Brady said no one told him that failing to hand over evidence would result in discipline.The two sides are expected to appear in court on Aug. 12 before U.S. District Judge Richard Berman. Both the NFL and the union have asked Berman to decide whether to uphold the suspension by Sept. 4, six days before the season begins.The union claims Goodell was not an impartial arbiter because he had praised Wells' work before the appeal, while the league has argued that Goodell was authorized to conduct the hearing under its labor agreement.In his report, Wells faulted two Patriots employees but concluded that Brady was ""generally aware"" of the plan to deflate footballs, which can make them easier to grip.At the hearing, Brady said, ""I never in the history of my career, I never thought about the inflation level of a ball,"" according to the transcript.Goodell also fined the Patriots $1 million and forfeited two of the team's future draft picks.The Patriots defeated the Seattle Seahawks 28-24 in the Super Bowl, giving Brady his fourth championship and cementing his place as one of the greatest players in NFL history.

The junk poses a huge collision-risk to current and future space missions. And now, scientists have proposed a new way to clean up all of that trash.Researchers from Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne have proposed what they are calling the Clean Space One Project to remove debris from orbit by using a ""Pac-Man"" satellite.What is that? Well, the satellite looks like this:When it encounters space debris, it acts like this:The video game-inspired design was chosen over a claw shape, as the most likely to be able to perform a precisely-timed capture, Space.com reported.The scientists plan to test out the design by sending the Pac-Man craft on a mission to collect and dispose of the small, now obsolete, SwissCube satellite that was launched in 2009. After it gobbles up the satellite, the Pac-Man will burn up in the atmosphere with its catch. Though the mission sounds straight forward, but it will take careful coordination.""SwissCube is not only a 10-centimeter by 10-centimeter object that’s tough to grasp, but it also has darker and lighter parts that reflect sunlight differently,"" Christophe Paccolat, a PhD student working in the institute's Center for Space Engineering and Signal Processing 5 Laboratory, said in a written statement. ""These variations can perturb the visual approach system and thus also the estimates of its speed and distance.""This is not the weirdest space clean-up method that has been suggested. Some scientists have proposed harpoon-like capture methods, while others hope to maneuver trash with pulses of air. Similar to the chomping Pac-Man, most methods rely on Earth's atmosphere to burn up the offending debris. For now, working models of the prototype Pac-Man system soon will be created. NBC News reported that Cleanspace One could launch as early as 2018."

These jets are formed when the neutron star's gravity pulls gas from its companion star, and some of the gas gets blasted outward.""Black holes were previously considered the undisputed kings of forming powerful jets, even when they were only fed by a little bit of material from their companion star,"" Dr. Adam Deller, astronomer at the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy and lead author of the study, said in a written statement.

Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- If the president saves his Iran deal from the critics trying to kill it in the United States Senate, it will be in large credit to one lawmaker.Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) emerged this past week as the chief organizer, White House liaison and public cheerleader for the controversial agreement. He has organized briefings, taken his case to the airwaves and meticulously encouraged the fence-sitting senators. The administration considers him its most valuable ally in the upper chamber on the deal, while colleagues describe his work as tireless and deft.""Dick's demeanor and reputation within the caucus puts him in a perfect position to lead the vote-counting effort,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), also a supporter of the deal. “He's not twisting arms, but he's listening to members and making sure they have the information necessary to make the right decision. Yes, he's passionate about this issue, but he knows that this is a unique whip operation that requires a consistent but gentle touch.""Durbin took on this role partially out of necessity. He is the only member of the Senate Democratic leadership team who publicly backs the Iran deal, which exchanges sanction relief for curbs on Iran’s nuclear program. This honor places him at odds, for now, with his longtime collaborators and with his former roommate, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y). But it also has given him the somewhat fortuitous distinction of being a leading progressive foreign policy voice at the precise moment the leadership team preps for a transition, with the impending retirement of Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and a likely showdown between him and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) for the whip post.Diplomatically, Durbin downplayed any riffs. While he acknowledged that he has repeatedly encouraged both Reid and Schumer to support the Iran deal, he said he empathized with their ambivalence.“I respect Chuck and I know he is going through a soul-searching process here. He wants to do the right thing,"" he said. ""It is critically important politically as a Jewish-American politician, and it is critically important to him personally. And he is taking the time to do it right. But I believe his decision is not going to sway six, eight or 10 votes. People are just deciding this on an individual basis. I really believe they are.”Though he’s alone among Democratic Senate leadership in publicly supporting the Iran deal, Durbin isn’t on particularly difficult political terrain. For starters, it could very well be that the Senate isn’t needed to keep the deal alive. Should legislation pass Congress rejecting the deal, the president will veto it. At that point, two-thirds of each chamber will have to override the veto, and it is widely expected that the votes won’t be there in the House.Philosophically, moreover, Durbin has been in this spot before. Thirteen years ago, he was one of 23 Senators to vote against the authorization of the war in Iraq.In an interview, Durbin said the 2002 authorization vote was not an easy call, even for a Democrat from reliably Democratic Illinois. He was in the midst of a re-election campaign back then, and political pressures, not to mention emotions, were engulfing. The current debate on Iran may not directly echo that moment, if only because the vote set to take place in September will not be to explicitly start a war (though advocates of the deal insist that would be a byproduct of killing the diplomatic agreement). But Durbin sees it as containing the same level of historical import.“There aren’t many votes that you remember for a congressional lifetime and beyond. And one that will be with me forever is the vote on the war in Iraq,” he said. “I view this vote in the same context. This is a historic decision. This isn’t just another political decision. This is one the senators are going to remember for a long time.”In pitching the Iran deal to his colleagues, Durbin has raised the specter of another moment similar to the Iraq authorization. But he’s wary the analogy “doesn’t transfer” to some members, who either weren’t in the chamber in 2002 or are already overwhelmed with pressure from groups lobbying for or against the Iran deal. And so, aides say, he’s tried a softer touch too: talking to Senators on a one-on-one basis, encouraging members to announce their intentions before heading on August recess, and organizing routine briefings with administration officials and nuclear experts.The latest briefing came on Tuesday, when Durbin brought ambassadors and foreign officials from countries that are party to the deal, along with former U.S. Ambassador to Israel Daniel Kurtzer, to meet with 30 of his colleagues. The session, which took place in the capital and lasted about an hour, proved highly consequential, according to multiple Senate aides, with several attendees subsequently announcing their intention to support the deal.That may seem like a circuitous criticism of Durbin himself. Foreign officials, after all, were able to do what he, the president, and the secretary of state could not: convince skeptics that the international sanctions regime against Iran could not be put back together if the deal was voted down.But Durbin wasn’t personally offended. Sometimes, he said, lawmakers need “third-party validation” to finally get to yes. “And that’s what happened yesterday … I said at the end of this meeting, I can’t help but think for a moment, as a student of history, what we have as an alliance on the other side of this table: China, Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany and France. When the German [Deputy Chief of Mission] said at one point, ‘You all know the history of Germany and the Jewish people. But you must know now we are more dedicated to the survival of the Jewish people than any country in Europe,’ that kind of statement is touching and powerful. And it brings this into historic perspective.”Want more updates from Sam Stein? Sign up for his newsletter, Spam Stein, here."

The new Justice Department report comes in the wake of her death. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The number of people who died by suicide in local jails ticked up in 2013, even as the overall jail population declined, according to a new report.Between 2012 and 2013, the number of suicides went from 300 to 327, a 9 percent increase, according to a report from the Justice Department released this month. That jump comes even as the overall jail population declined by 4 percent, the report said.Total deaths were also up slightly between 2012 and 2013, from 958 to 967. Suicide, the report noted, has been the leading cause of death in jails every year since 2000. In 2013, 34 percent of inmates' deaths were by their own hands.That's in stark contrast to the cause of death in state prisons, where, between 2000 and 2013, nine in 10 deaths were the result of illnesses like heart disease and cancer.The report offers no possible explanation for the increases or for why more people die by suicide in jails as compared to prisons. But the Marshall Project, a criminal justice news site, suggested it's partially due to ""shock of confinement.""One reason why jails have a higher suicide rate (46 per 100,000 in 2013) than prisons (15 PER 100,000) is that people who enter a jail often face a first-time “shock of confinement”; they are stripped of their job, housing, and basic sense of normalcy.Another reason for the disparity between jails and prisons is that jail staffers don't have as clear an idea of who they're dealing with, Michele Deitch, a professor at the University of Texas' LBJ School of Public Affairs, told the Marshall Project. By the time people enter prison after they're convicted, mental health issues and suicidal tendencies are usually evident, Deitch said.""Prisons know who they're getting,"" she said.Inmates are at the greatest risk of suicide seven days after they have been arrested, Eric Balaban, senior staff council with the American Civil Liberties Union's National Prison Project, told The Huffington Post.As for why there was an increase in suicides between 2012 and 2013, Balaban said it could be because of the continued erosion of the country's mental health care system.""There's not an infrastructure to provide community-based treatment,"" Balaban said. ""So people don't have the support they need.""The report comes in the wake of the high-profile death of Sandra Bland. The Texas woman was pulled over for failing to signal when changing lanes on July 10. She was then accused of assaulting an officer and arrested.Bland was found dead in her cell on July 13. Authorities say she killed herself, but Bland's family is skeptical of that conclusion.Her family announced a federal lawsuit this week.

No big deal.The 25-year-old caught up with The Huffington Post to exclusively discuss his ""Gatorade Beat the Heat"" lumberjack experience, plus why he doesn't watch football and why the NFC Championship loss to Seattle remains firmly off his radar.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.What was harder for you than what you anticipated in the lumberjack experience you participated in recently?Climbing the pole -- or should I say trying to climb the pole. To watch them do it, they get up and down in about 14, 15 seconds. And then it was my turn, and I try it and it’s taking me about 30 minutes to get 20 feet. It was definitely difficult. It takes a lot of upper body and lower body strength, and it’s tough. Those guys have been doing it for a long time so they make it look easy, but for the first time it was definitely difficult for me.Lumberjacking is definitely total body work. Speed, power, agility, balance -- it’s everything at the same time simultaneously. Football is maybe something for your lower body or your upper body, like if you’re a quarterback you need balance and you’re just dropping back and throwing the ball. If you’re running the ball, it’s more lower body to take the hits and bounce off of the hits. It’s not everything at the exact same time like it is when you’re lumberjacking.What did you do this offseason and what are you doing now to get to another level for you as a running back?Well I was down in Atlanta training, doing a lot of lower body work, because as a running back your legs are your job -- it’s what you do. So I took a lot of time doing leg workouts, resistance bands.They’re already strong, though, so are you trying to get faster? Or are you trying to bounce off more tackles? Because it seems like you’re doing both of those already.It’s really about maintaining. You can always get better, but you don’t want to stay the same. Even if you’re doing just a little bit, you’re going to progress. That’s what it’s always about: I’m trying to maintain and progress.With that in mind, do you remember that game in Green Bay against Detroit, where it seemed like you dragged about 100 guys? Are you seeing those guys? How much of that is just natural ability or vision? It’s just a crazy run.It’s definitely vision. It’s being on the same page with your offensive linemen, your fullback and tight ends that are blocking for you. Then after that, after you get past the initial steps, it’s pretty much just all you. Me, personally, I just see colors. So once I was able to get past the linebackers and it was just a safety out there, and then he tried to tackle me and a lot of other guys came. It’s just showing toughness and it gets your team into the game.For a big guy, you do run pretty well, but is it safe to say you’d rather run over somebody than run past them?That’s kind of a gray area. It definitely depends, and certain things help spark at certain moments of the game. Say, for instance, we’re in a tied game and we have the ball. I'm trying to like get the tempo going and get the crowd into the game, and you run over a defender that gets your whole team hyped. And it takes a lot out of the other team, too. It depends on the scenario.Great running backs, especially big backs, you hear them talk about guys like you or Marshawn Lynch or Frank Gore, guys who are wearing down defenses late. How much do you savor that?Definitely. When you get later in games and you’ve been running the ball hard in that first or second quarter, it takes a lot out of those defenders. I mean, after a certain point in time they’re not going to want to tackle you anymore. I mean, they will because it’s their job, but you can tell they really don’t want to do it. So for backs like Marshawn and me and other big backs, once it gets to like the late third, fourth quarter, you can tell this is the time for you to keep going and keep pushing. It’s pretty much a mindset thing.When you say guys maybe don’t want to tackle you that much, how can you tell?I was thinking about it in college because my college coach would talk about it a lot but I never understood until I watched Mark [Ingram] and Trent [Richardson] run, but at the beginning of the game, you know, guys will come out and they’ll try to get the big hits, or they’ll hit you and celebrate after. It pretty much goes that way for the first or second quarter, but by the time the game slows down and you lose all that energy, you can tell they’re not the same person at the end of the game that they are in the first quarter.And that’s when you’re ready to go.Correct, yeah. I’m ready to go all the time, but definitely in the fourth quarter when I can tell there’s a difference in those players.From a motivational standpoint, when you go back to last season and you guys being so close, what motivates you from that Seattle game?Well for me, I have pretty much natural motivation. Some players use that Seattle game for motivation for the following season, but for me I just go out every game no matter what or regardless of what happened the year before and just continuing to try to do better. I don’t like to use certain things for motivation because at some point in time it goes away.When you look at other running backs, is it different now that you’re in the NFL and you’ve established yourself as an elite player? Are you necessarily modeling your game after anybody else? Or when you were a kid were you doing that?I actually never watched football or anything growing up. I still don’t watch it today. You know, I watch like a game here or there, but as far as like modeling or following a certain player, I’ve never done that. I just play.When you think about your time with Coach Nick Saban and your Alabama coaches, I’ve heard people say certain things about Alabama, like “when guys come out they’re just so much more ready than anyone else to play in the NFL."" Is that fair? Did that happen for you?Yeah that definitely happened, because going into college that’s pretty much where I learned the game of football. In high school I was just playing with natural ability, and the coaches were like, ""He’s good, let’s just run the ball every time."" There’s not really too much technique talk or detail, just get the ball and try to get a touchdown. Once I got to college, they taught me those techniques and taught me the details and how stepping a certain way can manipulate a linebacker. You know, just learning the game of football. It’s hard work down there, too. They make you work down there and they teach you football as well as life after football, so you pretty much get the complete package there. That’s why when most guys come out they’re pretty much NFL-ready.We know running backs -- because of the hits you take -- it’s not a position where guys have really long careers, what can you do to make sure you have as long a career as possible? What are you doing on and off the field?Training in the weight room. You know, the weight room coaches preach it all the time. You make your career longer by working out. But it’s football, so you never know when that one hit is going to come and everything goes down the drain.But you don’t think about that right? You don’t think about injuries? You can’t.No, you can’t. If you play like you’re going to get hurt, you’re going to get hurt. "

The boy's panic is audible in the recording, which can be heard below. The 911 operator does an admirable job of keeping him calm while gathering essential information, like what room in the house he's hiding in, whether the men have weapons, and if he has any brothers or sisters who might unexpectedly return. ""Please don't hurt me,"" the boy says, as the burglars spot him -- and, fortunately, start running away. ""Oh my God, I don't know what to do,"" he tells the operator.Police rushed to the home and took Robbie Jay Johnson Jr., 36, and Cole Austin Lewallen, 31, into custody. Officers caught Johnson immediately, and after Lewallen fled through the backyard, he was taken down by a police K-9 unit and treated in a hospital for injuries. Police are charging both men with felonies. Police are warning Scottsdale residents of a new burglary trend that involves robbers knocking on the door to see if anybody's home, then forcing an entry if nobody answers. They advise residents to tell unknown visitors that they're home, then retreat to a safe hiding place and call the police in the event of a forced entry. "

We young adults would resort to texting our BFFs, checking out who’s on Tinder, or, perhaps as a last result, daydreaming about the ideal partner or #squad member to hang out with. But kids (read: younger, more creative adults) have long retreated into the corners of their imaginations to devise some quick company.Fictitious friends are a staple of childhood; some kids play with dolls and other toys, imbuing them with real-life characteristics and forming real-life attachments. And, according to Psychology Today, by age 7, 37 percent of kids take this imaginary kinship a step further by creating an invisible pal. Whether human, humanoid, or an entirely made-up species (technicolor lions? Why not! Polka-dotted, winged creatures? Sure!), kids care about their imaginary friends as though they were real, going so far as to construct fact conflicts that the pair must resolve.One such conflict has become a trope in how we discuss imaginary friends in pop culture: what happens to the made-up playmate when a kid outgrows the need for his or her kinship? This summer’s new Pixar flick “Inside Out” addressed the problem when protagonist Riley’s former fictitious friend struggled against becoming obsolete, (spoiler) ultimately sacrificing himself for her happiness, marking the production company’s token tear-jerking scene.A recently released short film, directed by student filmmaker Kate Tsang, confronts the same quirky, heart-wrenching conflict.A young girl laughs on her family’s front lawn, rolling around with a faceless, pocket-square wearing man who has seemingly magical powers, turning mundane activities like lunchtime into thrilling adventures. Named Ex, the heroine’s imaginary friend is entering his ninth year in existence -- much longer than most mythical creatures are allowed to stick around. He visits a bureau designed for imaginary friends and learns that he’s eligible for retirement, but declines the offer sternly, hoping to continue working as a trusty sidekick for as long as possible.To address Ex’s stubbornness, a bureau worker shows him a film called “So You’ve Grown Attached” -- also the name of Tsang’s film -- an instructional video meant to help imaginary friends adjust to life post-friendship. As Ex tries balance remaining relevant while still providing support, he takes up an interest in beauty magazines and makeup in an attempt to help his human counterpart make other human friends. It’s a tender take on growing up and learning to step outside of your own imagination. Watch “So You’ve Grown Attached” above, and check out other student films at Film School Shorts.Also on HuffPost:"
