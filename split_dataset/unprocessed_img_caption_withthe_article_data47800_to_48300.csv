1,POLITICS,A Regular Liberal Critic Goes All In On Clinton's Presidential Run,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-moveon_us_57bef621e4b02673444e98b9,MoveOn has quarreled with Clinton for years. But fear of a Trump presidency can heal those wounds.,2016-08-25,"Hillary Clinton is getting a boost from MoveOn.org, a group that's had its disagreements with her in the past.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the nation’s top liberal advocacy groups is mobilizing its expansive network to aid Hillary Clinton’s campaign against Donald Trump and prop up Senate Democratic nominees. MoveOn.org announced on Thursday that it will be hiring more than three dozen paid staff to serve as state directors and field organizers in eight key states. The investment represents an expansion of the group’s United Against Hate campaign against Trump. But it also dovetails with its efforts to regain Democratic control of the Senate. The states where MoveOn.org is upping its field presence include Arizona, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania ― all of which have competitive Senate races. “This is an all-hands-on-deck moment to ensure that Donald Trump never sets foot in the White House, and MoveOn members across the country have the power to influence this election by helping elect Hillary Clinton and winning key Senate seats across the country,” said Victoria Kaplan, organizing director for MoveOn.org. With its expansive membership list, MoveOn has the potential to be a powerful on-the-ground mobilizer for Democrats in the fall. And for Clinton, in particular, the group’s support could provide a nice hand in shoring up lingering problems (to the extent that they exist) with base voters. That’s because the two ― MoveOn and Clinton ― have had a rather topsy-turvy relationship dating back nearly two decades. MoveOn was initially started to defend Bill Clinton from impeachment proceedings (hence the name). During the George W. Bush years, it had morphed, somewhat, into an anti-war organization ― and it found itself at odds with then-Sen. Hillary Clinton for her vote to authorize the Iraq invasion. During the 2008 campaign, the group endorsed Barack Obama. And at a private fundraiser, Clinton was caught complaining about its stringent anti-war posture and the gushers of money it was raising for the then-Illinois senator. This cycle, Clinton snubbed a MoveOn forum that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley agreed to attend. MoveOn snubbed her back, by endorsing Sanders bid for the nomination. But time, and Trump, heals wounds. When it became apparent that Sanders didn’t have the delegate numbers to become the Democratic nominee, the group threw its support behind Clinton. And as the election has neared, MoveOn has put substantial resources ― including a major voter contact effort, a rapid-response video lab and nationwide Laughter Trumps Hate comedy contest ― behind Clinton’s election. The group pledges that its expanded field teams “will knock on hundreds of thousands of doors and hold conversations with thousands of likely voters in coming weeks.”"
2,BUSINESS,Top GOP Congressman Tells Trump To Release His Taxes,Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jason-chaffetz-trump-tax-returns_us_57befd8be4b04193420dbacc,"“You’re just going to have to do that, it’s too important,"" Congressman Jason Chaffetz said.",2016-08-25,"Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Austin, Texas.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57befecf1600003503bfe5e1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump should release his tax returns and full medical records, Republican Chairman of the House Oversight Committee Jason Chaffetz (Utah) said Wednesday.“You’re just going to have to do that, it’s too important,” Chaffetz said on CNN. “If you’re going to run and try to become the president of the United States, you’re going to have to open up your kimono and show everything, your tax returns, your medical records.”Chaffetz said that the standard applies to both candidates. Clinton has released her 2015 tax return and medical history. Trump has only released a cursory, bombastic letter from his doctor.Trump said in May that he hoped to release his tax returns, but has since refused to, saying he can’t because he’s under audit by the IRS. However, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said that being under audit does not prevent a person from releasing returns. “If you’re being audited, and you want to do something else, share that information with your returns, you can do that,” Koskinen told CSPAN in February. In July, Trump’s then-campaign chairman was adamant that the Republican nominee would not release his tax returns. Earlier this week, Eric Trump said it would be “foolish” for his father to release his taxes. “You learn a lot more when you look at a person’s assets,” Eric said. “You know how many hotels we have around the world? You know how many golf courses we have around the world?”The value of Trump’s assets, however, is not the simple matter Eric Trump implies it is. In his personal financial disclosure detailing those assets, Donald Trump says he is worth $10 billion. Bloomberg and Forbes, however, estimate his wealth at $2.9 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively. And Tim O’Brien wrote in his 2005 biography of Trump that “three people with direct knowledge of Donald’s finances, people who had worked closely with him for years, told me that they thought his net worth was somewhere between $150 million and $250 million.”The New York Times reported last week that Trump’s debt totaled $650 million, about twice as much as the candidate had disclosed. The discrepancy, the Times said, arises from the fact that the financial disclosure forms for candidates are not designed for a person with business dealings as complex as Trump’s are.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

That statement, which was subsequently sent to The Huffington Post, reads:“The Chris Rock ‘Kill the Messenger’ segment should not have been uploaded on flights based on our criteria for excluding onboard programming that includes content featuring explicit language, slurs, extreme violence, and explicit scenes.

The viewer also tweeted his discontent: Earlier this month, Delta landed in hot water for running an edited version of “Carol” that did not include a same-sex kiss that was present in the original version of the film.Requests from The Huffington Post for comments from Rock about the situation were not immediately returned."

Paul LePage (R) said Wednesday that for the past seven months he has been keeping a dossier of drug dealers arrested in his state to justify an earlier comment linking drugs and race. In a January conversation about Maine’s heroin problem, LePage said “guys with the name D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty” bring drugs from New York and Connecticut and “impregnate a young white girl before they leave.” At a town hall in North Berwick on Wednesday, the Portland Press Herald reported, a man who identified himself as a businessman from New York asked the governor how the state could attract investment given the “toxic environment” created by LePage’s comments. “I made the comment that black people are trafficking in our state. Now, ever since I said that comment I’ve been collecting every single drug dealer who has been arrested in our state,” LePage said, adding the man would be welcome to see the binder. (You can hear the exchange on the Portland Press Herald’s website.)“I don’t ask them to come to Maine and sell their poison, but they come,” LePage said. “And I will tell you that 90-plus percent of those pictures in my book ― and it’s a three-ringed binder ― are black and Hispanic people from Waterbury, Connecticut, the Bronx and Brooklyn.”The New Yorker then asked LePage if Maine police might be racially profiling their arrestees. LePage responded by repeating the thing about white girls. “There are a whole lot of white girls, too, a whole lot of white girls,” LePage said. “In fact, in almost every single picture is a white Maine girl in the picture.”It’s not clear how there’s a white girl in every photo if 90 percent of the pictures are of black and Hispanic people. A LePage spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.The Maine chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union criticized the governor’s comments in a statement. “White people are statistically more likely to sell drugs than black people, yet according to the governor police in Maine are nine times more likely to arrest black people for doing so,” the Maine ACLU said on Twitter. “We don’t know what’s behind this disparity, but we look forward to working with the governor to end any unconstitutional racial profiling that may be occurring.” "

6,IMPACT,Proposed Seattle Homeless Shelter May Allow Residents To Use Heroin,Eleanor Goldberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/seattle-homeless-shelter-may-allow-residents-to-use-heroin_us_57bcad3fe4b0b51733a64cbd,"Supporters say it could help prevent overdose deaths, HIV and hepatitis C transmissions and keep used needles off the streets.",2016-08-25,"A man lies in a tent with others camped nearby, under and near an overpass in Seattle on Tuesday, Feb. 9, 2016. Seattle has the third-highest number of homeless people in the U.S. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As Seattle continues to battle its heroin crisis, a group tasked with addressing the issue is pushing an unconventional tactic for helping homeless addicts. The Task Force on Heroin and Prescription Opiate Addiction, formed by the city in March, has put its support behind building a shelter where homeless addicts could use heroin under supervision, according to The Seattle Times.Those who support such a facility say it could help prevent overdose deaths, HIV and hepatitis C transmissions and keep used needles off the streets. Taxpayers might benefit too, since the facility could potentially reduce public health services and criminal justice costs. The concept was first introduced by the People’s Harms Reduction Alliance, a group that organizes needle exchanges, The Times reported in April. The task force is expected next month to offer up a more fleshed-out plan for how the program would work. These discussions come at a time when heroin deaths are on the rise. In 2014, heroin-related deaths hit a 20-year high in King County: There were 156 heroin-related deaths that year, more than triple the number in 2009, according to government records.Drug overdose is currently the leading cause of death among people who are homeless in the U.S., the medical journal JAMA concluded in a 2013 study. At the proposed Seattle facility, users would get clean needles and anti-overdose medications. They’d also get access to medical care and treatment opportunities, per the Times. Critics of the program say it would enable homeless people’s addictions and squandering taxpayers’ dollars.“I’m open to ideas,” Dori Monson, a radio host at local station KIRO, wrote in an op-ed. “Just not this one, which will only be another magnet for heroin users from around the country who will come to Seattle for a free apartment to shoot up with the government’s permission.”“I’m told about all these savings these programs supposedly produce,” Monson added, “but we sure never see the benefits.” The proposition for this homeless facility comes about a year after Seattle declared a state of emergency, as a result of its growing homeless population. On a single night in January last year, King County identified 3,772 individuals living on the streets. That was a 21 percent increase from 2014.Experts say the facility is just one element that fits into the larger concept of “housing first.” That approach encourages giving homeless people housing, and then addressing their health and employment issues.In numerous studies across multiple U.S. cities, the approach has been found to keep homeless people off the streets and to cut down and to save taxpayers money."

Nixon in 1968, and described Republican efforts to use race as a wedge issue ― on matters such as desegregation and busing ― to appeal to white southern voters. Ken Mehlman, the Republican National Committee chairman, this morning will tell the NAACP national convention in Milwaukee that it was ‘wrong.’ ‘By the ‘70s and into the ‘80s and ‘90s, the Democratic Party solidified its gains in the African American community, and we Republicans did not effectively reach out,’ Mehlman says in his prepared text. “Some Republicans gave up on winning the African American vote, looking the other way or trying to benefit politically from racial polarization.

Follow us on Twitter - @HuffPostHillHILLARY CLINTON GOES AFTER TRUMP’S ALT-RIGHT WEIRDOS - From her speech in Reno: “Anti-Muslim and anti-Immigrant ideas –– all key tenets making up an emerging racist ideology known as the ‘Alt-Right.’ Alt-Right is short for ‘Alternative Right.’ The Wall Street Journal describes it as a loosely organized movement, mostly online, that ‘rejects mainstream conservatism, promotes nationalism and views immigration and multiculturalism as threats to white identity.’ The de facto merger between Breitbart and the Trump Campaign represents a landmark achievement for the ‘Alt-Right.’ A fringe element has effectively taken over the Republican Party…. On David Duke’s radio show the other day, the mood was jubilant. ‘We appear to have taken over the Republican Party,’ one white supremacist said. Duke laughed. There’s still more work to do, he said. No one should have any illusions about what’s really going on here. The names may have changed… Racists now call themselves ‘racialists.’ White supremacists now call themselves ‘white nationalists.’ The paranoid fringe now calls itself ‘alt-right.’ But the hate burns just as bright.” [HuffPost]DONALD TRUMP: I AM NOT RACIST, HILLARY CLINTON IS RACIST - Igor Bobic: Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Thursday criticized his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, for falsely accusing him and GOP voters of racism. ‘It’s the oldest play in the Democratic playbook. When Democratic policies fail, they are left with only this one tired argument,’ Trump said at a campaign rally in New Hampshire. ‘You’re racist, you’re racist, you’re racist. It’s a tired, disgusting argument. And it’s so totally predictable.’ ‘She lies, and she smears, she paints decent Americans — you— as racists,’ he added, a day after he himself called Clinton a ‘bigot’ who “sees people of color only as votes not as human beings worthy of a better future.’” [HuffPost]WHAT A WEEK FOR THE ALT-RIGHT! Best week in Washington. Rosie Gray and Andrew Kaczynski: “On a day when the alt right is likely to become more famous than it’s ever been before, the movement is also facing a disorienting shift on its key issue by its favored candidate. On one hand, Hillary Clinton is set to give a speech today tying Donald Trump to the movement — a moment that will undoubtedly raise their profile and which casts them as central characters in the election. On the other, Trump has pivoted hard on immigration, reversing his stance on deportations. And Trump’s hard-line positions on immigration had been a key cause of the alt right’s devotion to him. On the week of possibly the alt right’s biggest victory, it’s also dealing with possible betrayal. ‘Trump has been so good for my cause that I’m able to be very tolerant and patient with him,’ said Richard Spencer, the president of the National Policy Institute, a white nationalist think tank, in an email to BuzzFeed News. ‘My tolerance and patience is huge. No one is more tolerant and patient than I am.’” [BuzzFeed]HOW THESE WEIRDOS IMAGINE THEMSELVES - As heroes, of course. Here’s what alt-righters Allum Bokhari and Milo Yiannopoulos said of their movement in March: “Young people perhaps aren’t primarily attracted to the alt-right because they’re instinctively drawn to its ideology: they’re drawn to it because it seems fresh, daring and funny, while the doctrines of their parents and grandparents seem unexciting, overly-controlling and overly-serious….Millennials aren’t old enough to remember the Second World War or the horrors of the Holocaust. They are barely old enough to remember Rwanda or 9/11. Racism, for them, is a monster under the bed, a story told by their parents to frighten them into being good little children.” [Breitbart]Like HuffPost Hill?

For the Republican primary election in March, Essex was accepted as a poll watcher for Trump in Collier County, Florida, although she said she only made phone calls for the campaign. But as a hopeful November volunteer, Essex is one of the supporters Trump is trying to recruit to “stop crooked Hillary from rigging this election!” As Trump struggles in the polls, he has suggested that voter fraud ― an incredibly rare crime ― will be partly to blame if he loses. His racially charged rhetoric speaks to some white supporters who fear their votes will be taken by immigrants and voters of color. Trump wants these supporters to join his campaign as poll watchers. But election experts worry they won’t follow the rules and are going to cause trouble. [w/ HuffPost’s Dana Liebelson]THIS IS SO AWKWARD FOR JOE MANCHIN! Awkward in the sense that he is part of a legislative body that has deliberately made prescription drugs extremely profitable for rich companies and unaffordable for regular people. So awkward! “Mylan CEO Heather Bresch struggled Thursday to justify the repeated big price hikes of the company’s lifesaving EpiPen devices as criticism continued that Mylan is gouging consumers with a retail cost of more than $600. ‘No one’s more frustrated than me,’ Bresch told CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’ on Thursday when she was pressed on the question of why Mylan needed to have such a high price for EpiPens, and why she just didn’t cut their price. ‘Everybody should be frustrated,’ said Bresch, who in recent days has come under fire from U.S. Senators, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and patients who are outraged by EpiPen’s skyrocketing cost.” [CNBC]HAPPY BIRTHDAY, NATIONAL PARKS! YOU’RE OLD AF - Kate Sheppard: “Thursday marks the 100th anniversary of the National Park System, which has been described as ‘America’s best idea.’ Today the National Park Service oversees 409 sites, 23 national trails and 60 ‘wild and scenic’ rivers. These parks are among the country’s most prized assets ― enjoying high public regard and record attendance last year, with 307 million visitors. But they also face a nearly $12 billion backlog on maintenance. Repairs and upgrades to paved roads, bridges, and parking lots make up nearly half of that backlog. Another half involves the parks’ facilities, including dams, utility systems and amphitheaters. Funding for the National Park Service has fluctuated slightly in recent years, but hasn’t kept pace with needs.” [HuffPost]Last night Trump completely softened his stance on immigration, saying he’d give undocumented immigrants legal status if they paid back taxes, which is much different than deporting them. ARE YOU OK, CONSERVATIVE TALK RADIO? Igor Bobic: “Conservative talk radio has long been an influential bastion of anti-immigrant sentiment. When Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) backed a bipartisan effort to pass comprehensive immigration reform in 2013, prominent talk show hosts lashed out at the GOP darling, calling him a sell-out and pressuring him to reverse his position. But mere hours after Donald Trump appeared to walk back his stance on immigration ― the GOP nominee’s signature issue ― in favor of a plan for granting undocumented immigrants legal status, prominent voices in the conservative talk show circuit responded with hardly more than a shrug. ‘Is Donald Trump now Jeb Bush? I don’t think most people think that,’ Laura Ingraham said Wednesday on her radio show, referring to the former Florida governor’s immigration plan that included giving undocumented immigrants legal status. ‘They did make a mess of this immigration rollout or whatever it is they’re rolling out,’ Ingraham added, but the ‘reason it’s a problem is not because his supporters will leave him, but that actually it takes the heat off of Hillary [Clinton].’” [HuffPost]@EricCantor: Pleased to see @realDonaldTrump embrace @JebBush’s immigration plan.ANN COULTER SAD - Jonathan Swan: “Donald Trump ‘panicked’ when he said he was open to softening his immigration policies, according to conservative pundit and Trump ally Ann Coulter. ‘It’s just rhetoric but it’s still annoying,’ Coulter told The Hill Wednesday night. ‘I think he panicked and he had to say [it] ... I don’t think he is softening. I mean the big thing is the wall.’ Coulter, a hardline opponent of illegal immigration and one of Trump’s most prominent media backers, was speaking to The Hill at a party to launch her new book, ‘In Trump We Trust: E Pluribus Awesome!’” [The Hill]CLINTON REALLY WANTS TO MUTE THIS THREAD - Hillary Clinton is running out of ways to say the same thing. Theodore Schleifer and Dan Merica: “’I have been asked many, many questions in the past year about emails and what I have learned is that when I try to explain what happened, it can sound like I am trying to excuse what I did. And there are no excuses. I want people to know that the decision to have a single email account was mine. I take responsibly for it. I apologize for it. I would certainly do differently if I could.’” [CNN]BECAUSE YOU’VE READ THIS FAR - Sweet national park pics. NATIONAL DIALOGUE ON RACE CONTINUES - Maine Gov.

Over the past few months, unions in a number of cities have stated that the only way they’ll accept change is if they get something in return.In some cases, unions have taken a particularly hard-nosed approach to bargaining, seeking financial concessions from taxpayers in exchange for measures designed to ensure that officers are doing their jobs effectively and appropriately.Earlier this month in Cincinnati, a local Fraternal Order of Police attorney sent a “cease and desist” letter to the city, saying that officers should only use body cameras if the city was willing to pay them more.Daniel Hils, president of one of Cincinnati’s Fraternal Order of Police lodges, acknowledged that body cameras are coming whether he likes it or not. But to him, the devices mean additional expectations and responsibilities for officers, and should therefore translate to more compensation.“We recognize [body cameras are] the direction we’re going,” Hils told The Huffington Post. “But I believe this is a game changer, as far as complexity of the job. And this level of monitoring will result in positives and negatives about what it’s like to be a policeman. Because of that, I think it does require some additional compensation or at least bargaining for that.”Taxpayers in the city were already expected to foot the $6 million bill for the 700 body cameras scheduled to be on the street by the end of the year. And Cincinnati already understands the value of these devices. Last year, footage from a body camera worn by a University of Cincinnati police officer provided key details surrounding the controversial fatal shooting of an unarmed black man during a traffic stop. A grand jury later indicted the officer on charges of murder and manslaughter.Still, some experts on public sector unions see merit in Hils’ argument. And it isn’t unusual for unions to take advantage of a potential shift in their day-to-day functions, said Nelson Lichtenstein, director of the Center for the Study of Work, Labor and Democracy at the University of California Santa Barbara.“You enhance the duties or add additional responsibilities to a job and then you want to be compensated for it,” he told The Huffington Post. “That’s what collective bargaining is all about.”But some advocates for reform say demanding more money for officers to wear body cameras is insulting. Unions are now effectively holding transparency and accountability hostage, and treating basic oversight like a luxury item that isn’t included in the usual terms of service.This sort of resistance conflicts with some of the broader messaging from law enforcement. Many police officers have said they support body cameras. Top brass apparently wants them, and law enforcement officials have said they’ll benefit both officers and civilians. Police departments, though not in Cincinnati, have scrambled to sweep up federal government grants to implement body camera programs. And all of this makes sense, considering the public is broadly in favor of them.Yet earlier this month in Boston, the city’s Police Patrolman’s Association tried to put a halt to a body camera rollout after officers refused to volunteer for a pilot program. The city had previously reached an agreement stating participation would be voluntary, but when no officers came forward, the mayor said he’d push ahead and assign the devices to officers. The police union and city briefly sparred over which party had violated the terms of the contract, but Police Commissioner William Evans later confirmed to HuffPost that the Police Patrolman’s Association had failed to obstruct the process.“One hundred officers have been selected to participate in the [body-worn camera] pilot program,” he said. “The officers were selected by an independent party … who will be performing the evaluation at the end of the pilot period.”Nobody is eager to be put under constant surveillance on the job, so some of this resistance may be logical, says Jay Stanley, senior policy analyst with the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. Considering the nature of police work, however, the public is always likely to be less sympathetic to their expectations and demands.“Police officers have been granted the power by the community to use brutal and even in some circumstances deadly force,” Stanley told HuffPost. “So with great power comes the need for great checks and balances.”And body cameras aren’t the only issue police unions are stalling.A union in San Antonio recently fought back against an attempt by city officials to give the police chief greater power to reprimand repeat misconduct by his officers. Union leaders sought additional compensation ― beyond the current contract’s 14 percent pay increase over the next four years ― for agreeing to the higher standards. As it stands now, misconduct cases among cops in the city effectively disappear after two years.Officers later voted for a version that didn’t include the reforms, which is now headed to the City Council for approval, amid outcry from local activists.Police unions have been equally intransigent in Seattle, where officers in July overwhelmingly rejected a new labor contract with the city that would have included both wage hikes and accountability measures. The police department there has been under intense scrutiny over its failure to remedy unconstitutional policing practices as part of a 2012 consent decree between the Justice Department and the city. Earlier this month, a federal judge issued a harsh rebuke of the union, declaring from the bench that “black lives matter.”Unions aren’t in the business of public opinion, of course. They’re intended to serve as unapologetic, unwavering advocates for police officers.“Bad PR? The hell with it,” Lichtenstein said. “Union leaders want to consolidate their base and get re-elected in the next election.”But just because unions may be acting in an entirely predictable way doesn’t make it any less concerning to those who see reform as an integral step toward restoring public confidence and trust in policing.“When it comes to policy, all too often we have seen police unions pushing for officers to be given special treatment when it comes to investigations of critical incidents,” Stanley said. “That is something that police departments should not be able to do.”"
9,POLITICS,Atheists Sue Pennsylvania House After Being Barred From Giving Opening Invocations,Nick Wing,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pennsylvania-house-atheists_us_57bf260ee4b085c1ff283197,"""To say that theists can do this but nontheists cannot is quite clearly discrimination,"" one of the plaintiffs says.",2016-08-25,"You have to be religious if you want to give an opening invocation in the Pennsylvania state House, say the chamber's leaders.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57bf2eee1800002100bcd1d3.jpeg?cache=Ml0anXqKh5&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Over the past few years, leaders in the Pennsylvania state House have repeatedly maintained that only religious individuals are fit to deliver the opening invocation before each session. Now, they may end up having to defend that position in court.A group of atheist and secular organizations filed a federal lawsuit on Thursday, claiming that Republican leadership is unconstitutionally discriminating against nonbelievers who wish to offer guidance to lawmakers in accordance with their sincerely held beliefs.The controversy dates back to August 2014, when two members of local atheist groups each submitted a request to deliver an opening invocations at a daily session of the Pennsylvania House. A month later, then-House Speaker Samuel H. Smith (R) shot down the applications on the grounds that the body was not “required to allow non-adherents or nonbelievers the opportunity to serve as chaplains.” A similar request months later was met with an official rule change stating that guest speakers “shall be a member of a regularly established church or religious organization or shall be a member of the House of Representatives.”This is a violation of precedent established in the Supreme Court’s 2014 ruling in Greece v. Galloway, the plaintiffs contend. That decision upheld the constitutionality of government prayer, as long as it maintains a policy of nondiscrimination. Atheist and secular groups interpret this ruling as prohibiting preferential treatment of religion over nonreligion, which is also a pillar of the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause.“The court emphasized that the town of Greece expressly allowed atheists to give opening invocations, and that was an important factor in the court’s ruling upholding the town’s practice,” said Alex Luchenitser, associate legal director at Americans United for Separation of Church and State, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group representing the plaintiffs.Republican leaders in Pennsylvania and elsewhere disagree, and have routinely claimed that the Supreme Court ruling doesn’t explicitly call for the inclusion of nonbelievers. A spokesman for Pennsylvania House Speaker Mike Turzai (R), who, along with other House members, is named as a defendant in the suit, said in a statement: “We believe our rule and policy comports with the Constitution and is consistent with long history of legislative prayer as recognized by the various Supreme Court cases.”Similar disputes have fueled contentious battles over the role of religion in state and local chambers around the nation. At issue is a broader question of whether nonbelievers must be allowed to participate in proceedings that have traditionally been seen as forums for religious expression.Months ago in Arizona, for example, an atheist lawmaker spoke out after years of being barred from leading an invocation over concerns that he wouldn’t mention God. When he was finally given an opportunity to deliver these opening remarks, the House majority leader declared it illegitimate because they hadn’t referenced a higher power.These arguments have increasingly become fodder for lawsuits. The Freedom From Religion Foundation, a nonprofit that advocates for the separation of church and state, sued the U.S. House chaplain and other lawmakers earlier this year, claiming they’d unconstitutionally discriminated against the group’s co-president by blocking him from leading a secular invocation before Congress. Despite the ongoing quarrels, many governmental bodies have taken steps toward fuller acceptance, whether due to genuine interest in inclusivity or fear of legal ramifications. An atheist invocation in Waterloo, Iowa, went over with little fanfare earlier this year, which could speak to the argument of many nonbelievers: They want to be included in these ceremonies for the purposes of unity, not to divide or denigrate religion.Satanists have even seen victories in the campaign for inclusion, and have recently delivered invocations in Pensacola, Florida, and Soldotna, Alaska.Nonbelievers in Pennsylvania say theirs is the latest fight for full equality and acceptance of all Americans.“To say that theists can do this but nontheists cannot is quite clearly discrimination, but it also sends a message to the nontheist community that our voice doesn’t matter, that our point of view doesn’t matter,” Brian Fields, president of Pennsylvania Nonbelievers and a plaintiff in the case, told The Huffington Post. “It reinforces religious ideas that nontheists don’t have a say when it comes to morality.” Sessions of the Pennsylvania House have been opening with prayer for more than three centuries, according to PennLive, and a look at the recent history of the practice suggests the legislature hasn’t done much to foster diversity.In the period from Jan. 8, 2008, through Feb. 9, 2016, the plaintiffs found records of 575 invocations, 265 of which were delivered by guests. Of these, they documented 23 instances of Jewish rabbis giving prayers, three invocations given in the Muslim tradition and just one where the religious affiliation of the guest was not stated. All of the invocations over this period were monotheistic in nature.“There’s a lot of talk about Jesus in the invocations, there’s a lot of talk about God and God’s role in the individual lives of the people presenting,” Fields said.But nobody has spoken on behalf of the growing ranks of religious “nones,” including atheists, agnostics and others who do not identify with any formal religion. These people now make up nearly one-quarter of the U.S. population, and among them are more than 2.5 million nonreligious Pennsylvanians, according to American Atheists, an advocacy group that has joined the lawsuit.“For us, this is an opportunity to present another point of view, to say, ‘Hey, look, we’re in this together,’” Fields said. “It wouldn’t be my intention to bring up God, but to bring up morality and justice and fairness and those ideas that we hold to be important, rather than a strictly religious invocation.”And none of that should be threatening or offensive to lawmakers who considering themselves religious, Luchenitser says.“These are unifying, uplifting invocations that don’t criticize or disparage religion,” he said. “Our plaintiffs want to present a positive, inclusive message that includes everyone and doesn’t denigrate anyone.”Below is a draft copy of the invocation Fields had planned on giving, which was included in the lawsuit:Thank you for inviting me to speak today.This story has been updated to include comment from Turzai."

In May, the actress joined forces with the makers of the EpiPen through a campaign called Anaphylaxis for Reel. At the time, Parker urged awareness for life-threatening allergies and revealed that the issue is personal for her because her 13-year-old son, James Wilkie Broderick, has a severe peanut and hazelnut allergy. But following reports that the company raised the price of their standard two-pack of EpiPens from $100 in 2009 to $600 in 2016, Parker publicly cut ties and condemned the price hike.“I’m left disappointed, saddened and deeply concerned by Mylan’s actions,” she said in her statement on Instagram.Her original ad from May: Parker and her son, James Wilkie:Parker issued a statement on her Instagram account severing her relationship with Mylan, expressing her disappointment in the company’s actions and price hike.“I do not condone this decision and I have ended my relationship with Mylan as a direct result of it. I hope they will seriously consider the outpouring of voices of those millions of people who are dependent on the device,” she wrote.Read the statement in full below:We reached out to Sarah Jessica Parker’s representatives about the statement, but the actress had no additional comment. Parker hasn’t been the only public figure to express dismay at Mylan’s actions. On Thursday, Hillary Clinton condemned the price increase. Mylan’s CEO Heather Bresch told CNBC on Thursday that she wants to make sure that “everybody that needs an EpiPen has an EpiPen.” The drugmaker also announced that it would offer patients a savings card to cover part of the cost. “As a mother I can assure you that the last thing we could ever want is no one to have their EpiPen due to price.”Bresch has been particularly criticized over the price hike because her salary increased along with the drug’s price. Her compensation rose more than 600 percent between 2009 and 2016. "

The film features two actors of color in top billing, but what truly makes the film remarkable, according to Jakubowicz, is that its Latino lead doesn’t fulfill any negative stereotypes.“Ever since I moved to Los Angeles, nearly every script I’ve been sent has featured Latin drug dealers, rapists, or criminals of some other kind,” Jakubowicz writes at the beginning of his recent essay, “Why Latino Movie Stars Have Never Been More Necessary,” for Vulture. “Everywhere I look in American movies and TV shows, I see few, if any, positive Latino characters. Even when the filmmakers are Latino, most Hispanics I see onscreen are criminals.”In the piece, published Wednesday, the director makes a case for why we need to see more Latino lead actors as heroes and not villains ― particularly within the current political climate. He especially points to the hateful rhetoric Republican nominee Donald Trump has been spewing since he portrayed immigrants as drug dealers, criminals, and rapists when he announced his candidacy last year. “Trump didn’t invent the stereotype,”Jakubowicz wrote in his essay. “He’s merely taking advantage of it for political gain, speaking to an audience that doesn’t find his words offensive since they’ve come to think of Latinos in the way he describes them. On CNN or Fox News, we watch Trump calling Mexicans drug traffickers, and then we change the channel to any number of scripted shows featuring Mexican drug traffickers.

So he set out to create a project “about a positive Latino figure,” that’s when he found Durán’s story.The director wrote the script for “Hands Of Stone” in collaboration with Robert De Niro, who also stars in the film, and cast the film with up-and-coming actors of color. Yet, he writes, no studio in Hollywood wanted to finance it and many even suggested replacing the lead stars with white, non-Latino actors that had more star power. “I get it. Even in the era of CGI franchises, Hollywood runs on the star system. But we will never have a proven Latino movie star unless we cast Latino actors as Latino leads — and if you’re telling the story of Roberto Durán, you have to come correct,”Jakubowicz wrote. “Boxing has been dominated by Latinos for decades, and yet there’s never been a mainstream boxing movie with a Latino lead. Continuing that trend with our film would have been unforgivable.”Eventually the director says he moved to Panama for a year in order to find the proper funding to make his film a reality.

Other volunteers came wearing motorcycle helmets instead of hardhats, wearing T-shirts and tennis shoes.The fire department chief directing rescue operations in the village, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media, welcomed the help of the young people and especially appreciated the expert work of the specialist volunteers from the Alpine Rescue and Civil Protection.“In the first 24 hours, it’s a big help to have all the volunteers we can get, because time is of the essence in an emergency,” he said.Three dogs from the Alpine Rescue searched for human scent below the crumpled rubble, helping to find more than 20 bodies on Wednesday, said Cortelli.Two dogs, both Belgian Malinois Shepherds, were flown down by helicopter from northern Italy. Ax, a male, and Babi, a female, searched what was left of the town, sniffing between the heaps of shattered brick, terra cotta, wood and concrete.They signalled areas where human smell was still present. Afterward, the volunteers went to work digging, with their hands, with axes, chainsaws and hammers.“The dogs detect the odour of the living. The dead have a totally different smell, but they retain some of the smell of the living for a few hours,” said Cortelli.Some of the volunteers were veterans of the rescue effort in Italy’s last comparable quake, which hit the central city of L’Aquila in 2009 and killed more than 300 people.“This is worse than L’Aquila,” said Stefano, 41, who had driven to the quake site some 70 km (45 miles) from his home. “This place is just a pile of rubble. There is nothing left.”(Editing by Crispian Balmer)"

Police there have increased fines on scooter riders found playing the game in traffic.News reports in July claimed that a Guatemalan teenager was the first Pokemon fatality after he was shot breaking into a house while playing the game.Also in July, Pokemon Go players were robbed of their smartphones at gunpoint in a north London park in Britain, while four teens in Missouri in the U.S. used the game to target around a dozen people into armed robberies."

The virus poses a risk to pregnant women because it can cause severe birth defects. It has been linked to more than 1,800 cases of microcephaly in Brazil.In a teleconference on Wednesday, Scott made a plea for more support in fighting Zika, complaining that “Congress and the White House have not been good partners.”Scott said he asked the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for 5,000 Zika antibody tests last week, but so far had only received less than 1,200. He had also asked for additional lab support personnel to speed testing.Scott also said the state had asked the CDC for 10,000 Zika prevention kits for pregnant women, which had not been provided.

In addition to insect repellent, the kits include bed nets, larvicide tablets and condoms.“We sent the state of Florida more than $35 million for Zika and other emergencies. That includes funds to purchase the other products they might want in a Zika prevention kit,” he said.As for the request on Friday of 5,000 antibody test kits, Frieden said: “We’ve already arranged for them and they will begin shipping on Tuesday.” The CDC said in a statement late on Wednesday that it planned another shipment of antibody test kits for Thursday, giving Florida the ability to conduct 6,300 Zika antibody tests.Frieden also said the CDC had provided Florida laboratories with technical support.As for the new case in Palm Beach County, Scott said he believed it was not related to an earlier non-travel related case announced earlier in the same county."

The country's leaders have varying opinions on banning face coverings. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57bf134a1600002900bfe65e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A heated debate over the public dress of Muslim women has engulfed much of Europe’s consciousness after Cannes, the famous French Riviera beach town, first announced its ban on the “burkini” on July 28.Twenty-five towns in France have followed the resort city’s lead, and public officials from Prime Minister Manuel Valls to National Front leader Marine Le Pen have further stoked the flames by lending their support to the controversial ban. A majority of the French public agrees, according to a recent survey conducted by Ifop that found 64 percent of respondents opposed the use of the swimwear. While France may be the center of this debate, it is far from the only country in Europe that has taken a hostile position toward traditional Islamic covering, such as the hijab, which politicians often cite as an obstacle to assimilation and social cohesion. In Germany, where there has been rising public disquiet over the integration of the more than 1 million migrants that arrived in the country last year, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s governing conservative bloc is now eyeing a ban on full veils.Members of Merkel’s coalition view full veils as incompatible with German society, but other politicians maintain that a sweeping ban would in fact inhibit integration.At an August conference on combatting terrorism and bolstering security measures in Germany following a wave of attacks over the past year, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière proposed a partial ban on veils covering women’s faces.“It doesn’t fit in with our open society. To show one’s face is crucial for communicating, for living together in our society and keeping it together,” de Maizière said at the conference.The ban would be applied in courtrooms, administrative buildings, schools and universities, as well as behind the wheel of a car or at protests.“In the areas where it serves a function to show one’s face, we want to make it a rule … and this means whoever breaks it must feel the consequences,” de Maizière added.Days after the interior minister’s comments, an administrative court in the town of Osnabrück told an 18-year-old student that she could not wear an Islamic covering that leaves only her eyes exposed.“The ruling’s outcome is right and welcome,” Christian Social Union member Stephan Mayer told HuffPost Germany.Mayer said that legal processes would be necessary to regulate certain areas of public life. “The idea that in the future girls will walk around German schools covered head-to-toe is absurd,” he said.Burkhard Lischka, a member of the Social Democrats, disagrees. He tells HuffPost Germany that while he regards full veils as “a marker of exclusion,” he rejects the idea of a general ban on the garment.“It’s in the interest of our children’s cosmopolitan, tolerant education for schools to be able to decide for themselves whether they’ll tolerate students wearing a full covering or not,” he said.Germany’s Left Party is also speaking out in favor of letting schools make their own decisions about banning the burqa or niqab.“Just as Christian schools get to decide if they’ll prohibit young ladies from wearing clothes that show their belly button, it’s within the realm of reason to let the leadership of private schools decide to reject the wearing of full-body covering,” Ulla Jelpke, the Left Party’s speaker for internal affairs, told HuffPost Germany.“In the case of public schools, education and integration must remain the primary imperatives. I reject the idea of a unilateral legislative ban,” Jelpke said.Green Party deputy Konstantin von Notz says that a burqa ban at schools will hinder, not help, integration.“The way to integration beyond the burqa lies through education and emancipation, and sweeping bans inhibit that process,” von Notz stated.“It doesn’t matter how big the veil is; people need access to education and success,” he said.This piece originally appeared on HuffPost Germany and has been translated into English and edited for clarity.

The South Korean government and experts said the launch showed technical progress in the North’s SLBM program.“A test-fire of strategic submarine-launched ballistic missile was successfully conducted under the guidance of supreme commander of the Korean People’s Army Kim Jong Un,” the North’s official KCNA news agency said.“He appreciated the test-fire as the greatest success and victory,” KCNA said.“He noted with pride that the results of the test-fire proved in actuality that the DPRK joined the front rank of the military powers fully equipped with nuclear attack capability.”DPRK, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, is North Korea’s formal name.North Korea has conducted a spate of military technology tests this year, including a fourth nuclear test in January and numerous ballistic missile launches, in defiance of U.N. Security Council sanctions that were tightened in March.North Korea said this year it had miniaturized a nuclear warhead to fit on a ballistic missile but outside experts have said there is yet no firm evidence to back up that claim or show it had mastered the technology to bring a live warhead back into the atmosphere and guide it to strike a target.North Korean state television on Thursday showed video clips of the launch of a missile from underwater at dawn, and still photographs of Kim on the dock at a port as a large crane unloaded an object onto a submarine.Kim is also seen jubilantly celebrating with military aides in photographs carried by the official Rodong Sinmun newspaper.REACHED JAPAN DEFENSE ZONEThe Washington-based 38 North project said in a report that the missile was launched from the North’s sole experimental missile submarine and a satellite photograph taken on Monday showed final preparations, likely after the missile had already been loaded onto the submarine using a heavy construction crane.The test showed the solid-fuel missile’s control and guidance system as well as the atmospheric re-entry of the warhead all met operational requirements, KCNA said.The South Korean and U.S. militaries said the missile was fired from near the coastal city of Sinpo, where a submarine base is located. Japan said the missile reached its air defense identification zone, the first time by a North Korean missile.The UN Security Council met behind closed doors on Wednesday at the request of the United States and Japan to discuss the launch. Deputy Russian U.N. Ambassador Petr Iliichev said the United States would circulate a draft press statement.The meeting comes after the Security Council was unable to condemn a missile launch by the North earlier this month that landed near Japan because China wanted the statement to also oppose the planned deployment of a U.S. missile defense system in South Korea.China said on Wednesday that it opposes the North’s nuclear and missile programs. It had been angered by what it views as provocative moves by the United States and South Korea on the decision to deploy the THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defence) anti-missile system in South Korea.(Additional reporting by Minwoo Park in Seoul and Michelle Nichols at the United Nations; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)"

The issue makes walking on his front legs awkward and painful, which is why Tigger spends more time than most dogs using his stronger back legs to get around.Sometimes, he’ll use those legs to propel himself directly into a person’s lap, said Eve Good, who has been fostering Tigger in her Scio, Oregon, home for dog rescue group Savin’ Juice. He’s “confident he’s a lap dog” despite weighing more than 50 pounds, she added.“Tigger assumes that everybody is his new best friend, no matter who you are,” Good said. “You are his new best friend, and you are going to love him.” That goes for people and other dogs — he currently shares a home with not only Good and her boyfriend, but also five other canine buddies. Sometimes, he’ll lean on them, using another dog as a ledge to support himself as they walk around side by side.But though the playful dog tries not to let his disability to slow him down, the pain appears to be getting worse by the day. After walking increasingly shorter distances, he tends to stop and wait for someone to pick him up. Veterinarians fear his shoulder will dislocate soon, and he’s already developed arthritis. Without surgery to correct his issues, it will become totally debilitating.“If he doesn’t get this fixed, his life is significantly shortened,” Sarah Ostrin, a veterinary physical therapist who has offered her services to Tigger free of charge, told The Huffington Post. “It will be so excruciatingly painful.”She said it’s remarkable that Tigger has made it this far — many dogs born with his condition don’t live long because they quickly get severe arthritis that renders them completely immobile.That’s why Good is working with Ostrin and veterinary surgeon Jennifer Warnock of Oregon State University to plan a comprehensive surgery for Tigger. Good has set up a GoFundMe account to help pay for the procedure.The surgery will involve fusing bones together in his legs that currently aren’t connected the way they should be. This will make it possible for him to wear prosthetics, Ostrin said. They’ll also be moving his paw peds — which are currently on the wrong side of his legs — to the correct location so they’ll actually protect his toes when he’s not wearing the prosthetics.The prosthetics should allow him to run around and move “like a normal dog” around the house or for short walks, Ostrin said. The plan is for him to also get a wheeled cart to help him out for longer journeys.The benefits of the surgery will extend beyond Tigger himself. Very few similar surgeries have ever been performed, so his will serve as a case study for veterinarians to use in the future, according to Ostrin. What his veterinary team learns will be highly beneficial for other disabled dogs.And beyond the surgery, Good says that Tigger’s happy-go-lucky resilience in the face of his disabilities should be a lesson to all people. Animals with disabilities — even those that don’t require any surgery, like blindness, or simply missing a leg — are usually overlooked by potential adopters. But she believes there’s no reason that should be the case.“They rebound so quickly,” Good said. “Those dogs in shelters that are special needs, they just think they’re fine. Tigger just thinks he’s a normal dog … They just need someone to love them, that’s all they need.”Follow Tigger’s adventures on his Facebook page."

Directed by filmmaker Raoul Peck, “I Am Not Your Negro” will be based on a hypothetical book that Baldwin never got to write. According to Shadow and Act, the book Baldwin envisioned was about three important black leaders who were assassinated: Medgar Evers, Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. According to TIFF, Baldwin was unable to finish the ambitious book idea before his death, so all that remains of the idea are letters sent to his literary agent and 30 pages of preliminary notes for the book. “I Am Not Your Negro” will be based mostly on Baldwin’s notes, and will explore not only the writer and activist’s life, but race in America as a whole. Samuel L. Jackson narrates the film.Though a trailer has yet to be released for the documentary, TIFF artistic director Cameron Bailey writes that it “matches Baldwin’s lyrical rhetoric with rich archival footage of the Civil Rights and Black Power movements.” “I Am Not Your Negro” will debut at TIFF next month, and then screen in October at the New York Film Festival.

31,POLITICS,Pro-Immigration Reform Republicans To Donald Trump: Told You So,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-immigration-reform-republicans_us_57bf6487e4b04193420e6c59,The GOP nominee is adopting some talking points that sound surprisingly familiar.,2016-08-25,Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump says lots of things about immigration. It is unclear which of them (if any) he'd actually put into practice as president.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57bf6827180000dd10bcd355.jpeg?cache=B9AvOTTIxB&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump talked this week about deporting criminals, securing the border and, perhaps, employing a strategy other than the mass removal of every one of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country. If that immigration plan sounds familiar, it’s because it is ― pro-reform Republicans have been promising the same for years. Some of them are watching with mild amusement as Trump adopts their talking points, if not their policies, ahead of election as he attempts to gloss over his past vilification of undocumented immigrants.“To say you’re for deporting murderers and rapists, well that’s great news ― so is Paul Ryan, Nancy Pelosi, George Bush and Chuck Schumer,” said Rob Jesmer, a Republican strategist who works with the pro-immigration reform group FWD.us.No one knows, possibly including Trump himself, where exactly he stands on unauthorized immigrants. His campaign has been the worst-case scenario for the Republicans who warned after the 2012 election that their party needed to tone down the anti-immigrant rhetoric and improve its standing in the Latino community to have any chance at survival.Trump infamously began his run for the White House by promising a wall along the border with Mexico and saying the country was sending murderers and rapists into the United States. He then promised to round up undocumented immigrants and send them all back to their home countries. It was never a realistic policy offering, but it was one he made repeatedly. He now seems to be backing away from it. On Wednesday, Trump “polled” the audience by applause on whether an undocumented immigrant who had been in the U.S. for years should be allowed to go through some sort of process and stay in the country ― the broad strokes of immigration reform he criticized opponents including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for supporting. But there’s a very important caveat: Trump hasn’t endorsed the type of immigration reform Bush or Rubio floated. Both of them had detailed policy proposals for undocumented immigrants; he does not. For all of the fanfare about his remarks, Trump hasn’t yet said whether he would allow undocumented immigrants to obtain legal status.Trump’s team insists he isn’t changing his positions. When a campaign aide described Trump’s current immigration endorsement plans, it sounded more like an acknowledgement that it’s impossible to deport 11 million people than an endorsement of legal status for undocumented immigrants.Trump told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Thursday that there is “not a path to legalization unless people leave the country if they come back in, and then they have to start paying taxes. But there is no path to legalization unless they leave the country and come back.”Still, even a rhetorical shift is a relief for Republicans who’ve been calling for a better tone on immigration for years. “There’s a small bit of vindication that in a last-ditch effort Trump is adopting the same talking points that some Republicans had used a year and a half ago to try to find a sensible pathway forward on this issue,” said Ryan Williams, a Republican strategist who worked as an adviser to Bush’s 2016 presidential campaign and for 2012 nominee Mitt Romney.All of this has produced a fair amount of trolling, including from former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.), who was ousted by a primary opponent who accused him of supporting “amnesty.”Becky Tallent, who worked on immigration reform for Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and then-House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), noted the similarities to the way she encouraged politicians to talk about immigration. Bush weighed in as well, without any amusement, calling Trump’s shifting on the issue “abhorrent.” The Trump campaign promised details on his immigration plans in the coming days or weeks. Until then, we probably won’t know whether he has a plan to offer more than the status quo or increased enforcement. Like anything with Trump, even after he puts out more detailed plans, they could change. Outside of the conservative sphere, the immigration reform advocacy community isn’t holding their breath for something they will like. “He hasn’t really said what he’s for,” Frank Sharry of pro-reform group America’s Voice told reporters on a call about Trump’s latest comments. “It’s a rhetorical float, and given 15 months of overt bigotry and racism towards Latinos and immigrants, color us skeptical that he’s actually going to go forward with a real policy shift.” "

I just think that every once in a while, I could probably do, I could make statements maybe a little bit differently,” he said.Then he suggested that “a lot of people” didn’t want him to express any regret at all.“A lot of people like my statements,” Trump said. “Frankly, a lot of people said, ‘Oh, don’t even say that. We love your statements.’”“I’m a very honest person. I’m an honorable person,” he added. “But if I soften things up in terms of statements made, that would be OK.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
