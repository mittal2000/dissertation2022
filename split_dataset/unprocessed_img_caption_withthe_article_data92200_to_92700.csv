A Scenic Helicopter Ride over the Okavango DeltaBelieved to be the world's largest inland delta, this region is flooded by the Okavango River each year, bringing an abundance of diverse wildlife to the area when the surrounding regions are in the midst of their dry season. Spot lions, cheetah, rhinos and giraffe, among many more majestic species, and between exploring on water and land safaris, see the delta from the skies by flying over this spectacle of nature on a helicopter tour.When To Go June through October are the best months for game viewing.CONGO2. A Helicopter Tour of Virunga National ParkWhile many choose to see the mountain gorillas of Uganda and Rwanda, the neighboring nation of Congo has its own extraordinary appeal. Declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Virunga National Park is dedicated to the conservation of mountain gorillas, chimpanzees, forest elephants and okapi. Virunga also encompasses a chain of eight volcanoes, including Mount Nyiragongo - a volcano that's been continuously erupting for the last century - alongside the Rwenzori Mountains, which are the source of the Nile River. On multi-day helicopter tours see this landscape from the skies, with treks into the forest to seek out the region's famous wildlife species when you're back on solid ground.When To Go June to September are the drier months, but the region can be visited throughout the year.ETHIOPIA3. A Helicopter Tour through EthiopiaWith both mountains and lowland, Ethiopia has a number of ecologically distinct areas. Ethiopia's highest peaks, The Simiens, rise to a lofty 4,543 meters, while the salt pans and acid lakes of the Danakil Depression lie below sea level. On multi-day helicopter tours get a bird's-eye view of this spectacular landscape by flying from the capital Addis Ababa. Venture along the Blue Nile Gorge to Lalibela, a town that's known for its rock-cut churches, then by following the course of the Tekeze River, continue on to the majestic Simiens - home to endemic species like the Ethiopian wolf - and the Danakil Depression where you might catch sight of the nomadic people leading their camels across the land. Finally, witness the active volcano Erta Ale as it bubbles over with molten lava.When To Go The rainy season runs from April to September but the country can be visited during any month.KENYA4. A Balloon Safari over the Maasai MaraSet out early to reach your launch site before dawn, then rise into the skies as the sun comes up revealing the magnificent landscape below. The Maasai Mara is one of Africa's most famous safari destinations, due to the annual arrival of the Great Migration, in which more than two million wildebeest and zebra make their way north from Tanzania's Serengeti plains. Year-round though, there are ample wildlife sightings of the big mammal species as you drift silently over the forest and plains, while pods of hippos bask in the Mara and Talek Rivers. When To Go Balloon flights are rewarding all year round, but go anytime from July to October if you want to witness the Great Migration.MOZAMBIQUE5. A Helicopter Flight to the Bazaruto IslandsOff the coast of Mozambique, archipelagos of white-sand coral islands lie in the crystal clear waters of the Indian Ocean. Of these groups of islands, the Bazaruto Archipelago offers ultimate seclusion in a pristine environment that's designated national park. Take a helicopter flight from the coastal town of Vilanculos out to Azura Benguerra Island to see the islands from above before reaching your luxury lodge.When To Go Monsoons sometimes occur in February, March and April, but you can travel throughout the entire year.NAMIBIA6.

A Scenic Flight over the Skeleton CoastOne of the advantages of aerial safari is that is enables you to see places that are inaccessible by land. This is what makes a private flight over The Skeleton Coast so rewarding. The coastline took its name from the treacherous nature of its current that has resulted in shipwrecks along its shores, while further inland, shifting sand dunes contrast starkly with the vast salt pans, and desert oases dug by baboons and elephants support a unique ecosystem. Alongside these desert-adapted species, the nomadic Himba people continue to live on the land too, adding to the unique beauty of this region.When To Go Travel is possible throughout the year.SOUTH AFRICA8. A Helicopter Flight over Hermanus BayEach year southern right whales migrate from Antarctica to the warmer waters of South Africa's coastline.

A Balloon Safari over Serengeti National ParkThis vast UNESCO World Heritage national park is one of the world's most iconic spots for safari, in part due to the annual migration that passes through. Hundreds of thousands of wildebeest, zebra and gazelle stampede across the plains with their predators close behind. This also makes the park a popular spot for hot air balloon flights.

Would you expect an airline which had experienced two catastrophic incidents in one year to be the source of promotions which also could earn a prize in the genre, if such awards existed. Neither Pinter, nor Beckett could have thought this one up. In terms of absurdity it outdoes Ionesco, Genet or any of the practitioners of the so-called Theater of the Absurd. ""In a Twitter Post, Malaysia Airlines Sends the Wrong Message,"" NYT, 11/28/14) read the headline of a small obscure piece in The Times. The Times article went on to report the following tweet from Malaysia Airlines, ""Want to go somewhere, but don't know where?"" The Times piece also recounted a Twitter user's response that the promotion was ""probably not the best choice of words for an airline that doesn't know where one of its planes is."" You have to marvel however at the brilliance of the faux pas from an airline whose Flight 370 is still the subject of a massive search and whose Flight l7 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was shot out of the sky by pro-Russian Ukrainian separatists. Humorists like Lenny Bruce pushed the limits of what could be the subject of humor and today cable hosts like Bill Maher are constantly pushing the envelope. Maher recently said about the pope, ""My hope is that someday he's going to have little too much sacramental wine and just blurt out, 'I'm not really religious, but I'm spiritual.'""But neither he nor his counterpart Jon Stewart could have come up with a doozer like the Malaysia airlines tweet. Perhaps truly black humor can only be produced both those who don't see any light on the horizon.photo of Lenny Bruce's arrest in l961 (Examiner Press){This was originally posted to The Screaming Pope, Francis Levy's blog of rants and reactions to contemporary politics, art and culture}"

Moscow archivists are spreading misinformation to whitewash Soviet history. Last month, Russian archives posted documents purportedly showing that the Polish Army was allied with Nazi Germany. The agency's head, Andrei Artizov made the absurd claim that Poland stabbed Russia ""in the back."" This is rehashed agitprop from a 1945 Stalinist show trial. In the ""Trial of the Sixteen,"" Joseph Stalin prosecuted Polish underground leaders as Adolf Hitler's allies. It's Orwellian doublespeak because it was Stalin who allied himself with Hitler in the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. In reality, World War II began when Germany and Soviet Russia attacked Poland from two sides, splitting the country in half. Poland's freely elected government was exiled to London, while the Polish underground army continued fighting the Nazis for the next six years.In the territory captured by the Soviet Army, half a million Poles were sent to Siberian gulags where they were starved, frozen and worked to death. Stalin ordered the murder of 22,000 Polish officers in the Katyn Forest. Their hands were tied behind their backs and they were each shot in the back of their heads. When Germany invaded Russia, the Nazis discovered the mass graves and reported it. Stalin lied and claimed the Germans did it.Poles stabbed Russians in the back? No, Russians shot Poles in the back of their heads.After six years of German occupation, the people of Warsaw rose up when the Soviet Army approached the east bank of the Wisla River. The Russians urged Poles to ""rise up,"" but it was a cynical ploy. If Poles liberated their own capital, the Russians knew they'd never take over. So this time, Stalin ordered his troops to watch for 63 days as the Germans killed 200,000 Poles, mostly civilians, during the Warsaw Uprising.Afterward, Russian troops marched through the rest of Poland. Stalin was not about to relinquish this territory. So when the remaining Polish underground army and political leaders gathered in 1945, Stalin invited them to a villa outside Warsaw to organize a new government. It was a trap. The Poles were kidnapped by the NKVD, Stalin's secret police, and flown to Moscow and jailed in the infamous Lubyanka Prison where they were interrogated, tortured and prepared for their trial. There were 16 Polish officials in all. They fought Nazi Germany longer than anyone, yet Stalin charged them as collaborators. Unbeknownst to the Poles, a month before their arrest, Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill made a backdoor deal at the Yalta Conference ceding half of Poland's territory to the Soviet Union in exchange for Stalin's promise to allow ""free and unfettered elections"" in an ""independent Poland.""Stalin had no intention of keeping this promise. The Soviets declared that they had ""liberated"" Poland and then propped up a puppet regime, the Polish Committee of National Liberation. The Polish Home Army and government in exile in London objected, but to no avail. At first, the Russians claimed they did not have the 16 in custody. But when it became obvious that they did, the Kremlin had to stage a trial as propaganda production. The 16 were marched into the courtroom at gunpoint and forced to confess to bogus crimes. Most of the prisoners broke down, and were eventually allowed to live in Soviet-occupied Poland. But three of the 16 mysteriously disappeared from prison and were never heard from again.George Orwell wrote a scathing letter to the British democratic socialist magazine Tribune, saying the 16 Poles ""were accused of trying to preserve the independence of their country against an unelected puppet government.""So last month when the Russian Federal Archival Agency once again attacked the 16 Poles, the Polish Institute for National Memory took out a full page ad in the Russian newspaper Komsomolska Pravda asking for anyone with information on those disappeared prisoners to speak up.Russians are known for airbrushing photos and erasing blots from their history. Hopefully, someday soon, Russians will get the democratic government that everyone deserves. Democracies make good neighbors, while autocracies are dangerous.Rough justice is nothing new for the Kremlin. It has historically used show trials to terrorize domestic critics and its neighbors. Even now, the suspect in the Boris Nemstov assassination says he was beaten and forced to confess. The truth is unlikely to emerge, even with a show trial.That's because in Russia, justice is not blind. It's a theater production."

Several outlets this week, including the Los Angeles Times, Quartz and KQED, shared data on how much water is required to produce different agricultural products. Meat is by far the biggest water hog, a 2012 study on water footprints published in the journal Ecosystems found. A pound of beef, for example, requires 1,847 gallons of water to produce. But would going vegan, vegetarian or ""reducetarian"" help California as it weathers its worst drought in 1,200 years? In short, not really, one expert said. Newsha Ajami, the director of urban water policy with Stanford University's Water in the West initiative, told The Huffington Post that if everyone in California -- the nation's fourth-leading beef producer -- were to go vegetarian, farmers probably wouldn't slow production and would continue selling meat internationally.""It eventually may impact water use,"" she said. ""It’s not fast. It’s a long-term plan. So if we decided to do that tomorrow, that doesn’t mean it’s going to impact the drought at all ... Don’t forget, because this is a global market, they might have other customers they’re selling their meat to.""However, Ajami said, that doesn't mean people should disregard the water footprint of their meals.""I think at the end of the day ... eating less water-intense food products certainly is important to lower demand,"" she said. U.S. policymakers are starting to encourage that shift. For the first time, the federal Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee this year decided to factor environmental sustainability into its recommendations and concluded that a diet lower in animal-based products is both healthy and better for the environment, the Hill reported. The report is currently undergoing a public comment period and has received significant backlash from the meat industry.The authors of the 2012 study on agricultural water use came to a similar conclusion. ""Managing the demand for animal products by promoting a dietary shift away from a meat-rich diet will be an inevitable component in the environmental policy of governments,"" they wrote. That's certainly food for thought in a nation where, according to Scientific American, meat consumption alone accounts for 30 percent of our water footprint. "
7,QUEER VOICES,A Case of Cis Regret,"Lola Phoenix, ContributorAgender writer based in London, working in marketing, LGBTQ ac...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-case-of-cis-regret_b_7020598.html,"I was actually born with a body that matched my agender identity. I didn't make sex hormones. But I was bullied so viciously for looking androgynous, I chose to be ""normal."" And now I have cis regret.",2015-04-09,A screenshot of my GIC rejection letter last paragraph,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-07-1428440609-1571501-nottransenoughsmall-thumb.png,"A cisgender person is a person whose self-identity conforms with the gender that corresponds to their biological sex. Both ""trans"" and ""cis"" come from Latin and chemistry, ""trans"" meaning across and ""cis"" meaning ""on this side."" I was born with a disorder called Septo-Optic Dysplasia and because of that I don't make a variety of hormones -- including estrogen and testosterone. I grew up looking androgynous and was bullied constantly for it. By the time I was 12 and I could start hormone replacement therapy for estrogen, I jumped at it. I just wanted to be normal.Fast forward a decade. I stumbled upon the concept of genderqueer, then found the term non-binary and finally, like picking the right wand in Ollivanders, ""agender."" The more I accepted and understood my identity, the more I realized my chest didn't fit. It wasn't right.Putting on a binder solved all of my worries. Everything felt 100 percent better. Despite the tight pressure, despite the soreness from it cutting into my sides, I felt right. And that's when I made the official leap five years ago to try and get my chest corrected. But my chest isn't large enough for a reduction, according to GPs. So after three years of referral circles, I tried a gender identity clinic. I was initially referred in June 2013, but my first appointment wasn't until September 2014.In the five years I was pursuing surgery, I came out to my friends. I didn't advertise my non-binary identity at work, but I didn't advertise being disabled, bisexual or anything else.At first, the idea that I would never been seen as agender was depressing. But then I thought more about visibility. I thought of the fact that trans women of color who make up the majority of the murdered are visible to the point of death. I thought of the small part of me that is indigenous American and that, if I knew my tribe, they might have a society where people like me were accepted -- maybe even celebrated.Even with surgery, the hormone treatment I was given at 12 years old had done it's job -- I'd never be seen as genderless again. All that became important was fixing my body. Society would take much longer.Just before Trans Visibility Day, I received my official discharge letter: ""...we would not countenance endorsement of an irreversible surgical procedure unless the individual had been able to demonstrably consolidate a social transition including name change to the preferred gender role.""Little did I know, I had two appointments to prove myself. I was never asked what my pronoun was, who I was out to as agender or if I planned on changing my legal name. I told the truth in that I went by ""Lola"" and saw no reason to change it.Years of being bullied taught me that if people can't read your gender, they will demand to know. Being constantly asked what I am is far more distressing for me than for people to assume. No one will see me as agender. My discharge letter said I was ""accepting"" of that -- but the truth is that I am only resigned to it. I have no choice.There also is no societal role for me to transition to. What does that even mean for an agender person? What does it mean for any gender? Before I had my first appointment, I went to an introductory session where they assured me that they treat non-binary people. But if they still base surgery recommendation on ""societal roles"" of gender, then it's no surprise I've never heard of a single positive experience from a non-binary person in a GIC.What the rest of society doesn't realize or see is that trans people are often stuck in this conundrum to receive any medical treatment. If a trans woman wants to be ""taken seriously,"" she better show up to her appointments in a dress and demonstrating her societal role. If a trans man wants to be seen as serious enough to get surgery, he better not paint his nails. The gatekeeping standards set upon our shoulder is a concentrated version of 50s gender roles we have to bend to in order to get help.For a lot of trans people, demonstrating our ""need"" for medical help often comes to walking a tightrope between showing how distraught and uncomfortable our bodies can make us but at the same time not seeming too unstable as to be unbelievable all together. It's unsurprising then so many people, even in positions of power over trans healthcare, believe us all to be mentally ill.Some believe proving our need is necessary. The media have over-publicized the few cases of ""trans regret,"" making it seem more common than it actually is. But really would I have waited for two years to get help if I were so confused? The journey we go through before we even understand ourselves means that by the time we seek a referral to a GIC, most of us aren't confused.Did my acceptance of my situation and the positive way I feel toward my identity actually hurt me more than help me? Just because society sees ""Lola"" as feminine doesn't mean I have to. ""Lola"" isn't inherently feminine any more than I am. Though I told them that getting my surgery was not about convincing the world to see me as agender, I still failed to convince them.Maybe I'm just not trans enough. I was actually born with a body that matched my agender identity. I didn't make sex hormones. I had what every trans kid dreams of. But I was bullied so viciously for looking androgynous, I chose to be ""normal."" And now I have cis regret.I can only hope that a wider understanding of trans issues and the experiences of what we go through will make for a change in how people like me are able to get help in the future.For more information about my journey, visit my YouCaring page."

I chose something contemporary, Melancholia, directed by the strange, and often fascinating, Lars Von Trier and starring Kirsten Dunst and Kiefer Sutherland. I won't even try to describe the story ,but the movie contains, in its opening 10-minute sequence, some of the most beautiful and magical images ever created on film. It was this that I wanted to reveal to Ran, who didn't know the movie. I watched him absorb the scene, live in its moment of abandon and imagination. Those few minutes of observation allowed me to understand just how important film is to Ran, why he is so consumed by its power, and why it has been a continuing source of inspiration in his music-making. An extraordinary improvising musician who styles himself a ""noir pianist,"" Ran celebrates his 80th birthday on August 20 this year. He can look back, and indeed forward, at a life spent entirely in music as a performer and as an educator. His past and current students revere him and speak in the same awed tones I have heard used by those who have studied with Nadia Boulanger, Carl Flesch and Vera Roza. He has some of the greatest ears in the business, he is musically challenging and he stretches his students, and indeed all his collaborators, with the new directions and ideas his improvisations, compositions and arrangements take. This is, after all, a musician who worked with Dizzy Gillespie and who Gunther Schuller charged with creating New England Conservatory's Third Stream department 42 years ago. (That department, which has burgeoned into Contemporary Improvisation or CI, now led by the energizing Hankus Netsky, is perhaps the most unique and creative program at any conservatory in the country.)Ran still performs and much prefers to play with all the house lights off. I must say that the dark has a way of galvanizing the ears, and I would love to hear more performers experimenting with this style of delivery. Try listening to his recent album with the great jazz singer Dominique Eade for a superlative example of his art. And maybe even try it with the lights off!Which is a great segue to the world of film noir, the genre, or, dare I call it art form, which permeates Ran's work as a musician. He has been fascinated by the genre all his life, and he is not alone. Its unmistakable essence still pervades so much film-making even today. Where indeed would Martin Scorsese or Quentin Tarantino be without the foundation and inspiration of film noir?We all recognize the idiom intuitively whenever it appears. Just think of all those classics, The Maltese Falcon, The Big Sleep, Sunset Boulevard, Double Indemnity, Lady from Shanghai, The Third Man, Shadow of a Doubt, Cape Fear and perhaps the most disturbing of them all, Night of the Hunter, the only movie directed by Charles Laughton, who creates his own world of fear and anxiety through the inclusion of children who are central to the plot. But I could extend this list almost indefinitely. Film noir captures something in our collective consciousness that we respond to viscerally and emotionally. First off there is the style. America in the 1940s and '50s with its chic and energy and confidence. Then there are the characters. The men as anti-heroes, a bit seedy, not necessarily handsome, but fascinating, as portrayed by a Robert Mitchum (in photo right) or Humphrey Bogart. These are guys who are slightly damaged by life, street wise, cynical and vulnerable. They are also very tough. The women smolder. Their dark contralto voices are marinated in gin martinis over which the vermouth bottle barely pauses. Their ever present, languorous cigarettes punctuate the action and the interplay with these tough guys. (See Ann Savage from Detour in photo below.) But it's the women who are really in charge, who are far more powerful than the guys. Until, of course, that moment when the seductress falls into the man's arms, weak and grateful, but... don't believe it.Film noir has to be seen in black and white. Just imagine how wrong those ever lengthening shadows in The Third Man would be if it had been shot in color. Everyone has to stalk around in long rain coats, hastily tied at the waist. And hats are the order of the day for both men and women. Can you imagine Dana Andrews in Laura not having his hat at all times? It's an essential prop which helps color the character. The films also have an absorbing patina of sex, both suppressed and overt. Think of the manifest play the very young Lauren Bacall makes for Bogart in To Have and Have Not. It's so intimate and sensual. And then there's the dialogue. There's tons of it rattling out at light speed. Think of Clifton Webb in Laura in his bathroom dashing off more bon mots than Oscar Wilde. Tarantino must have spent a whole year watching film noir before he finally came up with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction which then reintroduced the whole concept of the importance of the screenplay in the 1990s.No wonder then that Ran Blake has spent the last ten years devoting himself to a very special film noir performance project at NEC where each year he selects a classic such as Laura, a collection of Brandos, works of Claude Chabrol, Cat People, The Spiral Staircase, Bunny Lake is Missing and I Walked with a Zombie. The movie is screened in part, sometimes with fragments of the original sound track but more often with new music or arrangements performed by students in the CI department. It makes for an unforgettable musical and filmic event of originality and wonder.To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the film noir series Ran has chosen the classic Gaslight. There are two versions of the movie. The British original dating from 1940 directed by Thorold Dickinson with Anton Wallbrook as the intimidating husband and Diana Wynyard as his wifely victim. It's based very much on the play by Patrick Hamilton. And then, just four years later, Hollywood went for a remake directed by George Cukor and starring the great beauty Ingrid Bergman (in photo right) as the poor wife and Charles Boyer as the sinister husband. Hollywood also utilized a new screenplay by John van Druten and strayed quite a long way from the original play. This version cleaned up at the Oscars that year with Bergman winning best actress. Ran intends editing between these two versions in what should be a great night at the movies... with music. You can catch all of this on April 13 in Jordan Hall at 8.00 p.m. It will also be an opportunity to wish Ran many happy returns, and for whom I pay special tribute in this blog."

In equally outrageous news, SAE chant leader, Levi Pettit, called a press conference to collect support from the Black community in Oklahoma after leading a rendition of a colonial lynching song.Although both incidents were commenced by white male students, both incidents became black people's responsibility, as we were left to bear the burden of forgiveness.Is it me, or is anyone else frustrated that there is an implicit expectation on Black people to absolve the guilt and racist behavior of white people?We recently witnessed Mo'ne Davis, a 13-year-old black girl, express maturity in her magnanimous approach to forgive despite being called a whore by an adult. And instead of seeking any kind of retribution, Mo'ne turned the other cheek - going so far as to request that the college student be reinstated to his sports team. And though this act of forgiveness was a very noble thing to do, I'm frustrated by the implicit cost she had to pay for it.After forgiving the man who called her a slut, many on social media celebrated Mo'ne for being a ""class act."" And in fact she was, and is. But to measure her character based on her capacity to forgive an act of racism was - and is - still erroneous.The media labeling Mo'ne a 'class act' is double-pronged. In addition to dismissing the accountability necessary for his actions, it normalizes Mo'ne's response to racism and sexism, and consequently deems more confrontational methods as illegitimate.By not confronting his racism and sexism, Mo'ne's actions suggest that it is appropriate for people to say and do whatever they want. It insinuates that Black men, women, and children are meant to carry the burden of inflammatory claims, and suggests that people aren't exemplifying classy behavior when they decide to challenge it publicly.The public's celebration of Mo'ne was not about her integrity on the field, but her inadvertent compliance with oppression. She, having been the victim, forfeited her right to be outraged because she believed his comments were isolated, when in fact they are a part of a larger system. A system that perpetually demands black people to forgive their oppressors - even in the absence of accountability.An all too familiar scene -- almost identical to SAE's Levi Pettit's Press conference.Similarly, instead of placing the burden of correction on SAE's Levi Pettit, it fell on the Black Oklahomans he targeted in the video, who, ironically, flanked to his side during his poor excuse of a press conference.Pettit's apology and press conference was a complete farce and showed no real signs of remorse or empathy that would lead me to believe that Pettit actually gets it. When you listen to the video, you hear traces of indignation and apathy. None of it confirming that he understands the ramifications of his actions - just that he's sorry he got caught. *Cue further frustration*I am frustrated because I did not watch Pettit apologize for himself or his actions. Instead, I watched Black community leaders apologizing for Pettit.Black community leaders and clergy, in routine fashion, came together to cape for the indiscretions of dominant culture instead of being bold enough to hold it accountable. To see those leaders standing behind him made me sick because it was an obvious (and strategic) publicity stunt. And though the individuals behind him didn't actually speak during the conference, their silence verified their buy-in.But why did they feel so compelled to stand behind someone who chanted his preference of seeing their sons hung from a tree as opposed to joining his fraternity? And what kind of message does it send out to OU's Black student population? And to the larger community? That one should feel inclined to forgive those who desire to kill you, because you'd want the same done for you? Frankly, I 'm beginning to think so.That's why I pose this very simple hypothetical to those Black Oklahoman leaders that stood behind Pettit: If the shoe was on the other foot, and their son had sung a similarly racist and hate-filled chant directed towards White students, would Levi Pettit's father be standing in solidarity with one of their Black sons? Quite simply, in this society, even when White people are to blame for racial indiscretion, Black people are always expected to absolve the crime, its guilt, and the repercussions of the actions in a timely fashion. It is for this reason that the media was so quick to celebrate Mo'ne Davis' willingness to forgive. And as if that wasn't bad enough, they then attempted to measure her character based on her decision to excuse racist and sexist behavior.But contrary to popular belief, Black people are not responsible for carrying the burden of white remorse. We are no one's moral mules and neither are we anyone's ethical scapegoats. We are more than that. Much more. Black people are autonomous and responsible for none other than themselves and deserve to operate as such. And gratefully, people of color are starting to redefine morality on their own terms and are casting off the burden of forgiveness, one highly publicized racist incident at a time."

NBC News erroneously reported the capture of two suspects and killing of another in the attack on a French newspaper office and has been forced to issue a correction. The false report came on NBC's flagship ""Nightly News"" Wednesday, Jan. 7, 2015, and was dialed back over the next few hours. Williams, was to explain the error to viewers on Thursday's broadcast. (AP Photo/Matt Sayles, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5c67f2100002501c87182.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After months of relative silence from NBC News leadership regarding Brian Williams, Vanity Fair has published a new exposé of the controversy surrounding the ""Nightly News"" anchor. The lengthy investigation by Bryan Burrough dives into the network's history and all that has ""plagued"" it since it was purchased by Comcast in 2011. There was Ann Curry’s messy ouster from ""Today"" in 2012, slipping morning show ratings, David Gregory's demise as host of ""Meet The Press"" and Chuck Todd's takeover -- all leading up to Williams' fall this year from beloved host to untrusted ""liar"" following several inaccuracies in his reporting. The VF piece offered behind-the-scenes insight into what went wrong with Williams and the network's handling of the controversy, from his insecurities to tension with Tom Brokaw to his public apology in February, all the way to the ongoing investigation being led by Richard Esposito. Here are a few of the new allegations made in the story:1. Brian Williams blamed a possible brain tumor for his fabricated Iraq helicopter story.Turness and the other executives who had gotten involved quickly became frustrated, as they would remain for days, with Williams’s inability to explain himself. “He couldn’t say the words ‘I lied,’ ” recalls one NBC insider. “We could not force his mouth to form the words ‘I lied.’ He couldn’t explain what had happened. [He said,] ‘Did something happen to [my] head? Maybe I had a brain tumor, or something in my head?’ He just didn’t know. We just didn’t know. We had no clear sense what had happened. We got the best [apology] we could get.”2. Things at the network have been ""a nightmare"" since Comcast acquired it.“When Comcast took over, they had the No. 1 morning show, the No. 1 Sunday show, and the No. 1 evening broadcast,” says a former top NBC executive. “That’s all completely fallen apart. I don’t know how you blame anyone but Comcast and the people it brought in. It’s been a nightmare.”3. NBC News president Deborah Turness has no idea how to run a news organization.“News is a very particular thing, NBC is a very particular beast, and Deborah, well, she really doesn’t have a f****** clue,” says a senior NBC executive involved in recent events. “She’s letting the inmates run the asylum. You have kids? Well, if you let them, they’ll have ice cream every night. Same thing in TV. If you let the people on air do what they want, whenever they want, this is what happens.”4. Some things about Brian Williams irked Tim Russert.“What always bothered Tim was Brian’s lack of interest in things that mattered most, that were front and center, like politics and world events,” says a person who knew both men well. “Brian has very little interest in politics. It’s not in his blood. What Brian cares about is logistics, the weather, and planes and trains and helicopters.”5. Brian Williams was insecure about being a ""journalistic lightweight.""Williams took the anchor chair in December 2004, after a career handling the news at local stations and MSNBC; though he had worked as NBC’s chief White House correspondent for two years, he was never a foreign or war correspondent. He was deeply insecure about this, some of his friends believe. These people suggest that his storied broadcasts from New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, which proved a boon to his ratings, were in part an effort to overcome the perception that he was a journalistic lightweight. 6. Brian Williams is ""bitter""... and there is definitely some beef between him and Tom Brokaw.“Tom will never say this for the record, but I’ve talked to him about this, and I can tell you for a fact Tom is livid about this,” says a friend. “Tom didn’t push Brian out, but he didn’t try to save him, either.”7. Brian Williams bad-mouthed network executives to get ahead.The venue where several top NBC executives witnessed Williams’s efforts at corporate politics firsthand was the 51st-floor executive dining room, which Burke had spruced up and encouraged them to use.Read the full story on Vanity Fair here."
13,POLITICS,Nice Try Rand Paul But It Won't Work,"Earl Ofari Hutchinson, ContributorAuthor and political analyst",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nice-try-rand-paul-but-it_b_7024850.html,The one thing that Paul banks on to separate him from the expected large pack of GOP senators is his big pitch to make the GOP more minority-friendly. The hardest part of the sell will be getting minorities to think that they can somehow share the same space in the GOP with the legions of Tea Party adherents.,2015-04-08,"US Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) speaks to supporters during the kickoff of the National Stand with Rand tour on April 7, 2015 in Louisville, Kentucky. Conservative US Senator Rand Paul announced on April 7 that he is running for his party's nomination for the 2016 presidential race, making him the second major Republican to join the contest. AFP PHOTO / MICHAEL B. THOMAS (Photo credit should read Michael B. Thomas/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f1962000000f0201dafb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Freshly minted 2016 GOP presidential candidate Rand Paul has a few good things going for him. He has talked back to the war hawks. He wants to radically rein in out of control intelligence spying. He wants to chip away at the draconian drug laws that still incarcerate mostly minorities for long stretches for petty drug crimes. This has brought lots of grumbles and raised eyebrows from GOP hard liners who say that he isn't the right fit for the GOP trying desperately to take back the White House. But the one thing that Paul banks on to separate him from the expected large pack of GOP senators, governors and personalities that in the weeks ahead will also toss their hats into the presidential rink is his big pitch to make the GOP more minority-friendly. Before he took the stage at a downtown Louisville hotel ballroom to announce his candidacy, he was preceded to the podium by a black minister and former GOP congressman J.C. Watts. The stark contrast of the minister and Watts on stage facing a mostly white crowd of supporters wasn't lost on some observers. It's a huge indicator of the double bind Paul is in. On the one hand, he has to sell the notion of more minorities in the GOP to the party's traditional conservative base. While trying to sell minorities, especially blacks, that the GOP really does want and welcome them. This may be the more daunting of the two. Paul, though, has made a few photo-op appearances before black audiences, church groups, and academics, and last summer's National Urban League's annual convention in Cincinnati. So far it has produced meager results. He is still little more than a blip on the chart in terms of name recognition among African-Americans. There is absolutely no indication that his make-nice campaign with blacks has moved the dial up in the number of black voters that say they are willing to give the Paul presidential candidacy a real look. Paul, however, has another problem that will be tough to shake if, and when, he trots around to black groups imploring them to give him a fair listen. The problem was on glaring display when he spoke at the Urban League convention. He spoke to a nearly empty room. This despite the best efforts Urban League officials made to dragoon people to show up. There's still the shadow of his widely quoted smoking gun interview with the Louisville Courier Journal in 2010 in which he blew off the 1964 Civil Rights Act as a slap against private businesses' right to racially discriminate. When asked to explain, he did the obligatory disavowal of racism, but did not back away from his belief that the Civil Rights Act went way too far in telling private businesses that they couldn't racially discriminate. Paul knows that position would render any presidential campaign DOA. So now, whenever asked, he sounds a note of enthusiasm in claiming that he backs it without any reservations. This isn't all. Paul was dogged for a time by revelations that a few of his key staff members had strong ties to neo-Confederate and racist fringe groups. He quickly disavowed any personal connect with these groups and their philosophies. The odor and the suspicion of the possible connections haven't gone away. Make no mistake, as the presidential campaign gathers steam in the months to come that checkered past will be repeatedly dredged up and tossed back at Paul. The hardest part of the sell, though, will be getting minorities to think that they can somehow share the same space in the GOP with the legions of Tea Party adherents that still pack a wallop within the GOP. Though, the wild-eyed, naked race-baiting, serial Obama-bashing, that was the Tea Party's stock in trade during the first few years of the Obama presidency has at least visibly subsided, no one really thinks for a moment that the Tea Party has amended its ways and can or will morph into a rainbow coalition. The racial bruises and lumps that it laid out are still too raw.During most of this time, Paul has been the one GOP notable that has been most associated with the Tea Party. His still pronounced mishmash of ultra-conservatism and libertarian pronouncements that government should have minimal role in many areas of law and public policy concerns and that includes civil rights laws and enforcement is still too close for comfort to the Tea Party line. This old, worn and thoroughly discredited view will still warm the hearts of the packs of closet bigots who pine for the old days when racial and gender discrimination was the American norm and government did little to protect black and gay rights.Paul obviously believes that he can twist the hoops enough for people to see himself and his approach as the winning path to the White House. The best that can be said about this is nice try Rand, but it won't work.--Earl Ofari Hutchinson is an author and political analyst.
