4,POLITICS,"Donald Trump Reportedly Says He's With Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders On Drug Pricing",Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-drug-prices-hillary-bernie_us_56a7ac37e4b0172c65943f0b,And to think drugmakers were worried about the Democrats.,2016-01-26,"On health care, Trump may be finding his inner liberal.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56a7ac951f00007f00216aca.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump has jumped into the debate over prescription drug prices -- and, if reports are correct, he’s standing in the same place as Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and President Barack Obama.According to The Associated Press, Trump told a New Hampshire audience on Monday night that he thinks Americans are paying way too much for their prescription drugs. To remedy this, the Republican presidential front-runner said, he would have the federal government negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies to obtain lower prices. Doing so, Trump reportedly said, could enable the U.S. to “save $300 billion” a year.The Trump campaign has not distributed official material to support this statement and has not responded to inquiries from The Huffington Post. That makes it impossible to know precisely what the candidate has in mind or how he came up with the $300 billion figure, which is actually slightly more than total U.S. spending on outpatient drugs as of 2014.Trump could be calling for the government to bargain with drugmakers over the price of pharmaceuticals that seniors obtain through Medicare Part D. It’s also possible, although less likely, that he could have something far more ambitious in mind, like having the government negotiate the price for all drugs sold in the U.S. And of course, it’s possible Trump was speaking off-script, without much attention to detail. It wouldn't be the first time.But if the reports are right and Trump sticks with his position, he'd be squarely on the Democratic side of a debate that has divided the two parties for at least 20 years. Americans today pay far more for drugs than people living overseas because the governments of other countries deal directly with drug companies and set prices as part of their national health systems. This is true of routine prescriptions, like the medications that tens of millions of Americans take for allergies or acid reflux, and it’s true of more exotic drugs as well. One stark example is Gleevec, a leukemia treatment that costs Americans an average of $6,214 per regimen, according to the International Federation of Health Plans. The same drug costs the Swiss national health system just $3,363. The price for Canada’s government health system is just $1,141.Democrats have long insisted that the U.S. government should have similar power over drug companies. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton issued such a call in 2008 and has done so again this year. Her rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has said enabling the government to set drug prices is part of his proposal to create a “single-payer” insurance system. Obama has also called for government negotiation of prices.Republicans and their allies have traditionally opposed such measures, arguing that cutting into drug companies' profits would reduce innovation. They have also argued that the government could not negotiate successfully with drug companies unless it was willing to walk away from negotiations and deny insurance coverage for certain drugs. Advocates for government drug pricing rarely acknowledge that last point -- which, the GOP and conservatives say, could mean people lose access to medications they want or need.On Tuesday, a spokesman for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Trump’s chief rival for the GOP nomination, said he was not surprised to see Trump defy conservative orthodoxy since the business mogul expressed support for a single-payer system in 1999 and has spoken admiringly of such systems since then. Trump has, however, recently disavowed intentions to create such a system here. “Trump has already promised that he will support a single-payer healthcare system, so it is not surprising that he thinks the government can set pricing for drugs,” Rick Tyler, a Cruz spokesman, told HuffPost. “The problem is that when government interferes in the market, and especially the healthcare market, the result is always the same: high prices, lower quality, less choice and fewer innovations, and it will cost lives.”Yet the experience abroad -- and for certain U.S. organizations like the Veterans Health Administration, which has long obtained discounts using a similar mechanism -- suggests that patients don’t suffer when the government negotiates drug prices. There’s no question that Trump is seizing on a popular position. In an August 2015 poll by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, 83 percent of respondents said they favored having the government negotiate drug prices for Medicare. Even among respondents who identified themselves as Republican, support was high: 74 percent.Of course, the primary political obstacle to giving the government control over drug prices has been the lobbying power of the drug industry -- something Trump was sure to point out on Monday. “We don’t do it,” Trump said. “Why? Because of the drug companies.”Also on HuffPost:"

""I'm running for Congress to give people their voices back so together we can address the real concerns facing our communities.""Teachout is running in New York's 19th District, which is being vacated by Rep. Chris Gibson (R). She ran against Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the 2014 Democratic gubernatorial primary. Although he defeated her -- 62 percent to 34 percent -- the fact that she was able to pull so much support away from a sitting governor was impressive. She had no previous electoral experience, spent nearly no money and had a bare-bones campaign operation. Her populist platform emphasized the anti-corruption and anti-monopoly principles she has long advocated. And she did particularly well in the Hudson Valley, which is where the moderate 19th District is located. Teachout already has the backing of the liberal Working Families Party and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, according to the New York Observer. She has also gained the support of the majority of the Democratic county chairs in the district. Teachout started in politics when she was director of online organizing for Howard Dean's 2004 presidential campaign. ""[T]he key lesson that I learned in Howard Dean’s campaign was not about technology, but it was about power,"" she told The Huffington Post in 2014. ""Because we had three months to run this campaign against Andrew Cuomo, we could not build any tools and we did not have any money to buy the best tools. So we used Facebook and Twitter. But otherwise we had a very similar model -- we empowered local groups to do their own organizing, and that made a huge difference because we had a tiny staff until we raised money.""Democrats were unsuccessful at picking up the 19th District in 2014, when Sean Eldridge, the husband of Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, moved to the district and purchased a multimillion-dollar house for his run. He was never able to overcome the perception that he was out of touch with the district and simply looking to buy a seat. Teachout moved to the 19th District about a year ago, according to the Poughkeepsie Journal, and commutes to her job at Fordham University School of Law. "
7,MEDIA,Michael Bloomberg's 2016 Ambitions May Shake Up The Race -- And His Media Company,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michael-bloomberg-2016_us_56a6362ee4b0404eb8f22c28,So how's Bloomberg going to cover Bloomberg?,2016-01-25,Bloomberg has flirted for years with the idea of running for president. Is this time for real?,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- Bloomberg, the media company, made a big bet on the 2016 election by dropping millions on star political journalists Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, launching a new politics site and producing a daily Bloomberg TV show that's also simulcast on MSNBC. Now Bloomberg, the man, is considering his own 2016 bet on an independent run -- one that would shake up not only the presidential race, but also his namesake news organization. Michael Bloomberg left his eponymous company in 2001 to run for mayor of New York City, an office he went on to hold for three terms. He returned as company CEO in September 2014 and immediately made his presence felt. He set up a desk in the newsroom and installed a new top editor, and helped shift the company's focus away from consumer-facing sites and back toward the kind of bread-and-butter topics, like global business and finance, desired by subscribers.A White House run -- or perhaps even the time needed to consider one -- would again pull Bloomberg out of the newsroom, which is now grappling with how to cover his latest presidential flirtation.""John Micklethwait is our Editor-in-Chief and is in charge of decisions about coverage,"" Bloomberg News spokesman Ty Trippet said in a statement to The Huffington Post. Bloomberg News has long placed limits on how reporters cover both the company and its famous owner, including his personal life and wealth. Its coverage of the former mayor this past weekend was noticeably scant. As major news outlets pounced after The New York Times reported Saturday that Bloomberg's advisers had drawn up plans for a potential independent run, Bloomberg Politics' contribution was only a brief summary of that story. The company licenses Times content and provided the paper’s full story to subscribers of its Bloomberg Terminal service, but didn't independently report new details. Meanwhile, Politico, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and other publications confirmed Bloomberg’s interest Saturday through their own sources, and candidates fielded questions about the hypothetical three-way race on the Sunday shows. On NBC’s “Meet the Press,” former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said her understanding was that Bloomberg would only run if Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) became the Democratic nominee instead of Clinton herself -- a scenario she said she doesn't expect to happen.Sanders, for his part, told ABC's ""This Week"" that he'd welcome the chance to run against two billionaires -- namely, Bloomberg and current Republican front-runner Donald Trump -- because Americans don't want to live in an ""oligarchy.""The notion of Bloomberg running for president has surfaced again and again over the past decade, with the former mayor's advisers extolling his strengths as a successful, pragmatic executive and politician, and arguing that his fiscally conservative and socially liberal views could appeal to independent voters.The Times story, which noted Bloomberg’s willingness to spend over $1 billion on a run, suggested a seriousness beyond the usual anonymous Bloomberg adviser bending a reporter's ear. The former mayor appears to be taking more formal steps than in the past, which could force his media company to more actively cover his presidential ambitions this time around.It’s always tricky for a news organization to report on itself. If the coverage is positive, it can be seen as self-congratulatory cheerleading; if the coverage is negative, skeptics will say it's just a superficial attempt to assert independence. Matt Winkler, then editor-in-chief of Bloomberg News, said in 2014 that covering one’s own company represents “an inherent conflict of interest and no outlet does it well.”At Bloomberg-the-company, restrictions on coverage of Bloomberg-the-man are a matter of policy, and the company has been scooped in the past on its own news. Most employees first learned Bloomberg was returning as CEO from a story in the Times. According to ""The Bloomberg Way,"" the company’s in-house style guide, Bloomberg News “doesn’t cover Michael Bloomberg’s wealth or personal life” and “doesn’t originate stories about the company.”The style guide states that Bloomberg should be included in a story “in cases where omitting the company from a broader story would be misleading or make the story incomplete,” and notes that a company spokesman should be reached for comment. Also, it says, “when others report about Bloomberg, we should summarize what their stories say, and the company should be given an opportunity to comment."" Bloomberg News has had to navigate covering its owner in the past, given that he’s a public figure and has been outspoken on issues like gun control. While Bloomberg was mayor, the news organization typically covered what he publicly said or did in that role, but steered away from analysis. But Halperin and Heilemann -- the latter of whom, for New York magazine, wrote in 2007 on an earlier Bloomberg boomlet -- will be expected to report on the behind-the-scenes details of the presidential race, and to analyze the various contenders' chances. On Monday, MSNBC host Joe Scarborough asked Halperin what he’s been hearing about Bloomberg “outside of your position at Bloomberg.”“As people know, I work for Michael Bloomberg,"" Halperin said. ""But as [BuzzFeed editor Ben Smith] said, it’s true of me: I’ve reported on his thinking about running for president for a long time. So what I think about this is independent of the fact that he owns the company for which I work.”Halperin acknowledged the difficulty of third-party presidential runs, something of which he said Bloomberg himself is similarly aware.“He knows, as well as every analyst does, it’s easy to romanticize the prospect of a third-party bid,” Halperin said. ""It’s very difficult to get 270 electoral votes."""

He set up a desk in the newsroom and installed a new top editor, and helped shift the company's focus away from consumer-facing sites and back toward the kind of bread-and-butter topics, like global business and finance, desired by subscribers.A White House run -- or perhaps even the time needed to consider one -- would again pull Bloomberg out of the newsroom, which is now grappling with how to cover his latest presidential flirtation.""John Micklethwait is our Editor-in-Chief and is in charge of decisions about coverage,"" Bloomberg News spokesman Ty Trippet said in a statement to The Huffington Post. Bloomberg News has long placed limits on how reporters cover both the company and its famous owner, including his personal life and wealth. Its coverage of the former mayor this past weekend was noticeably scant. As major news outlets pounced after The New York Times reported Saturday that Bloomberg's advisers had drawn up plans for a potential independent run, Bloomberg Politics' contribution was only a brief summary of that story. The company licenses Times content and provided the paper’s full story to subscribers of its Bloomberg Terminal service, but didn't independently report new details. Meanwhile, Politico, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and other publications confirmed Bloomberg’s interest Saturday through their own sources, and candidates fielded questions about the hypothetical three-way race on the Sunday shows. On NBC’s “Meet the Press,” former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said her understanding was that Bloomberg would only run if Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) became the Democratic nominee instead of Clinton herself -- a scenario she said she doesn't expect to happen.Sanders, for his part, told ABC's ""This Week"" that he'd welcome the chance to run against two billionaires -- namely, Bloomberg and current Republican front-runner Donald Trump -- because Americans don't want to live in an ""oligarchy.""The notion of Bloomberg running for president has surfaced again and again over the past decade, with the former mayor's advisers extolling his strengths as a successful, pragmatic executive and politician, and arguing that his fiscally conservative and socially liberal views could appeal to independent voters.The Times story, which noted Bloomberg’s willingness to spend over $1 billion on a run, suggested a seriousness beyond the usual anonymous Bloomberg adviser bending a reporter's ear. The former mayor appears to be taking more formal steps than in the past, which could force his media company to more actively cover his presidential ambitions this time around.It’s always tricky for a news organization to report on itself. If the coverage is positive, it can be seen as self-congratulatory cheerleading; if the coverage is negative, skeptics will say it's just a superficial attempt to assert independence. Matt Winkler, then editor-in-chief of Bloomberg News, said in 2014 that covering one’s own company represents “an inherent conflict of interest and no outlet does it well.”At Bloomberg-the-company, restrictions on coverage of Bloomberg-the-man are a matter of policy, and the company has been scooped in the past on its own news. Most employees first learned Bloomberg was returning as CEO from a story in the Times. According to ""The Bloomberg Way,"" the company’s in-house style guide, Bloomberg News “doesn’t cover Michael Bloomberg’s wealth or personal life” and “doesn’t originate stories about the company.”The style guide states that Bloomberg should be included in a story “in cases where omitting the company from a broader story would be misleading or make the story incomplete,” and notes that a company spokesman should be reached for comment. Also, it says, “when others report about Bloomberg, we should summarize what their stories say, and the company should be given an opportunity to comment."" Bloomberg News has had to navigate covering its owner in the past, given that he’s a public figure and has been outspoken on issues like gun control. While Bloomberg was mayor, the news organization typically covered what he publicly said or did in that role, but steered away from analysis. But Halperin and Heilemann -- the latter of whom, for New York magazine, wrote in 2007 on an earlier Bloomberg boomlet -- will be expected to report on the behind-the-scenes details of the presidential race, and to analyze the various contenders' chances. On Monday, MSNBC host Joe Scarborough asked Halperin what he’s been hearing about Bloomberg “outside of your position at Bloomberg.”“As people know, I work for Michael Bloomberg,"" Halperin said. ""But as [BuzzFeed editor Ben Smith] said, it’s true of me: I’ve reported on his thinking about running for president for a long time. So what I think about this is independent of the fact that he owns the company for which I work.”Halperin acknowledged the difficulty of third-party presidential runs, something of which he said Bloomberg himself is similarly aware.“He knows, as well as every analyst does, it’s easy to romanticize the prospect of a third-party bid,” Halperin said. ""It’s very difficult to get 270 electoral votes."""
9,POLITICS,Black Americans Are Half As Likely As Whites To Be Very Confident Their Water Is Safe,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rick-snyder-flint-water-crisis-poll_us_56a627d1e4b0404eb8f22268,"Race is ""the single greatest determinant of what happened in Flint,"" one lawmaker said.",2016-01-25,"Flint resident Louis Singleton receives water filters, bottled water and a test kit from Michigan National Guard Specialist Joe Weaver on Jan. 21.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_74_99_4044_2639%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Americans nationwide are following the water crisis in Flint, Michigan. But few are really worried about their own water, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey shows -- although there is a significant racial gap in that concern.Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) is also winning very few plaudits nationwide for his handling of the water crisis. Among Americans who've been following the story, just 15 percent approve of the job that he's done, while 58 percent disapprove. Many think it's time for Snyder to resign, a step that Sen. Bernie Sanders and others have called for. Forty percent of those following the story agree that the governor should go; only 24 percent disagree.Not enough data exist yet to say whether that sentiment is widely shared by Michigan residents, who rated Snyder highly as recently as last summer.""He's probably glad he's not running for re-election,"" Bernie Porn, a Michigan-based pollster, told WLNS-TV. ""All of the things that he feels he deserved credit for, people may forget all about that based on this one issue and based on how they react to it.""Regardless of its effect on Snyder's legacy, Flint's experience with toxic water appears to have boosted support nationwide for more water regulation. A 56 percent majority of Americans think government should do more to regulate the safety of the public water supply, up 9 points since the aftermath of the Toledo water crisis in 2014.But nearly three-quarters of the populace still say they're somewhat or very confident that their own tap water is safe to drink -- a number little changed since the previous survey. Just 9 percent say they're not at all confident in their local water supply.There's a major racial difference in the results: Black Americans are about half as likely as white Americans to say they're very confident in their local water and far more likely to think further regulation is needed. The crisis in Flint, whose population is largely black, struck many as a fresh example of environmental racism, which leaves African-Americans disproportionately relegated to neighborhoods affected by pollution. Race is ""the single greatest determinant of what happened in Flint,"" Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.), who represents the area, told The New York Times.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Jan. 21-22 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

10,SCIENCE,Why It's Impossible To Focus When You Haven't Slept,Carolyn Gregoire,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sleep-attention-focus_us_569e58d1e4b0cd99679b571c,"Sleep and attention regulate each other ""like yin and yang.""",2016-01-25,A new study finds that sleep and attention balance one another. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56a623741a00002d00ab13c8.jpeg?cache=LDCfbqzcaG&ops=crop_0_309_3144_2269%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"We all know how difficult it is to pay attention at work -- or to get anything done, for that matter -- after a night of bad sleep. It should come as little surprise, then, that sleep and attention are critically linked. Now, a new study from neuroscientists at the Queensland Brain Institute in Australia reveals why the ability to pay attention during the day relies on our capacity to do the opposite at night. The researchers explain that sleep and attention are ""like yin and yang"" -- opposing forces that work together to create harmony -- and the two systems may have even co-evolved to regulate each other. ""The yin and yang in Chinese philosophy describe contrary forces that are in fact interdependent and give rise to each other, as with light and dark,"" Leonie Kirszenblat, a neuroscience researcher at the University of Queensland and the study's lead author, told The Huffington Post. ""Sleep and attention seem like opposite brain states, but they may actually arise from similar brain mechanisms that relate to ignoring the outside world.""Sleep and attention may balance each other, because the ability to pay attention depends on getting adequate sleep and the amount of sleep we need seems to be driven by learning and performing tasks that require attention.The researchers analyzed a variety of sleep studies conducted on animals, investigating the function of sleep in different types of species. The data revealed that in animals with simple nervous systems, such as nematodes, sleep is used for development or as a response to environmental stress. It turned out that in animals with complex nervous systems -- including insects, humans and other mammals -- sleep isn't only used for growing or responding to stress. Instead, the data showed that sleep is an everyday activity that's used to support cognitive functions, including selective attention. The data also suggested that tasks requiring more attention correlated with an increased need for sleep, and a great intensity of sleep. Sleep and attention tend to be viewed as fundamentally different states, but they seem to involve a common mechanism for suppressing external distractions.""Sleep and attention may be two sides of the same coin,"" Kirszenblat said. ""Both allow animals to selectively process some information, while ignoring most other sensory stimuli. More broadly, we tend to view sleep and wake as fundamentally different phenomena, but mechanistically they might be quite similar because both involve suppressing the outside world.""Dr. Bruno van Swinderen, a neuroscientist at the university, said in a statement that this is a ""revolutionary"" way of thinking about how the brain works during sleep and waking.The study was published in December in the journal Trends in Neurosciences.Also on The Huffington Post:"

""Bigots go home,"" state Sen. Jeffrey Kessler, the Democratic Senate Minority Leader, said in the video produced by LGBT rights group Fairness West Virginia. ""Be open and have a free marketplace for participation for all people based upon their skills and talents, not upon who they love during the day or who they go home to at night."" State senators and delegates from both political parties cited the Constitution, West Virginia's declining population and their desire for economic expansion as reasons for supporting a more inclusive society. There are still 28 states -- including West Virginia -- where it’s legal to fire someone for being gay; to discriminate against them when they seek housing; and to turn away their business in general. ""The United States Constitution guarantees to its citizens equal protection under the law,"" said state Sen. Charles Trump, the Republican chair of the state's Judiciary Committee. ""And government should not be in the business of discriminating against one class or group of people.""Supporters of LGBT rights are up against the Family Policy Council, an anti-gay lobbying group that is pushing the state legislature to pass the Religious Freedom of Conscience Act. Indiana's state legislature passed a similar controversial bill last year before doing an aboutface after businesses and activists threatened to boycott the state. ""For those who want to draw distinctions or limit opportunities for a particular class or a particular persuasion, you’re hurting West Virginia and you’re hurting our business climate here by doing that,"" said state Sen. Mitch Carmichael, the Republican Senate Majority Leader. The Family Policy Council says the law defends religious freedom, but lawmakers who oppose discrimination also mentioned their faith.""From a moral perspective, I am a born-again Christian and I feel like you should love everyone,"" said Del. Sean Hornbuckle (D). ""When love is in the air, it just makes sense to not to discriminate against anyone.""""Fairness West Virginia is excited to showcase that leaders and the next generation of leaders from both parties are unequivocally speaking out in favor of nondiscrimination for all West Virginians,"" Andrew Schneider, the organization's executive director, said in a press release. ""This video demonstrates that it is no longer politically advantageous for members of either party to support discrimination of any kind.""In the past, federal efforts to stop LGBT discrimination have excluded the community’s transgender members. Republican Saira Blair, West Virginia’s youngest delegate in history, specifically mentioned gender identity in the video.Also on HuffPost:"

The openly gay actor recently discussed the controversy with Sky News, calling the criticism ""legitimate,"" but also extending the conversation to the lack of recognition for other minority groups from Hollywood.""As a representative of the industry they're in, [the Academy is] receiving complaints which I fully sympathize with,"" McKellen explained. ""It's not only black people who've been disregarded by the film industry, it used to be women, it's certainly gay people to this day.""That being said, obviously women still have a ways to go when it comes to representation at the Oscars, with only one woman ever having won the award for Best Director.A-list couple Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith are currently at the forefront of the discussion surrounding the white-washing of the Oscars, claiming that they will boycott the ceremony. Pinkett Smith recently shared her decision in a video posted to Facebook, currently at over 11 million views.""These are all legitimate complaints and the Oscars are the focus of those complaints,"" McKellen continued.While more and more queer talent in front of and behind the camera continue to be recognized by Hollywood, the entertainment industry still has a long way to go when it comes to queer representation. In 2015 alone the lack of nominations for the indie transgender hit ""Tangerine"" and acclaimed lesbian drama ""Carol"" being snubbed for best picture have drawn outrage from the queer community.Also on HuffPost:"

But the joke, much like getting a catchy Christmas carol stuck in your head, lives on.Patrick Horton, 28, of Brooklyn, New York, and his roommates, Griff Jones and Justin Seeley, came up with the chilliest idea to build an igloo a few months ago.“Beers were definitely involved in that idea,” Horton told The Huffington Post. “But once we had it in our heads we knew that we were going to do it.” During last weekend’s Winter Storm Jonas, in which 27.9 inches of snow blanketed New York City, the guys finally got their chance. On Saturday, during peak snowfall, the roommates spent three hours piling snow in the corner of their yard. On Sunday, they spent an additional three hours hollowing out their igloo:Once the structure was complete, they added creature comforts like blankets, lights and pillows covered in plastic.They also added a potted plant to the front entrance, for a warm and welcoming touch:A little before 4 p.m. on Sunday, Horton decided to list the igloo on the rental site Airbnb as a hoax, using the descriptions of the igloo in the listing to poke fun at Brooklyn and hipster stereotypes.""Dripping with ingenuity and alt-lifestyle aura, lays this Snowpocalypse's most desirable getaway,"" the post read. ""Built completely by hand all natural.

According to Horton, five people inquired about the igloo before Airbnb deleted the listing around 7 p.m. on Sunday.""We are happy to see that you guys are staying busy and having fun during Blizpocalypse,"" a Airbnb rep named Dustin wrote to Horton in an email. ""Unfortunately, your igloo, while very well-constructed, has failed to meet our occupancy standards and has been removed from search results.""""Be sure to pick a place with running water, electricity and a roof that doesn't melt.""Though the igloo is no longer available for a cozy Tinder date of #Iglooandchilling, Horton claims his frozen abode won’t melt in vain.“We definitely plan to get some use out of it and enjoy it before the weather warms up,” he said. “We learned this weekend that people love igloos.”Also on HuffPost:"

It may not be intentional, but the player's rare greatness masks things that should not happen. For the Cleveland Cavaliers, LeBron happens to mask significant issues -- problems that worsen with time, especially in the fourth-oldest roster in the league. It's what led to the firing of head coach David Blatt, despite the fact that he brought the team to the finals last season and had a 30-11 record this season. In fact, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, Blatt is the first head coach since conferences began in 1970-71 to be fired when his team has the best record in its conference.The 31-year-old LeBron, who has reached a modern era record five consecutive NBA Finals, can only impose his will for so long without more problems coming to light. On the heels of defending world champion Golden State throttling the Cavs by 34 in their own building, let's look at why LeBron's window to bring a long-awaited title back to his home state is quickly disappearing:The K-Love ConundrumIt may have come as a surprise to some when 27-year-old Kevin Love re-signed in a long-term deal with Cleveland last summer, but it shouldn't have: Love couldn't command max dollar anywhere else, and there wasn't another suitor offering a legitimate second option.The issues with Love -- twice a Second-Team All-NBA selection -- in 2016 are the same issues from last year, only amplified. He has never quite figured out how to play second -- or even third -- fiddle to LeBron and All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving. Blatt, to his credit, tried to integrate Love into late-game situations, but the reality was simple: He was never a consistent weapon in his half-court attack throughout the course of a 48-minute game.One of the beauties of Love's game is his ability to stretch the floor with his 3-point shooting. And yet, in Cleveland, the former UCLA standout has become overly reliant on the 3, often drifting away from the hoop and primarily into the role of pick-and-pop man. He's still shooting upwards of six triples per game, as he did in Minnesota. The difference is that his shots are skewed greatly towards the perimeter. Now you're taking your best rebounder and best interior passer away from the basket, where he becomes a jump-shooting big and not a playmaker.This season, in addition to a miserable defensive rating, Love is shooting just 36 percent from distance and under 42 percent from the floor, the worst clip of his storied eight-year career. As a result, he's made the lowest number of free-throw attempts of his career, and has the lowest scoring output since 2010.Whether Love gets dealt before the deadline remains to be seen, though it seems highly unlikely because of the $110 million commitment. Now, newly minted coach Tyronn Lue has to figure out how to further integrate Love into the offense.Kyrie's WoesHe may have been selected to play in another All-Star game, but 23-year-old point guard Kyrie Irving has not played like an All-Star. After missing 26 games recovering from a broken kneecap, Irving has played the worst basketball of his career. He's never shot a worse percentage (41 percent), and he's never been so anemic from 3-point territory, where his sub-30 percent clip is shocking for a guy known as a knockdown shooter.""Personally, I don't feel like I deserve it,"" Irving said of not being chosen to start in the All-Star game, ""just from the amount of games that I've played and the body of work.""In many ways, Irving -- the No. 1 overall pick in 2011 out of Duke and an All-NBA performer -- is the Cavs most important player. His creativity is undeniable, as is his unique ability in the pick-and-roll game. Few players are as dynamic and gifted from an offensive standpoint than Irving, whose prowess allows LeBron to play far more off the ball and not expend energy as a permanent point-forward. Make no mistake: LeBron is the focal point of the offense, but he doesn't always have to assume the lion's share of the responsibility.When Irving struggles, LeBron is forced into a heavier usage role. It's something he considered in an interview with The Huffington Post before last season. The Cavs, as a result, rank just 10th in field goal percentage. To quantify that number, consider that San Antonio, Golden State and Oklahoma City -- widely viewed as the top tier of contenders -- make up the top three. Perhaps more important, this is hardly a knockdown shooting team -- an issue that is only exacerbated against elite competition. The Cavs are slotted 12th in the league from 3-point territory, an issue that's also made worse when dealing with double-digit deficits.Bench ProblemsPerhaps just as important, the Cavs have not been able to generate consistent production from their ancillary parts, specifically on the perimeter. Wing stalwarts J.R. Smith and Iman Shumpert have been too inefficient, shooting a combined 41 percent from the floor. In addition, Mo Williams and Matthew Dellavedova have struggled as well -- particularly with erratic shooting, a no-no with passers like Lebron and Irving consistently creating quality looks. And Lue says both Williams and Dellavedova will earn more minutes now that he's at the helm.Not to harp too much on the Spurs and the Warriors, but consider their superior depth in comparison to the Cavs. Both teams employe lineups that go 10 or 11 deep, enabling stars to rest during the regular season. But that's only the obvious benefit. Depth also allows a team to build trust and ""steal"" wins. It's why the Warriors' Andre Iguodala captured Finals MVP last June -- over the immortal Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and even Draymond Green. Sharing Is CaringEasy offense is the best offense, especially come playoff time. The Cavs, for all of LeBron's greatness, simply do not generate enough easy offense to win a championship. We can discuss defense all we want, but to win a prolonged series in the NBA against a great team requires an assortment of easy buckets. Cleveland ranks a pedestrian 12th in assists and just 14th in fast-break points per game.If you score at an elite clip in the half-court (like the Spurs, for example), a lack of transition offense can be overcome. If you don't (like the Cavs), the postseason becomes an arduous process. Lue has already implored his team to accelerate the pace of play, but learning how to run takes time.Blatt either never understood the benefit of an uptempo attack or was never able to delegate responsibility for it to someone else. With all due respect to Cleveland's other bugs, this might be Lue's greatest responsibility in his new role.Correction: A previous edition of this article stated that LeBron is the first player to ever reach five consecutive NBA Finals. It has since been corrected to reflect that he is the first player in the modern era to do so.Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com or ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram at @Schultz_Report.

Make no mistake: LeBron is the focal point of the offense, but he doesn't always have to assume the lion's share of the responsibility.When Irving struggles, LeBron is forced into a heavier usage role. It's something he considered in an interview with The Huffington Post before last season. The Cavs, as a result, rank just 10th in field goal percentage. To quantify that number, consider that San Antonio, Golden State and Oklahoma City -- widely viewed as the top tier of contenders -- make up the top three. Perhaps more important, this is hardly a knockdown shooting team -- an issue that is only exacerbated against elite competition. The Cavs are slotted 12th in the league from 3-point territory, an issue that's also made worse when dealing with double-digit deficits.Bench ProblemsPerhaps just as important, the Cavs have not been able to generate consistent production from their ancillary parts, specifically on the perimeter. Wing stalwarts J.R. Smith and Iman Shumpert have been too inefficient, shooting a combined 41 percent from the floor. In addition, Mo Williams and Matthew Dellavedova have struggled as well -- particularly with erratic shooting, a no-no with passers like Lebron and Irving consistently creating quality looks. And Lue says both Williams and Dellavedova will earn more minutes now that he's at the helm.Not to harp too much on the Spurs and the Warriors, but consider their superior depth in comparison to the Cavs. Both teams employe lineups that go 10 or 11 deep, enabling stars to rest during the regular season. But that's only the obvious benefit. Depth also allows a team to build trust and ""steal"" wins. It's why the Warriors' Andre Iguodala captured Finals MVP last June -- over the immortal Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and even Draymond Green. Sharing Is CaringEasy offense is the best offense, especially come playoff time. The Cavs, for all of LeBron's greatness, simply do not generate enough easy offense to win a championship. We can discuss defense all we want, but to win a prolonged series in the NBA against a great team requires an assortment of easy buckets. Cleveland ranks a pedestrian 12th in assists and just 14th in fast-break points per game.If you score at an elite clip in the half-court (like the Spurs, for example), a lack of transition offense can be overcome. If you don't (like the Cavs), the postseason becomes an arduous process. Lue has already implored his team to accelerate the pace of play, but learning how to run takes time.Blatt either never understood the benefit of an uptempo attack or was never able to delegate responsibility for it to someone else. With all due respect to Cleveland's other bugs, this might be Lue's greatest responsibility in his new role.Correction: A previous edition of this article stated that LeBron is the first player to ever reach five consecutive NBA Finals. It has since been corrected to reflect that he is the first player in the modern era to do so.Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com or ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram at @Schultz_Report.

17,COLLEGE,FSU Settles Lawsuit Over Jameis Winston Rape Allegations,Michael McLaughlin and Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fsu-settles-lawsuit-jameis-winston-rape-allegations_us_56a65b44e4b076aadcc74fd9,The school allegedly covered up a rape to protect the prized football program.,2016-01-25,"Florida State University (FSU) quarterback Jameis Winston comments about his half-game suspension during a news conference in Tallahassee, Florida September 17, 2014.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586173f21500002300915f07.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Florida State University president John Thrasher announced Monday the school will pay $950,000 to settle a former student's lawsuit alleging that FSU was ""deliberately indifferent"" to her claim that star quarterback Jameis Winston raped her.Erica Kinsman said in her federal lawsuit that FSU didn't take her case seriously when she identified Winston as her alleged attacker after she was sexually assaulted in December 2012. Her lawyers have said the school violated the law to protect its prized football program. The payment is the largest settlement, according to USA Today, in a Title IX case, a federal law which prohibits gender discrimination in education.“With all the economic demands we face, at some point it doesn’t make sense to continue even though we are convinced we would have prevailed,” Thrasher said in a statement.An admission of wrongdoing, however, was not included in the settlement and Thrasher insisted that FSU would have prevailed if the case had gone to trial:Although we regret we will never be able to tell our full story in court, it is apparent that a trial many months from now would have left FSU fighting over the past rather than looking toward its very bright future. We have decided to instead move forward even though we have full faith that the ultimate outcome of a trial would have been consistent with the previous law enforcement investigations and retired Supreme Court Justice Major Harding’s findings in the student conduct hearing.Even after the rape allegations became public knowledge, almost a year after Kinsman went to police, Winston continued to play for FSU, which was having a historic season. He went on to win the Heisman Trophy as the best college football player in 2013 and he led the Florida State Seminoles to the national title. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers selected Winston with the first pick in the NFL draft last year.As Winston starred on the field, Kinsman suffered harassment around campus. She ultimately withdrew from FSU.While Thrasher's statement claimed $700,000 of the settlement is going to Kinsman's attorneys, that is not accurate. Though a copy of the settlement, reviewed by The Huffington Post, states that number, immediately after it says that does not necessarily reflect the actual divvying up of the settlement amount. It goes on to say that the actual division of the settlement will be exclusively decided by Kinsman and her attorneys.Kinsman's lawyer, John Clune, declined to say exactly how much will go to the attorneys, citing attorney-client privilege. However, Clune told HuffPost that Thrasher's ""impression of the attorney fees is massively overstated,"" and the university administration knows it. An FSU spokeswoman said: ""This is a non-issue."" According to Thrasher's statement, FSU has committed to a five-year program to create awareness around and prevent sexual assault.“I will always be disappointed that I had to leave the school I dreamed of attending since I was little,” Kinsman said in a statement. “I am happy that FSU has committed to continue making changes in order to ensure a safer environment for all students.”Officials with FSU and local law enforcement have claimed they took then-freshman Kinsman's complaint seriously, but egregious flaws in the investigations were uncovered by The New York Times. Tallahassee police launched an investigation on Dec. 7, 2012, after Kinsman reported that she had been sexually assaulted when she was intoxicated and taken from a bar to an off-campus apartment by a man unknown to her. On Jan. 10, 2013, she told police Winston was the rapist after recognizing him in a class. A DNA sample Winston provided to authorities matched semen that the police collected from Kinsman's underwear.The Times investigation, however, found that the detective handling the case didn't write a report for two months. Police also lost valuable evidence, including a video recorded by a witness showing some of the alleged assault. Officials with FSU's athletic department learned in January 2013 that Winston was named as a suspect, but concluded it was a consensual encounter after speaking to two other players who were present. It was only in January 2014, after the Seminoles' championship season, that the university attempted to question Winston. The state's attorney declined to file charges against Winston in December 2013 and a student misconduct hearing -- during which he declined to answer questions -- said that he and Kinsman consented to sex, and cleared him of any wrongdoing.The federal Department of Education will continue a separate investigation it opened in 2014 into whether the university properly handled the Winston case and whether alleged misconduct created a sexually hostile environment. Kinsman sued Winston last April and he responded with a countersuit. That remains a pending case in Florida. This story has been updated with new information about the settlement amount going to the attorneys, after Kinsman's lawyer refuted the figure provided by FSU. "

""My favorite part of the gig, aside from the flexible hours and snacks, was the opportunity to teach these kids things that they may never learn in their fancy UES [Upper East Side] private school.
