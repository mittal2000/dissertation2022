Jerry Brown (D) is facing pressure from environmental activists to take a stand against hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking, in the Golden State.Brown, who is one of the nation's leading environmental advocates, has faced criticism for years for not opposing fracking, the controversial practice of pumping pressurized water, sand and chemicals into rock to extract oil and natural gas. While the state has adopted the nation's toughest regulations governing fracking, Brown has said a statewide ban on the practice ""doesn't make a lot of sense.""""If we reduce our oil drilling on California by a few percent, which a ban on fracking would do, we’ll import more oil by train or by boat, that doesn't make a lot of sense,"" Brown said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" in March. What we need to do is to move to electric cars, more efficient buildings and more renewable energy and in that respect, California is leading the country and some would say even the world and we're going to continue moving down that path.""Anti-fracking activists have continued to press the governor on the issue, voicing concern over the amount of water the practice uses in drought-stricken California. Advocates are also worried about the potential harm fracking could pose to drinking water and wildlife, as well as the risk of fracking-induced earthquakes.With Brown set to lead a delegation to the upcoming climate talks, a new ad campaign airing throughout California is hoping to change the governor's mind on fracking. The ads, backed by Movement Generation and The Other 98%, feature community activists, artists and comedians calling on the governor to impose a statewide ban on the practice.Actor and activist Mark Ruffalo is also upping the pressure on the governor, unveiling a new documentary called ""Dear Governor Brown."" The 20-minute film was directed by Jon Bowermaster, a writer and filmmaker who made a similar documentary geared at New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) in 2012. (Cuomo went on to ban the oil extraction method in 2014, citing concerns about potential health risks.)""Our industry generates billions of dollars in revenue for the state of California and for too long Governor Brown has put the fossil fuel industry above all others,"" Ruffalo told The Hollywood Reporter. ""We are standing up to tell Governor Brown that fossil fuels are bad for the state of California and if we want to grow a vibrant economy, we need to keep oil in the ground. Building out all the solar in the world means nothing if California keeps extracting and dumping fossil fuels into the atmosphere.""And in Sacramento, protesters representing Faith Against Fracking gathered last week to urge Brown to reconsider his position. ""We have a governor about to step on the world stage and say he's taking action,"" said group leader David Braun, according to the Los Angeles Times. ""We're calling on him to demonstrate his commitment to climate.""“California is a global leader in the promotion of alternative energy and the reduction of greenhouse gases,"" the Brown administration said in a statement sent to HuffPost via the state Department of Conservation. ""Someday, we won’t be dependent on fossil fuels. Until we get there, shutting down significant oil production in a state with millions of drivers would require us to import more. The Governor signed legislation creating the most comprehensive environmental analysis of hydraulic fracturing to date, and California has the most stringent rules in the nation for the use of hydraulic fracturing, ensuring environmental and public health and safety.”A poll conducted by the Public Policy Institute of California in July found 56 percent of Californians oppose the increased use of fracking.Also on HuffPost:"

2,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Is Pulling Away From Bernie Sanders With Union Endorsements,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-union-endorsements_us_564677a2e4b045bf3def3588,"Despite Sanders' decades as a champion of labor, the big unions are gradually lining up behind the front-runner.",2015-11-15,"Despite Bernie Sanders' strong history of support for unions, Hillary Clinton has been winning the race for 2016 endorsements from labor groups.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- When it came time to think seriously about endorsing a presidential candidate for 2016, Paul Feeney says it wasn't a hard decision for members of his union.Feeney is a shop steward for a local union of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in Massachusetts. His fellow members haven't forgotten the time they were in an ugly contract battle with Verizon back in 2003. One day, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) showed up and joined the workers on their picket line. He delivered one of the trademark fiery speeches that, more than a decade later, the rest of the country would come to recognize.""They remember when Sanders stood up on the back of a pickup truck and addressed our members,"" Feeney said. ""The person who went to bat for them the most was Bernie Sanders. And that means something to people."" The endorsement from Feeney's local union council says a lot about organized labor in the Democratic presidential primary. Three months out from the Iowa caucus, some of the biggest unions have already lined up behind front-runner Hillary Clinton, believing the former secretary of state has the best chance of defeating whoever Republicans end up nominating. And yet there's a deep, abiding passion for Sanders among much of the liberal rank and file, no doubt because he's been a relentless proponent of collective bargaining throughout his 25 years in Congress. The zealous support for Sanders says as much about Clinton as it does about the self-described democratic socialist.""His politics are much more clearly aligned with the labor movement than Clinton's politics are,"" said Larry Hanley, president of the 180,000-member Amalgamated Transit Union, which hasn't yet endorsed a candidate. Sanders recently sent a letter of support to ATU members in Grand Rapids, Michigan, as they try to fend off pension cuts proposed by the city's bus system, the Rapid. It's much harder to envision Clinton wading into a contract battle with a local transit system.Progressive as her 2016 platform may be, Clinton doesn't exactly have a long history of pumping her fist on the picket line with her union brothers and sisters. Her squishiness on fast-track authority for the Trans-Pacific Partnership bothered many union officials, though she has since come out against the president's trade deal. And while service-sector unions are rallying around a national fight for a $15 minimum wage, Clinton has voiced her support for the movement but not the number. She is instead advocating for a more moderate proposal of $12. Nonetheless, the unions that have so far declared their backing for Clinton represent a majority of the unionized workers in this country. They include the two primary teachers unions -- the American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association, which together boast 4.6 million members -- as well as the 1.6 million-member American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. In addition to those public-sector unions, Clinton has nabbed the endorsements of the carpenters' union and the machinists' union, among others. Sanders, meanwhile, has locked down only two endorsements from major unions so far -- National Nurses United, which represents 185,000 workers, and the American Postal Workers Union, which has 200,000 members and endorsed Sanders earlier this week. APWU's president said Sanders ""stands above all others as a true champion of postal workers and other workers throughout the country."" Meanwhile, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who's polling behind both Clinton and Sanders, hasn't nabbed any national union endorsements, despite his close attention to labor issues on the stump.Union endorsements are a big deal for Democratic candidates. Union membership in the U.S. has dipped pretty much to a historic low, yet labor unions remain a political force and a pillar of the Democratic Party. Even if they aren't as powerful as they once were, U.S. unions have almost 15 million members, plenty of money and influence, and an electoral ground game to be reckoned with. The most powerful support comes from the AFL-CIO, a federation of 56 unions, though it typically waits until a clear Democratic nominee has emerged before making its endorsement.One of the largest unions in the country, the 2 million-member Service Employees International Union, could announce its endorsement as early as this week. If the union backs Clinton, as many labor insiders expect it will, her campaign could credibly say she is organized labor's consensus candidate. Such an endorsement would sting for Sanders. He has been arguably the most prominent backer in Washington of the Fight for $15, which has been agitating for a higher minimum wage through fast-food worker strikes. The Fight for $15 is an SEIU campaign.Unions have plenty at stake in the 2016 elections. They need a functioning and union-friendly National Labor Relations Board, which only a Democrat in the White House can guarantee. The GOP-led Congress has sought to roll back labor-friendly reforms by the NLRB as well the Labor Department, which would be much easier to do under a Republican president. And unions continue to fend off state-level attacks on collective bargaining, with more states than ever now being right-to-work.The more unions rally around a single candidate, the stronger that candidate will be heading into a general election, the thinking goes. The need for unions to have a Democrat in the White House, whoever it may be, is a boon to Clinton as the front-runner.Larry Cohen, former president of the Communications Workers of America union, joined the Sanders campaign as a full-time volunteer in large part because of Clinton's stance on fast-track. He speaks as a surrogate for Sanders on labor issues and helped launch Labor for Bernie, a coalition of rank-and-file supporters. Its activists have tried to slow the union endorsements for Clinton to maintain the Sanders campaign's viability. Cohen said that regardless of how unions endorse, he hopes union leadership will give members the freedom to campaign for whoever they want. ""Bernie stands much more aligned with the values of unions, and I'm hoping there will continue to be tolerance of different views,"" Cohen said. ""I think the key is that unions encourage members to be active, with candidates who stand for the values of working people, regardless of any endorsement they make. Primaries are about arguing where does this party stand. I don't think the key is endorsements -- it's individual people.""The endorsements for Clinton from AFT and the machinists' union led to a backlash by some union members who called the process undemocratic. Some local unions loyal to Sanders have been trying to pressure their national leadership to hold off on any early endorsements of Clinton so as not to hurt Sanders' candidacy. That includes an SEIU local in Oregon, which, as Politico reported Friday, sent a letter to its national urging it to delay an endorsement of Clinton. The letter's authors said it would be ""a tragic mistake"" to throw the union's weight behind Clinton right now.""We do worry about the message it will send if SEIU backs the establishment candidate over a staunch labor ally in this primary,"" the letter read. ""It will tell our true friends that SEIU won't have their backs when they stand up for us.""Feeney's national union, IBEW, has not endorsed anyone yet. Feeney said the national leadership so far has ""done everything right,"" allowing members to debate the issue and make their own local endorsements if they choose. He's hoping he and other Sanders supporters can persuade other members that he's the right candidate, perhaps racking up more endorsements from locals. But Feeney said swaying an endorsement on the union's national level could be tough. ""In order to move leadership, that takes a bit of an insurgency,"" Feeney said. ""You have to win the hearts and minds of other union members. But that's what unions are based on.""Also on HuffPost:"

6,POLITICS,Bernie Sanders Pins The Rise Of ISIS On 'Disastrous' Invasion Of Iraq,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-isis-iraq_us_5647eccfe4b08cda348926c2,"""These invasions have unintended consequences.""",2015-11-15,"Bernie Sanders makes a point during a Democratic presidential primary debate, Saturday, Nov. 14, 2015, in Des Moines, Iowa.

Bernie Sanders (I) who opened a discussion of the past -- perhaps one familiar to Clinton on stages like this one: the Iraq War, and its role in allowing ISIS and other terrorists to take root in the region. Sanders cut to the chase rather aggressively. ""Let me have one area of disagreement with the secretary,"" asked Sanders. ""I think she said something like the bulk of the responsibility [for ISIS] is not ours. Well, in fact, I would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq, something that I strongly opposed, has unraveled the region completely and led to the rise of al Qaeda and to ISIS.""""Now, in fact, what we have got to do -- and I think there is widespread agreement here -- is the United States cannot do it alone,"" he continued. ""What we need to do is lead an international coalition which includes very significantly the Muslim nations in that region who are going to have to fight and defend their way of life.""It was an interesting proposition: to solve the original sin of the Iraq War, the United States was going to have to undertake a coalition-led intervention in the same region.Dickerson was quick to reopen the old wound: ""When you say the disastrous vote on Iraq, let's just be clear about what you're saying. You're saying Secretary Clinton, who was then Sen. Clinton, voted for the Iraq War. Are you making a direct link between her vote for that war and what's happening now for ISIS?""Sanders replied: ""I don't think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now. I think that was one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the modern history of the United States.""Clinton was primed to respond: ""I have said the invasion of Iraq was a mistake. But I think if we're ever going to really tackle the problems posed by jihadi extremist terrorism, we need to understand it and realize that it has antecedents to what happened in Iraq and we have to continue to be vigilant about it.""Sanders parried, interjecting what he considered to be the lesson that needed to be learned. ""If you look at history, John,"" Sanders said, ""you will find that regime change, whether it was in the early '50s in Iran, whether it was toppling Salvador Allende in Chile, whether it was overthrowing the government of Guatemala way back when, these invasions, these toppling of governments, regime changes have unintended consequences.""""I would say that on this issue, I'm a little bit more conservative than the secretary,"" Sanders said, ""and I am not a great fan of regime change.""Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley was also involved in the exchange. ""It was not just the invasion of Iraq which Secretary Clinton voted for and has since said was a big mistake -- and, indeed, it was,"" he said. ""But it was also the cascading effects that followed that. It was also the disbanding of many elements of the Iraqi army that are now showing up as part of ISIS.""""It's not just about getting rid of a single dictator,"" said O'Malley, ""it is about understanding the secondary and third consequences that fall next.""See the latest updates on the debate here.Related:Also on HuffPost:"

""Friends from the whole world, thank you for #prayforparis, but we don't need more religion,"" Sfar, 44, wrote in an illustration shared on Instagram on Friday. ""Our faith goes to music! Kisses! Life! Champagne and Joy! #Parissaboutlife.""In January, the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris were stormed by gunmen. Before Friday, the horrific incident had been the deadliest terrorist attack in France in two decades.Social media has also been flooded over the weekend with many other images, created by both professional and amateur artists, that pay tribute to the lives lost in Paris and call for unity in the face of tragedy.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he welcomed the renewed sense of urgency to find a solution to the war in Syria after the Paris attacks, adding the world had a ""rare moment"" of diplomatic opportunity to end the violence.Obama wants to coax other European and Middle Eastern countries into more tangible steps to show their military commitment and was due to hold a bilateral meeting with Saudi Arabia's King Salman. Last month, the two leaders affirmed the need to cooperate against Islamic State.Obama said he also discussed in a meeting with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan coordinating efforts to fortify the border with Syria, which Islamic State has used to smuggle supplies and foreign fighters.MIGRATION CONCERNSThe coordinated attacks by gunmen and suicide bombers in Paris on Friday put Obama and other leaders of the world's major economies under increased pressure to find common cause.It remains to be seen, however, whether Washington itself has an appetite for much deeper involvement after already stepping up air strikes and committing small numbers of special operations troops to northern Syria to advise opposition forces in the fight against Islamic State.The Paris carnage, in which 129 people were killed in attacks on a concert hall, restaurants, bars and a sports stadium, also poses a major challenge for Europe, with populist leaders rushing to demand an end to an influx of refugees and migrants from the Middle East and Africa.In a diplomatic coup for Europe and for Turkey, the G20 leaders will agree that migration is a global problem that must be addressed in a coordinated way, according to a draft communique seen by Reuters, although it has yet to be accepted by all and is due to be published on Monday.Europe and Turkey, the most-heavily hit by the crisis, had been pushing for the G20 to recognize the issue as a global problem and help to deal with it financially, despite opposition from China, India and Russia. A million migrants from the Middle East and Africa are expected to come to Europe this year alone.According to a separate statement due to be released later on Sunday, a draft of which was seen by Reuters, they also agreed to step up border controls and aviation security in the wake of the Paris attacks, which they condemned as ""heinous.""

11,FIFTY,Why I Decided To Hike The Appalachian Trail At Age 55,"Michelle Martin, ContributorWriter, blogger, educator (& mom)",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hiking-the-appalachian-trail_b_8494982.html,"Like many women who watched the movie 'Wild,' I was inspired by Cheryl Strayed's courage and how she was able to turn her grief and desperation into triumph. And I wondered if I could do something similar.",2015-11-15,2015-11-06-1446849126-5082130-WildInspiredTent.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-11-06-1446849126-5082130-WildInspiredTent-thumb.jpg,"Like many women who watched the movie Wild, I was inspired by Cheryl Strayed's courage and how she was able to turn her grief and desperation into triumph. And I wondered if I could do something similar -- turn my own form of grief and desperation into triumph by spending several months hiking a treacherous trail from border to border (or a particular portion, thereof), with very little experience, camping in tents or lean-to's along the way, eating dehydrated food while fending off an array of wild creatures. My answer? Heck no!And then I went out and bought a tent. Turns out it wasn't the right kind of tent for such a long hike (it was a giant six-person tent that you can stand up in), but I still bought it. And it sits proudly on my kitchen table in its original packaging.But still, I wondered...I am the type of woman who likes a challenge. I challenge myself all the time in the intellectual realm, the career realm, the emotional realm, the interpersonal realm, and in just about any other realm, for that matter, except the physical realm. I have never been athletic, mostly I imagine because I hate physical exertion. There. I said it. In the era of ""biking-hiking-camping-marathon-running"" I, Michelle Martin, am what you might call ""indoorsy."" I don't like to be hot. I don't like to sweat. I don't like pain. I have no tolerance for bugs. And wide-open spaces scare me.But perhaps I'm being too hard on myself and presenting myself in a way that isn't completely accurate. I have done some outdoorsy things -- I stayed in a cabin with a bat as a roommate for eight days and seven nights (while wearing a towel over my head and screaming). I fished for years because my son loves the outdoors. And once I climbed to the top of a volcano in Rwanda to see mountain gorillas (think Jumanji). Mostly though, I'm not a fan of nature, as the following text exchanges with my son reflect:  Over the years I've attempted a range of different physical activities, all to no avail. In the '80s, I was the only person in my Jazzercise class who couldn't swing her hips to the music. In the '90s, I was the only person in my step aerobics class who actually fell off the step (more than once, in fact). I had a tepid relationship with the elliptical for almost three years in the mid-2000s. And although I didn't mind it, when I quit during a busy writing season, I felt no compulsion to jump back on. And then there was last year's love affair with yoga. I still love yoga, I really do. I have no explanation for why I quit. Perhaps it was the exorbitant cost, I'm not really certain. But quit, I did.Which leads me to my ultimate point: I am the last person in the world who should be contemplating hiking any formidable trail that involves so much athletic ability, physical exertion, living off the land and sleeping in a tent, even for a single day. I couldn't even manage a few nights in an Airbnb last month when I was traveling on a budget. I stayed one night and when I was told there was an aggressive squirrel that kept getting into the room where I'd be sleeping, I packed up my things and moved right on into the Hilton. I am destined to fail. I have no qualifying traits. I'm not in the greatest shape, I hate to work out, I don't like the outdoors, I get blisters just walking to my car, and I have a ""can't do"" attitude. But still, I wonder...Can I? Can I enter a world I know nothing about, where I always seem to feel like an interloper? Can I challenge myself to get into shape, in the long-distance hiking sort of way? Can I endure discomfort of the physical kind? I began blogging about my life as a middle-aged, empty-nesting, single mom a few years ago. When I turned 50, my son left (me) for college, and I began to ask myself ""what's next?"" and I found I had no answer to that question. Through writing and hearing from post-50 women across the country, I've come to the conclusion that perhaps, growing older doesn't have to be all about loss. If we play our life-cards right, the decades after our 50th birthday can be a transformative time, filled with more passion, more creativity, more honesty, and bigger dreams. And then a few weeks ago, my dear friend Dr. Shirley Albertson Owens, who is 71-years young, posted a status on Facebook about Emma Rowena Gatewood, the first woman to hike the entire 2,168 miles of the Appalachian Train, at the age of 67. Shirley posted an article about Gatewood's adventures with the challenge: ""Who wants to do this with me?"" I have no idea what possessed me, but I responded immediately: ""Me! I know I seem like the most unlikely candidate, but just think of the fun and adventures we'd have!"" And just like that, a grand idea was born.   Initially we pondered hiking the Pacific Crest Trail, but then we thought better of it -- two always hot, post-menopausal women hiking in the desert is probably not particularly safe for the wildlife. So the Appalachian Trail it is. Our first challenge is to prepare physically and our second challenge is to somehow figure out a way to make dehydrated wine for our end-of-the-day-we-made-it toast. Oh, and we also have to figure out a way to stay alive.In a recent blog post I wrote about how women in middle adulthood could make transformative changes in their life by taking just one step into the unknown -- doing one thing differently today than yesterday. And then sit back and watch what happens. So perhaps this is my one step, not the hike itself (yet), but saying yes.So today I'm going to start preparing to hike the Appalachian Trail, not because I believe I can actually do it, but because my friend Shirley believes that I can. We're jumping on a trendy bandwagon of sorts, and we likely will not hike the entire trail (far from it), and we're bound to run into some naysayers -- those folks who believe we are foolish for even trying. But this is our one step to show the world and ourselves that even though we're over 50, our lives can be filled with new opportunities and grand adventures. Whether we make it one mile, or 1,000, it doesn't matter, because at least we're daring to dream.Follow our progress by liking our Facebook page: Shirley and Michelle's 2016 AT Hiking AdventureLearn about Michelle Martin's writing and other work on her website, Aging Naked™Earlier on Huff/Post50:"
