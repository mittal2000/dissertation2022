He was sentenced to life in prison.Lawyers for the plaintiffs argued that Cinemark and its co-defendants, the theater's property owners, should be held liable for various security lapses which they said had contributed to the tragedy at the Century 16 Theater multiplex in Aurora, Colorado.Plaintiffs' lawyer Mark Bern said in an email to Reuters that he was ""deeply disappointed"" in the verdict and expected to appeal the case.""They failed to have armed security guards on the night of a blockbuster movie premiere when they always have armed security on Friday, Saturday and Sunday,"" Bern said.""They failed to have CCTV on the perimeter of the building, they failed to have roving guards around the building, they failed to have silent door alarms on the auditorium exit doors,"" he added.Attorneys for Texas-based Cinemark told jurors liability for the carnage rested mainly with Holmes, not the theater owners.Owners and managers of the theater could never have foreseen, nor safeguarded against, such a seemingly random but meticulously planned and violent attack, Cinemark's lawyers had said in closing arguments on Wednesday.""Mr. Holmes was completely unpredictable, unforeseeable, unpreventable and unstoppable,""Cinemark lawyer Kevin Taylor told reporters after the verdict.Another lawsuit against Cinemark related to the shooting is pending in federal court. Victims and survivors have also sued the University of Colorado, including university psychiatrists who evaluated or treated Holmes.At the movie screening, Holmes opened fire with a semiautomatic rifle, shotgun and pistol, after he had rigged his apartment with bombs. His lawyers showed video of him naked and running head-long into a jail cell wall during his criminal trial, saying he suffered from schizophrenia and was not in control of his actions.(Reporting by Keith Coffman; Writing by Sharon Bernstein; Editing by Tom Brown)"
3,BUSINESS,Monsanto Is On A Major Losing Streak,Alexander C.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/573dec061a00008800c2906d.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Monsanto's list of problems is growing like a weed.Now, the world's largest seed company seems vulnerable to a $42 billion takeover bid by its German rival Bayer, maker of the eponymous Aspirin brand. And that's just the latest sign of trouble for Monsanto. ""It's a relentless string of bad news,"" Jonas Oxgaard, an analyst at the research firm Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., told Bloomberg News' Jen Skerritt this week. ""It's almost like they forgot to sacrifice a goat to the gods."" Here are all the things that have gone wrong at Monsanto this year:In January, the company laid off a total of 3,600 employees, or about 16 percent of its workforce.In a statement, Monsanto confirmed on Wednesday that its board of directors planned to review Bayer's offer, the same day Chief Operating Officer Brett Begemann denied talk of a deal as ""wild speculation.""""There is no assurance that any transaction will be entered into or consummated, or on what terms,"" the company said in the statement.Monsanto spokeswoman Christi Dixon declined to comment to The Huffington Post.The move by Bayer comes amid increasing consolidation in the chemical industry. Dow Chemical and DuPont Co. announced plans in December to merge into a $130 billion giant. By buying Syngenta for $43 billion, the Chinese state-owned ChemChina could become the world's largest supplier of crop-protection products. As the Wall Street Journal's Christopher Alessi noted on Thursday, taking over Monsanto may be Bayer's last chance to bulk up and avoid being sidelined as a ""second-tier crop player."" Founded in 1901 in St. Louis as a producer of chemicals such as Agent Orange, Monsanto was voted the ""world’s most evil company"" by Natural News readers in 2013. Notoriously litigious, the firm has sued everyone from farmers who save its seeds — the company ferociously defends its patents — to European food regulators who refuse to legalize its products. By sheer virtue of its market dominance, Monsanto's genetically modified crops and insecticides play a crucial role in feeding the world's growing population. The firm, used to its reputation as one of the most hated companies in the world, defends itself as a necessary player in the fight to feed 9 billion humans by 2050.Still, groups such as the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists accuse Monsanto of hampering efforts to make farming more sustainable. ""They're an aggressive company when it comes to the marketing and the PR and the reassuring everyone constantly that [GMOs] are safe,"" Patty Lovera, assistant director at the food industry advocacy group Food & Water Watch, told HuffPost by phone. ""They're also very aggressive in their business practices when it comes to selling seeds, and they have an enormous amount of control over the building blocks of the food industry."" "

Martin began working on accordion-style notebooks shortly after she finished her graphic design degree, when she got a Moleskine accordion sketchbook. After she graduated, she moved to Japan to teach in a rural town, ultimately ending up in Tokyo where she carved out a life as a working artist. In the introduction to Wave, Martin describes using her illustrations in an accordion-style sketchbook to keep a visual diary of her time there: ""I could happily jump between pages, joining everything up at the end versus working from front to back as one would in a traditional sketchbook.""That diary became Wave. In an email to The Huffington Post, Martin describes how the stream-of-consciousness art captures ""a mixture of conversations, things I saw and things I imagined. When I look back at them, I am reminded of various moments, times, places and people ... I discover new things each time I look at them.""This sort of contiguous, limitless sketching is the foundation of Martin's art. As a young girl, living in the Thamesmead estate public housing complex in London, she drew cartoon figures all over hidden spots below furniture.A New York Times Home & Garden profile in 2012 pictured her room in a friend's brownstone, where she'd covered not just the walls but the ceiling and the white bed frame with line drawings. She sketches in black all over her white shirts. And coloring books aside, Martin has also found more than one avenue for remaining financially stable while pursuing her artistic urges; she's drawn all over spaces for Maybelline and Warby Parker, shown in galleries and museums, and of course sells her drawings to private collectors.Martin has flourished as an artist in the years since she created the visual diary that led to Wave, but looking through the coloring book shows a crucial moment in her evolution as a young creative. ""When I look back at these pieces of work, I see that I was on a journey and that I was changing at that time. That's why it's diary-like in a way,"" she told HuffPost. ""And you can also see that over time the lines become more confident and patient.""So why publish this personal memoir-esque work of art as a coloring book? ""People bring the color to my work, and this way I get to see my journey told in numerous new ways and from an untold amount of perspectives,"" Martin explained. If colorists are inspired by the innovative artist's boundary-free approach to visual creativity, the back of the book suggests using ""the reverse side to create your own unfolding illustration."" Martin pointed out, ""If you have a single page, it’s very intimidating and very final. But when you have an accordion, you have the flexibility and freedom to jump between pages""""One of the most exciting things is that you can mix pages up and get an entirely new perspective of the drawing,"" she said.Maybe accordion-style sketchbooks will be the next new mindfulness trend -- for Martin, something about the form is undeniably liberating."

Crop fields and cow pastures are major polluters too. New research from Columbia University’s Earth Institute shows that farms are the biggest contributors to fine particle air pollution in much of the United States, Europe, China and Russia. Farms don’t emit particulates directly. Animal poop and nitrogen-based fertilizers, which many farms rely on, generate ammonia fumes that rise into the atmosphere and mingle with nitrogen oxides and sulfates, often emitted from factories and vehicles, to produce nasty grit that can lodge in people’s lungs and contribute to heart and lung disease. The largest of these fine particulates, PM 2.5, is responsible for 3.3 million deaths every year, according to a 2015 study in Nature. Overall, the health costs of ammonia emissions from U.S. farms run upwards of $30 billion a year, according to a NASA study.So while it’s not just farming that produces fine particulates, farms do contribute over half of the ingredients needed to form fine particle pollution in the eastern and central parts of the U.S., the study found. An even higher concentration of agricultural pollutants floats in the air over China and parts of Europe. “Emissions from farming, fertilizer applications and animal husbandry are currently the dominating contributors to particulate matter"" in the countries studied, Susanne Bauer, the report's lead author and an atmospheric scientist at Columbia University’s Center for Climate Systems Research and the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, told The Huffington Post.Given that fertilizers account for a large portion of farms' ammonia emissions, one solution to certain countries’ air pollution problems might be to wean farmers off nitrogen-based fertilizers, according to Bauer.“One problem is the overuse of fertilizers,” Bauer said. “This could reduce air-pollution tomorrow, if fertilizers would not be used in excess in the corn belt of the U.S. and Europe.” Slashing ammonia emissions could go a long way toward curbing the negative health effects of particle pollution.“Controls on ammonia emissions from agriculture could help reduce particulate matter and provide significant societal benefits,"" Fabien Paulot, a Harvard researcher, said in a NASA blog post in 2014.In the U.S., farming practices don't just worsen air pollution -- they also emit planet-warming greenhouse gases and can cause harmful chemicals to spill into nearby waters. In addition to ammonia fumes, animal waste releases raw methane into the atmosphere; nitrogen fertilizers emit nitrogen dioxide, a powerful greenhouse gas, as well as ammonia. Runoff from farms can pour nitrogen fertilizer into rivers and oceans, causing explosions of algae that suck up oxygen and kill off marine life.But fertilizers can be beneficial, especially for developing countries struggling to increase their crop yields, according to Bauer. And not every country suffering from fine particle air pollution should ditch nitrogen-based fertilizers, Bauer said.“This is not against fertilizer -- there are many places, including Africa, that need more of it,” Bauer said in a release. “We expect population to go up, and to produce more food, we will need more fertilizer.”In some places, reducing industrial pollutants might be a more effective way to curb air pollution. If pollution from factories and cars ebbs, ammonia fumes will have fewer particles to mix with, according to Bauer. Over time, it’s possible for fine particle pollution to decrease, even as agricultural emissions rise, provided that there are drastic reductions in pollution from other sources. Ultimately, reducing harmful air pollution will require cutting emissions from all sources of pollutants, according to Johannes Lelieveld, a chemist at the Max Planck Institute and author of the 2015 Nature study. The new research ""underscores that all source categories should be controlled,” Lelieveld said in a release."

Culvahouse Jr., a Washington-based attorney, met with the businessman's campaign aides at Trump Tower in New York, and has been tapped to lead the effort. His office declined to comment and referred requests for more information to the Trump campaign.Culvahouse previously served as White House counsel to President Ronald Reagan. During that time he handled the failed Supreme Court nomination of Robert Bork. In 2012, Culvahouse defended his vetting of Palin for Sen. John McCain's presidential ticket, writing in The Wall Street Journal that he ""believed she had the presence and wherewithal to grow into the position. I summed up her selection as 'high risk, high reward.'"" McCain's decision to go with Palin ended up being the former, not the latter. The Arizona senator and his staff have been criticized ever since for embracing and legitimizing Palin and her brand of anti-Obama and anti-immigrant politics, ultimately paving the way for a candidate like Trump. The Manhattan real estate mogul is currently weighing several potential running mates, including Scott Walker, John Kasich, Marco Rubio and Newt Gingrich. He has said he wants someone with government experience, an insider who can ably navigate the corridors of power in Washington. The announcement is expected in July at the GOP convention, where Trump will enjoy a bigger spotlight to present himself and his running mate to the nation in hopes of unifying the party and turning around his poll numbers.In the same Journal article, Culvahouse elaborated on how strictly he scrutinizes potential running mates. As part of the process, he examines “tax returns, medical histories, financial statements, court records,"" and poses questions about “infidelity, sexual harassment, discrimination, plagiarism, alcohol or drug addiction, delinquent taxes, credit history, and use of government positions or resources for personal benefit.”Trump's campaign told MSNBC that potential running mates would need to submit their tax returns during the vetting process. Yet Trump is refusing to release his own tax returns on the grounds that he's currently under audit by the IRS, even though there is nothing barring him legally from doing so. Moreover, there is precedent for releasing tax returns under audit. President Richard Nixon did so, for example.And the Trump campaign's response to the clear hypocrisy?“Trump’s not running for vice president.""Thank you, Captain Obvious.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S. "

Initially launched as a Kickstarter initiative, Jones' campaign to launch the comedy show went viral following his March appearance on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show.” He discussed his diagnosis with Stage 4 mesothelioma cancer and outlined his mission to raise money to film a comedy special while on the daytime television program.A week following his appearance, on March 21, Jones returned to ""Ellen"" where Ellen DeGeneres presented him with the news that HBO had agreed to broadcast the hour-long special.The surprise announcement led the comedian to immediately write material in time for his April 4 taping of the special at the Teragram Ballroom in Los Angeles, California, according to Jones.“We put the hour together to make it smooth in two weeks,” Jones told HuffPost in reference to creating the special. “Once we announced it, I was on the road and had to get to work. I had to submit the jokes for approval to make sure HBO approved it and they liked it. Luckily, I got it right the first go round, then I had to structure the jokes. So it really just more so me just doing the work that I normally wouldn’t do, which is just perform.”Jones went on to add that the special’s title is derived from a comedic phrase for people who are going over their set time, which is something that he plans to do with his life. Since receiving his prognosis in summer 2015, which at the time he said he was informed that he would only have one year to live, the Seattle-native said he changed his perspective on life. It also helped him with his approach to comedy by allowing him to make light of darker issues and gave his style of comedy “a little more substance” than before.As for his upcoming special, Jones said he decided to address topics dealing with race, gay marriage, social media and cancer. The latter, being a subject he was a bit apprehensive to address.“At first there was a debate as to whether I should or if I wasn’t going to address it,” he said. “But I figured since everyone was going to be there for me that night to support, and it wasn’t gonna be awkward for me to talk about cancer, I figured it was just a good thing to do just to address the elephant in the room.”But his past decision to omit discussing the disease in front of audiences for his normal stand-up routines is something that he doesn’t want people to focus on during his performances. “I really don’t address it, because I don’t want to give the cancer too much power,” he said. “I don’t want people to look at it as ‘oh, he has cancer,’ then you start getting the ‘awes’ and the pities and you sort of soothe the crowd’s feeling for you. I just want to go up there and be funny and have people enjoy theirselves, and provide a good time and then get off stage. And that’s what I like to do.”With his goal to headline and executive produce a televised comedy special accomplished, Jones has already begun writing the treatment for a follow-up special in-between ongoing performances across the country and attending chemotherapy every three weeks.Aside from the comedian pursuing his dreams and raising cancer awareness through his affiliation with the American Cancer Research Alliance, Jones said he wants to continue building his legacy through his work.“The thing about legacy is that you’re never around to see it anyways. So for me it doesn’t matter what my legacy is, I just hope while I’m here now people look at me and draw inspiration,"" he added.""I’m hopefully able to inspire and instill a work ethic for comedians or a passion for people who have cancer and they can realize that cancer doesn’t have to get to the quality of their living. That’s all I’m trying to do is be funny and hopefully spread the message of positivity and hard work.”Quincy Jones’ HBO comedy special “Burning The Light” premieres on June 2 at 10 p.m. E.

11,POLITICS,House Votes Down Proposal To End 2001 War Authorization,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-rejects-2001-aumf-end_us_573cfa33e4b0646cbeec198e,There's no end in sight for a war authorization that's been used for nearly 15 years.,2016-05-19,U.S. Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) is the sponsor of an amendment that would have revoked the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force within 90 days of the president signing the defense spending bill. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/573d07d91a00002f00c28f63.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There will be no end to the president's endless war authority.In a 138-285 vote, the House rejected an amendment Wednesday night that would have repealed the sprawling 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force passed in the days after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.The amendment would have revoked the 2001 AUMF within 90 days of the president signing the National Defense Authorization Act, which passed Wednesday night, 277-147.As amendment sponsor Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) noted on Wednesday, the Congressional Research Service says the broad war authorization has been used to justify military action in 14 countries a total of 37 times -- 18 from President George W. Bush, and 19 from President Barack Obama.""And this report only looks at unclassified incidents,"" Lee said. ""How many other times has it been used without the knowledge of Congress or the American people?""Lee, who was the only member of Congress to vote against the AUMF in 2001, said she opposed the authorization ""because I believed it opened the door for any president to wage endless war without a congressional debate or a vote.""""And I believe, quite frankly,"" Lee continued, ""that history has borne that out.""Lee said the authorization was not only used to fight large-scale wars, but that it's been used ""much closer to home to allow warrantless surveillance and wiretaps, indefinite detention practices at [Guantanamo Bay] and targeted killing by drones.""The 2001 war authorization is currently being used as a legal justification for the ongoing war against the Islamic State, and there's a growing coalition of lawmakers who think the president needs a new war authorization for military operations against ISIS.While Lee said lawmakers are splintered on what a new AUMF should look like, she asserted that many agree that an overly broad and nearly 15-year-old AUMF represents ""a major and very concerning deterioration of congressional oversight.""But there's still a large bloc of members who aren't ready to yank the 2001 authorization.House Foreign Affairs Chairman Ed Royce (R-Calif.) noted that the president, the secretary of defense, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff all say they have full legal authority to combat ISIS.""And Congress has supported that view by appropriating funds,"" Royce said.Royce noted that a new AUMF wouldn't give the president any more authority to fight ISIS than he currently has. ""It could give him less,"" Royce said. ""The president asked for less in his proposal.""That's true, more or less.Obama did submit a new AUMF to Congress in February 2015 that would have placed new restrictions on the president, authorizing a war against ISIS for three years and not authorizing ""enduring offensive ground combat operations."" That new AUMF, however, would not have repealed the 2001 authorization, meaning the president would retain all current authorities anyway. (The president's proposed AUMF would have repealed a 2002 authorization, and Obama said he was willing to work with Congress to sunset the 2001 authorization as well.)But that debate went nowhere.A small coalition of Republicans and Democrats have been pressuring Speaker Paul Ryan to debate a new war authorization. And Ryan has sounded somewhat open to the idea. But, thus far, a vote on the Lee amendment Wednesday night is the closest Congress has come to debating a new AUMF.The Rules Committee did not allow consideration of a number of amendments to the defense authorization that would have acted as a new AUMF. Instead, they made the Lee amendment in order, knowing that it was destined to fail. (A similar amendment -- again from Lee -- was rejected last year during NDAA consideration.)The vote on that amendment was 157-270. While it may seem like opposition to the 2001 AUMF is softening, Lee's amendment last year was a bit more forgiving on the timeline for revoking the authorization. Last year, members were voting in June to halt funding in December for activities granted by the 2001 AUMF. This year, they were simply voting to repeal the authorization within 90 days of enactment."

Circuit.The article titled “Quick Question: What Am I Supposed To Be Doing Right Now?” presents the faux Garland politely wondering if there's anything else he should do while waiting for the Senate to consider (or not) his nomination to the nation's highest court. “Is there any work I should be getting started on?"" he asks. ""In order to get a jump on things, I mean?”“I’d be happy to look over some briefs or sit in on the justices’ oral arguments if that makes sense,"" he offers. ""Whatever I can do to help.”“Anyhow, I’m here if you need me. Everyone has my current contact information, right?"" the article concludes, before providing Garland's office number. ""Don’t hesitate to be in touch. It’s no bother at all, honestly.”One Huffington Post reporter called that number, assuming it was a prank. He hung up when he realized it wasn't fake.While the number for Garland's office is also listed on the D.C. Circuit's website, the Onion article surely drew more attention to it. The people who answered the phone in Garland’s chambers and at a general number for the federal appeals court declined to comment when asked about the article and referred inquiries to the White House.

15,ENTERTAINMENT,Nicole Kidman On Imperfect Parenting And ‘The Family Fang',Cole Delbyck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nicole-kidman-family-fang-motherhood_us_573b6a13e4b0646cbeeb1fc0,"The Oscar winner talks about her new film, motherhood and never knowing what’s next.",2016-05-19,Nicole Kidman attends the 65th Berlinale International Film Festival.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/573b6a971300000105381dc2.jpeg?cache=Yn8CsEbU3Y&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Nicole Kidman likes to describe herself as a walking high-wire act. As an actress with upward of 70 film credits to her name over the course of a 30-plus-year career, the image of Kidman teetering on the Hollywood tightrope is hard to reconcile with her enduring celebrity. But this by-the-seat-of-your-pants mentality is exactly what drew the Oscar winner to ""The Family Fang,"" an offbeat portrait of a family united by dysfunction and the damaging effects of an artistic legacy. ""I have no idea what's up ahead, what I’m going to do next, how I'm going to do it or where I'm going to go,"" Kidman told The Huffington Post in a recent interview. ""I try to have that very laissez-faire approach, even though [the work] mines the depths of where I'm at as a mother and as a woman.""In ""Fang,"" Kidman has once again reached these depths with a performance best described by what it's not: affected, treacly or overstated. Adapted from Kevin Wilson's comic novel and directed by Jason Bateman, ""The Family Fang"" examines how decisions made by parents can reverberate through the identities of children. Used as props in mom and dad's boundary-pushing performance art pieces of the 1970s, Annie (Kidman) and Baxter (Bateman) are still struggling with the aftershock of childhood trauma. Their parents, Caleb (Christopher Walken) and Camille Fang (Maryann Plunkett), privileged artistic vision over child-rearing, gifting Annie and Baxter (called Child A and Child B) with both a deep appreciation for art and an unshakable melancholy. When the family unit is unexpectedly reassembled, the children are drawn back into their parents' web. But just as soon as the elder Fangs reemerge, they abruptly disappear again under mysterious circumstances, leaving Annie and Baxter to decide whether the two are gone forever or are masterminds of the ultimate performance piece. For Kidman, the role hits home on many levels. Annie is a 40-something actress searching for her next big role while navigating the difficulties of leading a life in the public eye. Despite the B-level success, she still seeks her parents' approval, filling the void with shoplifting, inappropriate sex and DUIs. Kidman's first scene finds Annie negotiating the necessity of a gratuitous nude scene only to later strut on set topless to ""control"" the moment. In her character's complexities, Kidman finds a point of resonance, articulating how, as an actress, displacement from one's identity can be essential for inhabiting a role. ""[Annie] doesn’t quite know what she’s meant to be doing or who she is,"" Kidman said. ""That’s the plight of an actress a lot of the time, because you can move so swiftly into other psyches and other places that so much of your own real life has to be devoted to seeking out your sense of self.""Drawing parallels to her experience in the industry, Kidman empathizes with the character's frustrations, but sees differences in her own career trajectory.""I’m fortunate in the sense that I’m quite uncompromising in terms of what I want to do now at this stage of my life,"" she said. ""I wasn’t in my 20s, but now I have a strong idea of where I want to place my time ... When you’re single and running around the world, there’s a flippancy to it. Once you’re raising children, particularly as a woman, where you place that time is incredibly important.""Kidman, of course, has been married for almost a decade to country singer Keith Urban, with whom she has two young daughters, Sunday Rose and Faith Margaret. The actress also adopted two children with ex-husband Tom Cruise. Kidman's and Urban's daughters travel with them almost everywhere they go, she said, and during our phone call Kidman let slip that the 5- and 7-year-olds were there right beside her. Parenting, however, is not without its challenges, as made clear by the irreparable damage wrought on Kidman's character in ""The Family Fang."" One line in the film we discuss comes from Walken's character, who matter-of-factly informs his offspring that their childhood woes are anything but extraordinary. ""You think we damaged you?"" he asks them. ""So what! That's what parents do."" Kidman says she can, in some small way, empathize with the uncompromising patriarch, explaining that parenting is no perfect science, having now experienced it from both the perspective of a child and a mother. ""I don't think there are very many people in the world that go, 'The way I was parented was perfection.' In that sense, we are all in the same boat,"" she said. ""In the case of my own family ... there were times when I had to rally against my parents to form my own beliefs. They certainly weren’t always completely synchronized and still aren’t at certain times, but that’s healthy.""But ultimately, parents are the ones who shape us. Both Annie and Baxter find a career in the arts, ironically fulfilled by the origin of their misery. Although by the film's end, the pair break free of the fangs embedded so deeply within them, the damage has already been done. Kidman admits too that in her own life the connections she shares with her family are what matters most. ""My own purpose in the sense of women’s rights is very tied to my mother, the feminist, so my identity is still very much linked to her,"" Kidman said. ""I feel very defined now by my relationship with my children and my husband and that’s given me such a strong sense of who I am and what I want."""
16,GREEN,Big Oil Could Have Cut CO2 Emissions In 1970s -- But Did Nothing,Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/big-oil-emissions_us_573c9d81e4b0aee7b8e8a046,New documents show the industry chose to prioritize costs over the planet.,2016-05-19,"""Burn off"" oil fume flames are seen on an offshore oil platform. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/573d03781600006400f93d28.jpeg?cache=1xF7ws4SPt&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In 1963, Esso (now Exxon Mobil) patented a design for a ""novel and highly efficient electrode"" for use in fuel cells -- a possible means of decreasing carbon emissions and producing cleaner-burning vehicles.Research into this innovative technology, the company said at the time, ""has been greatly accelerated."" But, as Carroll Muffett, president of the Center for International Environmental Law, likes to say, ""Did you start driving a Prius in 1968?""Muffett's point, which he supports with dozens more documents his group released Thursday, is that American oil companies were well aware of the risks their industry posed to the environment by the 1960s. And they could have taken actions to significantly reduce carbon emissions.The new documents, Muffett said, show that oil companies ""clearly preferred to invest in research to explain away the climate risks,"" instead of on technologies to reduce emissions.The Center for International Environmental Law last month published documents showing the oil industry was aware of the potential role of fossil fuels in carbon dioxide emissions and the associated climate risks as early as 1957 -- decades earlier than had previously been documented -- and covered them up.This second trove of documents, Muffett said, doesn't contain a ""smoking gun"" like the first set, but does highlight how the U.S. oil industry studied, understood and chose not to act on climate change.""Here's still more evidence that this industry both understood climate issues [and] had the capacity to cut pollution,"" Muffett said. ""What really emerges from our research is which side of the coin the oil companies decided to pursue.""For example, a 1980 Exxon corporate document released last month by the DeSmog Blog Project refers to existing technology that could remove carbon dioxide from power plant emissions. ""It is assumed that the major contributors of CO2 are the burning of fossil fuels,"" the document reads. ""There is no doubt that increases in fossil fuel usage and decreases of forest cover are aggravating the potential problem of increased CO2 in the atmosphere. Technology exists to remove CO2 from stack gases but removal of only 50% of the CO2 would double the cost of power generation.""""They could have deployed it very rapidly,"" Muffett said of the technologies, ""But they decided it was too expensive.""The American Petroleum Institute, an industry trade group, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment after business hours. Story continues below...The new documents also show that during the same period, oil companies funded research into other pollutants that may offset climate warming; carbon sinks that would reduce the need to control emissions; and alternative theories on the cause of climate change, some of which are still being tossed around by climate change deniers today. Between the 1950s and 1970s, the industry also financed studies into how petroleum products could be used to control the climate. The research included burning oil to clear areas of fog and smog, and constructing massive ""artificial heat mountains"" out of asphalt to increase rainfall. As early as the 1980s, oil companies were beginning to invest in taller oil rigs that could withstand rising sea levels.Bigger drilling rigs, Muffett said, are ""an example of the profound distinction of how these companies were protecting their own interests"" and not the public's.This week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced that April 2016 was the 12th consecutive month to set a global temperature record.Tom Sanzillo, finance director at the Cleveland-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, told Vice there is a clear potential, perhaps even likelihood, that these documents will result in litigation against oil companies. ""This looks like it's pretty serious, and it just seems to get worse,"" Sanzillo said. The Center for International Environmental Law plans to release additional documents in the near future. For now, the group's new searchable database allows users to identify connections between companies, research institutes and individuals.

EgyptAir said some of the plane's wreckage was found near the Greek island of Karpathos late Thursday, but later retracted the statement to CNN. Greek officials denied that any debris recovered so far was linked to the plane.EgyptAir Flight MS804 left Paris at 11:09 p.m. and was scheduled to land at 3:05 a.m., Cairo time. It was cruising at 37,000 feet when it vanished from radar around 2:45 a.m. Cairo time. The cause of the crash hadn't been determined. U.S. intelligence officials told NBC News that imagery suggests there was an explosion on the plane. However, U.S. officials cited by Reuters contradicted that claim, saying the imagery being reviewed showed no signs of an explosion so far.""At this time we do not yet know definitively what caused the disappearance of Flight 804,"" the White House said in a statement Thursday night.READ MORE: What We Know So Far About EgyptAir Flight MS804The search operation involved a frigate from Greece, as well as French, American, Greek, Turkish and Egyptian military planes. Earlier, search teams spotted two objects in the sea 230 nautical miles south of the island of Crete, a Greek official told The Associated Press. An Egyptian ship captain posted images on Facebook that he claimed show a yellow lifejacket and part of a plane chair. Officials know the pilot, Mohamed Saeed Shaqeer, 36, had more than 6,000 hours of flight experience, the airline said. The co-pilot, 24-year-old Mohamed Ahmed Mamdouh, had nearly 3,000 flying hours. No adverse weather was spotted at the time of the jet's disappearance.""Our crew was entirely professional,"" EgyptAir's Adel told CNN. He added that the pilot was ""incredibly professional, incredibly experienced.""Authorities have not ruled out terrorism as a potential cause of the crash. In a press conference, Hollande said he has no certain information about the disappearance.“When we have the truth, we will draw our conclusions; whether this was an accident or something else, perhaps terrorist. We will have the truth,” Hollande said.Egypt Civil Aviation Minister Sherif Fathi said at a press conference that a terror attack was a possibility, although he noted that he was not happy with ""people making assumptions.” U.S. presidential hopefuls began reacting to the news later Thursday. ""It does appear that it was an act of terrorism -- exactly how, of course, the investigation will have to determine,"" Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton told CNN.The plane descended 22,000 feet and took two sharp turns, the Greek defense minister said, according to the French newspaper Le Figaro. Egypt received no distress signal from the plane, according to Fathi. The pilot's abrupt turns and lack of distress call suggest a bomb is more likely to be the cause than structural or mechanical failure, former U.S. National Transportation Safety Board member John Goglia told AP. He cautioned that no potential cause could be ruled out at this stage.Flight MS804 was carrying 56 passengers and 10 crew, including one child and two infants. The passengers included 30 Egyptians, 15 French nationals, two Iraqis and one passenger each from Algeria, Belgium, Canada, Chad, Kuwait, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and the U.K. Anxious friends and family gathered at the airports in Cairo and Paris waiting for news.Other recent air disasters have triggered alarm within the security and aviation industries. Last October, a Russian airliner carrying 224 passengers from the Egyptian resort town of Sharm el Sheikh crashed, killing all those aboard. The self-described Islamic State later took credit for the incident, claiming to have brought down the flight with an explosive.In March, a man with a fake suicide belt hijacked an EgyptAir flight with 81 people flying from Alexandria, Egypt, to Cairo and forced it to land in Cyprus. No one was harmed. The man, who a Cyprus official said seemed unstable, was arrested. Authorities didn't classify the incident as terrorism.Paris increased security at its Charles de Gaulle Airport following the November terror attacks in the city.

Or, just a loony bunch of keyboard warrior NBA conspiracy theorists. Probably the latter. ""I want to let people know there was no conspiracy,"" Mutombo said to the Associated Press on Tuesday night in a phone interview. Suuurrreeee there isn't. The 2016 NBA Draft Lottery went down Tueday night in New York, and as statistical probability and some ping-pong balls would have it, the 76ers won the No. 1 overall pick. Or, as the well-established NBA conspiracy theory community claimed, the 76ers won a rigged lottery after Mutombo accidentally posted a congratulatory message to the team for winning the No. 1 pick hours before the event. He quickly deleted it, but the damage was done. ""It was like maybe 30 seconds, then I realized, `Whoa! What did I do here?""' he said. ""But it was too late. It was out in the air.""The 76ers came into the lottery with a 25 percent chance — the highest of all teams — of winning the pick after finishing 10-72, the worst record in the NBA this season. Fans, however, have long been skeptical of the lottery, believing that in some years, the NBA purposefully rigged it so certain teams would be rewarded for corrupt reasons. Logical tweets, like the one below, aren't the most fun takes, after all. Boo to reason and trust in organizational integrity. As the ""real story"" goes, Mutombo reportedly showed the Associated Press an earlier email containing sample tweets from the team if the 76ers landed the pick, and he went ahead and posted one without checking if the lottery had happened or not. Ignoring math: HOW DID THE 76ERS KNOW THEY'D NEED TWEETS IF THEY WON? Obviously, there's a conspiracy to reward them for booting team-destroyer and former 76ers general manager Sam Hinkie. And that's what we're choosing to believe, Mutombo and the NBA be damned. "

AFJ concluded that ""on the merits, Judge Garland is highly qualified to serve on the Supreme Court"" in a 102-page evaluation of his record, which was released as a separate document last week.Earlier this month, two prominent civil rights organizations evaluated Garland's record on pertinent civil rights issues. The evaluation focused on issues such as employment discrimination, equal rights to housing and criminal justice. The organizations found Garland to be “exceptionally highly qualified"" and called for an “immediate” and “prompt” Senate hearing.While AFJ's report takes a slightly more comprehensive look into Garland's record, it reaches the same conclusion: ""[T]here is no legitimate basis for the Senate to deny him full and fair consideration.""The Supreme Court seat has been vacant since Justice Antonin Scalia's death in February. Many Senate Republicans have opposed hearing Garland, or any nominee, during President Barack Obama's last year in office. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) are leading the opposition.""Throughout his judicial career, Judge Garland has demonstrated extraordinary intellect, fairness, humility, and an unwavering commitment to the rule of law,"" the report said."
23,POLITICS,Are Voters Pining For A Third-Party Candidate? It's Complicated.,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/third-party-candidate-polls_us_573cc72ae4b0aee7b8e8d035,A set of unpopular candidates is making the unknown look like an appealing alternative.,2016-05-18,Could this be the third-party candidate of voters' dreams?,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/573cd23f1a00008800c28f1a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A small but significant minority of voters would be interested in a more ideologically pure alternative to the two likely presidential nominees, a new HuffPost/YouGov poll finds. But that doesn't necessarily mean they'd actually vote for one.Ten percent of voters say they'd be very likely to vote for a liberal challenger over Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, with 16 percent saying they'd be fairly or somewhat likely, and 62 percent that they would not be very likely to do so. An equal 10 percent say they'd be very likely to support a conservative alternative to Clinton and Trump, with 57 percent calling themselves unlikely to do so and 21 percent falling somewhere in the middle.Even if only the ""very likely"" voters followed through, it would be enough of a bloc to serve as a possible spoiler either for Clinton or for Trump. It would also be a rare feat. While Ross Perot took 19 percent of the vote in 1992, less than 2 percent of voters cast a ballot for a third-party candidate in 2008 or 2012. For voters, professing openness to a third-party candidate may be appealing for the same reason that people are increasingly likely to describe themselves as independents -- it registers as a statement of dissatisfaction with the existing options, and allows them to paint themselves as being above the partisan fray. Plenty of other polls this year have found even higher support for a third-party candidate.But there's reason to doubt that many of those voters will end up backing someone else in November. Back in April 2012, 40 percent of voters said they'd ""definitely consider"" or ""probably consider"" supporting an alternative to Mitt Romney or Barack Obama, according to an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll. Such an insurrection never materialized.This year, of course, doesn't exactly look like past years. Both Clinton and Trump are historically unpopular. And unlike in other recent elections, a substantial slice of the GOP establishment, rather than falling in line, is actively plotting to take down the presumptive nominee.But saying you'll desert both the leading candidates and the two-party system isn't the same as actually doing it. A test for third-party support, set up by political scientist Steven Rosenstone and noted previously by Republican pollster Matt Dabrowski, shows that ""[a] potential third-party voter must reject both the Republicans and Democrats and both the Republican and Democrat nominees"" -- although this year's political climate could make that easier than usual. And, just as there's a difference between wanting a Republican to win and supporting Donald Trump, there's a dramatic gap between the ideal of Someone Who Isn't Trump Or Clinton and the reality of whoever would actually choose to run.Or, as the Washington Post's Chris Cillizza puts it:Think of it this way. You are really hungry. You have three options to eat. The first is blood pudding. The second is liverwurst. (Let's assume you are a normal person and hate both of those things.) The third is an unidentified food. You immediately begin fantasizing about what that third food might be. A cherry pie? A nice steak? Ice cream? Pizza? It's something different for most people. But the fact that it's an option without any specifics attached to it makes it instantly appealing. It could be the exact thing you have been craving!Or, to put it a third way:Asked to name any politician they'd especially like to see run as an independent, voters in the HuffPost/YouGov poll clustered most around Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has ruled out a third-party bid if he loses the nomination, followed by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who's done the same. Candidates who have actually declared, like Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green candidate Jill Stein, were mentioned just eight times and once, respectively.There are more concrete roadblocks for a new third-party candidate to enter the race. Time is running out for would-be challengers to get their name on the ballot; in Texas, the state with the second-largest number of Electoral College votes, the deadline has already passed.Until a viable third-party candidate actually declares for office, polls about one can't reliably predict how likely voters are to defect. But they do serve as a measure of dissatisfaction across the ideological spectrum.Voters in both parties are more likely than not to be comfortable with their presumptive nominee's ideology, but significant blocs, especially in the GOP, would like to see their candidate move a little further from the center. Fifty-four percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters think Clinton's ideology is about right, while 26 percent say she's not liberal enough and another 7 percent say she's too liberal. On the other side of the aisle, 47 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning voters consider Trump about right, while 34 percent say he's not conservative enough and 7 percent say he's too conservative.The big question is whether that dissatisfaction will be enough to make the staunchest partisans seek out another option, or simply to keep them home on Election Day. In most elections, signs would point to ""no"" -- and this year, despite the ongoing primary, Democrats are generally positive about Hillary Clinton, and Republicans are warming to their presumptive nominee. But this election has defied predictions before.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted May 6 - May 9 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling.

The LGBT equality group announced Wednesday that Olson, who successfully argued against California's Proposition 8 in the Supreme Court, will write the brief supporting the Obama administration's lawsuit against HB 2. Amicus briefs allow individuals or groups not directly involved in a lawsuit to offer additional information or arguments for the court to consider. Olson, who previously served as the U.S. solicitor general under George W. Bush, has argued dozens of cases in front of the Supreme Court. The conservative lawyer became an unexpected ally of the left when he took up the case against Prop 8, the California ballot measure banning same-sex marriages, in 2009. The case eventually reached the Supreme Court in 2013, when the justices upheld a lower court's decision to overturn the ban.""HB2 discriminates against fellow citizens because of who they are,"" Olson said in a statement. ""This law directly challenges the legitimacy of the identity of transgender persons and then compels them to deny it every time they use a public restroom. There can be no doubt that this is bad for business in North Carolina.""HRC President Chad Griffin traveled to California last week to convince major Silicon Valley companies to sign on to the planned brief, meeting with dozens of tech companies that have publicly opposed the much-maligned legislation. While the group has not announced which companies will sign on, an HRC spokesman said several companies had ""strong interest"" in joining the brief. “HB 2 is a hateful piece of legislation that has not only harmed thousands of people across North Carolina, but hurt companies and damaged the state’s economy,"" Griffin said in a statement. ""We are proud that Ted Olson, one of the nation’s leading conservative legal minds, will lead a brief on behalf of the business community and advocate for the equal rights and dignity of transgender Americans."" The equality group previously enlisted corporate support for an amicus brief ahead of the Supreme Court's 2013 ruling striking down the Defense of Marriage Act. North Carolina's law, signed by Gov. Pat McCrory (R) in March, prevents cities from establishing protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals. It also bars transgender people from using public bathrooms that match their gender identity. The DOJ filed the suit challenging the law earlier this month, arguing that HB 2 violates federal civil rights law.""This is about the dignity and respect that we accord our fellow citizens and the laws we have enacted as a country to protect them and to protect us,"" Attorney General Loretta Lynch said.North Carolina has countersued the government, accusing the DOJ of ""blatant overreach.""

The actress spoke about some of her most uncomfortable auditions during a Variety panel at the Cannes Film Festival on Wednesday. ""I've had the ‘What are you doing after this?’ conversation,"" Sevigny told the audience. ""I've also had the ‘Do you want to go shopping and try on some clothes and, like, I can buy you something in the dressing room' [conversation]. Just like crossing the line weirdness."" The ""American Horror Story"" actress added that another director once told her, ""You should show your body off more. You shouldn’t wait until you’re as old as this certain actress who had just been naked in a film, you should be naked on screen now.'"" If you know Sevigny's career, then you're well aware that she's not afraid to strip down for a role. But her on-screen choices do not suggest that she appreciates inappropriate comments thrown her way, nor does she think other women should have to take them. “If you’re young and impressionable and really want the part, it might be a tempting avenue, but I hope not,” she said.Still, Sevigny refused to label these directors' advances as sexual harassment, instead saying it was just ""Hollywood.""The actress is not alone in her experience, though, as many women in the industry have come forward with their own terrible audition stories. Academy Award winner Brie Larson shared a very personal encounter with icky execs in the press room just after she'd won her Oscar. “There were many times that I would go into auditions and a casting director would say, ‘It’s really great. Really love what you’re doing, but we’d love you to come back with a jean miniskirt and high heels,'"" she said. ""Those were always moments of a real fork in the road, because there’s no reason for me to show up in a jean miniskirt and heels other than the fact that you want to create some fantasy, and you want to have this moment that you can reject.""

Los Angeles county is considering taxing millionaires to help fund efforts to tackle homelessness, according to the L.A. Times. In a board meeting of the L.A. County supervisors on Tuesday, the group voted to pursue state legislation that would impose a tax on personal income over $1 million a year. The money would help pay for housing and other services for homeless people. ""It is a crisis, no one can deny that,"" L.A. County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas said at the board meeting, according to the Patch. ""It is the most compelling issue confronting us at this time.”Los Angeles has the largest number of chronically homeless people in the country, with more than 12,000 people who have been homeless for a year or more, or have had at least four episodes of homelessness in the past three years. And the problem is only growing: The number of homeless people in the city increased by more than 10 percent last year. Last month Mayor Eric Garcetti pledged $138 million to tackle the issue, mostly to build more permanent, affordable housing for the homeless. That figure is more than quadruple the $34 million allocated for the previous year’s budget, leaving many wondering where the money would come from.This new “millionaire’s tax” could be one way to do it. By imposing a .5 percent tax on income above $1 million, it would generate an estimated $243 million a year, according to the L.A. Daily News. But before this proposal becomes a reality, the state will need to approve legislation to implement the new tax, according to the L.A. Times. Then voters will have to approve the measure by more than two-thirds for it to pass. With a recent poll showing 76 percent of likely voters are strongly supportive of the idea, according to the Daily News, it may have a shot at success. "

Last summer, a senior editor at libertarian publication Reason praised Willett for authoring ""a full-throated defense of economic liberty"" in a state licensing case.Trump has previously referred to both Sykes and Pryor as judges who ""would best represent the conservative values we need to protect."" The two George W. Bush appointees have staunchly conservative records, according to an analysis by ThinkProgress' Ian Millhiser.The other judges on the list aren't exactly household names, and are drawn largely from federal appeals courts across the country.They include Steven Colloton, an 8th Circuit judge who once clerked for former Chief Justice William Rehnquist and served as a Justice Department lawyer; his colleague Raymond Gruender, who worked as a federal prosecutor in Missouri for several years before Bush appointed him to the bench; 6th Circuit judge Raymond Kethledge, another Bush appointee with experience in both public service and private practice; and Thomas Hardiman, whom Bush appointed to both a district and appellate court position. The list is rounded out by four state Supreme Court justices: Joan Larsen of Michigan, Allison Eid of Colorado, Thomas Lee of Utah and David Stras of Minnesota. Trump included only three women and no minorities on his list of judges. But none of his suggested potential candidates graduated from Harvard Law School, and only one went to Yale -- something that addresses a common critique of the current Supreme Court, which only includes justices from Ivy League law schools.In recent months, Trump has said he would rely on the know-how of The Heritage Foundation to help guide his decision-making, and that he would ultimately nominate ""wonderful, conservative, good, solid, brilliant"" judges to the Supreme Court.Of the names on the 11-judge list, five coincide with those put forward by Heritage: Willett, Sykes, Pryor, Colloton and Gruender.Conservatives have warned that the presumptive Republican nominee, who has displayed shifting views on hotly contested issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage, may not be up to the task of securing the legacy of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February.“Justice Scalia was a remarkable person and a brilliant Supreme Court Justice. His career was defined by his reverence for the Constitution and his legacy of protecting Americans’ most cherished freedoms,"" Trump said in a statement accompanying his list of names.National Review, an avowed conservative #NeverTrump publication, on Wednesday called Trump's delay on releasing his list of candidates to the high court ""worrisome.""""At a time when the future of the issues most vital to conservatives is more tied to the Court’s composition than ever before, the Republican party is about to nominate a man who inspires little confidence in conservatives,"" senior political correspondent Jim Geraghty wrote. Some people Heritage suggested, like former Solicitor General Paul Clement and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) -- both of whom have served as clerks on the Supreme Court -- didn't make the cut. (Lee's brother, Thomas, did make Trump's list; the two are sons of the late Rex E. Lee, former U.S. solicitor general under Ronald Reagan and onetime president of Brigham Young University.)Neither did Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who has denied being interested in the job whenever he has been asked about it.The Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative advocacy group that has fiercely opposed President Barack Obama's choice of Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court, seemed to be pleased with Trump's selections.""The names on this list would need to be vetted, obviously, but they all seem to share in common a record of putting the law and the Constitution ahead of their political preferences,"" Carrie Severino, the group's chief counsel, said in a statement. Senate Judiciary Chairmain Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) also looked on Trump's wish list approvingly. He had previously called Trump's clinching of the Republican nomination a ""gamble"" for the future of the Supreme Court, and for the last two months has roundly refused to hold a hearing on Garland.""Understanding the types of judges a presidential nominee would select for the Supreme Court is an important step in this debate so that the American people can have a voice in the direction of the Supreme Court for the next generation,"" Grassley said in a statement shared by the Trump campaign.The White House, meanwhile, downplayed the announcement as yet another sign that Republicans are not interested in meeting Obama in the middle on Garland, who is widely regarded as a moderate nominee.""I would be surprised if there are any Democrats who would describe any of those 11 individuals as a consensus nominee,"" said White House spokesman Josh Earnest at his Wednesday briefing. ""But the individual who President Obama has put forward is somebody that Republicans have described as a consensus nominee. I think that speaks to the wisdom of the Senate acting on the president's nomination.""Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.This article has been updated throughout."

""I used to beat myself up about it.""In the interview, she also praised the benefits of cognitive behavioral therapy, a specific type of treatment used by clinicians to help with mental health disorders.""I was skeptical at first because I’d never had therapy, but not being able to leave the house was so debilitating,"" she said.Goulding is hardly alone in her experience. Approximately 40 million American adults are affected by an anxiety disorder. The mental health issue prompts debilitating physical and emotional complications, from headaches to overwhelming feelings of fear or panic.But the effects don't end there: many people with mental illness feel like they have to say silent in their suffering. That's why public and candid testimonies like Goulding's are so important. Her account is crucial to combatting negative stereotypes about mental illness, particularly because research shows stigma can prevent people from seeking treatment.Just add the singer to the growing list of celebrities who are advocating for mental health through sharing their own experiences.

29,POLITICS,House GOP Is Determined To Make It Harder For Poor Kids To Get Free School Lunches,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-school-lunch_us_573c7e82e4b0ef86171cca10,A House committee approved a controversial change to the way low-income children would qualify.,2016-05-18,House Education and Workforce Committee member Rep. Todd Rokita (R-Indiana) is pushing for changes to the national school lunch program.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"House Republicans appear determined to advance an aggressive rollback of a program credited with helping low-income children get free school lunches.The Committee on Education and the Workforce on Wednesday advanced a child nutrition reauthorization bill introduced by Rep. Todd Rokita (R-Indiana) to the House floor. The committee approved the legislation along party lines, 20-14, with Rep. Dave Brad (R-Virginia) the only Republican to join Democrats opposing it.The legislation, called the Improving Child Nutrition and Education Act of 2016, has been widely panned by nutrition and hunger groups, which say it would reverse 2010 improvements to the national school lunch program. A letter opposing the bill released this week by the Center for Science in the Public Interest was signed by more than 750 local, state and national groups.Criticisms have centered on proposed changes to the community eligibility provision, which currently allows high-poverty school districts, with 40 percent or more of their student population from families receiving government assistance like Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, to offer free meals to all of their students.The community eligibility provision, which began in the 2011-12 school year and expanded nationwide in 2014, has been considered a success. A U.S. Department of Agriculture evaluation of its first two years found that the program increased participation in the national school lunch program by 5.2 percent and in the school breakfast program by 9.4 percent.The provision appears to be gaining popularity among school districts, too. According to a report co-authored by the think tank Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, and the anti-hunger advocacy group Food and Research Action Center, more than 18,000 schools in 3,000 districts participated in the community eligibility provision last year.But that progress is at risk. Rokita’s legislation would raise the qualifications for school districts to participate in the community eligibility provision, requiring them to have at least 60 percent of students whose families receive government assistance. The changes to the community eligibility provision, if they become law, would mean that nearly 3.4 million students at more than 7,000 schools would need to return to the previous application process in order to receive free meals at school, according to a separate analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. That process, advocates argue, causes many low-income children to miss out on meals, due to problems like communication and resistance to being stigmatized by peers.Sara Gasiorowski, child nutrition director at the Metropolitan School District of Wayne Township in Indianapolis, has seen how the community eligibility provision has affected her district’s students firsthand.Since the district began the program at 11 of its 17 school sites, participation in the free lunch program has increased 6 percent, Gasiorowski said. If the GOP legislation becomes law, only four of the district’s schools would remain eligible, she said. Gasiorowski, whose school district lies just outside of Rokita’s congressional district, said that change would make a “huge impact” for the students and families.“It’s hard to take something away once you’ve given that to people and your families have come to rely on that service,” Gasiorowski said. “I think it’s a terrible disservice to our families.”Rokita, for his part, doesn’t see the problem.In an op-ed provided to HuffPost ahead of Wednesday’s markup on his legislation, Rokita asserted that his proposal “in no way alters the eligibility requirements for students who receive free or reduced priced lunches.” He went on to describe the existing rules for the community eligibility provision as “perverse” and said savings would be used to increase reimbursement for the national breakfast program.“Ensuring that students in actual need have these strong protections in place is how we the people should judge our success, not by how much paperwork an administrator has to do or how much money a school can make off of the entire school population,” Rokita wrote.Robert Campbell, director of nutrition assistance and budget policy at hunger nonprofit Feeding America, pointed out that an identified student population of 40 percent or 60 percent from families receiving assistance doesn’t accurately count students who need free lunches.A multiplier of 1.6 is applied to a district’s identified student population to arrive at a better estimate. That means more students would be affected by the change than a straightforward percentage might suggest.“We want to make sure that any reauthorization that moves forward sticks to the principle of first doing no harm,” Campbell told HuffPost.The Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit science advocacy group, also opposes the bill. Karen Perry Stillerman, deputy director of the group's food and environment program, said the community eligibility provision was of deep concern.“We know that children’s health is dependent on a healthy diet and that starts at school,” Perry Stillerman said. “School lunch programs and food programs are part of that equation of increasing kids’ access to healthy foods. What’s important to us is keeping the kids who are already in these programs in these programs.”The Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act expired in September, but its reforms to the national school lunch program continue until Congress reauthorizes it -- which it is not required to do.In January, the Senate Agriculture Committee advanced a child nutrition reauthorization bill in a unanimous, bipartisan vote. The Senate version of the bill did not contain a change to the community eligibility provision."
30,POLITICS,House Panel Votes To Keep Congressional Reports Private,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/appropriations-crs-reports-private_us_573c832ae4b0ef86171ccdb1,"Lawmakers voted against publicly releasing informative, taxpayer-funded reports.",2016-05-18,"Reps. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.), pictured, and Scott Rigell (R-Va.) wanted to make it easier for members of the public to access taxpayer-funded reports from the Congressional Research Service.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/573c9c1c1a00008800c28e78.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In a blow to congressional transparency, the House Appropriations Committee voted against publicly releasing highly informative, taxpayer-funded reports that members use to educate themselves on the issues before Congress.At a time when highly informed voters might seem like a good thing, the Appropriations Committee voted down, 18-32, an amendment from Reps. Mike Quigely (D-Ill.) and Scott Rigell (R-Va.) that would have made it easier for the public to access Congressional Research Service reports.Under current law, CRS reports are made available when a member of CRS staff sends a report out and it finds its way online. In practice, lobbyists and private legislative tracking companies get their hands on the reports as soon as members do, while private citizens remain largely unaware that these detailed, nonpartisan reports even exist.""You know what the public's saying: 'What are you basing your decisions? Why are you doing this? What are you spending our money on?'"" Quigley said Tuesday during committee debate. ""In many cases, here we are, putting out reports that we're spending $100 million a year on, and we're telling the public, 'Oh, you don't have access to them.'""Quigley said a ""cottage industry"" has cropped up to resell CRS reports that taxpayers are already paying for, but aren't getting widespread access to.""It's time to elevate the debate in this country and allow the public to access the same neutral, unbiased, nonpartisan information that we in Congress rely on every day,"" Quigley said.But the chairman of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee, Rep. Tom Graves (R-Ga.), argued that members needed to be ""really, really careful with this."" He noted that CRS was an arm of Congress, and he didn't want members to be afraid to ask CRS to prepare reports on controversial issues for fear that their requests would become public.Never mind that the amendment explicitly states this legislation would not apply to reports prepared for individual members of Congress at their request, only to reports that CRS prepares for all members.Rigell responded to Graves' criticism by noting that he had spoken to administrators at the Library of Congress who said reports prepared for all members were already being made available to lobbyists and special interest groups, who find out about them as soon as they're released to members.But the ranking Democrat on the Legislative Branch Subcommittee, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), said that wasn't the case. She also said making the reports widely available would slow down the information getting to members.""I have serious concerns about changing the role that the Congressional Research Service plays,"" Wasserman Schulz said, arguing that it would not help members to have CRS go through a ""long and arduous approval process.""In the video above, debate for the CRS amendment starts at 2:38:00.Yet as open government advocate Daniel Schuman noted in a post on Medium, CRS reports already go through ""an arduous, multi-stage review process because they know the reports will become publicly available.""Ultimately, the full committee voted down the amendment in a roughly party-line vote. All Democrats -- with the exception of Wasserman Schultz and Reps. Nita Lowey (N.Y.), Jose Serrano (N.Y.), Sanford Bishop (Ga.), and Betty McCollum (Minn.) -- voted for the measure. All Republicans -- with the exception of Rigell and Reps. Kevin Yoder (Kan.) and David Young (Iowa) -- voted against it.The committee also voted down a second amendment from Quigley that would have simply allowed a list of the names of the reports to be published online, with the expectation that a voter who wanted to read a report could contact his or her member of Congress.Again, Graves and Wasserman Schultz opposed the amendment.Graves said he was against it ""for the same reasons as before,"" and Wasserman Schultz called the amendment ""the nose under the camel's tent.""Quigley, visibly frustrated that members would oppose even publishing the names of CRS reports, summed up Wasserman Schultz's argument this way:""The nose? Respectfully, if you let the public know a little bit, they're going to want a whole bunch?"" Quigley asked incredulously. ""Yuck."""

The 21-year-old Los Angeles Rams running back enjoyed a sensational rookie season in 2015, amassing over 1,100 yards rushing in just 13 games while earning a Second-Team All-Pro selection and AP Offensive Rookie of the Year honors.In doing so, the Baltimore native set an NFL record by running for 566 yards in his first four career starts. The Huffington Post caught up with Gurley, the 10th pick in last year's draft, to discuss the Rams' move to L.A., why player safety isn't so simple and how he grew to appreciate Kobe Bryant.Please note that this interview was conducted before the NFL Draft, and before the Rams selected Jared Goff first overall.You are working on a meaningful project with Kelley Blue Book to inspire safe driving for youth. Did you have a friend or family member that was in a bad car crash?Oh yeah for sure. In high school, one of my close friends [fell asleep at the wheel] and passed away in a car accident driving back on the way home. I have another friend who’s in college now, a couple of weeks ago the same kind of incident happened. Going home, driving, falls asleep, and he got thrown out of the car. I feel like it’s definitely an important issue to speak on, that it can happen to anyone. Because it can.You sustained a serious knee injury in college. Did that affect the way you look at something like this, in terms of how quickly the routine can be taken away? Oh yeah most definitely. Like you said, growing up everyone thinks that they’re Superman, and the next thing you know, the next day I can’t even lift my knee up. It definitely put life in perspective and makes you appreciate things a lot more.What has been the best, most enduring piece of advice that you’ve received since you were drafted? I’d say the main thing that older players and coaches tell you is ""do what got you here,"" and just keep working hard. Surround yourself with good people.What has been the preparation for you this summer, as compared to last year when you were getting ready to be drafted and were still dealing with the injury? Yeah, it’s funny, Case [Keenum], our quarterback, was just saying ""Man, you’re a lot further along than you were last year at this time."" Last year I was doing all that rehab, misdirection stuff. So I’ve had a chance to have a real offseason, rest my body, and now I’m back moving around and doing a lot more stuff than I was able to do last year because of my knee injury.Despite the injury and despite missing the first four games, you enjoyed tremendous success. What is the next step for your progression as a dominant player in this league?My biggest thing I say is: I play running back, that’s what I do is run the ball. So I can definitely get better at a lot of things, especially without me having the ball, whether it’s play-faking or pass protecting, getting out on my routes faster, getting out of the backfield -- anything without the ball. Three rookies earned Pro Bowl nods -- one of them was Marcus Peters, then you were the other along with Tyler Lockett in Seattle. It's rare to find success so early. We as fans hear the same thing all the time: the speed of the game is dramatically different. Holes simply are not there. How is that the case?Oh it definitely changed tremendously. Like you said, the holes are there but they’re only there for a quick second. I tell everybody else that it’s the best of the best.Are the hits different then as well?They’re different, but you kind of get used to getting hit being a running back.The franchise has moved to L.A. What are some of the earliest differences you’ve noticed in L.A.? Like, are you seeing Rams gear already? A couple of places, yeah. I don’t think they’re everywhere yet, but we’ll get them there.Will you miss St. Louis?I don’t know, man. I chilled there, I liked St. Louis but there’s not much to do. The fans and the people were good.How is your comfort level in terms of understanding the offense? I’m more of a guy I have to get my reps. I can get it from the book, but once you get in the game and stuff is coming full speed, a lot of things change. I’m more of a guy who has to practice and actually visualize it, and be in there and get those reps.How did it put the game in perspective when you were not able to play?In the NFL you definitely appreciate the game a lot more. You definitely want to play every play like it’s your last, especially when you’ve been through that situation before and you already know it. When you’re running that ball you want to make sure you run it hard to protect yourself. It’s football, injuries happen and I don’t even think about injuries when I’m playing, because you know that’s just a part of the game.With the emphasis that the league has put on player safety, how have you noticed defensive players attempting to alter their style?I don’t know. I think it’s very hard, especially when you have defensive guys going full speed. Then the quarterback throws the ball, and the league expects the guys to just stop on a dime. It’s not that simple. You don’t want to keep the defensive players from being aggressive. Yeah, there are some guys that hold back on it, but at the end of the day it’s football.Now that you're in L.A., have you watched Kobe at all?I did grow up a hoops fan. It’s funny, and people are probably going to hate me, but for a while I didn’t actually like Kobe at first because he was so good. Eventually I was like ""Man this dude is good,"" so I didn’t have any choice but to like him. I’m a big Carmelo fan and a Duke fan, so I grew up watching those guys.You said Duke? You know, Kobe said if he didn’t go to the NBA he was going to Duke.Exactly. Who wouldn’t play for the best coach in Coach K?What is the one individual goal you want to accomplish?I try not to get too caught up in the goals, but of course everybody wants to be the leading rusher.

33,POLITICS,Congressional Hearing Goof Pulls Back The Curtain On How Washington Really Works,Jeffrey Young,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congressional-hearing-medicare_us_573c9202e4b0646cbeebaeaf,Here's a hint: It was lobbyists.,2016-05-18,"Marcia Boyle, president of the Immune Deficiency Foundation, speaks at a House subcommittee hearing on May 17.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/573cbb79130000d605382183.png?ops=crop_484_68_1117_934%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Everyone knows Washington can be a virtual echo chamber, but a pair of witnesses at a congressional hearing this week took things a little too far.Two experts called to speak about a controversial Medicare regulation submitted written testimony to a House subcommittee Tuesday that included identical and near-identical passages outlining their opposition to a plan that would cut how much physicians get paid to administer medicines to patients in their offices.It's usual for witnesses on the same side of an issue to share a point of view. It's not normal for them to use the exact same words to articulate it.So how did this happen? Not surprisingly, lobbyists were involved.In theory, congressional hearings are an opportunity for experts to provide perspectives on important issues facing the Republic, and for lawmakers and citizens to learn more about complex subjects and to enable them to make informed decisions on policy matters.As Tuesday's goof reveals, these hearings mostly turn out to be yet another venue for partisan posturing and big-money lobbying fights to play out.A lobbying firm called Hart Health Strategies does business with the organizations both witnesses represented. ""Both of our clients were asked to testify at yesterday's hearing. We inadvertently merged the process parts of both testimonies. It was merely a clerical error,"" Vicki Hart, the lobbying firm's president, wrote in an email to The Huffington Post. The witnesses in this case were Marcia Boyle, president of the Immune Deficiency Foundation, and Michael Schweitz, a Florida-based rheumatologist who spoke on behalf of the Alliance of Specialty Medicine and the Coalition of State Rheumatology Organizations. The rheumatology group is part of the Alliance for Specialty Medicine, which is a Hart Health Strategies client along with the Immune Deficiency Foundation. The matching passages appeared in the written testimony each presented.The Immune Deficiency Foundation, Coalition of State Rheumatology Organizations and Schweitz didn't respond to requests for comment. Vicki Hart is listed as the contact for the Alliance for Specialty Medicine on that organization's website.Hart Health Strategies also represents the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the drug industry's main trade group, which is spending millions to lobby against the Medicare policy President Barack Obama's administration has proposed.The pharmaceutical industry and allied medical and patient organizations have been fighting the proposed changes in how Medicare pays for drugs delivered by physicians in their offices tooth and nail, and have gotten large numbers of lawmakers in both parties to go along with it.Rep. Larry Bucshon (R-Ind.) authored a bill to kill the proposal, and some Democrats have asked the administration to delay or scale it back.Other Democrats, backed by consumer groups like the AARP and the Medicare Rights Center, Aetna and other health insurers, and big labor unions including AFL-CIO, have sided with the administration.Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), who backs the Medicare plan, remarked on the oddity during the hearing.So did Charles Ornstein, a reporter at ProPublica. Two sections of each witness's testimony are nearly the same, and Ornstein helpfully highlighted one relevant portion on Twitter.  Houston Chronicle reporter Markian Hawryluk and the New York Times' Margot Sanger-Katz soon figured out this wasn't the first time some of the language in question appeared. The Immune Deficiency Foundation used it in a May 5 letter to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and it also showed up in an undated post on the Alliance for Specialty Medicine website. The Republican majority of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Health Subcommittee invited the individuals to appear at the hearing. The event largely proved to be a time for the GOP -- and some Democrats -- to criticize the Medicare policy, which Republicans ominously dubbed ""The Obama Administration’s Medicare Drug Experiment."" Schakowsky and other Democrats spoke out in favor of the plan. The rationale behind the proposed Medicare policy -- which probably will take effect in some form no matter what happens in Congress -- is that the current system for paying doctors like cancer and rheumatology specialists for giving drugs to patients encourages them to choose more expensive medicines when cheaper ones would be as effective. The regulation is consistent with recommendations from the independent Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, which counsels Congress on policy.The new policy wouldn't affect prescription drugs purchased at pharmacies and covered by the Medicare Part D drug benefit. Instead, it targets the $20 billion a year Medicare spends on medicines doctors must administer themselves, which are paid for by Medicare Part B, which covers physician visits and similar services. Under the current system, doctors get paid the “average sales price” of the medicines plus 6 percent. The new formula would be the price of the drug plus a 2.5 percent markup and a $16.80 per day fee. The plan also would test new models for these payments, such as tying the dollar amounts to how effective the drugs are for patients."

It's not normal for them to use the exact same words to articulate it.So how did this happen? Not surprisingly, lobbyists were involved.In theory, congressional hearings are an opportunity for experts to provide perspectives on important issues facing the Republic, and for lawmakers and citizens to learn more about complex subjects and to enable them to make informed decisions on policy matters.As Tuesday's goof reveals, these hearings mostly turn out to be yet another venue for partisan posturing and big-money lobbying fights to play out.A lobbying firm called Hart Health Strategies does business with the organizations both witnesses represented. ""Both of our clients were asked to testify at yesterday's hearing. We inadvertently merged the process parts of both testimonies. It was merely a clerical error,"" Vicki Hart, the lobbying firm's president, wrote in an email to The Huffington Post. The witnesses in this case were Marcia Boyle, president of the Immune Deficiency Foundation, and Michael Schweitz, a Florida-based rheumatologist who spoke on behalf of the Alliance of Specialty Medicine and the Coalition of State Rheumatology Organizations. The rheumatology group is part of the Alliance for Specialty Medicine, which is a Hart Health Strategies client along with the Immune Deficiency Foundation. The matching passages appeared in the written testimony each presented.The Immune Deficiency Foundation, Coalition of State Rheumatology Organizations and Schweitz didn't respond to requests for comment. Vicki Hart is listed as the contact for the Alliance for Specialty Medicine on that organization's website.Hart Health Strategies also represents the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the drug industry's main trade group, which is spending millions to lobby against the Medicare policy President Barack Obama's administration has proposed.The pharmaceutical industry and allied medical and patient organizations have been fighting the proposed changes in how Medicare pays for drugs delivered by physicians in their offices tooth and nail, and have gotten large numbers of lawmakers in both parties to go along with it.Rep. Larry Bucshon (R-Ind.) authored a bill to kill the proposal, and some Democrats have asked the administration to delay or scale it back.Other Democrats, backed by consumer groups like the AARP and the Medicare Rights Center, Aetna and other health insurers, and big labor unions including AFL-CIO, have sided with the administration.Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), who backs the Medicare plan, remarked on the oddity during the hearing.So did Charles Ornstein, a reporter at ProPublica. Two sections of each witness's testimony are nearly the same, and Ornstein helpfully highlighted one relevant portion on Twitter.  Houston Chronicle reporter Markian Hawryluk and the New York Times' Margot Sanger-Katz soon figured out this wasn't the first time some of the language in question appeared. The Immune Deficiency Foundation used it in a May 5 letter to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and it also showed up in an undated post on the Alliance for Specialty Medicine website. The Republican majority of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Health Subcommittee invited the individuals to appear at the hearing. The event largely proved to be a time for the GOP -- and some Democrats -- to criticize the Medicare policy, which Republicans ominously dubbed ""The Obama Administration’s Medicare Drug Experiment."" Schakowsky and other Democrats spoke out in favor of the plan. The rationale behind the proposed Medicare policy -- which probably will take effect in some form no matter what happens in Congress -- is that the current system for paying doctors like cancer and rheumatology specialists for giving drugs to patients encourages them to choose more expensive medicines when cheaper ones would be as effective. The regulation is consistent with recommendations from the independent Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, which counsels Congress on policy.The new policy wouldn't affect prescription drugs purchased at pharmacies and covered by the Medicare Part D drug benefit. Instead, it targets the $20 billion a year Medicare spends on medicines doctors must administer themselves, which are paid for by Medicare Part B, which covers physician visits and similar services. Under the current system, doctors get paid the “average sales price” of the medicines plus 6 percent. The new formula would be the price of the drug plus a 2.5 percent markup and a $16.80 per day fee. The plan also would test new models for these payments, such as tying the dollar amounts to how effective the drugs are for patients."
