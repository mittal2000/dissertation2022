But the laughs didn't stop there. In what was probably one of the best sketches of the night, Schumer and the SNL cast tackled the issue of gun control with a darkly yet funny mock PSA titled simply ""Guns.""The clip presents a bunch of different scenarios -- a girlfriend waiting for her boyfriend at dinner, a husband taking his pregnant wife to the hospital in a cab, two co-workers talking -- while a voiceover says, ""Whatever you're waiting for, whatever you face, whatever you're looking for, there are things we all share. Love. Family. Connection. A sense of purpose. And also, guns."" Yep. They went there. The voiceover continues: ""Guns are there in little moments and big ones. They unite us, comfort us, bring us joy and strength."" The scenarios play out with the addition of guns. Even the tiny newborn baby gets one. Scary stuff. And then the kicker: ""Guns: We're here to stay."" Also on HuffPost: For a constant stream of entertainment news and discussion, follow HuffPost Entertainment on Viber."
1,ENTERTAINMENT,Donald Trump Thinks Hillary Clinton 'Shouldn't Be Allowed To Run',Kim Bellware,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-shouldnt-be-allowed-to-run_us_561a73f3e4b0dbb8000ee84e,"""I don't think that the Democrats are going to stop her from running because the system is inherently unfair.""",2015-10-11,"That giving your wife ""negotiable assets"" is a terrible mistake.

""I can tell you this: If that were a Republican that did what she did with the emails, they would have been in jail 12 month ago,"" Trump told supporters during the rally in Norcross, Georgia. ""It is a very unfair system."" ""Honestly, she shouldn't be allowed to run. No, she shouldn't be,"" Trump said to huge cheers. ""I don't think that the Democrats are going to stop her from running because the system is inherently unfair.""Neither Trump's nor Clinton's campaign immediately responded to requests for comment. Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state has been the subject of a federal investigation -- and a favorite attack point for Republicans -- since the issue came to light in March. In September, Clinton apologized for the matter and admitted she made a mistake by using a private email account, though she has also deflected on the issue by saying her personal email use was ""allowed by the State Department"" (and that her emails are pretty boring anyway). Trump's Saturday message was a mix of self-aggrandizing statements (praising his wealth, his massive popularity and his incredible good looks), attacks on his foes (Clinton, the media and his fellow Republican candidates) and familiar talking points (issues like Russia, the economy and political donors).As no Trump stump speech would be complete without a mention of the ""great, great wall"" he plans to build on the southern U.S. border, Trump reminded supporters of his plan to quickly erect a wall -- and insisted the Mexican government would foot the bill. ""I love Mexico and I love the Mexican people ... but their leaders are too smart for our leaders,"" Trump said in regard to building a wall. ""Our stupid politicians say, 'That's not possible.' And for them, it's not."" Trump wrapped Saturday's speech by positioning himself as a candidate who could inspire people to get out and vote, and even grab a slice of Clinton's base. ""I think we're going to get a lot of Democrats. I think we're going to get a lot of liberals,"" Trump said. ""They want to see our country get better."" H/T MSNBCAlso on HuffPost:"

3,POLITICS,The Supreme Court Let A Man Die. He Was Executed With The Wrong Drug.,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-oklahoma-death-penalty_us_5616a1a2e4b0dbb8000d7860,The court placed far too much faith in Oklahoma's disastrous lethal injection protocol in January and in June.,2015-10-11,Oklahoma is under fire for using an unapproved drug to execute a man.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=crop_35_35_4625_2828%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"You need five Supreme Court justices to halt an execution. In January, Charles Warner got four. Oklahoma executed him that same day.But the court did something strange eight days later: It agreed to hear Warner's case. For that, you only need four votes. That case, initially docketed as Warner v. Gross, was posthumously renamed Glossip v. Gross, one of the highlights of the last Supreme Court term.No one knows which of the nine justices voted to hear the Warner case, but it was probably the same ones who would have spared his life a week earlier. Dissenting from the one-sentence order that refused to keep Warner alive a little longer, the four justices said a few things about Oklahoma's lethal injection protocol. They were none too pleased.""The questions before us are especially important now, given States' increasing reliance on new and scientifically untested methods of execution,"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in January.Those words now ring prophetic.On Thursday, The Oklahoman revealed that an autopsy report for Warner showed that he had been executed using potassium acetate, a chemical not approved for such use in Oklahoma. The state's drug protocol calls for potassium chloride.The Warner case marks the first time that any state has administered potassium acetate in an execution, according to the nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center. Oklahoma almost used it a second time on Richard Glossip last week, except Gov. Mary Fallin (R) gave him a last-minute stay after state Department of Corrections officials discovered the mix-up involving the wrong drug the day of his execution.An investigation into the errors -- including Warner's execution -- is underway, and all pending Oklahoma executions are on hold until the mess is resolved. A new investigative report published Friday by The Frontier also raised questions about who's truly the boss in Oklahoma's capital system. Could the Supreme Court have foreseen this disaster?In January, Sotomayor and her liberal colleagues on the court sounded the alarm when they said they were ""deeply troubled"" about the evidence Warner and other death row inmates had presented about midazolam, another problematic substance in Oklahoma's three-drug cocktail. They said the evidence suggested that it ""cannot constitutionally be used as the first drug in a three-drug lethal injection protocol."" The justices had doubts about the drug in part because of an earlier botched execution in Oklahoma -- that of Clayton Lockett, which in their words ""went poorly, to say the least.""""Lockett awoke and writhed on the execution table for some time after the drugs had been injected and officials confirmed him to be unconscious,"" Sotomayor continued. ""He was overheard to say, 'Something is wrong,' and, 'The drugs aren’t working.'"" Lockett died some 40 minutes after he received the lethal dose. Warner himself said, ""My body is on fire"" as he was being put to death.Yet in June, the Supreme Court upheld Oklahoma's drug protocol, ruling it did not violate the Constitution. It was a contentious 5-to-4 decision, with the same four justices who would've given Warner a reprieve losing the battle. Sotomayor wrote the principal dissent denouncing Oklahoma's practices, but it was Justice Stephen Breyer who made headlines when he said it is ""highly likely"" the death penalty, as practiced in the United States, is now unconstitutional.The conservative majority was unimpressed. Noting the five-month investigation into Lockett's disastrous execution and the state's new protocol that emerged from it, Justice Samuel Alito observed Oklahoma now had in place ""procedural safeguards to help ensure that an inmate remains insensate to any pain."" He added that Warner was executed in keeping with ""these revised procedures."" We now know that was hardly the case. Worse, the Supreme Court innocently took Oklahoma at its word about the last drug it would use to stop Warner's heart.""In January of this year, Oklahoma executed Warner using these revised procedures and the combination of midazolam, a paralytic agent, and potassium chloride,"" Alito said.As we learned Thursday, that also was not the case.With all this new information, it's unclear how the court might rule if Oklahoma's troubled lethal-injection scheme reaches it again. But there's something to be said about Sotomayor's warning in January about death penalty states' ""increasing reliance on new and scientifically untested methods of execution,"" which now raise the specter that Warner's execution may, in fact, have violated the Eighth Amendment.In a statement Thursday, Charles Ogletree, a Harvard law professor and a prominent death penalty opponent, called on the Department of Justice to investigate Oklahoma's use of the unapproved drug and to look into ""whether any civil or even criminal liability should attach to the homicide of Charles Warner.""For the lawyers attacking Oklahoma's execution drug protocols, the recent developments seem to have lit a new fire.Dale Baich, a federal public defender representing Glossip and other death row inmates, told The Huffington Post it's ""too early to tell"" if a new Supreme Court showdown will result from the new revelations, but he said the fight continues in federal district court.""We fully expect to go to trial,"" Baich said. As for the justices themselves, Glossip continues to be on their minds. During a hearing on Wednesday in an unrelated capital case from Kansas, Justice Antonin Scalia still didn't seem to be over the June decision, let alone his colleague's newfound opposition to the death penalty.""Kansans, unlike our Justice Breyer, do not think the death penalty is unconstitutional and indeed very much favor it,"" Scalia said.Perhaps. But if the recent failures and botched executions in Oklahoma -- and the death penalty chaos elsewhere -- mean anything, maybe the rest of the country and even a majority of the justices will soon be ready to turn a page.Until then, there's one thing we may never know: Why there wasn't a fifth vote at the Supreme Court that would have allowed Warner to make his case.Also on HuffPost:"

He has promised to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and to deport the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants already in the United States.Obama said Trump had tapped into something that ""exists in the Republican Party that's real. I think there is genuine anti-immigrant sentiment in the large portion of at least Republican primary voters.""""He is, you know, the classic reality TV character,"" the Democratic president said, adding it was not surprising Trump had received a lot of attention in the campaign's early stages.Asked if he thought Trump would eventually disappear from the race, Obama replied: ""I'll leave it up to the pundits to make that determination. I don't think he'll end up being president of the United States.""Obama also said in the interview that he did not know about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was his secretary of state but that it did not pose a national security problem.""She made a mistake. She has acknowledged it,"" he said.""I do think that the way it's been ginned up is in part because of politics. And I think she'd be the first to acknowledge that maybe she could have handled the original decision better and the disclosures more quickly.""Discussing Joe Biden's possible entry into the Democratic race, Obama called him one of the finest vice presidents ever and said: ""If you're sitting right next to the president in every meeting and ... wrestling with these issues, I'm sure that for him he's saying to himself: 'I could do a really good job.'""Asked if he thought he himself could be re-elected if not constitutionally barred from a third term, Obama replied: ""Yes.""

The German government still officially expects 800,000 asylum applications in 2015, while media say up to 1.5 million people could come.""Germany will receive more than a million refugees this year,"" Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel told a Social Democratic (SPD) party event in Mainz. It was important, he said, to create the right conditions to ensure Germany could meet the challenge.Reports of violent clashes at refugee shelters and overburdened local communities are deepening public skepticism towards the influx and have weighed on support for Merkel's conservatives, and opened rifts in their ranks.The Emnid poll taken for Bild am Sonntag put support for the governing conservative bloc on 38 percent, down two percentage points since last week and at the lowest level since the last federal election two years ago.At the same time, support for the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) climbed to six percent, the survey of 1,871 voters conducted between Oct. 1 and Oct. 7 showed.Rolf Clement, president of the Federal Criminal Police Office, said in an interview with Deutschlandfunk radio that the number of attacks on refugee homes was on the increase.""In the meantime we've reached 500 - and the numbers continue to rise,"" he said, adding that many of the attacks had been carried out by people with no history of politically-motivated crime.He said the crisis was giving ammunition to rightist groups and said he saw a danger of a potential towards radicalisation.While Merkel has reiterated her mantra ""We can do this,"" she is at loggerheads over her handling of the crisis with Horst Seehofer, head of the Christian Social Union (CSU) which governs Bavaria. The southern German state is the first port of entry for many of the hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants who have streamed into Europe this year to escape war and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and Asia.On Friday, Bavaria threatened to take the German federal government to court if it fails to take immediate steps to limit the flow of asylum seekers into the country.Almost half of those surveyed for the Emnid poll said Merkel has handled the refugee crisis the wrong way, and were divided over whether Germany could overcome the crisis, with 50 percent saying it was possible while 45 percent disagreed.

The strangers “dragged me, beat me, verbally abused me,” Hartoyo recalled in a 2013 interview with 429Magazine. They then called the police.“I get so angry when I remember what happened,” Hartoyo told the BBC. “The police urinated on my head and beat the two of us up.”Hartoyo, a gay rights activist who now lives in Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, said he was tortured for three hours while in custody. He was stripped naked and forced to perform sex acts. Later, he said, he and his boyfriend were intimidated into signing a “contract” vowing that they would no longer engage in sexual activity with each other.“We were treated like animals,” Hartoyo told the Jakarta Post in 2009. Aceh, located on the northern tip of the island of Sumatra, is known for its draconian system of Sharia law.

Though homosexuality isn't technically criminalized under Indonesian law, in many states, such as south Sumatra, anti-prostitution laws (where “prostitution” is widely defined to include same-sex intercourse) are used to limit the rights of LGBT people, and according to activists, the community is marginalized even in bigger cities like Jakarta.“LGBTI people are discriminated against in just about all domains of life,” Dédé Oetomo, founder of Gaya Nusantara, the first LGBT rights organization in the country, tells The Huffington Post. Discrimination even happens in the work place and in schools.Indonesia, which has the world's largest Muslim population, is mostly conservative and society is “very heteronormative,” Oetomo says. “The greatest challenge is still the immediate family.” A 2013 Pew Research Center report about global attitudes towards gays and lesbians found that 93 percent of Indonesians did not believe that homosexuality should be “accepted by society,” making the country one of the least tolerant nations surveyed. A year later, a landmark USAID/UNDP report on LGBT rights in Indonesia found that LGBT individuals are “often prevented from living meaningful lives and are denied opportunities that others take for granted.” “This takes a toll on the individual and the country as it prevents thousands of people from both contributing fully to the development of their country and from enjoying the benefits of development,” UNDP Country Director Beate Trankmann says.Indonesia has one of the worst records in the world when it comes to violence against transgender people, according to activist Mario Pratama.Last year, a group of unidentified assailants attacked attendees of a Transgender Day of Remembrance rally in the city of Yogyakarta.“They dragged, kicked and pushed the rally participants,” Pratama told the Jakarta Post at the time.The attack wasn't unusual. Pratama said that 85 percent of the country’s transgender community had experienced violence between 2011 and 2012. Hardline Islamist activists also target and intimidate LGBT individuals. One of the most vocal anti-gay Muslim groups is the Islamic Defenders Front, known as the FPI in Indonesia. In 2010, a member of the group told the BBC that “gay people are mentally ill.”“God didn't make them that way,"" he added. “They choose to be with people of the same sex and it is a crime in our religion.

But instead of dividing the communities they targeted, news about the rallies strengthened bonds between interfaith allies and inspired numerous acts of community service around the U.S.Grassroots organizers behind the so-called ""Global Rally For Humanity"" used Facebook to encourage ""fellow patriots"" to protest Islam outside their local mosques and Muslim community centers. On some pages, the protests were billed as ""open carry"" events and participants were encouraged to come armed with guns. Although up to 35 Facebook pages were created in support of the rally, according to the anti-bigotry group Center for New Community, the majority of these were deactivated in the days leading up to Friday.And in an extraordinary show of solidarity, interfaith networks in neighborhoods across America and online stepped up to show their support for their Muslim friends.A protest scheduled to happen in front of the Islamic Center of America in Dearborn, Michigan, had to relocate to the grounds of a public library because the organizers hadn't gained a permit, according to Arab American News. Fewer than 10 protestors reportedly showed up, four carrying weapons. Counterprotestors spent time engaging in dialogue with those who seemed to have an anti-Muslim viewpoint. The two groups left after shaking hands. Another rally was scheduled to take place at Masjid Muhammad in Washington, D.C. The Facebook page announcing that event was later taken down. Still, a few interfaith allies attended a Friday prayer service at the mosque to make it clear that they were willing to stand alongside Muslims. Catherine Orsborn, director of the Shoulder to Shoulder interfaith campaign, which aims to end anti-Muslim bigotry, was one of the leaders who attended the prayers. Other than a security protocol leaflet inserted into the program, she said the service went on as planned and the community didn't seem to be on edge.""The sermon wasn't about the protests, it was about freedom, justice and equality,"" Orsborn told The Huffington Post. ""There was a fish lunch afterwards outside the masjid -- I'm pretty sure if any protestors had shown up, they would have been offered fish, too.""At Seattle's Interfaith Community Sanctuary, Muslims, Jews, Christians and Buddhists participated in joint prayers on Friday. They screened the film ""American Muslims: Facts vs. Fiction,"" which presents information about the Muslim community, from how often Muslims watch television to how often they attend religious prayer services. Imam Jamal Rahman, co-founder of the sanctuary, called the gathering ""remarkable.""""In particular, the Muslims in the group were profoundly touched by the extraordinary expressions of support and unity by their non-Muslim brothers and sisters. All of us experienced a deep kinship of spirit,"" Rahman, a Muslim Sufi minister, told HuffPost. On Saturday, the Spokane Interfaith Council in Washington organized a potluck dinner at their local Islamic center. A similar interfaith community dinner is being organized at an Islamic center in Louisville, Kentucky, to ""celebrate the ideals of anti-racism and anti-bigotry.""The rallies also inspired the Council on American-Islamic Relations to launch a nationwide voter registration drive.In Spring Hill, Florida, Muslim doctors planned to offer free checkups to anyone who walked into the Crescent Community Clinic on Saturday. Michigan's Muslim Community Council directed Muslims and their interfaith allies to avoid counterprotests and instead commit to serving the community. Volunteers planned to distribute clothing and school supplies to people in need at the Muslim Center in Detroit. Others signed up to plant trees and organize a youth dialogue on politics and social justice. Online, supporters rallied under the hashtags #HateUnchecked and #LoveYourNeighbor.Dr. Sayyid Syeed, national director of interfaith and community alliances at the Islamic Society of North America, said in a statement released to HuffPost that he was reassured and encouraged by those who were determined to show their support for Muslims during this time.“We are proud of our allies from different faiths who have been our partners in dialogue over the years and stand with us against fear and hate,” he said.

Today, we speak with Charlie Winter, senior researcher at the Quilliam Foundation, a counter-extremism think tank.The Islamic State militant group produces a lot of propaganda, advertising the brutality of its punishments and promising an idyllic life in areas under its control with a steady stream of videos, photos and even music.The Quilliam Foundation, a U.K.-based counter-extremism think tank, has been digging into the strategy behind the propaganda. This week, the foundation released a report analyzing 1,146 pieces of propaganda that were produced by the group between July 17 and Aug. 15, the Islamic month of Shawwal.The WorldPost spoke to Charlie Winter, the author of the report and a senior researcher in transnational jihadism at the foundation, about what his findings reveal about the group. How does ISIS manage to produce such a large volume of high quality media? It's very clear that a huge amount of resources are being expended in creating all of this output and making sure that it sends the right message, sticks to the brand and toes the line. That's evident of the fact that propaganda is very close to the heart of what the Islamic State is trying to do. Its information operations campaign is chief among its primary concerns. It needs to consolidate in the territories that it's controlling right now, and a key way to do that is by producing a huge amount of propaganda and limiting the information that people within the region have.How many people do you think are engaged in this effort?Other than a lot, I don't know. I think that's a question that's at the forefront of everyone's minds who's involved in researching the propaganda of the Islamic State. We know who the group's key leaders are and some of the key military figures, but there's a dearth of information available on open sources about who the mid-level guys are and how they engage with the broader operations. What mediums does ISIS mostly use for its propaganda?Over the Internet, propaganda is disseminated mostly via Twitter. Videos will be uploaded onto other platforms and from there the link is circulated around the Internet. It's really important that we realize that propaganda isn't just being consumed by people on the Internet, it's also being handed around -- literally by hand -- in the form of electronic magazines and newspapers to a civilian population living in any Islamic State-held territories. We only really hear about online propaganda because that's seen as the chief agent of recruitment and radicalization for foreign fighters, but their propaganda is very important offline in the territories they control.What types of content did you find to be most common?Predominantly, it's photo essays. These are not just individual photos floating around that were taken spontaneously, but a set of between five and 15 photos that have been put together with a purpose in mind.For example, on the first day of the survey for this report, the Islamic State's official media office in Raqqa province [in Syria] released a photo report called ""Games on the day of Eid"" in the city of Tabqa. This wasn't just a photo of some random game, taken haphazardly and then put onto the Internet as it was. It was a set of photos that had been taken through a post-production process: branded and then put through filters so they're given the right kind of light, to maximize their effectivity. It was clearly something that had been choreographed, as there were a lot of people playing games. The propagandists are trying to convey a sense that it's only in the Islamic State's caliphate that Eid is so pristine and enjoyable and holy, as Islam is being implemented so thoroughly in this place. That's just one photo report out of 696 throughout the duration of the survey.You mention in the report that some of ISIS' military propaganda appears to be staged. So, their propaganda about civilian life in the territories they control is tightly choreographed also?I think that everything is very deliberate and everything is choreographed. While some of the photo reports might look very natural, there has still been a decision behind [them] to create propaganda about this event -- whether it's children having fun on a water slide, or a gay man being thrown off a tower and stoned to death. I think we have to recognize that none of this is really spontaneous. Another example is the stream of economic activity propaganda -- stories about stonemasons' workshops or goldsmiths or markets. All of these are selling a very specific message that the lands that the Islamic State controls are lands of plenty. Of course, there isn't abundant food in these territories, as the propagandists would have us believe. Who is this propaganda targeted at? There are many different target audiences, including supporters and enemies of the group. Their targets include governments [from the U.S.-led coalition bombing IS], local governments, international publics, local publics, people in Syria and Iraq who are outside Islamic State-controlled territories and so on. There are also many different layers to the supporters they target -- whether it's potential supporters or potential recruits, disseminators or potential propagandists.What are the main aims of the propaganda? To enemies, and especially to international publics, they want to draw attention to their cause, their military ventures and their general menace to the rest of the world. For recruiters, the propaganda acts as a sort of evidence base with which they can back up their claims. For people living in the region, they are attempting to serve as a reminder that life goes on -- while there are daily airstrikes and people getting their hands cut off and being stoned as punishment, it's all geared around the caliphate cause and does have a purpose.Has their propaganda changed over time?We have seen a shift from the international to the regional in the last few months. There's been a slight diversion from trying to provoke international outrage to deterring dissent and rebellion within the region with public executions of alleged spies or conspirators with IS adversaries. I think that's because IS' priority is now, above all else, to securitize and stabilize the area that they've created a level of hegemony over.Over the course of the last year there's also been a very concerted effort to make everything look more professional, more uniform, more centralized, more effective. In the first few days of the study there was a new set of iconography and fonts rolled out by all of the propaganda offices of the Islamic State in sync with each other. The way that the propaganda is framed makes it look like [the Islamic State] has the same sort of institutions in place from West Africa to Afghanistan.What would an effective counter-strategy to ISIS propaganda look like?We need to recognize that there's no one counter-narrative that will undercut Islamic State's whole information operation. If we focus only on responding and reacting to individual cases of brutality or individual acts that Islamic State carries out we're structurally impairing ourselves from meaningful progress. We need to create our own alternative set of narratives and values and develop them into something that captures people's imagination and they want to believe in and promote.For example, rather than responding to the Islamic State by saying that they kill more Muslims than anyone else, or aren't real Muslims, we could drive home what the international community is doing in response to [Syrian President] Bashar Assad or the refugee crisis. We need to focus on what our own image is as much as we need to focus on countering or responding to the Islamic State.In my opinion the information war on the Islamic State is just as important -- if not more important -- than any physical war on the group. It's the information side of things and the politics of the region that's fueling Islamic State successes and driving people to join or leave the group.

11,RELIGION,"In Major Shift, Rabbinical School Allows Students With Non-Jewish Partners","Lauren Markoe, Religion News Service",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/reconstructionist-rabbinical-college-non-jewish-partners_us_560c63f5e4b076812700bae6,A big win for interfaith couples.,2015-10-11,"Reconstructionist Rabbinical College President Deborah Waxman, center right, speaks with students.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/560c663f180000520083169c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(RNS) The rabbinical college of the Reconstructionist stream of Judaism has revoked its “non-Jewish partner” policy, becoming the first major Jewish movement to welcome seminary students who are in committed relationships with non-Jews.“Today’s announcement is a decision by our faculty about what should or should not hold someone back from becoming a rabbi,” said Reconstructionist Rabbinical College President Deborah Waxman, of last week’s faculty vote, which was announcedWednesday (Sept. 30.)“Our deliberations, heavily influenced through consultation with alumni, congregations and students, have simultaneously led us to reaffirm that all rabbinical candidates must model commitment to Judaism in their communal, personal and family lives,” said Waxman. “We witness Jews with non-Jewish partners demonstrating these commitments every day in many Jewish communities.”Reconstructionism, the smallest of the major movements in American Judaism — after the Reform, Conservative and Orthodox — includes about 100 affiliated synagogues in North America. But it has long taken a leading role in changing Jewish minds on cultural issues, particularly those involving women and gays. Based in Wyncote, Pa., outside Philadelphia, Reconstructionists were the first to celebrate girls’ bat mitzvahs, a coming-of-age ceremonies previously reserved for boys.The debate over the “non-Jewish partners” policy within the school, also in Wyncote, Pa., began more than two years ago and included discussions of Jewish law, studies of Jewish demographic trends and consultations with Reconstructionist rabbis. The faculty’s vote to change the school’s policy — Waxman would not reveal the actual number who approved and disapproved of the change — affects both incoming students and those already enrolled in the school.The revoked policy had stated: “The RRC does not ordinarily admit or graduate as a rabbi a student married to, or in a committed relationship with, a non-Jew.”Though the school graduates, on average, eight to 10 students a year, and the policy change may affect few personally, it is based in principle, said Waxman, and should inform the debate on Jews and interfaith relationships beyond the college.The subject of intermarriage is particularly touchy within the Jewish community, given that one-third of the world’s Jewish population — now around 14 million — was lost in the Holocaust and because intermarriage for American Jews now approaches 60 percent. Studies, including the Pew Research Center’s 2013 Portrait of American Jews, show that, as a group, children of intermarried couples are far more likely to shed their Jewish identities compared with the offspring of couples where both partners are Jewish.The debate over intermarriage extends to the Reform movement — which accounts for about 35 percent of U.S. Jews — and where it is up to an individual rabbi to decide whether to officiate at the marriage of an interfaith couple. Conservative rabbis are prohibited from officiating at interfaith marriages, though a few have said they would like to. Neither Reform nor Conservative seminaries allow their students to be in committed relationships with non-Jews. In both streams of Judaism, gay marriages are blessed.Orthodox Judaism prohibits both gay and interfaith marriage.Rabbi Mychal Copeland, who graduated from RRC in 2000, is now married to a Jewish woman with whom she was in a serious relationship when she was in rabbinical school. Copeland wishes her spouse could have converted without RRC’s old “no Jewish partners” policy forcing the issue.She is glad for its revocation.“RRC’s policy change recognizes that leaders who are part of religiously diverse families could be the best models for other interfaith families exploring Jewish life,” said Copeland, who heads InterfaithFamily/Bay Area, which helps deepen Jewish practice within families where one partner is not Jewish.“A rabbi’s choice of partner does not reflect that leader’s religious life or commitment to Judaism,” Copeland continued. “Welcoming such rabbis sends a message to the large numbers of Jews partnered with people of different backgrounds that they, too, can lead rich and meaningful Jewish lives without feeling like second-class citizens.”Said Rabbi Waxman: “The issue of Jews intermarrying is no longer something we want to police; we want to welcome Jews and the people who love us to join us in the very difficult project of bringing meaning, justice and hope into our world.”Also on HuffPost:"

For the next nine days, we'll be telling the stories of each country in the region. There will be a new one each day. Scroll to read them. ***SINGAPORE -- “No one cares about Southeast Asia,” LGBT activist Jean Chong says, her eyes downcast as she lets out a small mirthless laugh. “The western world -- they find it hard to comprehend how backward we are when it comes to LGBT and human rights. They don’t understand the sophistication of oppression here.” Chong is based in Singapore, one of four Southeast Asian nations where it is illegal to be gay. One of the four Asian Tigers, Singapore -- with its towering skyscrapers and affluent, well-educated population -- may be one of the richest countries in the world, but when it comes to LGBT rights, it has an appalling record. Chong says it's become a “leader” in limiting, rather than protecting, the rights of its people.“Singapore is a case study of what happens when you have economic success without human rights,” Chong, who is a co-founder of the LGBT rights organization Sayoni, says. “And what’s disturbing is how a lot of countries, like China and Laos and Russia, now want to copy Singapore's model.”Sayoni has been documenting cases of abuse and discrimination against Singapore's LGBT community over the last few years. It's the first time that such a project has been undertaken here, and Chong says she's been “shocked” by what they've uncovered. “It’s been quite emotional,” she says. Dressed in black on a sticky September afternoon, Chong has an easy, open demeanor. Her eyes smile behind her silver-rimmed spectacles. She speaks evenly, and without anger, about the challenging work she does -- lobbying lawmakers and trying to change unwilling hearts. At the end of our meeting at a downtown cafe, she envelops me in a warm embrace. Yet, when asked to share stories from the people she met during the project, her shoulders stiffen and her voice quavers. “There’s so much abuse that’s being underreported, especially within the family,” she says. “There are cases of so-called ‘corrective’ rape, or kids becoming homeless after being kicked out. One girl told me she was raped by her brother's friend but when she told her parents, they said she had ‘deserved it’ because she was a lesbian. There have been all kinds of horror stories. Violence has just become so normalized.” Chong says she regularly faces discrimination in public. “I look tomboyish and there’s a lot of gender-policing,” she says. “I have people who will just walk up to me and tell me I should get beaten up. Non-conformity disturbs people.” Stories like these, Chong says, are unfortunately not unique to Singapore. The rejection of the LGBT community is endemic across Southeast Asia (defined for the purposes of this article as the 10 member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN). The countries may be vastly different in their politics, economy, culture and history -- from communist Vietnam to Sharia-ruled Brunei to Myanmar, which is struggling to open itself to the world after years of oppressive rule -- but they all share at least one problematic trait. “If you look at Brunei, Singapore, Malaysia, Myanmar, and also Laos, it’s very backward when it comes to LGBT rights … but even in the other, more ‘progressive’ countries, there are problems. Butch women are being killed in rural areas in Thailand, trans women are being targeted in the Philippines,” Chong says. At the time of writing, homosexuality remains criminalized in Brunei, which abides by strict Sharia law, and countries like Singapore, Malaysia and Myanmar continue to adhere to an antiquated colonial-era law that bans same-sex intercourse. When enforced, the punishment for being gay in these countries can be severe, including: being stoned to death, whipped, or thrown in prison. Other than Thailand, which just this month announced the enactment of a groundbreaking Gender Equality Law, ASEAN countries currently don't have anti-discrimination laws to guarantee equality of all citizens, regardless of their sexual orientation and gender identity. Thailand still does not have legislation protecting persons based on sexual orientation. The new law only protects against discrimination on the grounds of gender expression.Gay marriage is illegal in all the ASEAN countries, and none of them has offered legal recognition or protection for same-sex partnerships, including civil unions. Same-sex couples across the region aren't entitled to adopt children. And in many countries, it is difficult, if not impossible, for single women to access in vitro fertilization and related fertility treatments and services.Similarly, access to services such as gender-confirmation surgery or hormone therapy for transgender people is limited. Changing one’s gender designation is also a challenge in most of ASEAN.As a result of these repressive legal and policy frameworks, the abuse and marginalization of LGBT persons is a pervasive problem across the region. A U.S. Marine is currently on trial for the murder of a trans woman in the Philippines. He has admitted to “choking” her to death in a motel after discovering that she had male genitalia. Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim is serving a five-year prison term after he was convicted of sodomy, which is illegal in the country. And last August, a member of parliament in Myanmar said the government was “constantly taking action” to have “the gays” detained by police. “Discrimination is a common thread, going through LGBTI lives throughout [ASEAN],” Edmund Settle, a policy advisor for the United Nations Development Programme, tells The Huffington Post from his office in Bangkok.Settle is one of the coordinators of a recent landmark project spearheaded by the UNDP and the U.S. Agency for International Development, which analyzed the state of LGBT rights in parts of Asia. Several Southeast Asian countries, including Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines, were included in the study. The findings were alarming.Social stigma and discrimination were found to be limiting job and education opportunities, as well as access to healthcare for LGBT people in all the ASEAN countries studied. Bullying and other forms of abuse and harassment were also found to be widespread.“[ASEAN] countries are also really limiting civil society space. This lack of space for civic engagement limits the ability to organize, mobilize and advocate,” Settle says. “This is hampering efforts to improve the state of rights.”Activists in the region say their main priorities are pushing for greater visibility for the LGBT community, and also for the enactment of national anti-discrimination legislation in all countries.Such legislation is critical in the region, Chong says, “because so far ASEAN nations have very poor promotion and protection of human rights.”Chong is one of the leaders of the ASEAN Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Gender Expression Caucus, an activist collective that’s urging regional leaders to include the network in ASEAN Human Rights Mechanisms, including the association’s Human Rights Declaration. Except for Brunei and Laos, the caucus includes activist groups from all the ASEAN countries.Regional LGBT groups are working double-time in an effort to push for these legal protections, according to Ging Cristobal, a Manila-based activist with OutRight Action International and another leader of the Caucus. The need is desperate, she says.“I always emphasize that every day we don’t protect LGBT people, some of us die, some of us turn to sex work because we don’t have the skills or access to better employment, some of us turn to illegal work to live,” Cristobal says. The challenges facing the activist community, however, are immense. Across the region, there are major issues of authoritarianism, corruption and political instability, not to mention an entrenched disregard for human rights.Still, as with fights of equality through history and the world over, regional activists are determined to make a difference. “Activists are working assiduously across ASEAN,” Kyle Knight, an LGBT rights researcher at Human Rights Watch, tells HuffPost. “They’re going up against these great obstacles, either explicit ones in the case of colonial-era laws or implicit in the form of discrimination. These are incredibly courageous people.” Scroll down to read each part of this series. We'll be unveiling a new one every day. Aceh, located on the northern tip of the island of Sumatra, is known for its draconian system of Sharia law. It has a population of 4.7 million and is the only province in Indonesia where homosexuality is illegal. According to a December Reuters report, the LGBT community has been forced “into hiding” there.Earlier this year, the deputy mayor of Banda Aceh, the province’s capital, labeled homosexuality “a social disease that should be eradicated.” The province, however, is hardly the only place in Indonesia where it's unsafe to be LGBT.CONTINUE READING. Last October, a transgender woman named Jennifer Laude was found dead inside a motel room in Olongapo City, Philippines. Motel staff found her naked body on the floor of the bathroom, her head leaning on the rim of the toilet bowl. U.S. Marine Joseph Scott Pemberton admitted in August to strangling the woman. The 19-year-old said in court that he was “repulsed” and “feared he would be raped” after discovering that Laude was transgender. That fear, he said, prompted him to “subdue” her in self-defense.He later allegedly told a fellow Marine: “I think I killed a he/she.”LGBT activist Corky Hope Maranan told the Associated Press last year that the case was one of the worst hate crimes she has seen.“This is just so abominable,” she said. CONTINUE READING. Kenneth Chee and Gary Lim have been together for almost two decades, but in the eyes of the law they're criminals.The couple met by chance at a shopping mall in Singapore in 1997. “I guess my ‘gaydar’ went off,” Chee recalls. “I just went up to him and asked him for his number.” They’ve been inseparable ever since.“If gay marriage was legal here, we would get married in a heartbeat,” Lim says. Chee, by his side, nods in agreement.But gay marriage is not legal in Singapore. Same-sex civil partnerships are also not recognized, and there are no laws that protect against discrimination on the grounds of gender expression or sexual orientation. CONTINUE READING. When Meas Sophanuth started to transition in high school, his mother -- afraid that her child would bring shame to the family -- tried to stop what she saw as his “unnatural” behavior.She took away his phone, kept him at home, and forbade him from seeing his friends. She finally took her son to a traditional healer, known in Cambodia as a Kru Khmer, in the hope that the shaman would be able to “cure” him.It was a traumatic experience, Sophanuth, who identifies as transgender, told the Phnom Penh Post last year. “After that, I did not feel warm to my parents anymore. They frightened me,” he said.Such attempts at “curing” are not uncommon in Cambodia, where LGBT people are often seen as being mentally ill or as being possessed with “bad spirits.”CONTINUE READING. In Brunei, being gay could soon be punishable by death.But that hasn't always been the case. Homosexuality has long been a criminal offense in the country, which is located on the island of Borneo. But while the punishment was previously 10 years in prison, the oil-rich sultanate announced last year that it was introducing a three-phased plan to impose Islamic Sharia law at the national level -- becoming the first Southeast Asian country to do so.

For the next nine days, we'll be telling the stories of each country in the region. There will be a new one each day. Scroll to read them. ***SINGAPORE -- “No one cares about Southeast Asia,” LGBT activist Jean Chong says, her eyes downcast as she lets out a small mirthless laugh. “The western world -- they find it hard to comprehend how backward we are when it comes to LGBT and human rights. They don’t understand the sophistication of oppression here.” Chong is based in Singapore, one of four Southeast Asian nations where it is illegal to be gay. One of the four Asian Tigers, Singapore -- with its towering skyscrapers and affluent, well-educated population -- may be one of the richest countries in the world, but when it comes to LGBT rights, it has an appalling record. Chong says it's become a “leader” in limiting, rather than protecting, the rights of its people.“Singapore is a case study of what happens when you have economic success without human rights,” Chong, who is a co-founder of the LGBT rights organization Sayoni, says. “And what’s disturbing is how a lot of countries, like China and Laos and Russia, now want to copy Singapore's model.”Sayoni has been documenting cases of abuse and discrimination against Singapore's LGBT community over the last few years. It's the first time that such a project has been undertaken here, and Chong says she's been “shocked” by what they've uncovered. “It’s been quite emotional,” she says. Dressed in black on a sticky September afternoon, Chong has an easy, open demeanor. Her eyes smile behind her silver-rimmed spectacles. She speaks evenly, and without anger, about the challenging work she does -- lobbying lawmakers and trying to change unwilling hearts. At the end of our meeting at a downtown cafe, she envelops me in a warm embrace. Yet, when asked to share stories from the people she met during the project, her shoulders stiffen and her voice quavers. “There’s so much abuse that’s being underreported, especially within the family,” she says. “There are cases of so-called ‘corrective’ rape, or kids becoming homeless after being kicked out. One girl told me she was raped by her brother's friend but when she told her parents, they said she had ‘deserved it’ because she was a lesbian. There have been all kinds of horror stories. Violence has just become so normalized.” Chong says she regularly faces discrimination in public. “I look tomboyish and there’s a lot of gender-policing,” she says. “I have people who will just walk up to me and tell me I should get beaten up. Non-conformity disturbs people.” Stories like these, Chong says, are unfortunately not unique to Singapore. The rejection of the LGBT community is endemic across Southeast Asia (defined for the purposes of this article as the 10 member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN). The countries may be vastly different in their politics, economy, culture and history -- from communist Vietnam to Sharia-ruled Brunei to Myanmar, which is struggling to open itself to the world after years of oppressive rule -- but they all share at least one problematic trait. “If you look at Brunei, Singapore, Malaysia, Myanmar, and also Laos, it’s very backward when it comes to LGBT rights … but even in the other, more ‘progressive’ countries, there are problems. Butch women are being killed in rural areas in Thailand, trans women are being targeted in the Philippines,” Chong says. At the time of writing, homosexuality remains criminalized in Brunei, which abides by strict Sharia law, and countries like Singapore, Malaysia and Myanmar continue to adhere to an antiquated colonial-era law that bans same-sex intercourse. When enforced, the punishment for being gay in these countries can be severe, including: being stoned to death, whipped, or thrown in prison. Other than Thailand, which just this month announced the enactment of a groundbreaking Gender Equality Law, ASEAN countries currently don't have anti-discrimination laws to guarantee equality of all citizens, regardless of their sexual orientation and gender identity. Thailand still does not have legislation protecting persons based on sexual orientation. The new law only protects against discrimination on the grounds of gender expression.Gay marriage is illegal in all the ASEAN countries, and none of them has offered legal recognition or protection for same-sex partnerships, including civil unions. Same-sex couples across the region aren't entitled to adopt children. And in many countries, it is difficult, if not impossible, for single women to access in vitro fertilization and related fertility treatments and services.Similarly, access to services such as gender-confirmation surgery or hormone therapy for transgender people is limited. Changing one’s gender designation is also a challenge in most of ASEAN.As a result of these repressive legal and policy frameworks, the abuse and marginalization of LGBT persons is a pervasive problem across the region. A U.S. Marine is currently on trial for the murder of a trans woman in the Philippines. He has admitted to “choking” her to death in a motel after discovering that she had male genitalia. Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim is serving a five-year prison term after he was convicted of sodomy, which is illegal in the country. And last August, a member of parliament in Myanmar said the government was “constantly taking action” to have “the gays” detained by police. “Discrimination is a common thread, going through LGBTI lives throughout [ASEAN],” Edmund Settle, a policy advisor for the United Nations Development Programme, tells The Huffington Post from his office in Bangkok.Settle is one of the coordinators of a recent landmark project spearheaded by the UNDP and the U.S. Agency for International Development, which analyzed the state of LGBT rights in parts of Asia. Several Southeast Asian countries, including Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines, were included in the study. The findings were alarming.Social stigma and discrimination were found to be limiting job and education opportunities, as well as access to healthcare for LGBT people in all the ASEAN countries studied. Bullying and other forms of abuse and harassment were also found to be widespread.“[ASEAN] countries are also really limiting civil society space. This lack of space for civic engagement limits the ability to organize, mobilize and advocate,” Settle says. “This is hampering efforts to improve the state of rights.”Activists in the region say their main priorities are pushing for greater visibility for the LGBT community, and also for the enactment of national anti-discrimination legislation in all countries.Such legislation is critical in the region, Chong says, “because so far ASEAN nations have very poor promotion and protection of human rights.”Chong is one of the leaders of the ASEAN Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Gender Expression Caucus, an activist collective that’s urging regional leaders to include the network in ASEAN Human Rights Mechanisms, including the association’s Human Rights Declaration. Except for Brunei and Laos, the caucus includes activist groups from all the ASEAN countries.Regional LGBT groups are working double-time in an effort to push for these legal protections, according to Ging Cristobal, a Manila-based activist with OutRight Action International and another leader of the Caucus. The need is desperate, she says.“I always emphasize that every day we don’t protect LGBT people, some of us die, some of us turn to sex work because we don’t have the skills or access to better employment, some of us turn to illegal work to live,” Cristobal says. The challenges facing the activist community, however, are immense. Across the region, there are major issues of authoritarianism, corruption and political instability, not to mention an entrenched disregard for human rights.Still, as with fights of equality through history and the world over, regional activists are determined to make a difference. “Activists are working assiduously across ASEAN,” Kyle Knight, an LGBT rights researcher at Human Rights Watch, tells HuffPost. “They’re going up against these great obstacles, either explicit ones in the case of colonial-era laws or implicit in the form of discrimination. These are incredibly courageous people.” Scroll down to read each part of this series. We'll be unveiling a new one every day. Aceh, located on the northern tip of the island of Sumatra, is known for its draconian system of Sharia law. It has a population of 4.7 million and is the only province in Indonesia where homosexuality is illegal. According to a December Reuters report, the LGBT community has been forced “into hiding” there.Earlier this year, the deputy mayor of Banda Aceh, the province’s capital, labeled homosexuality “a social disease that should be eradicated.” The province, however, is hardly the only place in Indonesia where it's unsafe to be LGBT.CONTINUE READING. Last October, a transgender woman named Jennifer Laude was found dead inside a motel room in Olongapo City, Philippines. Motel staff found her naked body on the floor of the bathroom, her head leaning on the rim of the toilet bowl. U.S. Marine Joseph Scott Pemberton admitted in August to strangling the woman. The 19-year-old said in court that he was “repulsed” and “feared he would be raped” after discovering that Laude was transgender. That fear, he said, prompted him to “subdue” her in self-defense.He later allegedly told a fellow Marine: “I think I killed a he/she.”LGBT activist Corky Hope Maranan told the Associated Press last year that the case was one of the worst hate crimes she has seen.“This is just so abominable,” she said. CONTINUE READING. Kenneth Chee and Gary Lim have been together for almost two decades, but in the eyes of the law they're criminals.The couple met by chance at a shopping mall in Singapore in 1997. “I guess my ‘gaydar’ went off,” Chee recalls. “I just went up to him and asked him for his number.” They’ve been inseparable ever since.“If gay marriage was legal here, we would get married in a heartbeat,” Lim says. Chee, by his side, nods in agreement.But gay marriage is not legal in Singapore. Same-sex civil partnerships are also not recognized, and there are no laws that protect against discrimination on the grounds of gender expression or sexual orientation. CONTINUE READING. When Meas Sophanuth started to transition in high school, his mother -- afraid that her child would bring shame to the family -- tried to stop what she saw as his “unnatural” behavior.She took away his phone, kept him at home, and forbade him from seeing his friends. She finally took her son to a traditional healer, known in Cambodia as a Kru Khmer, in the hope that the shaman would be able to “cure” him.It was a traumatic experience, Sophanuth, who identifies as transgender, told the Phnom Penh Post last year. “After that, I did not feel warm to my parents anymore. They frightened me,” he said.Such attempts at “curing” are not uncommon in Cambodia, where LGBT people are often seen as being mentally ill or as being possessed with “bad spirits.”CONTINUE READING. In Brunei, being gay could soon be punishable by death.But that hasn't always been the case. Homosexuality has long been a criminal offense in the country, which is located on the island of Borneo. But while the punishment was previously 10 years in prison, the oil-rich sultanate announced last year that it was introducing a three-phased plan to impose Islamic Sharia law at the national level -- becoming the first Southeast Asian country to do so. Under the new law, same-sex intercourse is punishable by death by stoning.“It's a return to medieval punishment,” Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch told The Guardian last year. “It's a huge step back for human rights in [the country] and totally out of step with the 21st century.” CONTINUE READING.

UCLA's chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon posted a statement on Facebook Thursday pushing back on a significant amount of media coverage that said students wore blackface at the Oct. 6 party, including reports from the Los Angeles Times, KTLA, Billboard and British newspapers.Students protested on campus last week, demanding a response from the UCLA administration to publicly state that the white students dressing to resemble Kanye West and Kim Kardashian with baggy clothes and padded bottoms were being racist, the Daily Bruin reported. They displayed signs stating, ""Our culture is not a costume.""The fraternity apologized for the event, which was co-hosted with the Alpha Phi sorority, and said students can ""expect better"" from them. But SigEp insisted no one wore blackface.""It is important that we put this rumor to rest,"" the chapter said in a statement. ""Some of our guests attended the event dressed as miners in reference to the Kanye West song 'Gold Digger,' but their attire had nothing to do with race. This does not excuse our lack of judgment in not recognizing the inappropriateness of the party theme and that other costumes were offensive.""No photos have emerged depicting anyone in blackface. Members of the Afrikan Student Union, which helped organize the demonstrations on campus, could not immediately be reached for comment. Students, however, have tried to make the point that their anger is not based solely on the SigEp party. The university said it is investigating the incident. "

Two of the bills are on a fast track being sped through the legislature with an unusual Joint Senate/Assembly hearing on Tuesday.,2015-10-11,2015-10-09-1444407035-4779911-forsalesoldwiccnd2saraflickr900x507pxopt.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-10-09-1444407035-4779911-forsalesoldwiccnd2saraflickr900x507pxopt-thumb.jpg,"The far-right Wisconsin Supreme Court already handed Governor Scott Walker a ""get out of jail free card"" when it called a halt to the John Doe criminal probe into campaign finance violations by Walker and his team of advisors during the 2011-2012 recall elections.Now, the Wisconsin legislature is going the extra mile with three separate bills to retroactively decriminalize the behavior at the heart of the investigation and to defang the nonpartisan elections agency that aided it. Two of the bills are on a fast track being sped through the legislature with an unusual Joint Senate/Assembly hearing on Tuesday. The first will allow candidates to directly coordinate with big money ""issue ad"" groups that keep their donors secret -- allowing politicians to form their own shadow campaign committee, and then ask billionaires and corporations from around the country (or even overseas) to contribute million-dollar checks, without any public disclosure. The second will destroy the nonpartisan Government Accountability Board, widely regarded as a ""model"" for the nation, that assisted prosecutors in the Walker investigation. The third will exempt politicians as a category from these types of corruption probes.Legislative leaders are calling it an overhaul of the state's campaign finance laws, but it really isn't campaign finance at all. Wisconsin should inaugurate new chapters in the statutes including ""Facilitating Secret Money in Wisconsin Elections"" and ""Protecting Politicians from Independent Oversight and Accountability.""The Supreme SwindleIn a 4-2 July decision that broke along ideological lines, the Wisconsin Supreme Court's right-wing majority ended the John Doe probe into whether Governor Scott Walker illegally coordinated with supposedly ""independent"" secret money groups during the recall elections. The Court declared that any coordination that did occur didn't violate the law, since it only involved so-called ""issue ads"" that stopped short of expressly saying ""vote for"" or ""vote against"" a candidate. The Court additionally ignored evidence that Walker's team had also engaged in coordination with express advocacy groups.By ruling as it did, the Court overturned years of precedent and practice in Wisconsin. Previously, one of their own colleagues, Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Jon Wilcox, was fined $60,000 for engaging in the same type of issue ad coordination that Walker engaged in. But the state's highest court, elected with over $10 million in support from the same dark money groups under investigation in the Walker probe, was anxious to create new rules.On Wednesday, GAB Chairman Judge Gerald Nichol, a former Republican District Attorney appointed to the board by Scott Walker, said the justices should have recused themselves.Nichol told Wisconsin Public Radio: ""You get off the case, and that protects the system. It gives it integrity. And right now, I think the Supreme Court has a problem with their integrity.""""Most judges in this state who I've talked to are appalled by that decision,"" Nichol added.The justice's failure to recuse may yet be challenged before the U.S. Supreme Court, which in 2009 held that a West Virginia Supreme Court Justice should have recused under similar circumstances, but by then Nichol and his colleagues will be off the board and Wisconsin campaign finance laws will have been dramatically rewritten.Vos Writes Coordination into Wisconsin Law, Welcomes Secret MoneyThis week, Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) unveiled a bill to codify the Wisconsin Supreme Court decision and legalize campaign coordination between independent issue ad groups and candidates.Under the bill, there is nothing stopping a candidate from forming a nonprofit, having it operate out of their campaign offices, and asking billionaires and corporations from around the country (or overseas) to contribute million-dollar checks, without any public disclosure. Donors who max out on their contributions directly to campaigns (currently limited to $10,000 per gubernatorial candidate) will have a new conduit for giving money, with the full knowledge of the candidate, but no disclosure to the public. Corporations could support Wisconsin candidates without public disclosure. Special interests seeking political favors -- but not public scrutiny -- can curry favor with candidates without questions from the media.At the same time, the bill doubles the contribution limits for individuals to give directly to a candidate, but these smaller donations would have to be disclosed. The GOP will spin the bill as required to conform with the Supreme Court ruling.But elections law expert Tara Malloy with the Campaign Legal Center told CMD: ""By allowing outside groups to coordinate all spending except express advocacy expenditures with their favored candidates, the bill offers big spenders a clear route to circumvent Wisconsin's contribution limits. This approach is by no means constitutionally compelled. No federal court has recognized a First Amendment right to engage in this this type of coordination. Not even the U.S. Supreme Court in Citizens United. In fact, the Supreme Court has explicitly recognized that a state can go beyond express advocacy in restricting coordinated spending.""But Vos, who got his start in politics in the office of Assembly Leader Bonnie Ladwig (R-Mt. Pleasant) one of the legislators charged in the ""caucus scandal,"" now apparently wants to make his mark on history by handing over full control of Wisconsin campaign spending to corporations and special interests acting in secret.What could go wrong?Getting Rid of the GAB, an Independent Election Board Is No Longer NeededVos' campaign finance deform measure came the same day that the GOP dropped a bill to get rid of the independent elections and ethics board.The bill will do away with the non-partisan retired judges who sit on the GAB board and weigh-in on every major decision. Judge Nichol and the other judges (the majority appointed by Walker) will be out on the street and partisan appointees will take their place.Nichol warned that dismantling the board shortly before the 2016 presidential elections was rash and ill-advised. ""The public and the agency's customers will not be well served by rushing through a sweeping reorganization at this point in the election cycle,"" he wrote to legislative leaders. The board had its hands full implementing Voter ID and other changes demanded by Republicans. The board ""makes its own decisions guided by the law, not partisan politics,"" he wrote to legislative leaders.But his warning falls on deaf ears. The Wisconsin GOP appears ready to rush the GAB reform bill and changes to the campaign finance system through the legislature. Speaker Vos and over 23 other legislators who voted to create an independent overseer of Wisconsin elections will now have to reverse course. (See the list here.)Gutting the John Doe Statute, No More Corruption InvestigationsThe final folly in the trinity of bad ideas is a bill that would prohibit Wisconsin's John Doe statute, which lays out a process similar to a grand jury but operating in front of a judge, from being used to investigate political corruption. The broadly written bill  authored by GOP Senator Tom Tiffany (R-Hazelhurst) would only allow the statue to be used for serious, for instance violent, felonies and would apply time limits and other restrictions. Former Milwaukee District Attorney E. Michael McCann, a Democrat who prosecuted a Democratic Senator under the John Doe, testified that the law was ""critically important to bringing an end to the misconduct in office"" seen previously in the Legislature. The bill ""guts the strength of the John Doe by removing numerous crimes for which public officials have been convicted in the past,"" he said. Tiffany agues in an op-ed that the bill is geared toward ""treating everyone equally and fairly,"" but the bill can be viewed as giving politicians special protections, much like the 2010 law passed after the last corruption scandal that allows elected officials (and elected officials only) to be tried in their home counties for violation of ethics, lobbying and campaign finance laws. The End of an Era of Good GovernmentWisconsin's campaign finance laws were enacted after the Watergate scandal rocked the nation. Now the language that ushered in a 30-year era of transparency and fair play in Wisconsin politics is being jettisoned.The Vos bill eliminates the preamble of the state's campaign finance law, which includes: ""our democratic system of government can be maintained only if the electorate is informed,"" ""excessive spending on campaigns for public office jeopardizes the integrity of elections"" and ""when the true source of support or extent of support is not fully disclosed, or when a candidate becomes overly dependent upon large private contributors, the democratic process is subjected to a potential corrupting influence.""That's right, an informed electorate is no longer a goal of Speaker Vos and the Wisconsin GOP, which has now made multiple attempts to gut the state's open records law.""The net effect of this plan is effectively the complete deregulation of campaign finance law in Wisconsin, including any meaningful transparency or disclosure. Much more money, in much larger amounts will flow and Wisconsin voters will be relegated to the sidelines,"" says Wisconsin Common Cause director Jay Heck.* * * * *There will be a Joint public hearing Tuesday, October 13, 9:00 a.m., Rm. 412 East in the Wisconsin State Capitol on three bills: SB 295 to deconstruct the GAB, SB 292 the campaign finance bill, and SB 295 related to electronic voter registration.

19,POLITICS,Iraqi National Reconciliation: A Way to Tackle IS,"Khairuldeen Al Makhzoomi, ContributorResearcher at the Near Eastern Department. University of Calif...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/iraqi-national-reconcilia_b_8261240.html,"The country has intensified its attempts at national reconciliation. Notably, Iraq has sent diplomats to countries that have faced similar sectarian problems, with the aim of finding ways to speed the reconciliation process.",2015-10-11,2015-10-11-1444600078-1183400-ScreenShot20151011at2.46.52PM.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-10-11-1444600078-1183400-ScreenShot20151011at2.46.52PM-thumb.png," Iraqi army officers made two attempts on the life of the country's prime minister, Haider Al-Abadi, before being thwarted by the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, according to a high-level Iraqi official. This is the latest symptom of the ongoing radicalization and sectarian violence that has plagued post-2003 Iraq. The roots of ISIS' rise can be found in the disempowerment of the Sunni tribes at the hands of the Shiite-led government. Despite substantial support from the international community, Iraq continues to struggle under the ISIS menace. Only reconciliation and cooperation between Sunnis and Shiites can lead to the purging of ISIS and the prevention of the rise of similar groups in Iraq.The two factions' radically different political ideologies too often manifest themselves in violent conflict which threatens the stability of the country. These differences stem from the Shiites' refusal to grant local political authority to the Sunni tribes from the province of Anbar, and the cities of Ramadi and Fallujah, let alone representation in national governance. This trend of Sunni political exclusion heightened after Nouri al-Maliki's election to a second term as prime minister in 2010. Critically, this exclusion has left no choice for the Sunni tribes in Anbar province other than joining ISIS to protect their tribal control. Thus, Iraq's lack of national cohesion has made it harder for the country to deal with the current crises inflaming the region. Looking forward, the UN Secretary-General special representative to Iraq, Jan Kubis, explained that unity and cooperation between the Sunni tribes, the Shiite-led government and all members of Iraqi society is essential to successfully counter ISIS.Political outlook in Iraq The political instability in Iraq is exacerbated by a lack of consensus among the major political blocs about how the country should be governed -- a situation which has its roots in the Erbil Agreement. This agreement, which was discussed in 2010 between Masoud Barzani, president of the Iraqi region of Kurdistan, former Iraqi prime minister Nouri al-Maliki, the leader of the dominant Islamic Dawa party, and Iyad Allawi, the leader of the Iraqi National Accord party, if implemented, would have reduced the powers of the prime minister. Instead, Maliki consolidated his power over the Kurdish and Sunni political blocks, which have since been unable to win the necessary majorities to contest his power. This consolidation of power over the Kurds and Sunnis reduces Iraq's ability to develop such policies as a strong national military, which could keep the country stable and prevent another power vacuum. President Fuad Masum appointed a Sunni and a Shiite to head the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Interior, respectively, following his presidential election in 2014. Haider al-Abadi, after being appointed in 2014 as prime minister, also declared that uniting Iraq would be a political priority, and that he will work to develop a government that represents Iraqis of all ideologies and creeds equally. Abadi's commitment to resolving Iraq's sectarian strife -- which he will accomplish ""even if [he] get[s] assassinated by it,"" to use his words -- is a welcome change from his predecessor's schismatic rhetoric. On March 1, Iraqi parliament speaker Salim al-Jubouri said that the doors of reconciliation are open to everyone ""except [those] who collaborated with [ISIS]."" On March 2, 2015, Iyad Allawi noted that, ""a true reconciliation should include all parties except for the ones who have Iraqi blood on their hands."" These statements, aimed at decreasing sectarian tension, and could ally many Sunni tribes with the Shiite government rather than ISIS. Corruption has also proved to be a constant difficulty in Iraq. In an interview with the New York Times, President Masum highlighted the need for both political and religious reforms, admitting that rampant corruption has even crept into the army. However, the appointment of Haider al-Abadi in 2014 promises improvement on this front. As prime minister, he laid out a seven-point plan on August 8, requiring a number of senior government positions -- previously filled by partisan officials shrouded in allegations of corruption -- to be filled with political technocrats with no party affiliations. These proposed reforms followed anti-government protests, which were sparked by unreliable electricity and allegations of corruption at all levels of the country. One day before the reforms were announced, Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani - Iraq's most influential Shiite cleric - also urged Abadi to ""strike with an iron fist"" against corruption, and to make political appointments based on ability, rather than party or sectarian affiliation. Abadi's reforms also call for a reduction in the cost of officials' personal bodyguards (which for some officials number over 1000) and a restructuring and budget increase for Iraq's national security forces. Iraq's Parliament unanimously passed the measures in August, taking a major step towards curbing corruption. However, this has by no means solved the larger issue of uniting the country across its tribal divides. Reconciling the Sunnis and Shiites in Iraqi society  The country has intensified its attempts at national reconciliation. Notably, Iraq has sent diplomats to countries that have faced similar sectarian problems, with the aim of finding ways to speed the reconciliation process. According to the Irish Times, former national Iraqi government advisor Mowaffak Al-Rubaie, called the mission an ""eye-opener."" He noted, however, that just as it took Northern Ireland a considerable amount of time to reconcile their differences with the British, Sunni-Shiite peace in Iraq would be a gradual process. For the sake of national unity, Al-Rubaie said that the government was ready to meet with representatives of all Iraqi insurgencies, excluding only ""diehard Saddamists"" and Al-Qaeda. Imposing too many preconditions, Al Rubaie said, would hinder the government's efforts.Iraqi tribes have already proven that they are capable of uniting against a common enemy. In 2007, Sunni tribes in central and western Iraq turned against the Al-Qaeda fighters and cooperated with the Shiite government. This sort of cooperation, that in the past has mended sectarianism and created progress against the prominent terrorist organizations, is now more important than ever in Iraq's endeavor to destroy ISIS. Similarly, after the fall of Mosul in June 2014, Ayatollah al-Sistani urged the Iraqi people, regardless of religion (Sunni, Shi'ite, and Christian), to rally against ISIS by joining the Popular Mobilization Force. Thus, the Popular Mobilization Force lost its explicitly Shi'ite image and was placed under the control of the prime minister. Both these examples demonstrate the possibility of national reconciliation in Iraq. Reconciliation at the national level rests on respect and cooperation between individuals, tribal blocks and the ruling government. In other words, every citizen should have freedom of speech, thought and representation. Reconciliation rests on differing opinions as a part of a national dialogue. Moreover, national reconciliation will require skilled leadership and a loyal citizenry. Democracy, strongly enforced laws, shared cultural symbols and equal distribution of resources, will all aid Iraqi citizens to identify as Iraqi.Critical collaboration across tribal divides, combined with support from both the Iraqi government and international governments and agencies - such as the United States - will allow Iraq to defeat ISIS. And indeed, Iraq has no option other than to defeat ISIS if it wants to maintain its sovereignty and guarantee the humanitarian, political and economic rights of its citizenry. There is, however, much yet to be done."

Glazed Oatmeal-Maple SconesThese comforting breakfast treats are like a cross between scones and oatmeal cookies: buttery and tender on the inside, crisp and craggy on the outside, and chockfull of oats, pecans and currants. The recipe is the first I tried from Joanne Chang's wonderful cookbook, Flour: Spectacular Recipes from Boston's Bakery & Cafe, and it was love at first bite.  GET THE RECIPE2. Zucchini and Cheddar FrittataFrittatas are often dry and tough but this one is delicate and creamy, almost like a crustless quiche. GET THE RECIPE3. Pancetta Wrapped AsparagusThis dish looks fancy but it's incredibly easy to make. Simply wrap big, thick asparagus spears with pancetta and sauté them until nice and crisp. GET THE RECIPE4. Best Ever Blueberry MuffinsBursting with fresh blueberries with a tender, cakey crumb and sparkling sugar crust, these really are the best blueberry muffins. GET THE RECIPE5. Citrus and Pomegranate Fruit SaladIn this refreshing fall fruit salad, oranges, grapefruits and pomegranate arils are soaked in their own juices. The fruit soaks up the sweet syrup -- and the syrup is so good you'll want to drink it straight from the bowl.  GET THE RECIPE6. Drunken Carmel French ToastPart booze, part French toast, part bread pudding -- how can you go wrong?  GET THE RECIPE7. Chai Spiced Banana BreadHere, I've taken one of my favorite banana bread recipes and subtly infused it with warm chai spices like cardamom, cinnamon, ginger and allspice. It's wonderfully moist and aromatic -- a sophisticated twist on basic banana bread.  GET THE RECIPE8. Spinach & Cheese StrataThis elegant brunch strata -- really a savory bread pudding with spinach, cheese and cubes of bread baked in custard -- is perfect for entertaining because you can prepare it the day before. The next morning you simply turn the oven on, place the strata in, and effortlessly wait for brunch to emerge. GET THE RECIPE9. Double Chocolate Zucchini BreadDouble Chocolate Zucchini Bread is perfect for your morning chocolate fix. It has a deep chocolate flavor yet it's not so sweet that it tastes like dessert. It's also loaded with zucchini, so there's some virtue in it. GET THE RECIPE10. Banana PancakesFluffy on the inside, crispy on the outside -- these are phenomenal banana pancakes. The recipe, believe it or not, is adapted from a children's cookbook, which only proves how easy they are to make.

Harvest Grape & Olive Oil CakeStudded with juicy red grapes with hints of vanilla and citrus, this is a simple and lovely Italian-style cake -- perfect for breakfast, brunch or tea. It's called a ""harvest cake"" because it's traditionally made during the grape harvest season to use up the small grapes not going for pressing.  GET THE RECIPE12.

26,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Is About To Get Two Key Chances To Quiet Her Skeptics,Amanda Terkel and Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-democratic-debate_us_561802cde4b0e66ad4c7ca99,It's her opportunity to shore up support among progressives while beating back conservative opposition.,2015-10-10,Hillary Clinton has put out a series of progressive policy proposals in recent days that will likely be highlighted at the debate Tuesday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=crop_16_86_3884_2293%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The next two weeks will provide Hillary Clinton with two of her best chances yet to distinguish herself from her presidential primary opponents and put to rest lingering concern over the private email server she used while secretary of state.The first chance comes Tuesday, when five Democratic candidates face off in Las Vegas for their first debate. While the primary has been a polite affair so far, especially compared to the Republican race, the debate will be the first chance for voters to evaluate the candidates side by side. The Clinton campaign is focused on highlighting her progressive positions while also showing that she is the best-equipped to turn campaign proposals into governing realities. The second test comes the following week, when Clinton will testify before the House Select Committee on Benghazi. The appearance has long been viewed as an opportunity for her to lay out her side of the story and counter Republican lawmakers who risk the very real chance of overplaying their hand and appearing as if they're on a partisan hunt. Clinton received some assistance with that last week, when House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) gloated that the supposedly nonpartisan committee has helped weaken her poll numbers. His comments made it easier for Democrats to argue that Republicans are using the taxpayer-funded committee to go after Clinton rather than get to the bottom of the 2012 terrorist attack. The two events together present a major inflection point for Clinton's presidential ambitions: a chance to shore up support on the progressive end of the political spectrum while beating back opposition on the conservative end. The campaign has taken a number of steps to facilitate the first half of that mission. On Wednesday, Clinton revealed her much-awaited position on President Barack Obama's Trans-Pacific Partnership, announcing that she was against the massive trade deal. Progressive groups have long opposed the TPP, as do Clinton's two main Democratic primary rivals, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley. Clinton released her Wall Street reform plan the following day, undercutting critics who worry that she's too close to the financial industry and rebuking Obama's weak enforcement record against financial misconduct.She's also split with Obama in recent weeks by calling for the elimination of the Affordable Care Act's ""Cadillac tax,"" opposing construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and pushing for certain administrative actions on gun control that Obama has not yet taken.The announcements' timing appeared designed to preempt criticism from her more progressive opponents prior to Tuesday's debate.But advisers to Clinton reject that, noting that she came out with a progressive immigration plan, for example, much earlier in the campaign. And the former secretary of state said she delayed taking a stance on TPP because she wanted to hear final details before making a decision. ""From her time at the Children's Defense Fund through running for President today, Hillary Clinton has spent her career fighting for the progressive values she knows will help improve lives and make our country stronger,"" campaign spokeswoman Christina Reynolds said. ""Throughout this campaign, starting with her first policy speech on criminal justice reform and through policies like immigration, voting rights, holding Wall Street accountable and gun violence prevention, Hillary has been focused on the issues and progressive causes she would fight for as President.""The ultimate goal is not just to play defense, but also to establish Clinton's superior credentials on a number of issues. Advisers have reportedly been preparing her to question how Sanders is planning to pay for some of his proposals, such as free public college tuition. Her gun control plan also sets up a telling contrast: Clinton goes further than Sanders by calling for an end to the legal immunity that firearms manufacturers and dealers currently enjoy.""This is going to be millions of people's first time actually hearing her policies for how to move America forward,"" Reynolds added.If the debate presents a critical moment for Clinton, it could be a veritable launching pad for Sanders. The Vermont senator has drawn tremendous crowds at his campaign rallies. And in a few short months, he has built a grassroots fundraising apparatus that has allowed him to nearly keep pace with the Clinton campaign and its decades of connections with big donors. But Sanders' team feels he has barely been introduced to a wider audience.""I don’t think it has begun to happen for most of America,"" said Tad Devine, a senior adviser to Sanders. ""I know he has gotten a lot of attention, and certainly we are pleased with where we are in Iowa and New Hampshire. But I think in terms of the country getting to know him, we have only begun to scratch the surface.""While a highly watched forum on CNN will surely provide that introduction, it's also a stage the size of which Sanders has yet to experience. To prepare, Devine said Sanders has studied briefing materials and held talks with policy advisers. The campaign won't have a ""full-blown mock debate,"" but will sit around a table and ask the senator potential questions, ""making sure he is familiar with his own record and his opponent's records."" The hope is to get Sanders to open up more about his life story. But ""Bernie being Bernie, he may just decide, 'I'm not here to talk about my immigrant father who couldn’t speak English,'"" Devine said.One thing Sanders is unlikely to do is launch negative attacks at his opponents.Devine said the campaign's biggest fear is ""that the debate will move away from substance and into political attacks. That’s not his forte. He is not a guy who does that politics at all. So I don’t think we want that.""""You're looking at a candidate who has run in many, many elections who has never run a negative political ad in my life and hopes never to have to run one,"" Sanders told reporters at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute's annual policy conference Wednesday. ""And you're looking at a candidate who does not go about attacking people personally. I just don't do that.""O'Malley, however, is a different case. The former Maryland governor has been less shy about going after Clinton in particular, hitting her for past positions and for being slow to take a stance on current issues. ""The distinctions I have with the two current front-runners in our party is this: I have 15 years of executive experience, actually getting things done as a big-city mayor and as a governor -- pulling people together, forging a new consensus, very oftentimes in advance of the polling or the focus groups,"" O'Malley said at the CHCI event Wednesday. ""Leadership is not putting a finger into the wind and waiting for the polls to tell you it's safe to do so. Leadership is forging a new consensus based on the principles we share as a people that will actually give our children a more just and more prosperous future.""O'Malley hopes the debate will be a breakout moment for him in what has largely been a two-way contest thus far.""Right now in our party, the only two candidates people have heard of, really, is the inevitable front-runner and the senator from Vermont,"" he said. ""But once the debates happen, people will be able to listen to all of the candidates.""Former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb will also be onstage Tuesday. The debate, hosted by CNN, is the first of six in the Democratic primary. Elise Foley contributed reporting."

So I don’t think we want that.""""You're looking at a candidate who has run in many, many elections who has never run a negative political ad in my life and hopes never to have to run one,"" Sanders told reporters at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute's annual policy conference Wednesday. ""And you're looking at a candidate who does not go about attacking people personally. I just don't do that.""O'Malley, however, is a different case. The former Maryland governor has been less shy about going after Clinton in particular, hitting her for past positions and for being slow to take a stance on current issues. ""The distinctions I have with the two current front-runners in our party is this: I have 15 years of executive experience, actually getting things done as a big-city mayor and as a governor -- pulling people together, forging a new consensus, very oftentimes in advance of the polling or the focus groups,"" O'Malley said at the CHCI event Wednesday. ""Leadership is not putting a finger into the wind and waiting for the polls to tell you it's safe to do so. Leadership is forging a new consensus based on the principles we share as a people that will actually give our children a more just and more prosperous future.""O'Malley hopes the debate will be a breakout moment for him in what has largely been a two-way contest thus far.""Right now in our party, the only two candidates people have heard of, really, is the inevitable front-runner and the senator from Vermont,"" he said. ""But once the debates happen, people will be able to listen to all of the candidates.""Former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb will also be onstage Tuesday. The debate, hosted by CNN, is the first of six in the Democratic primary. Elise Foley contributed reporting."
