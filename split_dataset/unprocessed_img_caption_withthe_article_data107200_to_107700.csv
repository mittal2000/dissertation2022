These younger Catholics are also supportive of legalizing same-sex marriages, with 75% throwing their weight behind the concept. The positive attitudes toward homosexuality are less likely to be found among older adults. About 57% of Catholics aged 65 and older told Pew that they believe homosexuality should be accepted.Church attendance may be a factor:Our research has found that older Catholics attend Mass more frequently than do their younger counterparts, and that Catholics who attend Mass at least weekly are more likely to say that homosexuality should be discouraged than those who do not. But even among churchgoing Catholics of all ages – that is, those who attend Mass at least weekly – roughly twice as many say homosexuality should be accepted (60%) as say it should be discouraged (31%).Catholic bishops at the Synod of the Family caused a stir earlier this week after questioning whether the church is capable of “welcoming homosexuals persons” into the fold. In a draft report on the Synod proceedings, the bishops suggested “homosexuals have gifts and qualities to offer to the Christian community,” RNS reports. The report caused backlash among conservative bishops, who scrambled to reinforce traditional church teachings on the subject.The text was later changed from “welcoming homosexual persons” to “providing for homosexuals.”The conservative Catholic website Rorate Caeli claimed the report's welcoming attitude toward homosexuality is “destroying the Church from the inside.”But if the statistics about the rising generation of Catholics is any indication, the Church may face more pressure to approach gays and lesbians with openness as younger Catholics grow to hold increasing power.

Dozens more were still missing.""We have spotted nine new bodies today,"" said Govinda Pathak, police head in the district of Mustang. ""We could not retrieve them because of bad weather conditions and snowfall. I can confirm that the toll is 39 now.""Twelve helicopters were pressed on Saturday into action to drop searchers in otherwise inaccessible spots, and soldiers fanned out in different directions along the 240-km (150-mile) route.It was the most intensive effort yet to find survivors of one of the country's worst mountain disasters, which struck at a time of year when the weather is usually calm and clear.Foreign victims included hikers from Canada, India, Israel and Poland who were caught on Wednesday by the tail end of a cyclone that battered India's eastern coast last weekend before heading northward.Thorong La, the highest pass along the Annapurna trek, is at an altitude of 5,416 meters (17,769 feet), but the route does not require mountaineering experience. Eyewitnesses said many victims perished trying to descend the pass in freezing, whiteout conditions.In the capital, Kathmandu, survivors recounted their brush with death during the blizzard. SWEPT AWAYFour Nepali guides were swept away by an avalanche, said Horst Ulrich, a 72-year-old German, who was on his fourth trip to Nepal with a group of friends.""We were in a dangerous spot and shocked at the conditions we were seeing unfold in front of our eyes,"" he added. ""We just got lucky.""Munchang Lama, 35, a guide for two Israeli women, found himself marooned while he was pitching a tent for them.""Suddenly it started raining and I took shelter between two rocks,"" said Lama, who was rescued on Friday, suffering from frostbite and minor injuries.""Next morning I was not able to walk because my leg was stuck in snow,"" he added. ""I realized I would only be able to get out when the snow melted.""Lama said he was able to keep up his strength by munching on nuts, chocolates and a banana he found in the women's bags.""This kept me alive for 48 hours,"" said Lama, adding that he did not know what became of his clients.The government has admitted failing to issue any warning that the weather would take a sudden turn for the worse, and has promised to set up an early-warning system.This week's incident was the second major mountain disaster in Nepal this year after an avalanche killed 16 guides on Mount Everest, the world's highest peak, in April.The home ministry told officials in the five affected districts to trace missing people who could have taken shelter from the storm in hamlets, temples or other isolated spots.At least 45 Nepali families have approached officials in the districts of Mustang, Manang and Dolpa for help tracking down their missing menfolk who worked as porters and guides.""The problem is that any Nepali is free to start operating as a porter and they do not require a license,"" said Keshav Pandey of Nepal's Trekking Agencies Association.

A spokesman said talks to free the girls would continue in Chad on Monday.The fresh attacks dashed hopes for an easing of the northeast's violence, although officials remained confident they can negotiate the release of girls whose abduction by the rebels in the remote northeastern town of Chibok in April caused international shock and outrage.A presidency and another government source said they were aiming to do this by Tuesday.Boko Haram, whose name translates roughly as ""Western education is sinful,"" has massacred thousands in a struggle to carve an Islamic state out of religiously mixed Nigeria, whose southern half is mainly Christian in faith.Nigeria's armed forces chief Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh announced the ceasefire on Friday. On Saturday, two senior government sources said it aims to secure the girls' release as early as Monday or Tuesday, although they declined to give further details.In the first attack, suspected insurgents attacked the village of Abadam on Friday night, killing at least one person and ransacking homes, while another assault on the village of Dzur on Saturday morning left at least eight people dead.Three other attacks in Adamawa state on Saturday killed dozens of people, witnesses and a local politician said.""I was just boarding a bus when the gunshots started,"" Adams Mishelia, who was in the adjacent town of Shaffa, said of the Dzur attack. ""People were fleeing into the bush, so I got off the bus and headed to the bush too. I later learned they slaughtered eight people.""A security source confirmed that attack and the assault on Abadam the night before. Mohammed Bulama, a resident of the main northeastern city of Maiduguri, told Reuters he lost his uncle in the Abadam attack. Other casualties there were unclear.On Saturday suspected insurgents also attacked three small towns in a local government area called Michika, Adamawa state.""Dozens of people are been killed and houses are been burnt by the insurgents, so what is the meaning of the ceasefire government is talking about?"" said Adamu Kamale, a state government lawmaker. ""DISCUSSIONS IN CHAD""When asked about the violence, government spokesman Mike Omeri said by telephone that ""the Boko Haram people have also said that some attacks are not undertaken by them.""Boko Haram, seen as the biggest threat to Africa's top economy and oil producer, is believed to be divided into several factions that loosely cooperate with each other, and it is unclear with which faction the government has been negotiating.""Discussions will continue in Chad next week, and on the basis of those discussions we'll have more details,"" on how the girls will be released, Omeri said.The announcement of the truce came a day before a rally of supporters of President Goodluck Jonathan in Abuja attended by his vice president, Namadi Sambo, although an expected announcement of Jonathan's candidacy for February 2015 elections did not materialize during the rally.Officials at the presidency and military did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Boko Haram has also not yet commented on the reported truce. The group's sole means of conveying messages is via videotaped speeches by a man claiming to be Abubakar Shekau, its leader whom the military last year said it had killed.A history of abortive government attempts at truce deals with Boko Haram and military claims to have rescued some girls that proved false, mean Nigerians are likely to greet the newly reported breakthrough with skepticism.The second government source said: ""We are negotiating with considerable caution. Boko Haram has grown into such an amorphous entity that any splinter group could come up disowning the deal. (But) we believe we are talking to the right people.""The talks were held with a formerly unknown militant called Danladi Ahmadu, who says he is the group's ""secretary general.""Underlining the uncertainty over the chain of command in Boko Haram, Nigeria's military said at the end of last month a man who had been posing as Shekau in the group's growing number of videos had been killed in clashes over the town of Konduga.The schoolgirls' abduction stunned the world, spurred a global Twitter campaign to get them rescued and heaped pressure on Jonathan's administration to do more to protect civilians in the northeast where Boko Haram's insurgency is focused.Several rounds of negotiations with the jihadist movement have been pursued in recent years but they have never yielded calm, partly because of Boko Haram's internal divisions.Since the girls' kidnapping, the Nigerian military has twice asserted that it rescued some or all of the girls, only to have to backtrack hours later.At Saturday's rally in Abuja, many of President Jonathan's supporters wrapped themselves in the white and green of Nigeria's flag and sang and danced under a banner reading ""We Love You Goodluck Jonathan. Our support is 100 percent.""Two candidates for the main opposition coalition, former military ruler Muhammadu Buhari and ex-vice president Atiku Abubakar, have declared their candidacy against Jonathan.

Earlier this month, the nonprofit posted listings on Craigslist and Indeed to advertise an opening for a part-time web designer. It offered to pay $13 an hour or more, depending on the designer's experience. That's well below the $20 minimum wage the party pushes for in its platform, and lower than the $15 wage it helped pass this year in Seattle. Right-leaning sites promptly seized on what they saw as hypocrisy. But Doug Barnes, the party's national secretary, told The Huffington Post on Saturday that the group relies heavily on donations from low-wage workers and could not afford to pay much to an inexperienced designer.""We're practicing what we're preaching in terms of continuing to fight for the minimum wage,"" Barnes said, making his first public comment on the controversy. ""But we can't pay a lot more than $13.""He said the party's revenues would increase if the minimum wage were raised to $20 -- and he'd even prefer $22, at least in Seattle. The city will begin phasing in a $15 minimum wage in April. ""Our donor base would all be affected, and the low-wage workers who support us with $5 to $6 a month would be able to give more,"" he said. ""That would affect our ability to pay higher wages as well.""But Barnes said he removed the $13 starting wage from the Craigslist ad on Friday in response to the online criticism. ""The right-wing attack is very hypocritical,"" he said. ""These are the same people who fought against the minimum wage and support companies like Walmart."" He said the Freedom Socialist Party, which was formed in 1966 as a revolutionary feminist breakaway group from the United States Socialist Workers Party, does not accept donations from corporations."

But after reviewing its marketing, the Unilever-owned ice cream brand said it found nothing that ""condoned hazing, supported hazing, or even inferred hazing,"" according to a report on Bloomberg.

Delegates representing some 50 nations and 20 regional and international organizations attended a donor conference in Cairo, Egypt, on Sunday to help Gaza rebuild after the war between Israel and Gaza's militant Islamic group Hamas this summer. Organizers of the Cairo conference hope pledges of over 5 billion dollars by donors will be paid over the period of three years to aid reconstruction in the Gaza Strip, which borders Israel and Egypt. Both countries have blockaded Gaza since Hamas took power there in 2007, causing the territory of 1.8 million people economic hardships and high unemployment. (AP Photo/Adel Hana)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13f272400005500e47bea.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every week, The WorldPost asks an expert to shed light on a topic driving headlines around the world. Today, we look at efforts to rebuild the Gaza Strip after the latest conflict with Israel.For 51 days this summer, Israeli troops and Palestinian militants in Gaza fought a devastating war that left over 2,100 Palestinians and 70 Israelis dead. The United Nations estimates that 60,000 homes in Gaza were damaged or destroyed in the fighting, leaving some 110,000 people homeless. Infrastructure in the enclave was badly damaged.As another 50 days have passed since the end of the war, the need to start Gaza's reconstruction process is growing more acute. Last weekend, international donors gathered in Cairo and pledged $5.4 billion to rebuild the Strip. A major challenge for donors and aid agencies is to make sure the cash translates into actual rebuilding. Gaza's neighbors -- Israel and Egypt -- severely restrict the passage of goods in and out of the area. Israel has insisted on guarantees from the international community that construction materials won't be used by militants to resupply for another war. In a potential breakthrough last month, the UN brokered a deal for international monitoring on reconstruction materials imported into Gaza. On Tuesday, the first trucks carrying building materials were allowed to enter the enclave via Israel.The WorldPost turned to Tony Laurance, CEO of U.K.-based charity Medical Aid for Palestinians, to discuss the reconstruction effort and the scale of the challenges ahead.It's been nearly two months since Israel and Palestinians in Gaza reached a ceasefire deal. Has the rebuilding of Gaza started yet?Not in any meaningful sense. At the moment they’re mainly clearing unexploded ordnance. People were waiting for the Cairo donor conference and on an agreement on how materials will get into the enclave to start the rebuilding process. Substantial amounts were indeed pledged during the conference. However, after the last confrontation, Operation Cast Lead in 2008-2009, there were also a lot of pledges but nothing was delivered. While the agreement reached by the United Nations on the entry of goods into Gaza is promising, there have been many promises over the last five years to resolve that same problem. Nothing ever happened in a very wide scale. Will it be different this time?The UN deal will need to be accompanied by enormous intentions. The challenges lie in the details and the success of the deal depends on relationships and trust, which are very sorely absent. Israeli-Palestinian relations don’t really exist at the moment. Will the promised aid be enough, if it does arrive?Getting the materials in is one thing. There are very complicated projects ahead -- like repairing the water, sewage and power systems -- which not only require goods entering Gaza but also expertise and equipment.Additionally, unless you create opportunities for export you cannot get the economy running again. One-off aid may help kickstart the economy but it won’t create longer term opportunities or jobs.Where does that leave people in Gaza in the meantime?People aren’t starving, but that's about the best you can say. Many are not able to go home, many don’t have electricity. There’s an awful lot of people with injuries. Gaza will need to cope with people who have severe disabilities, offering physical therapy and finding opportunities for them. The medical equipment was already pretty dire, even before the war, and now there is an acute shortage of drugs. A number of clinics and hospitals were damaged and a few were destroyed in the war. There are also wide concerns about the water supply and associated public health risks. The one public aquifer is desperately overused and a lot of people can’t afford to live off water tanks. It's crucial to act so that Gaza has an adequate water system in the coming years. There have been plans to invest in the sewage system, for years but they never got off the ground. At the moment the sewage is just pumped into the sea. This interview took place on Thursday, Oct. 16. It has been edited and condensed for clarity."

While reporting on Israel's politics and policy, it is important to draw the full picture -- most Israelis want peace.Since Israel's very early existence, Israeli leaders have always believed that we must shape our future by ourselves. The best and most memorable example, of course, is the Israeli declaration of independence, made by David Ben-Gurion in 1948. Ben-Gurion knew that the decision was fraught with risks, and yet decided to go on with his belief, taking into consideration the many chances and risks and prepared in accordance. Another example, this time a staunch right-wing leader who had opposed giving up any parts of the Jewish homeland -- Begin, finally and bravely made peace with Egypt as PM. Remembered are also the Oslo Accords, led by Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres on the Israeli side. Those leaders had known to defend Israel when needed and to search for peace when possible.This kind of pragmatic leadership is very much missed in Israel. Many Israelis hope for a new leadership which would prefer the country's benefit over its own political one. The lack of progress in the peace process as well as the increase of food and housing prices have caused the Israelis to believe very little in their leaders. The excessive influence of extreme edges of the Israeli political system has not contributed to public confidence in the political system either. The current leadership is seemed by many as a hesitant, having no vision in front of its eyes.Despite this kind of leadership leading the country for over five years now, there are large segments in Israeli society which are trying to make a difference. Those elements believe that Israel's supreme goal is reaching an agreement with the Palestinians. In their view, a peace agreement would preserve a Jewish majority in Israel and would ensure secured and clear borders once and for all.The Israeli labor party, led by Opposition leader Yitzhak Herzog, purports to be an alternative leadership which would promote a peace deal based on the Two-State solution. Even within the coalition, there is the very brave Justice Minister Tzipi Livni who has been fighting against right-wing elements for the sake of a peace process. Livni has put all of her political weight in order to promote dialogue and progress with the Palestinian Authority.­ Carter, Begin and Sadat after signing the peace treaty. Credit : Bettmann/CorbisA new poll, conducted by the Geneva Accord, exposes the true face of Israel as well as the incompatibility between the Israeli political system and the public will: Most of Israeli public believes that PM Netanyahu should initiate a peace process leading to the Two-State solution. Even in the Likud, the PM's own right-wing party, 53 percent of the voters believe that a peace process should be initiated. Additionally, 67 percent of the Israelis believe that the status-quo endangers Israel's future. The deep desire of most Israelis has yet to be translated into action.I am a young Israeli and as such I can say with great confidence that the young generation is keen to see steps toward peace. Many Israelis believe that this is a crucial time for Israel, a time when the people's voice must be heard. We believe that pursuing peace is a strategic imperative for Israel's future and also a Jewish-moral one stems from our heritage: since the Exodus from Egypt, through our ancient prophets who sought peace; to the days of modern Israel, which has made some painful concessions in order to fulfill this higher purpose. The poll well demonstrates the frustration of the young Israelis by the reality which former Israeli generations (and Palestinian as well) have led to: 85 percent of the Israelis between ages 18-24 believe that another violent confrontation is the most plausible scenario in the absence of progress in the peace process.When criticizing Israel, it is important to distinguish between the government (which does not represent Israel fully and accurately) and the people. Most Israelis might feel that the food costs are more urgent to solve, they might feel that peace is not within reach, but one thing is indisputable -- their hope for life of genuine peace.In order to promote a future peace agreement, all of us have some obligations to fulfill: we -- the Israelis -- must replace this government with a better one, one that will work on the important challenges Israel's facing and not just on those which may seem more urgent and more influencing on the daily lives. The Israeli sane majority must carry more weight in politics and policy making, and not let the extremists lead the country towards a messianic vision. And what about the world? The world should support and call for direct negotiations and avoid any unilateral steps (such as recognition of a state that can only be established through negotiations). Such steps can only damage the peace process and make the Israelis be more prudent and uneasy as they consider further major steps for peace in a turbulent and raging Middle East."
12,MEDIA,Why Did The Washington Post Name The White House Volunteer Accused In Prostitution Scandal?,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/washington-post-prostitution-scandal_n_5991544.html,,2014-10-18,"FILE - In this Feb. 27, 2008 file photo, The Washington Post building in Washington is shown. The Washington Post Co. reported a 69 percent jump in third-quarter profit Friday, Oct. 30, 2009, as its newspapers trimmed their losses and its cable TV and education divisions held steady.(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta, file)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5c035200000990000dc52.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- On the night of Oct. 8, The Washington Post reported  that White House aides had received information in April 2012 “suggesting that a prostitute was an overnight guest” of a presidential advance team staffer in Cartagena, Colombia, the site of the Secret Service prostitution scandal.The White House quickly dismissed the Post’s story as old news and noted that The Associated Press reported in September 2012 that investigators had “uncovered a hotel record suggesting” an advance team staffer had hired a prostitute in Cartagena. The White House determined at the time that the hotel record wasn’t accurate and cleared the accused of any wrongdoing, according to the AP.The same allegation surfaced in May 2013, when CBS News reported  that a Secret Service agent involved in the scandal said that there was evidence that “a volunteer White House staffer” had brought a prostitute to his room and suggested the staffer was given preferential treatment when it came to investigating the matter. But despite the White House's attempt to downplay the Oct. 8 story, the Post did reveal something new about the former advance staffer: his name.Jonathan Dach, who at the time was a 25-year-old Yale University law student volunteering at The White House and now works under contract for the State Department, has long denied hiring a prostitute in Cartagena. And the Post, even after laying out additional pieces of evidence allegedly implicating Dach, acknowledged it “remains unclear” whether he “was involved in wrongdoing.”So why then did the Post decide to name him now, two and a half years after it broke the news of the scandal and 9 months since reporters began communicating with his attorney? Letters obtained by The Huffington Post show the attorney, Richard Sauber, rebutted the claims and offered countervailing evidence in letters sent to top Post editors. The decision to publish Dach's identity regardless raises questions about the threshold news organizations must meet when revealing the name of someone accused of lurid activity without independently confirming the claims.The Post article relied heavily on information discovered by the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general’s office that suggested Dach may have hired a prostitute. In addition to detailing hotel logs indicating a prostitute was registered at the hotel under his room number, The Post also published the claim of an unnamed Secret Service agent who apparently told investigators he'd seen a woman he ""believed was a prostitute"" with Dach that night, though the paper didn't note when and where the alleged encounter took place. The ""eyewitness"" claim would likely be dismissed in court as circumstantial. The Post maintains that its article didn't attempt to prove one way or another whether Dach hired a prostitute. The story, clocking in at around 3,300 words, looked at the total breadth of the scandal, from the solicitation of prostitutes to the political pressures the administration allegedly applied to subsequent investigations. ""The story was about more than one individual,"" Marty Baron, the Post's executive editor, said in an email to The Huffington Post. ""It shed light on the performance of the White House and senior officials in the aftermath of a major scandal; claims by Secret Service agents of inequitable treatment; conflict between the lead investigator and his superiors at the Department of Homeland Security, along with allegations of political motivations for excising information from his report; and tensions between the White House and Congress on the adequacy of the investigation.""Though The Post did not conclude that Dach hired a prostitute, it nevertheless crafted its story in a way that could give the impression of guilt or impropriety. In the letters, sent to Baron and managing editor Kevin Merida earlier this year, Sauber denied the allegations and expressed concern that the inclusion of Dach's name in a story on the prostitution scandal could significantly damage his professional future. Sauber wrote on Jan. 16 that the publication of the charge ""will be devastating to this young man just as he embarks on his career after law school.""""It will hang over his head through the internet for the next 50 years,"" Sauber said. ""It will affect his job prospects and his reputation forever. Moreover, he has vehemently denied the allegation at every turn and would do so under oath directly to the Post if it would have a material impact on your decision. There is, in my view, no compelling reason for the Post to take this step. We also believe the Post should have an affirmative obligation to investigate and affirm the allegations before it chooses to do such harm.""Carol Leonnig and David Nakamura, the Post reporters who wrote the Oct. 8 story, were copied on the correspondence, along with several Post editors and executives. Sauber met with the Post's editors after the initial letter to express his concerns in person, and in a March letter provided documentation he said contradicted the claims. But some of that documentation did not appear in the Post's story when it was first published online, and was only added later that night. Baron said the information was not put on the record by Dach family spokeswoman Amy Weiss until after the story was posted. Weiss told The Huffington Post she never told The Post the letters were off the record and expected them to be included in the article. Dach, through Weiss, declined to comment to The Huffington Post. Sauber could not be reached for comment. The Post's coverage of the Secret Service scandal in 2012 and its more recent revelations of security lapses in the agency have been widely praised in media circles. Clearly the paper has expended significant resources covering the story, including sending reporters to Cartagena to investigate. Still, it's unclear what specific new information triggered the decision among editors to finally identify Dach last week.Baron argued that the Post learned a lot of new details since communicating with Dach's attorney, telling The Huffington Post that his ""reporters have used the period between the date of those letters and the date of publication to do an enormous amount of additional reporting."" ""It is simply false to say that nothing new was learned subsequent to those letters,"" Baron said. ""The documentation in the story is extensive and speaks for itself. The amount of time devoted to this story attests to the care and thoroughness of our work.""Baron also said The Post offered Dach ""numerous opportunities -- over a long period of time -- to be interviewed, in person or on the phone"" and he declined. Indeed, Dach could have gone on the record to deny the allegations. But doing so would have tied his name to the claims in print, an outcome Sauber was clearly trying to avoid in his letters to the Post.While Dach hasn't spoken publicly about the night in question, here's a closer look at the timeline and evidence revealed by the Post's reporting and Sauber's letters.ArrivalDach arrived at the Hilton Cartagena at around 7 p.m. on April 3, 2012, after leaving New Haven, Connecticut, and traveling for 19 hours on three flights.He left the hotel 10 minutes later in an embassy-supplied car with other White House advance team members and two embassy control officers. They went to dinner at a restaurant called Casa del Soccorro. Dach and his dinner companions returned to the hotel in the embassy cars at around 10:40 p.m. Eight minutes later, Dach texted a friend who had asked about his trip to Colombia: “it is the best I am exhausted,” he wrote.Dach’s lawyer told the Post’s editors in his March 6 letter that he would provide “any documentation we have to support this timeline, and we also suggest that there are multiple sources who can confirm these events.” The Post didn't mention the text message in its initial story, but added that detail shortly after publication, once the family spokeswoman put it on the record.The Hotel LogsA woman arrived at the Hilton that night and was registered as an overnight guest to Dach’s room, number 513, at 12:02 a.m., according to the Post, which independently reviewed the hotel logs. While prostitution is legal in Cartagena, hotels require identification proving that the prostitute is not underage, and so the hotel attached a photocopy of the woman’s ID to Dach's room. The Post reported that investigators found that ""guests must personally register their overnight visitors.""Additionally, the Post reported that ""hotel staff members in Cartagena told federal investigators that they had determined Dach was one of three guests at the Hilton who had additional overnight guests registered to their rooms."" The Post said it reviewed federal records identifying one of the three as ""a White House travel-team member,"" and added that government officials privy to the un-redacted version of the records had confirmed Dach's name was on them.Word of the hotel logs surfaced soon after the scandal. The AP reported over two years ago that ""the White House review found that a guest, perhaps a prostitute, had signed in to visit the same room assigned to that volunteer member of Obama's team."" The Post's story goes into greater detail based on the later investigation, but there still isn't direct evidence presented that Dach himself called for the prostitute, or that she ultimately ended up in his room. There's also precedent for the White House's suggestion that a mix-up could have occurred. The Post acknowledged that at another Cartagena hotel, a “Secret Service agent was erroneously accused of bringing a prostitute to his room” after a woman was registered using his room number. The ‘Eyewitness’The Post reported that an agent told the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general's office that ""he saw Dach with a woman he believed was a prostitute.""Dach's attorney has long objected to the Post's willingness to cite an anonymous agent, arguing in his January letter that the account ""is particularly flimsy unless corroborating evidence exists."" Sauber said that ""it seems as if the Secret Service source isn't saying that he has any proof that the person he saw was an escort -- only that the person looked like one.""Sauber urged the Post reporters to determine what time the alleged sighting took place and whether other embassy personnel or White House advance staffers were present. Presumably, security footage would be able to confirm whether Dach was with a woman that night, prostitute or not, and if the woman who signed in to his room ever arrived there. A Hilton spokesman declined to comment to The Huffington Post on the set-up of security cameras at the Cartagena hotel. Hilton HonorsThe Post reported that the inspector general’s office ""found that hotel officials had waived a fee normally charged to guests staying overnight"" and ""Hilton Worldwide officials in Virginia said their records showed Dach 'was not charged for additional guest'"" because he was a member of the Hilton Honors program.Dach tried to personal obtain information about his records earlier this year.On the afternoon of March 5, Dach emailed a Hilton representative to ask if there were “any additional notes” in his hotel record, such as “records of interactions with or requests made at the front desk,” apparently seeking to prove that he hadn't had a guest. About an hour later, a Hilton representative responded that there were no such records. (The Huffington Post has independently confirmed this exchange). In the March 6 letter to the Post, Sauber said he was attaching a copy of Dach's email exchange with Hilton, ""indicating that there is no notation whatsoever in his hotel guest file indicating anything, let alone an effort to have the late night guest fee waived.”Sauber added that there was nothing in Dach’s Hilton Honors file “to support this allegation either” and provided Dach’s member number so the Post reporters could verify that information for themselves. Like the text message Dach sent to his friend, the Post didn't mention the email exchange in its initial story, but added it in shortly after publication.But not every line of inquiry made it into the final story. Both the Jan. 16 and March 6 letters note that Post reporters were looking into supposed minibar charges that would have suggested Dach had had an overnight guest.The only charge on the bill was $8, spent on mineral water, according to Sauber's letters. He said the minibar charge was “hardly evidence to support a prostitute’s visit.”Read the two letters Dach's attorney sent to The Washington Post: Washington Post LettersClarification: This article has been updated to reflect The Post reported that hotel logs indicated the woman was registered to Dach's room as an overnight guest and not that she independently signed herself in. Also, Weiss's comment that she considered the letters to be on the record before The Post published its story has been added in the text above. "

Dr. Gloria I. Joseph has a treasure trove of memories of the renowned Audre Lorde, her late partner. Joseph's long-awaited new book, The Wind Is Spirit: The Life, Love and Legacy of Audre Lorde, gives us a rare glimpse of Lorde, as told by people who knew Lorde or whose work was greatly impacted by her. Who was Audre Lorde? While I gasp at having to pen such a query, I realize there's a generation who are the beneficiaries of Lorde's prodigious body of work and social activism but don't have a clue who she was.If she were among us today, this ""poet, warrior, feminist, mother, pioneer, lover, survivor"" would be 80 years old. She was born Feb. 18, 1934, in Harlem to Caribbean immigrant parents.I met Lorde in my early 20s after returning home from Wellesley College looking for an LBTQ support group. I was taken to African Ancestral Lesbians United for Societal Change (AALUSC), the first organization for out LBTQ sisters in New York City. Back in the day AALUSC was known as Salsa Soul Sisters, and Lorde facilitated workshops aimed at helping us love ourselves regardless of rejection by family and church.But Lorde's indefatigable spirit fought on many fronts -- and exclusion by white feminists was just one of the battles.The second-wave feminist movement was intentionally an exclusive women's country club. Betty Friedan's upper-crust, ""pumps and pearls""-wearing white women were the audience, and poor white women and women of color -- straight or gay -- had neither voice nor visibility.Lorde not only addressed Friedan's omission of us but called out Mary Daly's hubris in an open letter:To dismiss our Black foremothers may well be to dismiss where european women learned to love. ... What you excluded from Gyn/Ecology dismissed my heritage and the heritage of all other noneuropean women, and denied the real connections that exist between all of us.Lorde was shaping contemporary feminist and womanist thought well before her seminal 1984 book, Sister Outsider, a collection of speeches and essays unflinchingly depicting black lesbian women's lives as interlocking oppressions -- sexism, racism, ageism, homophobia, and classism -- and a clarion call for change and activism:As a Black, lesbian, feminist, socialist, poet, mother of two including one boy and member of an interracial couple, I usually find myself part of some group in which the majority defines me as deviant, difficult, inferior or just plain ""wrong."" From my membership in all of these groups I have learned that oppression and the intolerance of difference come in all shapes and sizes and colors and sexualities; and that among those of us who share the goals of liberation and a workable future for our children, there can be no hierarchies of oppression.Among scholars and activists today, Lorde's depiction of ""hierarchies of oppression"" is lauded as an important theory on intersectionality.Imani Rashid, Lorde's girlhood best friend, shared with me her insights on when Lorde began to recognize the multiple oppressions that affected her. She told me:Audre and I were little girls together. We both grew up in Harlem during the post-World War II era. We both attended the same little Catholic school, St. Mark the Evangelist. Audre was, I believe, at an early age aware of the race, class and gender issues of our times. Even though the school was co-ed, only little boys were selected to be altar boys.Lorde struggled mightily with breast cancer, and her Cancer Journals helped me through my own bouts with the disease. Lorde not only leaves us with a body of work to reflect on but leaves us humbly trying to uphold and implement her vision of radical inclusion and wellness. ""Audre was an eloquent, charismatic revolutionary,"" Rashid told me. ""And while she may have left this dimension, Audre is still being our mentor. She teaches women how to live with the challenges life has to offer.""Dr. Gloria I. Joseph, Lorde's surviving partner (they resided together on Joseph's native island of St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands), is keeping Lorde's legacy alive. Joseph was a firebrand in her day and still is today, despite being in her 80s. Though she's retired now, she was a professor in the School of Social Sciences at Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, and her legacy is not only the school's nationally renowned black-studies department, which she and others developed in the 1970s, but her inimitable pedagogical style of blending scholarship, the arts and activism, which her students so richly enjoyed and still speak about to this day. A photo of me talking about Audre Lorde with Dr. Gloria I. Joseph in St. CroixTogether, Joseph and Lorde, then quite ill with cancer, founded several organizations, including the Che Lumumba School for Truth and the Women's Coalition of St. Croix, to name a few.Joseph and Lorde together produced Hell Under God's Orders, a compilation of wrenching personal accounts of Hurricane Hugo, which devastated St. Croix in 1989, and our government's slow hand in assisting this unincorporated territory of the United States. Lorde's piece, titled ""Of Generators and Survival: A Hugo Letter,"" addressed the devastation and geopolitics of Hugo. Joseph depicts her latest book as a ""bio/anthology"" of Audre Lorde. It is a compilation of essays, photos, and recollections by a diverse group of contributors ruminating on how Lorde impacted their life, work, and activism.In Joseph's typically eclectic, out-of-the box style, her book is also a compilation of the various written genres that Lorde employed throughout her lifetime, and it's narrated in the traditional style of the ""griot,"" a type of West African orator who typically blended history, storytelling, poetry and music.Joseph's book is a must-read not only if you want to carry out Lorde's vision but if you want to help make all our lives better.To learn more about the book, visit the Kickstarter page."

And she shouldn't take the heat for that.",2014-10-17,"Actress Jennifer Lawrence poses for photographs during the photo call for the film Serena, as part of London Film Festival, at the Vue cinema in central London, Monday, Oct. 13, 2014. (Photo by Joel Ryan/Invision/AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5fd4f2100002501c886c0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I recently stumbled across an article by Matt Fradd entitled ""He Doesn't Need Your Sext: A Response To Jennifer Lawrence."" The article addresses (from a highly religious standpoint) the leaked nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence and her response to said photos.I typically try to keep my opinions on situations such as this on the down low, especially when religion enters the mix, but this response article pissed me off to the point that I felt inclined to write a response to Fradd's response.To begin, the title. Of course he doesn't ""need your sext."" He wants it. There is a large difference, not to mention that Lawrence never claimed that the recipient of her photos ""needed"" them. The author puts his foot in his mouth and we've only made it through the title.Fradd begins by stating, ""I don't want to spend time talking about what a stupid idea it is to take and upload explicit photos of yourself (a.k.a. porn)."" Wrong again.First off, Fradd, if that isn't your intent then don't include the ""a.k.a. porn"" jab. And second, no. Just straight up no. Any explicit photo of oneself is not automatically categorized as pornography. Oxford dictionary defines pornography as ""printed or visual material containing the explicit description or display of sexual organs or activity, intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings.""Yes, Lawrence's leaked photos included sexual organs. But who is anyone to say that her intent was to stimulate erotic feelings? Sure, that was probably the case. But no one except Lawrence can or should attest to that.Lawrence is quoted as stating, ""I was in a loving, healthy, great relationship for four years. It was long-distance, and either your boyfriend is going to look at porn or he's going to look at you."" The author attacked Lawrence for this claim, stating he found it ""sexist, false, and sad.""Both claims are extreme -- I can recognize that. Lawrence's claim that he's ""going to look at porn or he's going to look at you"" is broad, as is Fradd's claim that her sentiment is ""sexist, false and sad."" But let's examine Fradd's reasoning behind the ""sexist, false and sad"" claim.Fradd addresses the sexism aspect by countering Lawrence's claim in a ""holier-than-thou"" tone, stating ""It doesn't describe many of the men I know -- men who are virtuous despite the temptations the world throws at them, who fight valiantly against selfishness, and desire to love the women they're with as Christ loved the Church.""Oh please. Come on. Sexism exists for a reason. Hell, Lawrence is probably correct in that most males will view porn in the absence of female presence. No male, no human for that matter, can act as if they have never lusted after something or someone. Not to mention, no one ""fights valiantly"" anymore. Fradd's response is a mechanism to make himself feel as if he is surrounded by the right people, people who live and love in the name of Christ. Sorry Fradd, but those people are still men, and men (as do women) occasionally think about sex with someone other than their partner -- it's involuntary.Fradd then addresses the falsity of her claim, stating ""And by 'look at you,' I assume she doesn't mean, 'look at you while you're praying the rosary on your evening walk together.'"" No shit, Sherlock. She uses that phrase in the same sentence as the word porn -- of course she means ""look at you"" as in look at and appreciate your nude body. No one is denying that, including Lawrence. Fradd argues that Lawrence addresses the situation as ""either/or"" when in reality there is a third option -- chastity. Yes, chastity, right in line with ""fighting valiantly.""Fradd goes on to state, ""A person who cultivates the virtue of chastity is one who is in control of their sexual desire, rather than their sexual desire being in control of him or her."" I'm sorry, but I do not know a single person who is literally controlled by their sexual desire. Swayed by it, maybe. Controlled, no. Lack of control implies addiction, in which case that person probably needs help. Fradd fails yet again at proving Lawrence's claim ""false.""And third, her claim as ""sad."" Lawrence's statement is not sad. It is realistic. Fradd writes, ""It's as if she's resigned herself to the belief that men are weak and lustful and so the best you can hope for is that they'll lust over you instead of the women in porn."" Well... men are weak and lustful. So are women. It is a human fault.But finally Fradd makes a point I can agree with: ""She at least doesn't want a man she dates to lust over other women. That is, she wants a love that is faithful and exclusive."" DUH. So do most people I know who are in a four-year relationship, like Lawrence was. At least he could pick up on that much.Fradd ends on this holier-than-thou note: ""It is our work to be examples today. You can show the world that there is a better, healthier way to love. True love is not resigned to the inevitability of lust. True love does not mean you need to take off your clothes so that your boyfriend or girlfriend will remain faithful to you. True love is found in the freedom of chastity.""I hate to break it to you buddy, but part of ""true love"" is a sexual relationship, and if I recall, that requires taking clothes off -- maybe not in the name of remaining faithful, but still. Lawrence was only trying to keep the spark in her relationship alive, and chastising her for that through religious angles achieves nothing.If Lawrence wants to send nude photos to someone she has been in a long-term, long-distance relationship with, more power to her. She's hot, she's confident -- she should feel comfortable sending photos without fear of her privacy being impeded.The bottom line of this entire scandal is not Lawrence's actions and the religious morals behind them, but the actions of the person or persons who invaded her privacy and allowed the world to see a very personal, private side of her.And she shouldn't take the heat for that."

Famous as the 17-year co-host on Good Morning America in the ‘80s and ‘90s, Lunden later transformed into a healthy living guru and businesswoman who inspires everyone she touches.She came to talk to the gathered boomer-and-beyond crowd about caregiving — a role she had played with her mother, who died in 2013. But with bright eyes and a perfectly coifed hairstyle, Lunden said she wanted first to address “the elephant in the room.” A month earlier, Lunden, 64, had gone public with the news that she was one of the 232,670 new cases of breast cancer among women in the U.S. She told the group that she had just finished 12 weeks of chemotherapy and would enter another round in a couple of weeks. As she smiled at the supportive crowd, Lunden seemed strong and vulnerable at the same time.Triumphs and ChallengesLunden’s life has been a series of triumphs and challenges. As a young girl, she lost her father, a cancer surgeon, in a plane crash. As she began her career as a TV broadcast journalist 30 years ago, she also became a caregiver both to her brother, who had health complications from type 2 diabetes, and to her mother, who was eventually diagnosed with dementia. What Lunden didn’t know at the time, she says, is that caring for her brother and mother simultaneously is when her caregiving journey began. After GMA, she became a health advocate, writing books, making speeches and continuing to bring her California-girl sunshine to the masses, all the while crisscrossing the country from her East Coast home to the brother and mother who needed her care on the West Coast.After divorcing her first husband, Lunded found love again with current husband, Jeff Konigsberg, only to face infertility issues and opt for surrogacy to have her last four children (two sets of twins who joined Lunden’s three older daughters from her first marriage).  An Optimistic NatureI met Lunden in 2010 when she interviewed me as a caregiving expert on a special RLTV program called Taking Care with Joan Lunden. Since then, I have interviewed her a few times and have always been amazed by her boundless energy, her “you can do it” attitude and her genuine interest in people and their lives. Although Lunden's own life reads like a Lifetime movie, her roller-coaster ride has never affected her exuberance.Lunden credits her parents for her optimism. She said, “My mom was the ultimate positive thinker and my dad was a doer.”It is this positive outlook that makes Lunden a life force which I know will help her conquer breast cancer and is what made her a model caregiver. Her education as a caregiver is now empowering her as a cancer warrior.For instance, Lunden told me she had felt guilt over not moving her mother closer during her final years. Eventually, Lunden realized a move would not have solved anything. Lunden was traveling constantly and would not have had much more time to care for her mother even if she had lived down the street. The staff at the California dementia-care home where her mom lived reminded Lunden that the periods between visits were inconsequential to someone with dementia who has lost the ability to understand space and time.Lunden also expressed guilt over being diagnosed with breast cancer. Advocating for healthy eating much of her adult life, she says she felt that somehow she must have done something wrong along the way. But guilt can sap energy, Lunden realized. She also understands that the strength and energy she now needs to battle cancer is similar to the stamina she needed to care for her loved ones. Letting go of guilt is the ingredient for a strong emotional core during caregiving challenges.Finding the Silver LiningsLunden also looks for the silver linings in life — a lesson all caregivers need to heed in order to push through difficult and overwhelming feelings.Lunden realized she had to let go of trying to bring her mother back into her daughter's world. When she showed her mother photos of her grown daughters, her mom would express confusion or lack of interest in not knowing these people. Lunden then realized she had to step into her mom’s world.So when she swapped the photos with ones of her and her brother as children and included some of her parents as young newlyweds, her mother’s face lit up. Along the way, Lunden learned new things about her parent’s early life that she felt she would have missed if her mother did not have the cognitive impairment that made them both refresh memories from long ago.Regarding her own cancer, Lunden said her silver lining is in recognizing the irony of losing her adored father who was a cancer surgeon. His plane crashed returning from a conference where he was training other cancer doctors. When Lunden was first diagnosed, she pondered whether to go public about it. As she told the AARP crowd, “I thought it was ridiculous I could stay private with this news — it would break somehow. But my second thought was: I had always wanted to follow in my dad's footsteps and become a surgeon, but scalpels and blades where not my thing. However, my dad gave his life training others about cancer — now I can follow his footsteps and do the same thing.”As I look at the beautiful, bold, bald cover photo of Lunden on this week’s People magazine, it is clear she is our teacher, our healer, our cheerleader and our role model in caregiving and in caring for ourselves.Read more from Next Avenue: 8 rules for getting hired today Transforming life as we age Overcome 3 obstacles to start your own business"

Each of the new editions of Vice News will feature ""in-depth video and editorial content, including international reporting, recurring franchises, short-form and feature-length documentaries, Vine and Instagram, and live-streaming"" from major events, the company said in the release.The expansion comes just a few months after the March launch of the Vice News channel itself. The company says the channel has since garnered 150 million video views and one million subscribers, according to The Guardian.In September, Bloomberg reported that Vice Media had received a $500 million investment from Silicon Valley's Technology Crossover Ventures and A+E Networks, each of which took a 10 percent stake in the company. Vice Media founder and CEO Shane Smith told Reuters at the time that the investment would help the company both develop more content and get it out to more platforms. Chatting about the hefty investment earlier this month, Smith told the International Business Times that the company was definitely planning to expand.   “We’re going to be hiring a lot of people. If anybody wants a job they should apply at Vice,” he said.This post has been updated with information from Vice Media's news release."

But the conversation on this issue is often one-sided, focused narrowly on why there aren't more low- and middle-income students enrolled. Equally troubling is what happens to these students when they manage to get in the door. Without targeted support and resources, they face a significant uphill battle.The lack of economic diversity in top-tier higher education is real. A May 17 New York Times column cites figures that show ""roughly 75 percent of the students at the 200 most highly rated colleges came from families in the top quartile of income,"" while ""only 5 percent came from families in the bottom quartile."" The financial impediments to attending a top university are significant, even for many in the middle class. That's why investing in financial aid, at levels great enough to support success through graduation, is imperative.The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is bucking these trends. Despite losing more than 30 percent of our recurring state appropriations between 2008 and 2013, at UNC-Chapel Hill we have maintained our commitment to affordability and attainment. Nearly half of Carolina's 18,000 undergraduates receive aid, and we are one of the few public universities that is both need-blind and covers full financial need. As a result, The New York Times recently ranked Carolina the third most economically diverse ""top"" university in the country. And 13 times, Kiplinger has named us the best value in American public universities.Many people ask me how a public university like Carolina has been able to provide an excellent education while ensuring affordability. I tell them it requires making tough but worthwhile choices, choices made by generations of leaders at our university and across our state. It also relies on a commitment from taxpayers, alumni and donors who believe in the American dream: that opportunity is worth paying for; that talent and potential come from all backgrounds; and that excellence should be the standard for all students. Getting this right, not only at our top privates, but also at our nation's great publics (where two-thirds of Pell grant recipients and more than 70 percent of American students overall attend college) and historically black colleges and universities, is essential to our nation's future. One of the ways we fulfill our commitment to meet financial need is through the Carolina Covenant, an innovative program that promises a debt-free college education to students from the lowest income families (the median reported family income of participants is $27,497). Why is ""debt-free"" so important? First, it sends a message to low- and middle-income families that college is financially possible; the sticker shock of tuition and loans, even for a school with tuition as low as Carolina's, can discourage many students from applying. No-loan financial aid packages are also known to foster persistence and higher graduation rates, and they give recipients freedom to pursue their dream career without the burden of loan repayment.But financial support alone will not solve the problem. More students are going to college than ever before, yet low- and middle-income college students often struggle once they arrive. A recent College Board report found that ""among students who began their postsecondary studies in 2003-04, 58 percent of dependent students from the highest family income quartile"" earned bachelor's degrees by 2009, while just ""26 percent of those with family incomes below $30,489"" did.While finances may play some part in lower graduation rates, they are only part of the story. That's why Carolina and other schools are investing in support systems that can enable academic and professional success for all students. Carolina Covenant scholars, for example, are assigned a faculty or staff mentor and a peer mentor, and take part in workshops on topics such as time management, studying for math and science, and budgeting. We are moving to extend these same support services to other students who receive need-based financial aid, and in time to the student body more generally.We've also started ""flipping"" classrooms to increase interaction between students and professors. A recent study by one of our professors revealed that, while all students benefit, flipping large lecture science classes benefits first-generation college students most, for whom the achievement gap is completely erased, and black students, for whom the gap is cut in half.With financial aid that meets full need, appropriate support systems and innovative teaching techniques, we've seen real improvement. Before we launched the Carolina Covenant in 2003, just 56.7 percent of students who would be eligible for the Covenant graduated within four years. As of last year, the four-year graduation rate of Covenant scholars was 76.6 percent. The graduation rate of black men in the Covenant program more than doubled. Our early Covenant graduates are already paying it forward -- and backwards -- with several scholars now putting their own parents through college. The value of a college degree remains high, as two Federal Reserve Bank of New York researchers underscored recently with a report that finds that the value of a degree has held around $300,000 for more than a decade. That makes it even more important that our responsibility to low- and middle-income students not stop at enrollment; it must continue through graduation -- and beyond."
