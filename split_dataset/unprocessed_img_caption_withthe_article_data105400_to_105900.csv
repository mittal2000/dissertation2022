(Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cf830c92100004011e6b05b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The following post contains spoilers about ""Interstellar.""Back in August of 2013, Indiewire's The Playlist reported Matt Damon had signed on for a small role in Christopher Nolan's new film, ""Interstellar."" The story was soon picked up by Entertainment Weekly, Variety, TheWrap, Business Insider, Moviefone, io9, Slashfilm and The Huffington Post, among many other sites. Damon himself, meanwhile, talked about the ""Interstellar"" role in interviews with MTV and Hitfix earlier this year. ""I don't have a big part,"" he said to MTV in January. ""I was thrilled to be able to work with Chris and I had a blast working with him."" The actor even referenced his time spent working with ""Interstellar"" star Matthew McConaughey in an interview with David Letterman.But Damon's name has been completely absent from the film's marketing campaign and reviews. His appearance has gone from public knowledge to a huge ""Interstellar"" spoiler. In Joe McGovern's critique of ""Interstellar"" for Entertainment Weekly, Damon isn't cited, except as an ""A-list actor whose identity Nolan has kept secret."" Dana Stevens at Slate referenced Damon simply as ""one surprising sign of life."" (Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter echoed Stevens' language, referring to an unnamed Damon as a ""surprise presence."") Discussing the film's Oscar chances, HitFix In Contention editor Kris Tapley acknowledged Damon in this way: ""... and a famous actor whose cameo apparently isn't widely known despite the fact that he's talked about it on camera (on Letterman and here at HitFix), well, he's pretty memorable, too."" New York Times critic A.O. Scott even made reference to signing a nondisclosure agreement before seeing the film. ""Forget about telling you what happens,"" Scott wrote in his review. ""I'm not even supposed to tell you who's in the thing, aside from the people you've seen on magazine covers."" Of major critics, only David Edelstein, writing for New York, flat out announced Damon's presence: ""Matt Damon pops up on an ice planet to look shifty and bite his lip to keep from breaking into his peerless McConaughey impression."" (An article posted by Business Insider also revealed Damon's involvement, but noted his cameo was a ""surprise."")Along with J.J. Abrams, Nolan is one of the biggest proponents of film secrecy. He takes this very seriously. (The Wall Street Journal reported that Nolan wanted Warner Bros. executives to ""punish"" the person responsible for leaking news about the ""Dark Knight Rises"" sound mix.) That attitude didn't change for ""Interstellar,"" which Nolan kept under strict wraps, even with regard to how the film was screened for journalists and critics. But the decision to pretend Damon's association with ""Interstellar"" didn't already exist just feels like an overreach that takes away from the film. At a public screening of ""Interstellar"" on Friday night in New York, Damon's initial appearance made audience some members unintentionally laugh. What was the goal here? There are plenty of actors in ""Interstellar,"" and Damon is just one of them; knowing he appears in the film before seeing it is on par with knowing Topher Grace does too. (Topher Grace is in ""Interstellar,"" btw.) Neither of these revelations affect the overall viewing experience of ""Interstellar."" It shouldn't spoil anything to know people are in the movie.""We all want to unwrap our Christmas presents early,"" Nolan said about spoilers in an interview with the New York Times. ""But we all know we'll be disappointed if we do.""In the case of Damon, the present was unwrapped 15 months ago by The Playlist. Then again in January by Damon himself. Nolan's a master in many ways, but even he should know better than to try and regift."

And yet, I would contend that if we focus only on the external -- on gender equality as a measure of the numbers of women having reached positions long dominated by men -- we are missing the point. Let me explain. More than 60 years ago, Indian yogi Sri Aurobindo declared that, ""If there is to be a future, it will wear the crown of feminine design."" This emphasis on feminine design, offers us an interesting insight. It invites us to shift our focus from women to the feminine, from the external, to the internal. From seeing gender equality as a measure of the opportunities given to women respective to men, to understanding it as the balance in the masculine and feminine energies at play within ourselves.This shift in perspective is critical and enlightening. It suggests that the prevalent subjugation of women in many parts of the world is only possible because of our internal imbalance when it comes to the feminine. It is a symptom, which indicates the extent to which most of us have been conditioned to view everything female and feminine as being worth less than their male or masculine counterparts. This applies not only to the fact of being a woman, but also to the feminine qualities within us: our intuition, our capacity to feel, connect, collaborate and empathize, all of which are deemed less valuable than our masculine qualities of rational thinking, analysis, action and control.Instead of embracing these as complementary aspects of our being, we have raised one half on a pedestal and built our societies on top of it. The resulting dismissal of the feminine is alive and well. It is the subconscious voice that classifies as not quite good enough whatever a woman does, and any feminine behaviors and attitudes, which deviate from the blueprint of what is considered worthwhile on the road to success and recognition.This internalized gender hierarchy is so subtle and so pervasive that most of us don't even know how strongly we subscribe to it. And when we open our eyes to it, we prefer to deny it, rather than have the courage to consciously reclaim our whole selves, by cleaning out our inner structures and core beliefs from centuries of conditioning.There is more: this subdual of and disconnection from the inner feminine, has lead not only to the pervasive abuse and domination of women's bodies, but also to the abuse and domination of our planet, the source of life par excellence. How could it otherwise be possible for us to participate in a system built on infinite growth and consumption, whereby it is justifiable to plunder the resources of the Earth, without giving our planet sufficient time to restore the soil, replenish the aquifers, and regrow the forests, all of which constitute our most basic life-support system?There is no doubt -- as long as we are able to extricate ourselves from the grip of denial - that we are at a point in history, where the future will be very different from what we have known. And for many living beings, there will be no future at all. In this age of accelerating environmental destruction and economic collapse, we are called to re-think, re-feel, and re-design our connection and relationship with all of life.And I would contend that all of it hinges on a critical aspect: our capacity to reclaim the Feminine -- from within. To close the inner gender gap and bring ourselves and the world back into balance, by embracing and equally valuing all aspects of our innermost selves.This is the challenge for all of us -- whether we happen to walk the Earth in the body of a woman or that of a man."

No one will want to embrace the economic policies and politics of Andrew Cuomo.",2014-11-07,"NEW YORK, NY - OCTOBER 16: New York Governor Andrew Cuomo speaks at a meeting with city representatives on New York's planned response to an Ebola case on October 16, 2014 in New York City. While there have been no cases of Ebola in New York as yet, the governor has designated eight hospitals that would handle suspected cases of the epidemic. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8dc7b200000c70101d4c9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Twice before in the last 60 days I've posted pieces with the above title. It was true then and it's true now.Normally a 13-point win in a down year for Democrats would be good news for the victor. But the Cuomo campaign and his overarching strategy of the past four years were political disasters of a kind you rarely see.Remember 1) he raised close to $50 million, 10 times his opposition; 2) he had been widely praised for bringing functionality back to New York; 3) New York is reliably blue. One Republican statewide victory and 19 Democratic victories since 2000; 4) he had cajoled and bullied business, labor and the Legislature into submission; no one had ever heard of his opponent; and 5) going into 2014 his poll numbers were excellent.In spite of all this, he ended up with a primary that was embarrassingly close, a general election that was 10 points worse than his last run and a resurgent progressive third party -- the Green Party, of all things. Editorial boards either opposed him or explicitly held their noses and endorsed him. His campaign appearances were sour and depressing and voter turnout was the lowest in 85 years.What happened? The easy answer is to blame style and an overbearing persona. It's true, to an extent, but that stuff is inside baseball, beloved of the chattering class but not particularly relevant to voters.The real reason is a political and public policy bet Cuomo made in 2010, on the heels of an overwhelming victory in the year the tea party crested. In Keystone Kops version of Clinton triangulation, he did two things: On social and identity issues like guns, abortion rights and gay marriage, he moved directly and energetically to the left, twisted arms, led the debate and got laws passed that would make Teddy Kennedy look like a moderate. On economic issues, he moved just as strongly to the right, becoming a supply-side, austerity bug that Paul Ryan would love. He cut the estate tax for a few thousand rich families, eliminated the bank tax, cut income taxes for those making over $300,000, diminished school aid and social spending, and opened the treasury to massive corporate subsidies.It didn't play. New York was the place that invented the New Deal. It's important to deal with historical and ongoing injustices to social and identity groups. But intellectually and politically, ITES (It's The Economy, Stupid). A progressive social message, if coupled with Herbert Hoover economic policies, is neither good government nor good politics. Democrat voters got it and moved to his primary opponent, or the Green Party, or stayed home in droves.In the moment it was a bad day for Democrats, for progressive Mayor Bill de Blasio and for the unions and Working Family Party types that had been pushing New York to confront income inequality, progressive taxation and collapsing human and physical infrastructure. In the longer term it's a stern message from voters that austerity and supply-side economics are bad policy and bad politics. Even in Republican states like South Dakota, Nebraska, Alaska and Arkansas voters strongly supported demand-side increases in the minimum wage. In a Democratic state like New York, with FDR hovering over us all, the future is with those who restore economic and political balance, create good paying jobs, enable people who work for a living to earn enough to raise families.Austerity and supply-side economics don't work to create jobs and they don't work with voters. As 2016 looms, Hillary and the insightful Republicans will figure out how to deal with all that, in different ways, but deal with it they will. After Tuesday no one will want to embrace the economic policies and politics of Andrew Cuomo."

It actually marked him as a freak.” The show's ninth appearance will see a return of the gasp-inducing appendage which, O'Hare added, is also symbolic of the character's sexuality. “It marks Stanley as abnormal,"" he said. ""Being a gay [man] in the 1950s is abnormal. It’s an exploration of what is normal.”Titled ""Pink Cupcakes,"" the fifth episode of ""American Horror Story: Freak Show"" was certainly not lacking in gay appeal. Dell the Strong Man (played by Michael Chiklis) was revealed to have been engaged in an affair with a male hustler, Andy (guest star Matt Bomer). Andy later met a grisly fate at the hands of Finn Wittrock's Dandy, but not before both hunks stripped to their underpants. "

They grew up here on the Pine Ridge Reservation. If they hadn't, maybe they wouldn't have known about the 1890 massacre at Wounded Knee. That's because Wounded Knee, the most famous catastrophe in Native history, is rarely taught in U.S. schools. Sometimes I wonder if Americans know more about what's happening in Hollywood than they do about what happened right here in South Dakota.Our little house was two miles from the spot where Chief Big Foot and his band of 300 followers were captured by the U.S. Army and herded into nearby Wounded Knee. It was late December 1890 and the temperature was below zero. Big Foot was supposed to be leading his people to safety, but he had TB and was coughing blood in the snow. He had to be transported by travois. That slowed the caravan that was fleeing the soldiers. They were refugees on their own land, and Wounded Knee would be their final stop.Eighty-three years later, in the winter of 1973, over 200 Lakotas and members of the American Indian Movement (AIM) seized the village of Wounded Knee to demand human and treaty rights. Hundreds of federal agents and U.S. soldiers surrounded the little village, armored personnel carriers patrolled the perimeter and fighter jets swooped overhead. For 71 days, our government carried out military operations against Indian people. The takeover electrified Indian Country and caught the attention of the world.Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee had just come out. Soon, copies of the book were flying off the shelves. Indian and non-Indian people from across the country mobilized to support the action. I was a teenager then. I followed my activist parents to Wounded Knee. It changed our lives forever.It's hard to describe the horrific memories of 1890 that were still fresh in 1973. In those days, you could talk to Lakota elders who were just one generation removed from the ""Indian wars,"" when our government paid a bounty for the scalp of a ""redskin."" So with all the publicity surrounding the Wounded Knee occupation, we thought the dirty little secret of American genocide was finally out of the bag. After that, we had hoped that school children would be learning about the dark side of Manifest Destiny. Especially the toll it took on Indian people. But that didn't happen.It's true that the 71-day occupation of Wounded Knee -- probably the longest civil disorder in U.S. history since the Civil War -- brought national attention to the oppression of Indian people. And it's true that it pumped new energy and leadership into the tribal sovereignty movement. All that resulted in sweeping changes in federal Indian policy: the Indian Self-Determination Act, the Indian Child Welfare Act, and the Indian Freedom of Religion Act, the Indian Higher Education Act. And even the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. Wounded Knee 1973 did not end the oppression, but it strengthened our will to resist it.Regrettably, the U.S. government never has apologized for the massacre of those 300 civilians in 1890. Nor has the Pentagon recalled the more than 20 Congressional Medals of Honor awarded to the soldiers who participated.But the Wounded Knee occupation inspired a national movement, one that is still growing today. Just last Sunday, 5,000 people in Minnesota protested the racist name of the NFL football team from Washington D.C.. Another example can be found in the grassroots movement of Lakotas who today are trying to stop the Keystone XL pipeline from crossing Native Lands. There are many other examples.Three weeks into the 1973 occupation, the U.S. Justice Department barred the media from entering Wounded Knee to interview the occupiers. Suddenly, there were no journalists to provide a record -- except from the government side. Because of the blackout, academics, pundits and federal agents today still argue about the truth of what happened in 1973 inside Wounded Knee. And more than 40 years later, some critics still belittle or try to negate the gains of the Indian movement. And no professional -- someone trained to report conflict and to comment on history -- has managed to give us an inside, eyewitness account.Until now.In 1973 Kevin McKiernan was a young NPR reporter who didn't think the media should be embedded on one side. He defied the news embargo, walked 10 miles overland at night, penetrated the cordon of agents and soldiers around Wounded Knee and made his way into the village. He stayed until the end, smuggling out reports and film. McKiernan went on to cover wars in Central America and, more recently, in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria. Now he has a new film on the way called Wounded Knee: A Line in the Sand (shot in part by the legendary Haskell Wexler). McKiernan is a non-Indian. You can disagree with his conclusions. But he was there.After Wounded Knee, we broke free of the dependence on outside reporting. For years, members of the Oglala Lakota tribe and the American Indian Movement worked hard to build KILI Radio (90.1 FM).In 1983, we became the first 100,000 watt Native American community-owned radio station in America. More than 30 years later, KILI Radio is still on the air.Now that's progress.Mark Tilsen is the president and co-founder of Native American Natural Foods, maker of the Tanka Bar.

5,POLITICS,Treasury Department Endorses Student Loan Deals Slammed By Elizabeth Warren,Shahien Nasiripour,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sarah-bloom-raskin-student-loans_n_6117960.html,,2014-11-07,"Democrat Elizabeth Warren campaigns for the U.S. Senate at a senior housing complex in Quincy, Mass., Tuesday Oct. 16, 2012. Warren is running against U.S. Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass. Tuesday, Oct. 16, 2012. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8dc6d240000510098f7c9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"TAMPA, Fla. -- The U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday praised a move, already panned by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), to increase the amount of money the federal government pays its student loan contractors.In a speech here to consumer rights advocates, Deputy Treasury Secretary Sarah Bloom Raskin said her colleagues at the Education Department had recently boosted the amounts paid to companies that handle borrowers’ monthly payments in hopes that better financial incentives will drive them to improve their customer service and work harder to help borrowers avoid costly loan defaults. These companies include Nelnet Inc. and Navient Corp., the former loan servicing arm of student loan giant Sallie Mae.What Raskin neglected to mention Thursday is that taxpayers will fund a bump in pay for the student loan servicers even if their performance does not improve.In September, under withering questioning from Warren, a top Education Department official conceded that the companies will get more money regardless of any changes they make to their operations. At the time, the senator was incredulous. “Let me get this straight: You break the law. You don't follow the rules. You treat the borrowers badly,"" Warren said of the loan servicers. ""And you all just renegotiated the contracts to make sure that across the portfolio, [loan servicers] are going to make a little more money if nothing changes?""""The idea of the renegotiation was to help the borrowers, not to make the servicers richer,"" Warren told William Leith, chief business officer for the Education Department's Office of Federal Student Aid, which handles student loans.With unpaid student debt approaching $1.3 trillion during an era of stagnant wages and low employment, federal agencies including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Reserve and Treasury Department have taken an increased interest in the potential fallout from educational loans. Private-sector advisers ranging from chief executives of banks to Wall Street’s top traders warn that rising loan balances could inhibit U.S. economic growth.Some federal officials beyond the Education Department are concerned that inadequate loan servicing -- the process of working with borrowers to place them in appropriate repayment plans and collecting their monthly payments -- may be exacerbating the problem as Americans take longer and devote more of their earnings to repaying student loans. The more money that households devote to paying off student loans, the less they have to buy houses, start small businesses or save for retirement.A recent survey by the Federal Reserve revealed that nearly half of Americans said they had to curb their spending last year in order to make payments on student loans. Survey respondents with student loans also were more likely to say they had avoided medical treatment because they couldn't afford it.Citing borrowers’ complaints on Thursday, Raskin said the Education Department’s contractors have provided them with “inadequate” information on repayment options and failed to enroll them in federal repayment plans tailored to their income. The White House has championed the availability of income-based plans as one of the main ways the administration has aided middle-class households.The Education Department's new contracts with the loan servicing companies that hiked their pay are a “useful step to shape and improve the incentives in student loan servicing and drive better borrower outcomes,” Raskin said.Raskin’s hope contrasts with the approach favored by some Democratic lawmakers, consumer advocates, state colleges, student groups and organized labor, who all have complained about shoddy treatment of borrowers and pushed the department to penalize companies that violate borrowers’ rights.Navient, the former Sallie Mae unit, came under particularly harsh criticism after the Justice Department in May accused the company of intentionally cheating some 60,000 active-duty troops out of roughly $60 million on their student loans, which included debts overseen by the Education Department. The company settled the allegations by agreeing to refund aggrieved troops. It neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing, and spokeswoman Patricia Christel declined to comment for this story.In December, the Education Department told Warren that it had declined to levy any fines against Navient's former parent company related to its secret determinations that Sallie Mae over the previous decade had harmed borrowers and incorrectly billed the government, among other servicing failures. At the time, the department dismissed those various findings as “compliance issues.""But as a result of the contract change praised by Raskin, Navient could receive an additional 15 percent in annual revenue from taxpayers, according to an estimate that Michael Tarkan, an analyst at Washington-based Compass Point Research & Trading, made in a September report to clients. The Education Department also recently rewarded Navient with more taxpayer-provided business despite the Justice Department accusations.“I do not understand a basic renegotiation that says you can continue breaking the law, but we're going to pay you more money for doing it,” Warren said in September during her exchange with Leith of the Education Department.A few weeks after that exchange, during the second of three speeches she has delivered since April focused on student debt, Raskin said there is a “great deal of integrity and stability in the student loan market.”After listening to Raskin’s speech on Thursday, Joshua R.I. Cohen, a lawyer who represents borrowers with student loans, said he had to bite his tongue to avoid laughing during her remarks.While Raskin detailed how the Obama administration had attempted to fix problems in student loan servicing and suggested there would be “rigorous” enforcement to ensure borrowers aren’t mistreated, Cohen said, only one thought popped into his mind: “How can you say that when Navient is getting rewarded?” "
6,COMEDY,Nick Offerman Is Ready To Hang Up His Mustache,Katla McGlynn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nick-offerman-parks_n_5968658.html,,2014-11-06,"PARKS & RECREATION -- 'Farmers Market' Episode 612 -- Pictured: (l-r) Jim O'Heir as Jerry, Nick Offerman as Ron Swanson -- (Photo by: Chris Haston/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bad44ce1f00002e012298a6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Like it or not, the final season of ""Parks And Recreation"" means saying goodbye to one of TV's most dynamic cast of characters and their office patriarch, Ron Swanson.Nick Offerman turned Ron's mustache into an icon of hyper-manliness and made us appreciate the simple things in life, like camping, woodworking and bacon. But when ""Parks And Rec"" comes to a close after Season 7, he's looking forward to retiring his beloved character and moving on to new things. With a second book in the works and his New York Comedy Festival show ""Full Bush""coming to the Beacon Theater on Nov. 8, Offerman is keeping busy while he deals with the bittersweet emotions of his sitcom's final lap.Is there a different feeling on set now that it's the final season? Sure. Our writing continues to be the best stuff and we're still having a great time doing as funny of material as we've ever done. That is a great palliative, while inside we are all beginning to feel grief and sadness and the bereft feeling that will come all too soon when we turn off the lights in December.It will certainly be the end of an era. Watching my wife do ""Will And Grace"" all those years, I was so aware that it's probably easier to win the New Jersey Powerball than it is to land a comedy show on television that has writing you can hold your head up about -- and is being made by a group of people who love one another. It's incredibly rare. [The ""Parks & Rec"" cast] is very much in that situation and knowing that it has to come to an end will, undoubtedly, bring us all to our knees.Speaking of your wife, will we see more Tammy drama this season? I can't remember, to be honest. There has been so much going on ... I can't remember any details about the upcoming episodes [laughs]. When it comes to Tammy, I think, ""Oh yeah there was --"" and then I'm like ""No, that was a wet dream I had."" I get really bamboozled trying to keep reality straight with the different role-playing fantasies that we get into around our house.I can see how that could get confusing. Are you writing or directing any episodes this season? No, with a foreshortened season of 13 episodes, they didn't have any room for any freshman, like myself, or even a sophomore, I might be by now. Many actually qualified participants scooped up all the slots long before they got down to where I reside at the bottom of the barrel.When the big flash-forward was revealed at the end of last season, did that come as a surprise to the cast or did you know that it was coming? We usually hear or know about big moves like that. The interesting thing is whether or not we will stay flashed-forward in the final season, which now for the life of me I can't remember how that goes. It's been a while [laughs]. But yeah, [the flash-forward] was a lot of fun. I think that worked really well as a joke. It will be interesting to see how it plays out.When ""Parks And Recreation"" ends, are you looking to do more TV, movies, or do you have a preference? I don't, I just hope that I'll be able to perform in more good writing in the future. I always have a couple little indie movies lined up, of the Sundance flavor, but right now I'm just looking for a nap. I've got a show that I'm touring, ""Full Bush,"" that's a lot of fun. My wife and I have a show called ""Summer of 69"" -- no apostrophe -- that we're going to be touring next year. And I'm finishing up my second book. The one thing I know I don't want to do anytime soon is another TV series, because even if it was with the greatest team I could assemble, it would necessarily have to be a disappointment after the ridiculously pleasurable ride of ""Parks And Recreation.""Like having a rebound after a real relationship ends. Yeah, I think if I wait a while and I begin to hanker again for that kind of fix ... Maybe. But until then, I think I'll be satisfying myself with film and stage work.Tell me about ""Full Bush,"" are you excited to play the Beacon Theater? Yeah, I'm really excited to play the Beacon. I have befouled many stages on the East Coast, but I have not yet had the challenge of filling a room of this magnitude with my particular odor. I've been training, conditioning my system and I'll do my best to reach the back row.Is music a big part of this show? Well, music is a generous description for what I do with the guitar and my voice. I do quote-unquote ""sing"" songs and play the guitar. I've always enjoyed a stupid comedy song so I fully indulge that itch in ""Full Bush."" I also recently made my first ukulele out of mahogany, so that's in the show.That's impressive! Well, eventually I'll try my hand at making guitars, so I thought I'd start small. It's the kindergarten of luthiery. So I do a few songs on that; I talk about making things with your hands -- that seems to be a recurring theme with me -- and then there's just a whole lot of material on pubic hair.Like, manscaping? The abomination of manscaping is mentioned, yes. That is quite the opposite of my bag.Somehow that doesn't surprise me. Do you ever feel typecast as an icon of ""manliness"" because of Ron Swanson? I think it's definitely silly since it's something that I certainly have never pursued, nor is it a way I would ever describe myself. I feel like a big, simpering fop. So, yeah, once Ron Swanson took hold, I just started immediately looking for roles that aren't like Ron Swanson. As an actor, I don't want to play just one channel. I think once the mustache is retired, there will be a whole other spectrum of roles with which to displease the fans of Ron Swanson.Right, fans don't always understand the desire to end a show or character with dignity. No, they don't. We'll see what happens, but I would reassure them that if I were to do the opposite and try to just play Ron Swanson-like roles, that would be even more disappointing. Either way, you're not ever going to get Ron Swanson again. That will have been a golden moment, on behalf of the writers of my show. They created this incredible vehicle with which I was able to drive and -- just like seeing a good piece of theater -- when it's over, you can never have it again. That's what makes it magical.So, we can't expect a Ron Swanson spinoff anytime soon. Not that I know of. I've always felt that parts like Ron Swanson work a lot better as a spice rather than an entree."
