The story goes about a man shaking William Jennings Bryan's hand after one of the Great Commoner's speeches. ""When you ran for president in 1896 I rode ten miles on the back of a mule to hear you speak"", the man explained. ""Thank you,"" Bryan replied. ""Then, when you ran in 1900 I rode twenty miles to listen."" The former candidate mumbled his thanks. ""Why then in 1908, when you ran again, I actually rode thirty miles on the back of a mule to hear you."" Truly humbled, Bryan expressed profound gratitude. ""And if I weren't a Republican,"" the man cheerfully added, ""I would have voted for you.""Thus, throughout most of the twentieth century, parties were important institutions in America, and commanded loyal support. When I grew up you could walk into a voting booth and just swing a single lever to vote the entire party line. Now, instead, we have entered what I call the Era of Charismatic Politics, where personalities determine elections, rather than parties. This changes the landscape, and helps us understand what is to come.First, the Democrats have no lock on future presidential elections. Put another way, it is not yet clear if the winning side in 2008 and 2012 was an Obama coalition or a Democratic coalition. The first coalesced around a particular candidate in a particular year; the second links the electorate to a party.We have seen this difference before: one of the chestnuts for historians and political scientists used to be: when did the New Deal coalition emerge? For years the answer was imply ""1932"", but then Samuel Lubell pointed out that the real breakthrough came in 1928, when the twelve largest cities switched from Republican to Democrat. Lubell's famous expression was, ""Before there was a Roosevelt Revolution there was an Al Smith Revolution."" Later scholars, however, discovered that while city dwellers voted for Smith, they did not change their party affiliation until 1932. Earlier they had chosen Smith the person, now they joined not just Roosevelt but his party as well, a stronger and more lasting bond. Charismatic politics also explains the 2014 elections. If voters respond to a specific person not to parties, and they become disillusioned with that leader, allegiance to a larger institution can't soften the blow.As an indication of what could happen, look at Hispanic voters, one of the linch pins of the last two presidential victories. Yet in 2014, when Obama became diminished, so did Hispanic support for the Democrats. In Texas, Hispanics gave incoming Republican governor Greg Abbott 44 percent of their votes, compared to 38 percent for Rick Perry in 2010. Even in Kansas, Sam Brownback, a very strong conservative, got 47 percent of the Hispanic vote this year, compared to 46 percent for Paul Davis, the Democrat.Thus, given the shift to charismatic politics, the Democrats could be quite vulnerable. If they don't have a powerful candidate to rally voters -- whether in 2016 or beyond -- they could well lose.Right now Hillary Clinton is the ""in"" candidate, with the potential to win a charismatic race. But just to play a long shot, if Rand Paul overcomes staunch neocon opposition to get the Republican nomination, he could instead become the face of new politics, getting youth and minority votes while winning white males because of his Tea Party roots.The main point is that unlike party politics, with deep, long holding allegiances, charismatic politics is ephemeral, as fleeting as last year's top recording artist. It is not just the presidential race of 2016 that is up for grabs, it is American politics in a volatile time."
1,POLITICS,What Explains the Election Results? It's (Still) the Economy,"Dennis M. Kelleher, ContributorPresident and CEO, Better Markets, Inc.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-explains-the-electio_b_6118240.html,No one should be surprised that the American people are economically insecure and anxious. Seven in 10 voters said the nation's economy is in bad shape. Voters who said the economy was important to them voted 2 to 1 for Republicans.,2014-11-11,2014-11-07-FinancialCrisisLostGDPinyellowBLOGPOST11.6.14.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-07-FinancialCrisisLostGDPinyellowBLOGPOST11.6.14-thumb.png,"The number one issue for voters in the 2014 mid-term elections was the economy, by far. Seven in 10 voters said the nation's economy is in bad shape and 78 percent are worried about the economy. Voters who said the economy was important to them voted 2 to 1 for Republicans. Tellingly, five out of five state ballot measures to increase the minimum wage were all passed, including in the red/semi-red states of Arkansas, Nebraska, South Dakota and Alaska. And, 63 percent of voters said the economic system ""favors the wealthy."" Many have found this odd because the unemployment rate keeps coming down, the stock market keeps going up and we're told the economy is growing. But those traditional indicators of economic conditions clearly no longer accurately reflect the economic reality as lived by tens of millions of Americans. No one should be surprised that the American people are economically insecure and anxious, regardless of what the traditional economic numbers seem to suggest: in 2008, the economy was hit by the biggest financial crash and economic shock since 1929 which caused the worse economy since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The following chart from a recent important Larry Summers' analysis (reprinted in an article by Matt O'Brien in the Washington Post) shows just how bad the economic conditions caused by those events have been: The gross domestic product (GDP) is basically the total value of goods and services produced in the US and is a primary gauge for evaluating the condition of not just the economy, but also the economic circumstances of Americans who, after all, have to be working to produce those goods and services and have enough money to buy them. The chart clearly shows that the dramatically underperforming economy was directly and immediately caused by the financial crash of 2008. How bad has the underperformance been? This modification of the chart above highlights the lost GDP from the pre-crash 2007 economic activity projection to the post-crash reality of today: The yellow area represents all the goods and services never produced, the growth never achieved, the jobs, savings and homes lost, all as Better Markets detailed in its report on the Cost of the Crisis. Yes, the 2007 and 2008 projections were likely inflated to some indeterminable extent due to the pre-crash housing bubble, but the chart nevertheless broadly captures the post-crash lost economic output. This chart makes clear that the standard of living in the country hasn't just stalled, it has collapsed and tens of trillions of dollars have been lost and tens of millions of lives have been enormously damaged economically. Put differently, the yellow area in the chart above is the depth of damage and pain inflicted on the American people in lost jobs, wages, savings, income, wealth and, too often, hope, as dreams for homes, education, retirement and so much more first get put on hold and then silently slip away. That is the reality of the gnawing economic insecurity -- plus frustration, anger and fear -- that too many Americans took to the polls with them.As important, the chart also shows that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has over-estimated US GDP growth every year from 2007 to 2014. Like many, the CBO estimates that future growth and the economic circumstances of American families will normalize and return to pre-crash levels. This thinking is simply blind to the virtually unprecedented historic level of damage done to the economy by the financial crash. Politicians -- including too many running in 2014 -- have been similarly blind to the economic calamity that financial crash has caused Americans, as voters made clear in the mid-term elections. Okay, the economy is bad, but why is that bad for the president and his party? Unfortunately, while tens of millions of Americans suffered and continue to suffer from the economic wreckage of those years (the yellow area on the chart), no one has ever offered a clear, compelling accurate explanation of why the American people are in such dire economic circumstances. What caused this and who is to blame are questions never asked and never answered. As a result, the American people are hurting and, rightfully, mad. Adding insult to injury, they also see Wall Street getting trillions of bailouts, billions in bonuses, bouncing back without any accountability and welcomed with open arms in the corridors of power in Washington DC. With no one else to blame, the president and his party get blamed. Put another way, if something is wrong, seriously wrong, that directly impacts the kitchen table day-in and day-out and there's no visible, understandable, plausible reason for those circumstances, then whoever is convenient will do because something, anything must change. That is the key reason the president was such a potent Republican weapon in the mid-term elections and why his party suffered so many defeats by such large margins.   In fairness, in addition to Wall Street's financial recklessness almost causing a second Great Depression, the Congress itself is also to blame for a part of the poor post-crash economic conditions. As discussed by Bloomberg View, this Congress (or, in truth, a subset of this Congress) has ""crippled the recovery"" by counterproductive budget decisions and imposing austerity at a time of desperate economic need (and, even more foolishly, at a time of near or below zero borrowing costs). This is in stark contrast to Congressional actions during past economic downturns, as this chart shows: As a result, the government ""has actually subtracted from growth,"" making economic conditions worse and increasing the gap between projected potential growth and actual growth. (While admittedly controversial, it should be noted that the Federal Reserve Board policies on zero interest rates and its bond buying programs were undertaken, in part, to make up some of this gap.) In the absence of an economic miracle (as Larry Summers points out), the economy is likely to continue to substantially underperform (just as it did after the Great Crash of '29 and during the Great Depression). Thus, American families and voters are going to continue to be under enormous economic stress for the foreseeable future. While everyone must do everything possible to change that, the key political question is who is going be blamed for a bad economy that will almost certainly remain bad into the 2016 election cycle, if not well beyond? Put differently, while most want to forget the devastating financial crash of 2008 and Wall Street's role in it, will anyone ever put blame for today's economy and the ongoing damage to American families where it really belongs: on Wall Street and those who crashed the economy, plus those who mindlessly pursue spending cuts and austerity?"
2,RELIGION,The Sounds Of Muslim Prayers Filled The Washington National Cathedral On Friday,Carol Kuruvilla,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/national-cathedral-muslim-prayer_n_6136222.html,,2014-11-11,"WASHINGTON, DC - NOVEMBER 14: Muslims participate in a Friday prayer November 14, 2014 at the National Cathedral in Washington, DC. Members of five Muslim communities joined the very first Muslim Friday prayer, also known as jumu'ah, held at the cathedral today.

However, the November 14 event marks the first time American Muslims have been invited to lead their own traditional Jummah prayer inside the same sacred space that has hosted presidential funerals and other national religious services.The service was briefly interrupted by a lone protester who, according to the NBC4, shouted, ""Why can't you worship in your mosque, and leave our churches alone?"" The woman was quickly escorted from the sacred space. The Cathedral’s director of liturgy, Rev. Canon Gina Gilland Campbell, said the incident happened at the very beginning of the service and ""did not dampen the day.""“Other than that, it was very quiet and peaceful inside the building,” Campbell told The Huffington Post on Friday. “Everyone was just captured by the beauty of the moment.”The idea for the service emerged from a conversation between Campbell and South African Ambassador Ebrahim Rasool, who delivered the sermon. The two friends met while planning a memorial service for the late Nelson Mandela.""It is an enormous testament of solidarity,"" Rasool told the Huffington Post earlier this week. ""Of Christians toward Muslims who face the prospect of their religion being hijacked and towards Christians who face threats to their continued existence in place like the Middle East.""Rasool said that the building’s ornate carvings, arches, and long central aisle reminded him of ancient mosques.“What struck me was how he could look at our building and see his mosque. That was a powerful moment,” Campbell told HuffPost. “To realize we could be standing in the same spot in the same building and see our own prayer traditions.”The Jummah prayer was held with the support of Muslim leaders from the the All Dulles Area Muslim Society (ADAMS), Masjid Muhammad (the Nation's Mosque), the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA), and the Muslim Public Affairs Council (MPAC). The service is for invited guests, but was also livestreamed at the Cathedral's website.The Cathedral removed some chairs from the north transept in order to place carpeting on the floor. The north transept also has limited Christian iconography, which the Cathedral said provided an “ideal space -- almost mosque-like -- with the appropriate orientation for Muslim prayers.”Men and women were separated within the space and there was special seating for elderly worshippers, Campbell said.Campbell felt that now was an important time for “voices of moderation” in all faith groups to speak out and demonstrate the “unitive power of prayer.” “Hopefully, out of that will come some other kinds of work together,” Campbell added.Rasool said the event was particularly important because ""faith is endangered"" in the world. “On the one hand, people who profess faith have done enormous harm in the world in the name of their faith,” Rasool said. “On the other hand, we live in a material world where the spirit no longer has currency. We don’t believe in the intangible ties we have with each other.”"

All the male on-air hosts of Today, in fact, are not shaving in support of ""No Shave November"" to raise awareness about cancers that directly affect us guys, which are prostate and testicular cancer. It turns out that one in seven men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lives, according to the American Cancer Society. That's greater than one in eight women diagnosed with breast cancer, citing breastcancer.org statistics, in their lifetimes. How many of us lads knew that? I didn't. My granddaddy was a Maryland chicken farmer in Eastern Shore, Maryland who raised chickens for Frank Perdue. Granddaddy hated doctors, didn't believe in them, and told me when I was a boy that doctors were a complete waste of time -- that is until he started to have serious abdominal pains. It turned out the pains in Granddaddy's belly came from cancer that had metastasized from his cancerous prostate. Had Granddaddy been checked out several months before, he would have been fine with proper treatment. But by the time he got to a doctor, he was terminal. Granddaddy died four months later.My dad, thankfully, did believe in doctors, and so when he got diagnosed, back in 1992, he went straight away to surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, MD. Dad's surgery was scheduled the week after I was married, so I spent time by my Dad's bed watching him recover during my honeymoon. My Mom had died years before from breast cancer, so he asked if I could be there for him. What's a son to say, right? Of course, Dad! Dad is still with us today, thanks to all the great advances in prostate cancer treatment. When I was on the Today show to promote my book Stand by Her: A Breast Cancer Guide for Men, Matt came up to me after my interview to thank me, personally, for all that I did for my mom, my mom's best friend, my wife, and my sister who had all been diagnosed with breast cancer. It was so heartfelt, and honestly touching, that Matt did that. So fast-forward to this week, and here comes Mr. Lauer back into my life again, this time fighting the good fight against cancer for guys everywhere. So, fellas, let's all follow Matt's lead and sprout facial hair of our own this month, and send in your hard earned dollars to fight for our own male cancer cause.

4,POLITICS,Netanyahu Is a National Security Risk -- And Washington Knows It,"Adil E. Shamoo and Peter Certo, Contributors",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/netanyahu-is-a-national-s_b_6118652.html,"Once a taboo subject in Washington, the value of the U.S.-Israeli alliance has increasingly come under scrutiny among even leading members of the foreign policy establishment.",2014-11-10,"President Barack Obama meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, Monday, Sept. 30, 2013. The White House said the two leaders would discuss negotiations with the Palestinians, developments in Syria and Iran. (AP Photo/Charles Dharapak)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/60d422753b00009d27ec7e85.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"An anonymous U.S. official caused a dustup when he called the Israeli prime minister ""chickenshit."" Others might have said worse.Last month, an anonymous U.S. official stirred a tempest in a teapot when he called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ""a chickenshit"" in comments to the Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg. The insinuation was that while Netanyahu will happily rile up his right-wing base on issues related to Palestine or Iran, he lacks the political courage to take meaningful steps to resolve either conflict.State Department officials scurried to disavow themselves of the remark. But the incident revealed an increasingly common conclusion in Washington: Netanyahu's foot-dragging on Middle East peace is not only frustrating for the United States -- it's dangerous.Once a taboo subject in Washington, the value of the U.S.-Israeli alliance has increasingly come under scrutiny among even leading members of the foreign policy establishment.As Anthony Cordesman -- a Mideast expert at the center-right Center for Strategic and International Studies -- observed, ""It is time Israel realized that it has obligations to the United States, as well as the United States to Israel, and that it become far more careful about the extent to which it test the limits of U.S. patience and exploits the support of American Jews.""General David Petraeus, back when he was the head of the U.S. Central Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict ""foments anti-American sentiment, due to a perception of U.S. favoritism for Israel."" Even President Obama has listed the conflict as a factor in U.S. wars in the Middle East that are ""costing us significantly in terms of both blood and treasure.""These comments by leading American figures were made four years ago -- well before the Obama administration had had its biggest dustups with Netanyahu's government. Two Gaza wars and another round of failed peace talks later, nothing has changed except Israel's increasing willingness to flaunt international law -- as it did in its massive assault on Gaza earlier this year, which killed some 1,500 civilians.Now, even U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry -- a pro-Israel stalwart -- admits, to the chagrin of Israeli officials, that the lack of progress in peace negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians is feeding support for the Islamic State. ""There wasn't a leader I met with in the region,"" Kerry said of his efforts to cobble together an anti-Islamic State coalition, ""who didn't raise with me spontaneously the need to try to get peace between Israel and the Palestinians, because it was a cause of recruitment and of street anger and agitation.""One would think that such complaints from a key ally and patron would elicit some soul-searching in the Israeli government. Yet instead of charting a new course in his speech at the United Nations last September, Netanyahu fell back on an old, lazy recipe of demonization, equating Hamas with the Islamic State and the Islamic State with Iran. And he continued oft-used delaying tactics, inviting the current coalition of Arab countries fighting the Islamic Stateto draft a new peace proposal for Israel and the Palestinians -- despite his longstanding rejection of the Arab Peace Initiative drafted over 10 years ago by many of those same countries. Officials in the Obama administration were reportedly ""unconvinced"" that Netanyahu's proposal was sincere, given his lack of interest in direct talks with the Palestinians themselves.In addition, just days before an October meeting with President Obama, Israel announced plans to construct 2,610 new housing units in East Jerusalem in violation of existing agreements. In a rare public rebuke, Obama spokesman Josh Earnest said that the new settlements will alienate Israel's ""closest allies"" -- presumably including Washington -- and ""call into question Israel's ultimate commitment to a peaceful negotiated settlement with the Palestinians.""Uncowed, Netanyahu dismissed the criticism, describing the U.S. rejection of the new settlements as ""against American values"" and ""anti-peace."" When an Israeli prime minister describes longstanding U.S. strategic interests -- in this case, conditions that would enable the creation of a viable Palestinian state and a just resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict -- as ""un-American,"" it's a clear indication that the United States cannot continue its current course of appeasing Israel's every demand.That's a conclusion increasingly shared by Israel's longtime allies in Europe. Sweden's new government recently indicated that it will recognize Palestine as a state. The UK parliament followed up with a symbolic recognition vote of its own, and more European countries may soon do the same.Groups in the United States and in Europe, meanwhile, have worked with Palestinian activists to organize a boycott of Israeli settlement products and academic institutions. Indeed, U.S. civil society -- including many Jewish organizations -- is now leaps and bounds ahead of the U.S. government when it comes to rethinking the U.S.-Israel relationship.Nonetheless, Netanyahu now looks poised to mobilize his supporters in the U.S. Congress to vote against any nuclear agreement between Washington and Tehran.Yet even as official Washington simmers with frustration at Netanyahu's simultaneous demands for U.S. support and disregard for U.S. interests, officials rushed to put out the fire started by the anonymous ""chickenshit"" quip. As Foreign Policy's Steve Walt put it, if Washington pretends that the ""'special relationship' is hunky-dory, even when it is obvious to even casual observers that it is not,"" then ""Netanyahu's not chickenshit -- the White House is.""_______________ Adil E.
