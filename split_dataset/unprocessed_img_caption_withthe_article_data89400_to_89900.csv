0,POLITICS,Washington State Asks Not To Be Penalized For Lower Test Scores,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/washington-state-test-scores_n_7261596.html,,2015-05-12,"Washington state Superintendent of Public Instruction Randy Dorn speaks during a session at the annual AP Legislative Preview, Thursday, Jan. 10, 2013, at the Capitol in Olympia, Wash. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f79e1f00000002257e8b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SEATTLE, May 11 (Reuters) - Washington state, which already lost an exemption from some requirements of U.S. education law, is asking not to be penalized for lower test scores this year as districts switch to a standardized exam tethered to tougher standards, an official said on Monday.The request comes as school officials face vocal public resistance to the test as they transition to Smarter Balanced exams, which are aligned to the Common Core multi-state education standards in English and math.It also comes after hundreds of Seattle high school students boycotted the exam.""The test is more rigorous than previous tests we've had,"" said Nathan Olson, a spokesman for state Superintendent Randy Dorn. ""We shouldn't have to continue with penalties during this transition period.""Washington state public schools are required to give the tests to meet federal education requirements under No Child Left Behind, a law signed in 2002 requiring annual standardized tests in American schools.If Dorn's March 31 accountability waiver request is granted, the state would still report its test results from the 2014-2015 school year but be free from the federal law's increasingly punitive sanction scheme if students fail to meet yearly performance targets, Olson said.Last year, Washington lost its exemption from some requirements under the No Child law because its state legislature declined to link student test scores to teacher evaluations.That cost the state control of how some $40 million in federal funds is spent on supplemental education programs aimed at bringing schools up to par, and forced it to demonstrate adequate yearly progress on federally required state exams, Olson said.He added that 2014 was the first year all students had to meet a federal benchmark on statewide tests.It also comes about a month after U.S. Senator Patty Murray of Washington released a bipartisan rewrite of the No Child law that would preserve a mandate for annual tests but let U.S. states decide how to use the results.The U.S. Department of Education did not immediately respond to a request for more information.While any state can apply for the temporary accountability waiver, the Department of Education has already awarded No Child Left Behind waivers - the same one Washington state lost - to 43 states and the District of Columbia.

The 7.8 magnitude earthquake which struck the Himalayan nation on April 25, 2015, has had a devastating impact on the economy of Nepal where tourism attracted almost 800,000 foreign visitors in 2013 -- many of them climbers heading straight to Mount Everest but also less adventurous tourists seeking the rich cultural history of Kathmandu.

But far too often the media fails to show the whole picture, neglecting to tell the stories of what is working. From scientific breakthroughs to successful crime-reduction initiatives, the What’s Working Honor Roll highlights some of the best reporting and analysis, from a range of media outlets, on all the ways people are working toward solutions to some of our greatest challenges.Baltic Review: Clowns 'heal with laughter' in quake-hit Nepal In the Himalayan country of Nepal, where thousands remain in need of food, shelter and medical treatment after last month's devastating earthquake, the power of laughter is proving to be much stronger than anyone could have anticipated. Ron Fowler knows this firsthand. He is one of the many clowns who is helping bring entertainment and fun to Nepal's hurt and traumatized children. The April 25 earthquake, which killed more than 7,500 people, affected some 1.7 million children living in areas hit by the disaster. Baltic Review's Bibbi Abruzzini highlighted how Fowler, who organizes balloon and magic shows for kids, and other clowns are using laughter to help the nation's youth heal. Yet another group of clowns known as The Dream Doctors recently traveled to Nepal to entertain hurt and traumatized children. ""It might seem trivial to see a gang wearing red noses and floppy shoes where people lack basic necessities,"" Abruzzini writes. ""But along with water, medicines, food and tents, they can offer psychological support and bring smiles to those in trauma.""They do it because it works. Research has proven that laughter, particularly clown therapy, can increase recovery time and improve overall happiness for sick patients. The method isn't new. In 2013, an organization called Clowns Without Borders sent a group of clowns to Typhoon Haiyan-affected areas of the Philippines to perform for children. Clowns have begun bringing their talents to patients of all ages and people suffering from various ailments -- from children's hospitals to Alzheimer's patients.

We should act, be relentless and impatient when there is an immediate need to protect individuals across the globe.",2015-05-11,"Rev. Roger LaRade, of the Eucharistic Catholic Church in Canada, carries a gay pride flag before giving blessings to couples from the LGBT community in Havana, Cuba, Saturday, May 9, 2015. The blessing ceremony on an island where gay marriage remains illegal was part of official ceremonies leading up to the Global Day against Homophobia on May 17. (AP Photo/Desmond Boylan)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14c372300003300d0c8c4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the past two years I have gone from being a sympathizer of the LGBT cause, to becoming an outright supporter and advocate of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Our center deals with grand strategic issues of security, economy and human rights on a daily basis. LGBT rights are the cutting edge of human rights and based on our commitments to human dignity and freedom, we embrace the issue as part of geo-strategic thinking. The moment of realization of the importance of this came in the run-up to the Sochi Olympics. We suddenly understood that LGBT rights are the barometer for democracy and human rights. At times it is a harbinger of change, an indicator of the positive direction of a country. A sign of moving towards the granting and protection of the rights of persons to be who he or she was born to be, to live a full life without fear of harassment, discrimination, persecution or murder. At other times it is the canary in the coal-mine, signaling the slide-back of democracy, a move towards authoritarianism. The other day, I explained my position and the work we are doing on LGBT strategic thinking to a lady friend. Half jokingly, she asked me: ""Don't you have to be gay to do this?"" ""No you don't,"" I responded. ""You don't have to be discriminated against to want to join the fight against discrimination of others.""No doubt, LGBT rights have come a long way. In just 30 years, Washington Pride has grown from a small event of 2000 people, considered to be a curiosity, to be a celebration for the city, where over a 100,000 people from all walks of life show up to celebrate. Twenty years ago, my colleague, the Danish ambassador to NATO accepted as his deputy a talented and wonderful young diplomat. He told me, kind of hush-hush, that his new colleague was gay and will bring his partner, but that he hopes we will be accepting to him. Carsten and his husband broke new grounds, which needed courage. It was in many ways a curiosity then. It isn't now. Such a conversation would be totally strange today. Why would you even mention this, we don't care. This weekend at Cuba's gay parade, Raul Castro's daughter, Mariela, called for the legalization of same sex marriage, in a country at the very beginning of its long march towards change.Unfortunately many other countries are moving in the opposite direction of harassment and punishment, discrimination of LGBT people. The bad news keeps on coming from Russia.Support for LGBT rights must not be out of pity, or just empathy or solidarity. For people concerned with the long term, it must be part of our strategic thinking. This is because of our fundamental belief that a principled stance on human rights must be at the core of our foreign policy. Understanding its geopolitical implications, pursuing it globally, is in our interest. At times perhaps understandably, at other times out of cowardice, our immediate foreign policy decisions push aside human rights. No matter what, we need to be clear about our vision on global LGBT rights, so we can develop a better strategy and translate it into a sound, reliable and realistic policy. We should act, be relentless and impatient when there is an immediate need to protect individuals across the globe, and be patient but perseverant, when it comes to the long term: legal guarantees, changes in perception and strengthening institutional support for LGBT people. Giving in should not be an alternative!As we confront the enormous threats and challenges of the 21st century: security, imbalance between economic growth and overpopulation, the depletion of our water reserves, climate change, energy and many more to be dealt with, we will need all the creative and innovative power and in all societies, big or small, to come up with lasting solutions. This creativity and innovation can only be harnessed in an environment of freedom which nurtures diversity. Whether in politics, the arts, business, education or technology, the LGBT community has been an enormous source and a driver of change. Liberated from the pressures of discrimination, they will be able to exercise their creative power to the maximum. We need to use the platforms of innovative thinking in foreign policy in order to find new and better ways to integrate LGBT rights into our international efforts. Every single day we come up with thousands of new tools in support of business, media, health, culture. We should be able to come up with new tools for our foreign policy toolbox in support of global LGBT rights, a frontier where the future clashes with the past.Or as another Danish friend put it: ""LGBT rights is where modernity faces the forces of yesteryear."""

But aside from a couple of ill-advised, short-lived restaurants, the Center has proven an enormous success for places like Per Se, Porter House, Masa, and, A Voce, which was opened in 2009 by London-based Marlon Abela Restaurant Corporation.

Its location has never been a problem with a) those people who work in the building, b) those who stay next door at the Mandarin-Oriental or in the hotels that line Central Park South, c) those who love the panorama over Columbus Circle and the Park, d) pre-theater and Lincoln Center goers, and d) those who love stylish Italian cuisine. Good mix indeed. So the bar is always packed by six p.m., the tables full by eight, and all those people make a lot of noise in an interior that is very handsome in a sort of Milanese modern way but devoid of any textures to soak up the sound.

There has been some turn-over in chefs in the last couple of years, now under Chef Riccardo Bilotta (above), born in Trieste, with training and experience in diverse kitchens that include Il Pellicano in Porto Ercole, Italy, El Cellar de Can Roca in Girona, Spain, and most recently, Harvest on Hudson in New York, where he served as Executive Chef. Whereas in the past A Voce had a reputation for modern but lusty flavors, Bilotta has added just enough refinement to recipes that incorporate first-rate American ingredients, so as to make the evolution of the kitchen both clear and very much his own. Thus, I just abandoned the menu and let him feed me and my guests on a recent evening.   With a lovely bottle of Gaja Rossj-Bass 2012 (a blend of Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc) chosen by Mr Flosse, we began with a silky, tangy octopus terrine, with shaved marinated asparagus, capers, and a light sabayon. One of the most beautiful plates of Ahi tuna carpaccio, with orange, Taggiasca olives and chervil (above), I've ever seen tasted every bit as good as it looked, and the precise amount of seasoning brought a tartare of Piedmontese beef with pickled cucumber to vibrant life. There were three pastas served: a perfectly tender, nicely chewy risotto with generous morsels of Maine lobster, aromatic saffron, a touch of brandy and tarragon; parsley-imbued linguine with very delicate flavors of Alaskan king crab, scallions, Meyer lemon, and just the right amount of Santa Barbara sea urchin so as not to overpower the other ingredients; amatriciana di ricci also had sea urchin--very subtly--and the sauce a classic sugo, with which we drank a Pieropan 2013. Quite clearly Mr. Bilotta adores seafood, as he should for a chef from Trieste, and I think he's going one on one with Marea across the street. Our next course was fresh cod with impeccably rendered artichoke purée, pearl onions, black breadcrumbs, and watermelon radish; halibut swam in a heady seafood casserole with meaty borlotti beans and cauliflower. The single meat dish was an herb-crusted rack of lamb with buttery potato terrine, lamb cotechino sausage, and an enchanting pink lady apple mostarda. With this we enjoyed a Schioppettino, Ronchi di Chialla 2009, which we sipped for a while before having desserts. Chocolate and Sicilian pistachio mousse was blended with olive oil and set with pistachio gelato, while a coconut semifreddo came with caramelized pineapple and passion fruit sorbet. Even sated we could not resist a bite of bombolini with a chocolate hazelnut fonduta and sprinkling of Maldon salt. This is clearly sophisticated Italian food, and although there were a few people at other tables ordering just a plate of pasta, most guests that night were in full swing, with good bottles of wine on every table. In any other city A Voce would be very much a special occasion place, but in NYC it's a restaurant people will go to simply for the love of it whenever they get the chance.

Cameron's Conservative Party swept to power Friday in Britain's Parliamentary General Elections, winning an unexpected majority.

But this is to understate the abject defeat suffered by some Keynesian economists, and in particular the Nobel prize winning former Princeton professor Paul Krugman.Just days before the election, Krugman joined Brand in offering Ed Miliband a celebrity endorsement. It took the form of a long article entitled ""The Austerity Delusion,"" which argued, rather preposterously, that the fiscal policy of the Cameron-Clegg coalition had been inspired by a cabal of Harvard economists and sinister but unnamed business interests. If only the government had heeded his ""textbook"" Keynesian advice and run large deficits in the past five years, Krugman argued, the UK could have avoided ""major damage."" Even by his standards, Krugman's argument was lame. Exhibit A was a chart showing current government bond yields. According to the Nobel laureate, Britain had no need to worry about going the way of Greece because its bond yields today are a tiny fraction of Greece's. (That's right, today, as opposed to in the counterfactual world in which a Keynesian government had since 2010 heeded Krugman's advice to keep running a large deficit.) Exhibit B compared advanced economies' economic performance between 2009 and 2013 with the average annual change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance, Krugman's chosen measure of austerity. The implication seemed to be that if Britain had done less austerity it would have grown as fast as Germany or the U.S. But one might equally well say that Britain did do as much austerity as Spain and Portugal, yet grew much faster. In any case, by including 2010 and omitting 2014, Krugman was shamelessly rigging his own correlation. Publishing this shoddy diatribe was a blunder on Krugman's part, as it served to draw attention to his own delusions about the UK economy - and his own embarrassing contributions to Labour's defeat. These merit closer scrutiny, as I chose to omit them from my previous assessments of his record as a commentator on contemporary events (here, here and here). It was worth the wait.Like his journalism on the United States, Krugman's writings about Britain are characterized by extreme partisanship, complemented by a touristic level of knowledge. In the pre-crisis era, he was an enthusiastic fan of the Labour governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, praising them as ""politicians who are serious about governing, rather than devoting themselves entirely to amassing power and rewarding cronies."" Rewarding cronies with peerages was of course precisely the way New Labour financed itself.On more than one occasion during the crisis, Krugman applauded Gordon Brown for injecting capital directly into the British banks rather than relying on purchases of ""troubled assets,"" the initial thrust of the Troubled Asset Relief Program in the United States. In October 2008, Krugman engaged in the kind of sycophancy that usually indicates a man angling for a knighthood:Has Gordon Brown, the British prime minister, saved the world financial system? ... The Brown government has shown itself willing to think clearly about the financial crisis, and act quickly on its conclusions. .... Governments [should] provide financial institutions with more capital in return for a share of ownership ... [a] sort of temporary part-nationalization ... The British government went straight to the heart of the problem - and moved to address it with stunning speed.TARP has of course proved far more successful than the UK's nationalization of too-big-to-fail behemoths like RBS. When Brown crashed to electoral defeat in 2010 he was ""Gordon the Unlucky."" ""I actually admire him as a policymaker and have liked him in person,"" gushed Krugman. The election result elicited the comment: ""UK, Yuck."" By contrast, Brown's successors in Downing Street have been the objects of repeated and often spiteful attacks by Krugman - though this has necessitated some rather remarkable, not to say unscrupulous, intellectual U-turns. In March 2010, Krugman wrote a piece on his New York Times­-hosted blog entitled ""Debt Is a Political Issue."" It makes for interesting reading today. What, he asked, is the problem with running a very large debt of the sort incurred by the UK during the world wars. His answer?Confidence. If bond investors start to lose confidence in a country's eventual willingness to run even the small primary surpluses needed to service a large debt, they'll demand higher rates, which requires much larger primary surpluses, and you can go into a death spiral.Wise words. Just seven months later, however, Krugman was firing his first broadside against the new Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, whose first budget ""might have come straight from the desk of Andrew Mellon,"" the U.S. Treasury Secretary during the Great Depression. According to Krugman, by imposing steep cuts in public sector employment, Osborne was worrying needlessly about something called ""the confidence fairy."" This was a term Krugman had coined to ridicule economists (other than him) who argued for responsible fiscal policies aimed at stabilizing public debt. The fact that Krugman himself had previously emphasized the importance of investor confidence was magically effaced, presumably by the confidence trick fairy.In August 2011 Krugman returned to the fray with a blog post about the ""delusions"" of new Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, whose ""experiment in austerity"" was ""going really, really badly."" Three months later, in October 2011, Prime Minister Cameron's ""fantasy"" - that fiscal retrenchment was strengthening investor confidence in UK gilts - was given the same contemptuous treatment. Unfortunately for Krugman, the more he talked about the confidence fairy (as he did here and here and here and here and here and here), the more actual business confidence recovered in the UK. In fact, at no point after May 2010 did it sink back to where it had been throughout the last two years of Gordon Brown's catastrophic premiership. The low at the end of 2011 (Q4-11 to Q1-12) was followed by lift-off in mid-2012 and a peak in mid-2014.Source: Grant Thornton, ""UK Business Confidence Monitor,"" Q1 2015, p. 2.Along with the confidence fairy, a recurrent and equally misleading feature of Krugman's UK commentary has been his claim that the UK's economic performance in the past five years has been worse than during the Great Depression (see here and here and here and here and here and here). Once again, however, the truth will out, even in Krugman's own blog. In November 2011 he made the mistake of publishing a long-run chart of UK unemployment, showing that the rate exceeded 20 percent in the 1930s and was never less than 10 percent throughout the interwar period. For the record, UK unemployment peaked at 8.5 percent in September-November 2011. It has fallen steadily since then. The current figure is 5.6 percent.Source: ""A Century of Change: Trends in UK Statistics since 1900"", House of Commons Research Paper, Dec. 21, 1999. Note that the interwar definition differs from today's. The peak rate of 22% in 1932 would probably be closer to 10-16% if the modern definition is used - still higher than at any time in the last five years.Economists like models, and Krugman loves his own. The point about such models is, however, that they have to make accurate predictions about the future to have credibility. So how did Krugman's model do when it came to the UK? The answer is: disastrously.Here are the key predictions Krugman made:October 2010: ""Fiscal austerity will depress the economy further unless it can be offset by a fall in interest rates. ... The best guess is that Britain in 2011 will look like Britain in 1931, or the United States in 1937, or Japan in 1997. That is, premature fiscal austerity will lead to a renewed economic slump.""In fact, there was no double-dip recession, a fact Krugman strangely omitted to communicate to his readers. On the contrary, the growth rates for the UK in these years (according to the International Monetary Fund) were 1.6 percent (2011), 0.7 percent (2012), 1.7 percent (2013) and 2.6 percent (2014). In that last year, the UK had the fastest growing economy of all the G7 countries. The final piece of Krugman's analysis was that Cameron and Osborne were ""so deeply identified with the austerity doctrine that they can't change course without effectively destroying themselves politically."" They had ""to stick it out until something turns up, no matter how many lives it [austerity] destroys."" Cameron was ""the English prisoner"" of his own ""austerity crusade."" In fact, the government did change course, significantly easing the fiscal tightening in late 2012. Krugman was at first dismissive of these changes as ""a set of basically minor twiddles involving credit and planning authorizations, which seem highly unlikely to make any significant difference."" When these ""twiddles"" turned out to make quite a lot of difference, he cried foul. Why, Cameron and Osborne had stopped doing austerity after two years! How dare they not fulfil Krugman's apocalyptic predictions! Krugman has spent much of the last two years trying to dismiss the UK recovery - not surprisingly, as it makes nonsense of nearly everything he has written in recent years. It was, he insisted in September 2013, a ""dead-cat-bounce."" The government's claims of success were ""deeply stupid."" The economy's growth was merely the effect of stopping ""banging Britain's head against the wall."" Comically, in January 2014 Krugman sought to argue that France was the role model Britain should have sought to emulate. By April, however, he had thrown in the towel, but in a typically dishonest way. ""The fact that the [UK] economy has perked up,"" he argued shamelessly, ""is actually a vindication of Keynesian claims, whatever the government's intentions."" The return to growth - the one he had wholly failed to predict - was ""not at all surprising."" There was ""nothing here that warranted a major revision of framework."" Perish the thought!Let us just be clear. Paul Krugman predicted that George Osborne's policies would devastate the UK economy, producing results worse than those of the 1930s. The outcome? More than 1.9 million jobs have been created since May 2010. The UK unemployment rate is now roughly half the rates in Italy and France. In nominal terms, weekly earnings are up by more than 8 percent; in the private sector, the figure is above 10 percent. Inflation is below 2 percent and falling. Meanwhile, the government's policy of fiscal stabilization, so derided by Krugman, has in fact been a success. According to the IMF, the government's deficit has been halved from 11 percent to 5.7 percent; the structural deficit more than halved from 10 percent to 4.2 percent. The national debt has been stabilized at roughly the same level relative to GDP as that of the United States.In the words of Jeffrey Sachs - hardly a conservative on economic issues - UK economic performance has in fact been ""broadly similar"" to that of the United States, ""with the UK outperforming the United States on certain indicators,"" such as the employment rate (now at a record high of 73.3 percent compared with 59.2 percent in the United States). As Sachs notes, ""both the U.S. and UK economies have cast considerable doubt on Krugman's oft-repeated view that a robust recovery would require further fiscal stimulus."" Amen.Of course, Krugman was not alone. Martin Wolf of the Financial Times made much the same arguments. So did Simon Wren-Lewis, Jonathan Portes and others. However, none of these Keynesian authors could match Krugman's unique combination of over-confidence and toxic rudeness. It was not enough to sneer at George Osborne's policies; he had to be compared gratuitously to one of Monty Python's ""upper class twits."" Osborne's consistency - a trait Krugman greatly prizes in himself - was ""the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen."" His policy was ""a complete conceptual muddle."" Osborne was ""the Rt. Honorable Saboteur."" The government was like ""the Three Stooges."" Osborne's 2014 budget was ""ludicrous.""Krugman is of course in thrall to an Englishman who cannot be credibly described as anything but upper class: John Maynard Keynes. In his vainglorious dreams, Krugman is the Keynes of our time - brilliant, caustic, influential. In his journalism, Krugman frequently alludes to his hero's work - hence ""The Economic Consequences of Mr. Osborne."" But to be Keynes you need ultimately to be credible - credible enough for policymakers to pay heed to what you say. In this regard, Krugman's career is a story of catastrophic failure - a failure only partly explicable by the fact that, unlike Keynes, he is personally obnoxious.Amongst many offensive traits, Krugman's chronic inability to acknowledge error is the most troubling to policymakers, who are subjected to far more rigorous scrutiny than he is. Accusing other economists and the Financial Times of ""perceptual sleaze,"" Krugman recently had the gall to write: ""What's not OK is blurring the distinction between ... political analysis and a real analysis of how policy worked. ... When people do that kind of blurring to make the case for policies they prefer, it's deeply sleazy, no matter who they are."" Lack of self-knowledge on this scale borders on the pathological.It is easy to forget how seriously the British Left once took Krugman. In a speech for Bloomberg in August 2010, Ed Balls named him as one of the few intellectuals who were prepared ""to stand up now and challenge the current consensus that - however painful - there is no alternative to the Coalition's austerity and cuts."" Less than a year later, in a speech at the London School of Economics, Balls again made his debt to Krugman clear. And in his 2012 party conference speech, he went the whole way, parroting Krugman's prediction of a double-dip recession. This was the peak of Krugmania in the UK. In a gushing editorial in January 2013, the Guardian even urged Ed Miliband to appoint Krugman as Shadow Chancellor. Krugman lectures were now attracting throngs of credulous devotees - though Balls was no longer among them. He had belatedly - but too late - woken up to the fact Krugman's predictions had been worthless.Of course, if no one in power ever takes your advice it is quite hard to be proved definitively wrong. There will always be the unknowable Krugman counterfactual: in the British case, the bigger deficits that were never tried, in the U.S case the bigger stimulus that was never tried, in Europe's case the doubling of the inflation target that was never tried. Happy the economist whose policy prescriptions are so reckless that no one ever puts them to the test.Except that one country, just lately, has been putting a Krugman recommendation to the test. That country has defied the ""austerians."" It has thumbed its nose at the fountainheads of economic orthodoxy. It has dared to play chicken with the confidence fairy. It has even told the Germans where to get off. And it has done this on the basis of Paul Krugman's advice, spelt out when he visited the nation's capital, at the government's invitation, in April.That country is Greece.Niall Ferguson is Laurence A.

But this is to understate the abject defeat suffered by some Keynesian economists, and in particular the Nobel prize winning former Princeton professor Paul Krugman.Just days before the election, Krugman joined Brand in offering Ed Miliband a celebrity endorsement. It took the form of a long article entitled ""The Austerity Delusion,"" which argued, rather preposterously, that the fiscal policy of the Cameron-Clegg coalition had been inspired by a cabal of Harvard economists and sinister but unnamed business interests. If only the government had heeded his ""textbook"" Keynesian advice and run large deficits in the past five years, Krugman argued, the UK could have avoided ""major damage."" Even by his standards, Krugman's argument was lame. Exhibit A was a chart showing current government bond yields. According to the Nobel laureate, Britain had no need to worry about going the way of Greece because its bond yields today are a tiny fraction of Greece's. (That's right, today, as opposed to in the counterfactual world in which a Keynesian government had since 2010 heeded Krugman's advice to keep running a large deficit.) Exhibit B compared advanced economies' economic performance between 2009 and 2013 with the average annual change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance, Krugman's chosen measure of austerity. The implication seemed to be that if Britain had done less austerity it would have grown as fast as Germany or the U.S. But one might equally well say that Britain did do as much austerity as Spain and Portugal, yet grew much faster. In any case, by including 2010 and omitting 2014, Krugman was shamelessly rigging his own correlation. Publishing this shoddy diatribe was a blunder on Krugman's part, as it served to draw attention to his own delusions about the UK economy - and his own embarrassing contributions to Labour's defeat. These merit closer scrutiny, as I chose to omit them from my previous assessments of his record as a commentator on contemporary events (here, here and here). It was worth the wait.Like his journalism on the United States, Krugman's writings about Britain are characterized by extreme partisanship, complemented by a touristic level of knowledge. In the pre-crisis era, he was an enthusiastic fan of the Labour governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, praising them as ""politicians who are serious about governing, rather than devoting themselves entirely to amassing power and rewarding cronies."" Rewarding cronies with peerages was of course precisely the way New Labour financed itself.On more than one occasion during the crisis, Krugman applauded Gordon Brown for injecting capital directly into the British banks rather than relying on purchases of ""troubled assets,"" the initial thrust of the Troubled Asset Relief Program in the United States. In October 2008, Krugman engaged in the kind of sycophancy that usually indicates a man angling for a knighthood:Has Gordon Brown, the British prime minister, saved the world financial system? ... The Brown government has shown itself willing to think clearly about the financial crisis, and act quickly on its conclusions. .... Governments [should] provide financial institutions with more capital in return for a share of ownership ... [a] sort of temporary part-nationalization ... The British government went straight to the heart of the problem - and moved to address it with stunning speed.TARP has of course proved far more successful than the UK's nationalization of too-big-to-fail behemoths like RBS. When Brown crashed to electoral defeat in 2010 he was ""Gordon the Unlucky."" ""I actually admire him as a policymaker and have liked him in person,"" gushed Krugman. The election result elicited the comment: ""UK, Yuck."" By contrast, Brown's successors in Downing Street have been the objects of repeated and often spiteful attacks by Krugman - though this has necessitated some rather remarkable, not to say unscrupulous, intellectual U-turns. In March 2010, Krugman wrote a piece on his New York Times­-hosted blog entitled ""Debt Is a Political Issue."" It makes for interesting reading today. What, he asked, is the problem with running a very large debt of the sort incurred by the UK during the world wars. His answer?Confidence. If bond investors start to lose confidence in a country's eventual willingness to run even the small primary surpluses needed to service a large debt, they'll demand higher rates, which requires much larger primary surpluses, and you can go into a death spiral.Wise words. Just seven months later, however, Krugman was firing his first broadside against the new Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, whose first budget ""might have come straight from the desk of Andrew Mellon,"" the U.S. Treasury Secretary during the Great Depression. According to Krugman, by imposing steep cuts in public sector employment, Osborne was worrying needlessly about something called ""the confidence fairy."" This was a term Krugman had coined to ridicule economists (other than him) who argued for responsible fiscal policies aimed at stabilizing public debt. The fact that Krugman himself had previously emphasized the importance of investor confidence was magically effaced, presumably by the confidence trick fairy.In August 2011 Krugman returned to the fray with a blog post about the ""delusions"" of new Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, whose ""experiment in austerity"" was ""going really, really badly."" Three months later, in October 2011, Prime Minister Cameron's ""fantasy"" - that fiscal retrenchment was strengthening investor confidence in UK gilts - was given the same contemptuous treatment. Unfortunately for Krugman, the more he talked about the confidence fairy (as he did here and here and here and here and here and here), the more actual business confidence recovered in the UK. In fact, at no point after May 2010 did it sink back to where it had been throughout the last two years of Gordon Brown's catastrophic premiership.

The point about such models is, however, that they have to make accurate predictions about the future to have credibility. So how did Krugman's model do when it came to the UK? The answer is: disastrously.Here are the key predictions Krugman made:October 2010: ""Fiscal austerity will depress the economy further unless it can be offset by a fall in interest rates. ... The best guess is that Britain in 2011 will look like Britain in 1931, or the United States in 1937, or Japan in 1997. That is, premature fiscal austerity will lead to a renewed economic slump.""In fact, there was no double-dip recession, a fact Krugman strangely omitted to communicate to his readers. On the contrary, the growth rates for the UK in these years (according to the International Monetary Fund) were 1.6 percent (2011), 0.7 percent (2012), 1.7 percent (2013) and 2.6 percent (2014). In that last year, the UK had the fastest growing economy of all the G7 countries. The final piece of Krugman's analysis was that Cameron and Osborne were ""so deeply identified with the austerity doctrine that they can't change course without effectively destroying themselves politically."" They had ""to stick it out until something turns up, no matter how many lives it [austerity] destroys."" Cameron was ""the English prisoner"" of his own ""austerity crusade."" In fact, the government did change course, significantly easing the fiscal tightening in late 2012. Krugman was at first dismissive of these changes as ""a set of basically minor twiddles involving credit and planning authorizations, which seem highly unlikely to make any significant difference."" When these ""twiddles"" turned out to make quite a lot of difference, he cried foul. Why, Cameron and Osborne had stopped doing austerity after two years! How dare they not fulfil Krugman's apocalyptic predictions! Krugman has spent much of the last two years trying to dismiss the UK recovery - not surprisingly, as it makes nonsense of nearly everything he has written in recent years. It was, he insisted in September 2013, a ""dead-cat-bounce."" The government's claims of success were ""deeply stupid."" The economy's growth was merely the effect of stopping ""banging Britain's head against the wall."" Comically, in January 2014 Krugman sought to argue that France was the role model Britain should have sought to emulate. By April, however, he had thrown in the towel, but in a typically dishonest way. ""The fact that the [UK] economy has perked up,"" he argued shamelessly, ""is actually a vindication of Keynesian claims, whatever the government's intentions."" The return to growth - the one he had wholly failed to predict - was ""not at all surprising."" There was ""nothing here that warranted a major revision of framework."" Perish the thought!Let us just be clear. Paul Krugman predicted that George Osborne's policies would devastate the UK economy, producing results worse than those of the 1930s. The outcome? More than 1.9 million jobs have been created since May 2010. The UK unemployment rate is now roughly half the rates in Italy and France. In nominal terms, weekly earnings are up by more than 8 percent; in the private sector, the figure is above 10 percent. Inflation is below 2 percent and falling. Meanwhile, the government's policy of fiscal stabilization, so derided by Krugman, has in fact been a success. According to the IMF, the government's deficit has been halved from 11 percent to 5.7 percent; the structural deficit more than halved from 10 percent to 4.2 percent. The national debt has been stabilized at roughly the same level relative to GDP as that of the United States.In the words of Jeffrey Sachs - hardly a conservative on economic issues - UK economic performance has in fact been ""broadly similar"" to that of the United States, ""with the UK outperforming the United States on certain indicators,"" such as the employment rate (now at a record high of 73.3 percent compared with 59.2 percent in the United States). As Sachs notes, ""both the U.S. and UK economies have cast considerable doubt on Krugman's oft-repeated view that a robust recovery would require further fiscal stimulus."" Amen.Of course, Krugman was not alone. Martin Wolf of the Financial Times made much the same arguments. So did Simon Wren-Lewis, Jonathan Portes and others. However, none of these Keynesian authors could match Krugman's unique combination of over-confidence and toxic rudeness. It was not enough to sneer at George Osborne's policies; he had to be compared gratuitously to one of Monty Python's ""upper class twits."" Osborne's consistency - a trait Krugman greatly prizes in himself - was ""the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen."" His policy was ""a complete conceptual muddle."" Osborne was ""the Rt. Honorable Saboteur."" The government was like ""the Three Stooges."" Osborne's 2014 budget was ""ludicrous.""Krugman is of course in thrall to an Englishman who cannot be credibly described as anything but upper class: John Maynard Keynes. In his vainglorious dreams, Krugman is the Keynes of our time - brilliant, caustic, influential. In his journalism, Krugman frequently alludes to his hero's work - hence ""The Economic Consequences of Mr. Osborne."" But to be Keynes you need ultimately to be credible - credible enough for policymakers to pay heed to what you say. In this regard, Krugman's career is a story of catastrophic failure - a failure only partly explicable by the fact that, unlike Keynes, he is personally obnoxious.Amongst many offensive traits, Krugman's chronic inability to acknowledge error is the most troubling to policymakers, who are subjected to far more rigorous scrutiny than he is. Accusing other economists and the Financial Times of ""perceptual sleaze,"" Krugman recently had the gall to write: ""What's not OK is blurring the distinction between ... political analysis and a real analysis of how policy worked. ... When people do that kind of blurring to make the case for policies they prefer, it's deeply sleazy, no matter who they are."" Lack of self-knowledge on this scale borders on the pathological.It is easy to forget how seriously the British Left once took Krugman. In a speech for Bloomberg in August 2010, Ed Balls named him as one of the few intellectuals who were prepared ""to stand up now and challenge the current consensus that - however painful - there is no alternative to the Coalition's austerity and cuts."" Less than a year later, in a speech at the London School of Economics, Balls again made his debt to Krugman clear. And in his 2012 party conference speech, he went the whole way, parroting Krugman's prediction of a double-dip recession. This was the peak of Krugmania in the UK. In a gushing editorial in January 2013, the Guardian even urged Ed Miliband to appoint Krugman as Shadow Chancellor. Krugman lectures were now attracting throngs of credulous devotees - though Balls was no longer among them. He had belatedly - but too late - woken up to the fact Krugman's predictions had been worthless.Of course, if no one in power ever takes your advice it is quite hard to be proved definitively wrong. There will always be the unknowable Krugman counterfactual: in the British case, the bigger deficits that were never tried, in the U.S case the bigger stimulus that was never tried, in Europe's case the doubling of the inflation target that was never tried. Happy the economist whose policy prescriptions are so reckless that no one ever puts them to the test.Except that one country, just lately, has been putting a Krugman recommendation to the test. That country has defied the ""austerians."" It has thumbed its nose at the fountainheads of economic orthodoxy. It has dared to play chicken with the confidence fairy. It has even told the Germans where to get off. And it has done this on the basis of Paul Krugman's advice, spelt out when he visited the nation's capital, at the government's invitation, in April.That country is Greece.Niall Ferguson is Laurence A.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb290a3250000320038763c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"By Brienne Walsh, May 12, 2015After a record year for sales in 2014 -- artnet reported that the global fine art auction reached $16.1 billion -- expectations are high for the upcoming modern and contemporary sales in New York. This May, the auctions will bring an influx of art buyers from around the world to the city. Below, we round up the top five sales to watch.1. May 12: Sotheby's Evening Sale of Post-War and Contemporary ArtThe work expected to fetch the highest price is ""The Ring (Engagement)"", a 1962 work by Roy Lichtenstein that depicts a man's hand placing a diamond on a perfectly manicured finger. Only belonging to two previous owners -- one of them the legendary dealer Ileana Sonnabend -- Sotheby's is expected to set the estimate in the realm of $50 million. Watch to see if it breaks the current record for a Lichtenstein, set by the sale of ""Woman with Flowered Hat"" (1963), which fetched $56.3 million at Christie's in May 2013. Other works to watch include ""Untitled (Yellow and Blue)"" (1954) by Mark Rothko, ""Number 12″ (1950) by Jackson Pollock and ""Untitled"" (1970) by Cy Twombly.2. May 12: Bonham's Contemporary Art SaleFurther expanding its international profile, Bonham's, which sold $6 million of contemporary art in London in July of 2014, is expecting an impressive return on its sale in New York. Top lots include ""Love"" (2015) by Robert Indiana, estimated at $150,000 -- $250,000; ""Untitled (184)"" by Keith Haring, estimated at $100,000 -- $150,000; and Andy Warhol's ""Heaven and Hell Are Just One Breath Away (Positive and Negative)"" (1985), estimated at $200,000 -- $300,000.3. May 13: Christie's Evening Sale of Post-War and Contemporary ArtThe Christie's evening sale is full of blockbuster works from the likes of Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg and Jeff Koons. All eyes will be on ""Benefits Supervisor Resting"" (1994), a seminal nude by Lucian Freud. Depicting Sue Tilley, a local government worker in London and one of the artist's favorite muses, the work is expected to break the previous auction record achieved by Freud in 2008 for ""Benefits Supervisor Sleeping,"" which sold in 2008 for $33.6 million. Look mostly to see if Christie's is able to break the record it set on November 12, 2014, with an astounding sale that totaled $852,887,000- the highest auction total in art market history.4. May 14: Phillips Contemporary Evening SaleAn increasing presence on the international art market, Phillips is expecting big things from its evening sale on May 14. Watch especially Brice Marden's ""Elements (Hydra)"" (1999-2000/2001), an abstract work in muted primary colors. The Marden is part of a collection of 100 works from a private American collection of painting and sculpture being auctioned off by Phillips in both New York and London. It includes works by major American artists of the 20th century including Ed Ruscha, Robert Ryman, John Chamberlain and James Lee Byars, as well as Italian artists Giuseppe Penone and Alighiero Boetti. The bulk of the collection will go on the block in New York. In total, the collection is expected to fetch upwards of $33 million.5. May 12, 13 and 15: The Day Sales at Christie's, Sotheby's and PhillipsGenerally more subdued than the evening sales, the day sales at each of the major auction houses nevertheless showcase impressive works by seminal artists -- and fetch sums that while lower than the evening sales, are similarly jaw-dropping. Christie's will hold its day sale on May 12, the day before its evening sales, as a precursor to the main event. Sotheby's will hold its day auction on May 13, the day after its evening sale. Highlights include works sold to benefit The Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, as well pieces by trendsetters including Tauba Auerbach, Glenn Ligon and Christopher Wool. Phillips will auction off works on May 15, the day after the evening sale. Works to watch in that sale include John Chamberlain's ""Tonk #10-83″ (1983) and Tom Wesselmann's ""Smoker #7″ (1976).Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get the best of ARTPHAIRE delivered straight to your inbox!Brienne Walsh is an ARTPHAIRE contributor, as well as a freelance writer who contributes to Art in America, Interview Magazine, The Huffington Post, Glo, NY Mag, The New York Times and the NY Daily News, among other publications."
12,WORLDPOST,Report: Some Russian Soldiers Quit Army Over Ukraine War,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/russia-soldiers-ukraine_n_7257900.html,,2015-05-11,"A woman leaves her home which was destroyed to fetch water in the village of Nikishino on April 21, 2015 in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DNR). Only a handful stayed during the fighting here and as people returned to the village counting some 450 houses they found some 240 of those reduced to rubble or had been destroyed beyond repair.

Their accounts call into question the Kremlin's continued assertions that no Russian soldiers have been sent to Ukraine, and that any Russians fighting alongside rebels there are volunteers.Evidence for Russians fighting in Ukraine - Russian army equipment found in the country, testimony from soldiers' families and from Ukrainians who say they were captured by Russian paratroopers - is abundant. Associates of Boris Nemtsov, a prominent Kremlin critic killed in February, will soon publish a report which they say will contain new evidence of the Russian military presence in Ukraine.Until now, however, it has been extremely rare to find Russian soldiers who have fought there and are willing to talk. It is even rarer to find soldiers who have quit the army. Five soldiers who recently quit, including two who said they left rather than serve in Ukraine, have told Reuters of their experiences.One of the five, from Moscow, said he was sent on exercises in southern Russia last year but ended up going into Ukraine in an armored convoy.""After we crossed the border, a lieutenant colonel said we could be sent to jail if we didn't fulfill orders. Some soldiers refused to stay there,"" said the soldier, who served with the elite Russian Kantemirovskaya tank division. He gave Reuters his full name but spoke on condition of anonymity, saying he feared reprisals.He said he knew two soldiers who refused to stay. ""They were taken somewhere. The lieutenant colonel said criminal cases were opened against them but in reality - we called them afterwards - they were at home. They just quit.""Russia's President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly denied that Moscow has sent any military forces to help rebels in eastern Ukraine, where clashes and casualties persist despite a ceasefire struck in February. Putin's spokesman has derided such allegations by NATO, Western governments and Kiev. Officials say that any Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine are ""volunteers,"" helping the rebels of their own free will.The former Russian soldiers who spoke to Reuters, as well as human rights activists, said some soldiers were fearful of being sent to Ukraine, were pressured into going, or disgruntled at the way they were treated after fighting there.The former tank soldier from Moscow said he would not have gone to Ukraine voluntarily. ""No, what for? That's not our war. If our troops were officially there it would be a different story.""He said he had been sent to fight in Ukraine last summer and returned to Russia in September when the first peace talks took place. His crew operated a modernized Russian T-72B3 tank, he said.""(Back in Russia) we were lined up and told that everyone would get a daily allowance, extras for fighting and medals,"" he said. But he said that they did not get the extras they expected. ""We decided to quit. There were 14 of us.""The names of nine soldiers who quit the Kantemirovskaya division are mentioned in an exchange of letters between Viktor Miskovets, the head of the human resources department of Russia's Western Military District, and Valentina Melnikova, who runs the Alliance of Soldiers' Mothers Committees, a group based in Moscow.In the letters, seen by Reuters, human rights workers asked Miskovets to approve the soldiers' resignations - which one soldier told Reuters the military had been unwilling to do. The letters do not mention service in Ukraine.The soldiers left the service on Dec. 12, according to a letter signed by Miskovets. He and his deputy did not answer calls.Three soldiers from the list, contacted by Reuters, confirmed they had quit the service recently but declined to discuss Ukraine.A spokesman for the Ministry of Defense declined to comment on soldiers quitting the tank unit or being sent to Ukraine.

( -/AFP/Getty Images)FINANCIAL INCENTIVESIn Russia, all men aged between 18 and 27 have to serve 12 months in the military. By law, these conscripts cannot be sent abroad. But according to human rights activists, military officials have been promising conscripts financial incentives to sign contracts that make them professional soldiers. The officials then push the soldiers into going to Ukraine.Sergei Krivenko, head of a rights group called ""Citizen. Army. Rights"" and a member of a human rights council created by the Kremlin, has dealt with soldiers' rights since the early 2000s. He said military commanders are trying to find more people who will go to Ukraine voluntarily, ""but this is still 'volunteers' in quotation marks, because there is harsh pressure.""Krivenko said commanders take a carrot-and-stick approach: They offer large financial rewards to contract soldiers willing to go to Ukraine. If soldiers refuse, they are told to resign, he said. ""You can't criminally prosecute someone for not following the order, because the order itself doesn't exist on paper. It's only oral.""Since 2012, contract soldiers' pay has risen, said Krivenko, who traveled to Murmansk to meet soldiers, about 30 of whom told him they had been to Ukraine. ""Now they receive 20, 30, 40,000 roubles a month depending on their rank. Some even get 60,000 a month.""The average wage in Russia is about 30,000 roubles ($580).Resignation is not an easy decision for the soldiers, Krivenko said: ""Just like others in Russia, they're paying off apartments, foreign-made cars... The question becomes where do they find the money to pay off debts, to feed their families?""Reuters could not independently verify Krivenko's account. A spokesman for the Ministry of Defense declined to comment on Russian involvement in Ukraine, but Putin has made his position clear. On April 16, the president said during a televised question and answer session: ""I tell you directly and definitely: There are no Russian troops in Ukraine.""

(AP Photo/Mstyslav Chernov)""FIELD CONDITIONS""Another soldier who said he quit the army over the Ukraine conflict is a 21-year-old who was a member of a Grad missile unit. The soldier, who asked that he and his unit not be identified, told Reuters that in the summer of 2014 his team took up position about 2 km (one mile) from the Ukrainian border in the Rostov region of southwest Russia. The operation appeared to be an exercise, though the men were ordered to prepare as if for real combat.""We drove there without insignia. We took off all the buttonholes and stripes. We were told that we did not need them in field conditions.""In early September the men were ordered to fire their rockets at a target ""about 17 km"" away, ""maybe less."" It was possible the target was in Ukraine, he said. ""I was hoping I did not aim at any people. Or at least that I missed the target.""He said his fellow soldiers told him another battery from his unit had crossed the border and spent 10 days in Ukraine. ""I did not understand who was fighting and what for, and the point of it,"" he said.While on leave in January, the soldier said, he was unexpectedly summoned back to his unit.""We were moved to another (artillery) battery that was supposed to go to some exercises in Rostov region. They said they were really big exercises and very big forces were involved,"" the soldier said.Although he offered no proof, he said he had no doubt it was related to the conflict in Ukraine. ""Of course it was. Why else would we be called off from vacation?""He and four others decided to quit the army rather than risk being sent to fight in Ukraine. After completing the necessary procedures, they left in March, according to the soldier's account and documents from human rights activists and military prosecutors.

(AP Photo/Mstyslav Chernov)SPOTTED IN DONBASSMost Russian soldiers who fought in Ukraine last year - whether volunteers or not - came from Central Russia, the North Caucasus or the Volga region, according to soldiers' accounts, relatives and Russian media. More recently, Reuters reporters in east Ukraine spotted fighters from Siberia, thousands of miles away.Their appearance lends support to claims that Russian troops from regions closer to Ukraine have become reluctant to join the conflict.Early this year Asian-looking fighters were seen maneuvering armored vehicles and manning checkpoints in Donbass, eastern Ukraine. The fighters turned out to be Buryats, a Mongolian ethnic group from Russian Siberia near Lake Baikal, about 4,500 km from Ukraine.Dorjo Dugarov, a politician from Buryatiya, a region in southeast Siberia, said a Siberian soldier who had returned from Ukraine had told him that ""people from the western part (of Russia) didn't want to go. Their morale has fallen.""Yevgeniy Romanenko, a 39-year-old rebel fighter in east Ukraine, told Reuters that during battles near Debaltseve in February he drove a truck in a convoy that was accompanied by two tanks with Buryat crews. The tank crews provided cover for the truck convoy.""One of them drove in front of the convoy and the second one behind,"" Romanenko said at a hospital in Yenakiyeve, where he was recovering from shrapnel wounds to his leg.Asked if they were servicemen from Russia, Romanenko said: ""Yes, that's for sure. The guys were from there. It was clear.""In February, a Buryat soldier also appeared in an interview on a TV station in eastern Ukraine. Popular singer Iosif Kobzon, who is a member of Russia's State Duma, the lower house of parliament, was filmed visiting injured fighters in a hospital in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine's biggest city. Kobzon says he spoke to a soldier who said he was a member of a tank crew from Buryatiya. The Russian independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta later identified the soldier as Dorji Batomunkoyev from military unit 46108 based in Ulan-Ude, the capital of Buryatiya.Rebels in Ukraine said the Buryat were not soldiers sent by Russia but volunteers. ""We have volunteers from the Russian Federation,"" Vladimir Kononov, the Ukrainian rebel defense minister, told Reuters in early March. ""This tankman could have left the army before he came here.""Reuters could not reach Batomunkoyev. His mother Sesegma, contacted by telephone, confirmed that her son had served in the army and been injured in Ukraine. She visited him in a hospital after he was transferred back to Russia. She declined to say whether he had been ordered to go to Ukraine or had volunteered.""He did not say he was going,"" she said. ""He called me on February 19 and shouted 'Mum, I got burnt in a tank.' And that's it."" (Additional reporting by Thomas Grove; Edited by Richard Woods and Sara Ledwith)"

Just a teeny bit spicy, and oh so tasty!I think I finally found something that I have spent a long time looking for with this easy chili marmalade baked chicken. First, a little backstory.One of my most favorite dinner recipes that I've shared is easy honey mustard baked chicken. It literally takes just a handful of minutes to prep and get into the oven. And the thing is that it is good, like really good. Good enough for company, but easy enough for even the craziest of days.I think every mom out there, me included, wishes she had more of those types of recipes. The type that are no fuss, something I know I'll most likely have most if not all of the ingredients no matter the day, the type that are special even though really they aren't. Oh, and kids need to actually eat it.I've been on a mission to come up with some variation of that honey mustard chicken dish for a while. Enter easy chili marmalade baked chicken.This idea had been brewing a while, but I had a slight dilemma with what to do with the 1/2 cup of mustard the other recipe contains. Marmalade was an easy swap for the honey, both are sweet and sticky. I swapped out 1/4 cup of the mustard for a combination of chili garlic sauce, marmalade, and orange juice.I knew I wanted a little bit of spice, but not too much. I decided to add an extra 1/4 cup of marmalade to the mix. That gave me a sweet, slightly spicy sauce that basically measured the same as the previous recipe. The orange juice and soy sauce gave it a little extra flavor. A touch of ginger, salt, and pepper and we were good to go.I served this baked chicken, garnished with sesame seeds and green onions, with some steamed broccoli (it's on my list to try roasted broccoli though!) and coconut quinoa - because my kids are weird and actually like quinoa better than rice.

16,CRIME,Holmes' Lawyers Object To Testimony That's Too 'Upsetting',,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/colorado-movie-gunmans-l_n_7259894.html,,2015-05-11,"FILE - In this June 4, 2013, file photo, Aurora, Colo., theater shooting defendant James Holmes appears in court in Centennial, Colo. Taxpayer costs for the Colorado theater shooting case have risen to at least $2.2 million before the trial has even started. That figure doesn't include legal costs for the defendant. The Holmes trial is expected to start April 27. (AP Photo/The Denver Post, Andy Cross, Pool, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ba2b6a42100003300c6569f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Keith CoffmanCENTENNIAL, Colo., May 11 (Reuters) - Lawyers trying to avoid the death penalty for Colorado movie massacre gunman James Holmes objected on Monday when prosecutors tried to bring testimony the defense called ""upsetting"" from investigators at the bloody crime scene in July 2012.Public defenders for Holmes, 27, argued that the former graduate student's right to a fair trial would be jeopardized by lurid details of the scene where 12 people were killed and 70 wounded at the packed midnight premiere of a Batman film in a Denver area multiplex. Prosecutor Rich Orman responded with scorn.""The upsetting thing is that the defendant went into a theater of innocent people and shot! The upsetting thing is the defendant shot a little girl,"" Orman said, his voice shaking with emotion.""The upsetting thing is the crime.""Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Holmes, who has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to multiple counts of murder and attempted murder.Beginning the third week of the trial that is expected to last four to five months, attorneys for the former neuroscience graduate student objected to prosecution plans to call a fingerprint expert who examined the bodies.The defense lawyers said the testimony was likely to be ""upsetting"" and ""unnecessary"" because it follows multiple other law enforcement witnesses who described finding the victims inside theater nine of the Century 16 cinema in Aurora.Arapahoe County District Court Judge Carlos Samour ruled that the prosecution can present evidence on identifying the dead, as long as it does not belabor the point. He said he would deal with defense objections on a question-by-question basis.The jury also heard from an FBI special agent who showed photographs of Holmes' bomb- and booby-trapped apartment.Among the images was a calendar hanging on his bedroom wall with the date of the massacre, July 20, 2012, circled next to a number 1 and the mathematical symbol for infinity.His public defenders say Holmes suffers from schizophrenia and was not in control of his actions when he plotted and carried out the attack. They concede that he opened fire in the theater, and say only his state of mind should be in question.They say the jury could be prejudiced against Holmes if the prosecution persists in its strategy of calling crime scene technicians to give detailed testimony, interspersed with heart-wrenching accounts from wounded survivors.The prosecution says Holmes carried out the massacre because he had lost his girlfriend and career, and had a ""longstanding hatred of mankind.""

The rioting broke out after residents learned that the police officer responsible for the killing of Michael Brown would not be charged with any crime. Few of the businesses destroyed in the rioting in Dellwood and nearby Ferguson have reopened. Two police officers were shot Wednesday while standing outside the Ferguson police station observing a protest. Ferguson has faced many violent protests since the August death of Michael Brown.

After a thorough autopsy examination, there was no evidence of any inflicted trauma to Champion’s body.""Champion, 43, was found hanging from a tree behind a residence that was not his own, the Greensboro Police Department told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.Law enforcement said that Champion was hanging by a strap like those used to secure cargo on car roofs, with no visible wounds and his feet brushing the ground, NBC reports. Investigators initially found no signs of struggle or other trauma on Champion’s body, which could indicate foul play, according to Rusty Andrews, deputy director at the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, talking to Action 2 News Monday.Champion had been interviewed in connection with the murder of a woman on May 2 but had not been charged, Andrews told the station.GBI Special Agent Joe Wooten told NBC Monday that several people had already been interviewed in connection with Champion's death.""I understand that there is a lot of concern"" raised by the news of a black man being hanged in the Deep South, Wooten said. ""Because of that, we're going to be as transparent as we can be.""Over a month ago, Otis Byrd, a 54-year-old black man, was found hanged from a tree in Claiborne County, Mississippi. The FBI has disclosed the autopsy results to Byrd's family but has not said publicly whether his death was by suicide or homicide. "

The building houses the bicameral state legislature and the office of the governor. Located in Sacramento, the Neoclassical structure was completed between 1861 and 1874 at the west end of Capitol Park, which is framed by L Street to the north, N Street to the south, 10th Street to the west, and 15th Street to the east. The Capitol and grounds were listed on the office of the National Register of Historic Places in 1973,[1] and listed as a California Historical Landmark in 1974, with a re-dedication on January 9, 1982 to commemorate the close of the bicentennial restoration project. The building is based on the U.S. Capitol building in Washington D.C. The west facade ends in projecting bays, and a portico projects from the center of the building. At the base of the portico, seven granite archways brace and support the porch above. Eight fluted Corinthian columns line the portico. A cornice supports the pediment above depicting Minerva surrounded by Education, Justice, Industry and Mining. Above the flat roof with balustrade are two drums supporting a dome. The first drum consists of a colonnade of Corinthian columns; the second, Corinthian pilasters. Large arched windows line the drum walls. The dome is 64 m (210 ft) high, and supports a lantern with a smaller dome capped with a gold-leafed orbed finial. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Capitol"" role=""link"" class="" js-entry-link cet-external-link"" data-vars-item-name=""en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Capitol"" data-vars-item-type=""text"" data-vars-unit-name=""5bb8f793e4b087750101edb7"" data-vars-unit-type=""buzz_body"" data-vars-target-content-id=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Capitol"" data-vars-target-content-type=""url"" data-vars-type=""web_external_link"" data-vars-subunit-name=""article_body"" data-vars-subunit-type=""component"" data-vars-position-in-subunit=""0"">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Capitol</a><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License"" role=""link"" class="" js-entry-link cet-external-link"" data-vars-item-name=""en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_..."" data-vars-item-type=""text"" data-vars-unit-name=""5bb8f793e4b087750101edb7"" data-vars-unit-type=""buzz_body"" data-vars-target-content-id=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License"" data-vars-target-content-type=""url"" data-vars-type=""web_external_link"" data-vars-subunit-name=""article_body"" data-vars-subunit-type=""component"" data-vars-position-in-subunit=""1"">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_...</a>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f7933c000018010e02cd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SACRAMENTO, Calif., May 11 (Reuters) - Elected officials in California will get 3 percent raises under a package approved Monday by the state's Citizens Compensation Commission, after it cut their salaries during the recession.The commission voted unanimously for the increase at a meeting in Sacramento, citing the state's economic recovery.The raises will affect members of the legislature and all statewide elected officials, including Democratic Governor Jerry Brown.Starting in December, Brown will make about $183,000, up from $177,467 this year.

(AP Photo/Lynne Sladky)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafdb9a3c000018010ba800.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Andrew M. Seaman(Reuters Health) - The largest group of internal medicine doctors in the U.S. came out Monday in support of policies it says will improve the health of the country's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people. Those policies include support for civil marriage rights for same-sex couples, opposition to so-called conversion or reparative therapy and support for health insurance plans that include comprehensive transgender healthcare services. ""The LGBT community deserves the same high quality care that any community in the United States should be getting, but may not be getting,"" said Dr. Wayne J. Riley, president of the American College of Physicians. A new policy position paper from the college, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, is the result of more than a year of work, Riley told Reuters Health. ""It's based upon our longstanding policy in regard to eliminating healthcare disparities,"" said Riley, who is also a clinical professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville. The LGBT community faces similar health concerns as the rest of the population, according to the organization in its paper, but some disparities may be worse among LGBT people. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that some 1.1 million people in the U.S. are living with HIV. About one case in six is undiagnosed. While the CDC says only about 4 percent of U.S. men are gay or bisexual, they represent about two-thirds of the country's new infections. Also, the American College of Physicians writes that lesbian and bisexual women are less likely to be screened for breast or cervical cancer, compared to heterosexual women. A separate paper in the same issue of the journal reports that lesbian girls and women are less likely to receive the human papillomavirus vaccine, which helps prevent cervical cancer. The position paper identifies nine policy positions the organization supports. For example, it says that gender identity, which is different than sexual orientation, be included in nondiscrimination and antiharassment policies. Also, the organization says health insurance plans should include comprehensive transgender healthcare services and provide all services to transgender people as they would to others. ""It focuses in on making sure that transgender individuals can access the appropriate level of healthcare services to provide them with the opportunities that you or I and anybody else has with health and wellness,"" Riley said. The paper also comes out against the use of so-called conversion or reparative therapy, which has been banned by an increasing number of U.S. states. ""We agree conversion therapy is not a wise use of healthcare resources,"" Riley said. The organization also supports civil marriage rights for same-sex couples. Denying those rights has a negative impact on physical and mental health, and contributes to stigma and discrimination, it says. The top editors of the New England Journal of Medicine also urged the U.S. Supreme Court to require ""the full recognition of same-sex marriage,"" in a recent editorial. ""It's important, because we know from our members that simple things like hospital visitation and participation in the care of LGBT patients has been a huge problem around the country,"" Riley said. The quality of healthcare should be consistently provided for all population groups, he said. ""This speaks to the fact that the nation's largest specialty society comes down on the side of health equity for all,"" he added.

The following are simply the things I experienced and there is no one-size-fits-all approach. As a country we need to tackle the big-picture issues and critical details to provide comprehensive support to all working families, regardless of gender, race, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status. To prepare for the arrival of my daughter, fourteen months old this Mother's Day, I turned to friends and family for advice on strollers, swaddles, bottles and more. Many had long lists of registry suggestions, from life-saving nipple cream to hands-free pumping bras (all very new to me). Yet, no one had ready-made advice for how to juggle a baby and a job. My Mother's Day gift to you? A list of things I wish I'd known before taking on the high-wire work-baby balancing act.9. Managing IS Succeeding Parents shoulder enormous pressure today to do things better and faster, both on the job and at home. Forget the catalogue images of color-coordinated baby nurseries, timely sent greeting cards, and home-cooked meals. Being employed with an infant means you have less time -- for everything. As soon as I let go of the idea that I would be picture perfect in every part of my life, especially when deeply sleep-deprived, the better I could feel about simply keeping all the balls in the air.8. Fully Leaving on Leave?Before maternity leave, I prepared a list of projects to be handled (thankfully) by others in my absence. In California, one taking leave should be free from all workplace duties when disabled by pregnancy or childbirth and during the bonding period with your child. (Check out, for example, these resources for more information on which laws might cover you as a birth parent or non-birth parent). Yet, once things settled down with the baby, I started to wonder: ""How are things going at work? ""What will happen to my commitments when I return?"" ""Do I want to stay in touch with work during my leave?"" My employer put no pressure on me to communicate or work during leave. But increasing numbers of women confront this issue, curious if they should check in (via email, phone, or dropping by) during maternity leave. Frankly, there's no right answer. It helped me to speak frankly with my colleagues and supervisors before my leave to ensure a mutual understanding about how in touch, or not, I would be. 7. It's Not What You ThoughtFeelings may change while on leave -- I quickly learned how consuming and draining it can be to breastfeed your baby on demand every one to two hours while putting her down for naps usually five(!) times a day in the early months, not to mention night wakings. And cutting tiny newborn baby fingernails should be part of Navy SEAL training. But the first smiles (perhaps gas?) kept me going. New moms and their families are still figuring out how to press ""pause"" on the job to focus on the baby while remaining steady on the work track for long-term success. No need to have it all figured out ahead of time!6. Pumping Is a Job in ItselfPumping breastmilk for my baby while at work required some serious scheduling--worthwhile given the enormous benefits of breastmilk (although, understandably, pumping is not easy or ideal for everyone). I literally made appointments with myself in order to: protect that time, ensure others respected that time, avoid uncomfortable breast engorgement, and provide enough milk for my baby for the following day. Carve the hours out because you and your baby deserve it! Generally employers are required to provide breaks for pumping time, but I worked longer days, worked more efficiently, and/or worked at night  to stay on top of things. If you wish, talk about pumping with bosses and coworkers so they understand what it requires, as many simply don't know. I'd never laid eyes on a breast pump before using one. Most of all, make sure to learn about and use your workplace lactation rights! 5. Wait, No Shortcuts?!No matter how many devices and apps I tried, or guides and web-sites I read, I realized there's no one way to raise a baby, no perfect recipe for work-baby balance, and (sadly) no easy path. Get ready for contradictory advice. Laugh (at least to yourself) when well-meaning friends recommend 300-page baby sleep solution books to read in your ""down-time."" Appreciate somehow getting ready for work when the baby refuses breakfast, then insists on eating yours, and needs a diaper change just as you're heading for the door. I picked what worked for me, over time, usually based on trial and error. 4. Know and Use Your RightsOnly thirty six percent of individuals in California are aware they can take paid leave (with partial wage replacement) to care for their seriously ill loved ones or bond with a new baby (or adopted or foster child). This is money workers must set aside from their own earnings in each pay check (reflected on your pay stub) to use when they need time off. The statistics for low-income workers and workers of color show even fewer people are aware of this paid benefit. Very few states provide paid leave for caregiving and bonding--just California, New Jersey and Rhode Island. It is not always easy to use these benefits and exercise such rights, given complicated benefits forms, bureaucratic challenges and delays. But we all must support each other and reward best practices to exercise these rights so families may flourish.3. No Getting Back to NormalThe first few months of having a baby or being back on the job could be tough, but then things would go back to normal -- right? Turns out there's no normal anymore. Our baby, and others I suspect, is constantly changing. What works to get her to sleep tonight won't necessarily work in a few weeks. The foods a fourteen-month old will eat for dinner (versus throw on the floor) are totally different from those appealing to a seven-month old. And babies need constant medical check-ups, plus they get sick a lot (in some states and cities parents can use sick leave to care for ill children). Accepting change as the only constant keeps me realistic and on my toes. The bright side: monotony would be boring. 2. Trust the VillageIt may take a village, but you have to trust the villagers. Gratefully, I can rely on my husband (committed to gender-equitable parenting), another family member, or a caretaker to help with the baby when I'm tied up with work obligations. At first I thought ""she'll only fall asleep if I read her Goodnight Moon"" or ""my husband can't possibly know the precise rocking tempo that soothes her during tantrums."" Despite my fears, my daughter in fact loves it when my husband puts her to bed. He has creative, completely effective ways of doing things that amaze me and delight the baby (i.e., changing her diaper while she stands!?). Also, turning to other parents on how to overcome the next new parenting challenge (e.g., storing breastmilk on a work trip) through Google and Facebook groups helps me figure out workarounds to save time and energy for job demands. By letting go of total control, asking for and expecting help from my spouse or others, and relying on the whole team, I am more free to focus on work and pleasantly surprised by the great new influences on the baby. 1. Savor the Moment, at Least for a MomentWorking while raising an infant has its challenges but I love my job and I love my daughter. Yes, it is hard. Yes, I miss my baby. But I actively work to savor the special, everyday moments in both my home and work worlds. I enjoy the exciting on-the-job challenges (not to mention the uninterrupted meals and cups of coffee). When I'm at home on the floor with the little one building (or, more commonly, destroying) a pile of blocks, I try to slow down, put the phone away, and focus on her. Because when work is done my other job and joy is to experience and help this amazing developing person."

Everyone thought I was living the dream, but I was suffering on the inside. I felt a very strong pull towards something, but wasn't sure of what. As I went up in the mountains every day, I learned to see life from above again. Nature helped me remember that all is one. I sold my ownership in the company and left. I knew that my purpose was to remind the world of unity, but not sure how until one odd day.Two months after leaving my job, I found an old black & white wall clock I had bought 8 years earlier. I had never used it, I really don't like clocks. I only bought it because it said ""the truth"" on it. Something about it made me keep it all those years. As I was looking at it that day, I realized something. The time is always now. The clock should say now, that is the truth. When we shed the illusions of separation and labels and immerse into the present, we feel the unity of all things. That is how ""the truth"" inspired us to steal time back!starting this company meant.? To redefine what a company is.

I recently had turned 60 and was exercising daily, busy at my public relations career, and I had just published a book. I was feeling fine. All of a sudden I noticed the whites of my eyes were yellow. I had a sonogram and then a CAT scan, which showed a tumor in my pancreas. Next step was to see a surgeon, a middle-aged man with slicked back hair, impeccably dressed, with an expensive watch around his wrist. He looked up at my daughter, son, brother, partner and me from behind his desk and asked, ""How much do you know?""""Not much,"" I answered. Then he turned his placid face to me and spoke in a way that I will never forget. He could have told me anything with his dry tone: ""I am eating at a great restaurant tonight,"" or ""It is unseasonably warm today.""Instead he said, ""I have devastating news. You have stage IV pancreatic cancer and about a year to live.""We were silent. All we heard was the sound of my daughter dropping all her questions on the floor in a heap of despair.   He continued, ""You have two choices of treatment: One treatment is tough to endure; the other is even tougher. The tougher treatment will extend your life by two months or so.""""What do I do?"" I asked. His clipped answer was, ""Live a day at a time.""I did not listen to his advice. We need a powerful public outcry about the dismal state of treatment for pancreatic cancer. The same number of people die from pancreatic cancer as breast cancer every year. Yet we have such meager choices for treatments. It is increasingly up to us -- patients and families -- to advocate aggressively for better treatments and ensure that we are getting the right treatment for ourselves.So as other families grapple with the astounding lack of treatments for pancreatic cancer, I hope they can benefit by my approach.It is well known that after you receive bad news, the five stages of grief often emerge: Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, and Acceptance.I have experienced all these stages, but I have harnessed them in an unconventional way. I use these feelings to penetrate the resigned reaction that appears whenever my diagnosis is mentioned. DENIAL I used denial to help identify the best pancreatic cancer doctors and science. Denial became my research partner. It helped me stay objective when the data is devastating.What I quickly realized is that pancreatic cancer has a lot of nothings: no early detection, no symptoms, no long-term effective treatment, and no cure. A heartbreaking only 7 percent percent of pancreatic cancer patients live five years or more.These facts made me furious. ANGER Anger drove me to find the best and most innovative doctors possible, not just those who were geographically convenient. I was angry to learn that basically there are only three ""approved"" first line treatments for pancreatic cancer. These guidelines for treating pancreatic cancer, written by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) are used by the majority of oncologists, and it's my opinion that none of these treatments work very well over a long period of time, and no one discusses that. I was angry. Why had there been no public outcry about the lack of progress and advances in treatments and early detection. Why are our options so limited?Promising science and innovative research are now emerging, due to organizations like The Lustgarten Foundation that is funding many leading scientists to focus their research on pancreatic cancer treatments and early detection. Yet the brutal reality is that scientific advances are not moving into treatment fast enough to extend the lives of nearly 50,000 people who will be diagnosed with the disease this year. I wanted to shout at anybody I encountered: ""We can't wait!! We have the worst mortality rate of any cancer! We must find new treatments.""But instead of spending my days shouting, my family and I channeled the anger into researching the best pancreatic cancer doctors in the country. We found organizations such as The Lustgarten Foundation, the experts at Stand Up To Cancer and Pancreatic Cancer Action Network very helpful in providing their view of top experts. We talked to local oncologists and radiologists for their opinion as well. And after doing an intensive three-week research, we found doctors who have outstanding experience, and importantly, were willing to take new creative approaches to treating my cancer.I work with Dr. William Isacoff in Los Angeles and Dr. Allyson Ocean in New York at Weill Cornell Medical College. We first traveled to Los Angeles to meet Dr. Isacoff, a well known, highly-regarded pancreatic cancer expert and a brilliant pioneer in developing slow-dosing protocols for pancreatic cancer patients. As soon as we were ushered into his office we knew that we were going to have a very different experience. His boundless dedication to help pancreatic patients extend their lives engulfs the room. I asked, ""What treatment do you think will be right for me?"" And what stood out in his answer was his honesty. He answered that he was angry about the dismal state of progress in treatment in the past 40 years and told us that little had been accomplished -- only two successful clinical trials for protocols that still did not extend life by much. Yet within his candid response there was a steady message of optimism from someone who does not accept the status quo. He has worked years to develop a distinctive treatment protocol with a combinations of drugs that could potentially extend my life. We decided to go forward with his innovative approach after I met patients in his waiting room who have been seeing Dr. Isacoff for pancreatic cancer treatment for many years and were full of praise for his treatment. Dr. Isacoff also has a comprehensive website that provides data and a description of his metronomic dosing. My family and I moved to Los Angeles for four weeks to begin treatment with Dr. Isacoff on his protocol. More to come on how the treatment works in my next post."

The 7.8 magnitude earthquake which struck the Himalayan nation on April 25, 2015 completely destroyed 288,798 houses nationwide while 254,112 homes were partially damaged, according to the Himalayan country's National Emergency Operation Centre. AFP PHOTO/Philippe Lopez (Photo credit should read PHILIPPE LOPEZ/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1d92d2000003000ffc57a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Amidst the destruction and aftermath of the recent earthquake in Nepal, daily miracles and moments of compassion illustrate what is possible when humanity bands together -- babies pulled alive from rubble, mothers sheltering hours-old newborns and citizens rushing in from around the world to provide relief to massive suffering. We're reminded of the days and months after an earthquake leveled Haiti in 2010. The despair and poverty Haiti had experienced for generations caught the world's attention and a flood of emergency support made construction of better health facilities, roads and schools possible. Imagine the possibilities if humanity banded together before disaster struck to relieve everyday suffering worldwide. As we grieve the thousands lost in Nepal, we also grieve for the hundreds of thousands of women who die annually during pregnancy and childbirth. Many mothers die in countries like Nepal and Haiti where poverty and social barriers prevent women from accessing the health care they need every day. Women die bringing life into the world in many countries, including the U.S. In fact, one woman dies every two minutes from what we know are almost always preventable conditions. In a single week, we reach the death toll we're currently seeing in Nepal. In a single year and every year, more mothers die while having babies than all the lives lost in Haiti's earthquake. Imagine the possibilities if the world focused its attention on this devastation. Every Mother Counts is a nonprofit organization dedicated to making pregnancy and childbirth safe for every mother. We inform, engage and mobilize audiences to take action and raise funds that support maternal health programs around the world. Our organization is only 5 years old, but by working with partners, we already know what is possible when a community of committed people knock down maternal health barriers like lack of education, transportation and supplies. We've already raised more than $2.6 million and impacted almost 150,000 lives. And as part of a global effort and community of governmental and non-governmental organizations, we've made huge strides. In 2000, 500,000 mothers died every year. Today, that number is 289,000 -- far too many, but proof of what is possible when people commit to finding solutions. May is the month when people focus on mothers more than any other time of year. We believe that every mother has the right to access the care she needs during pregnancy and childbirth to support her health and to prevent and manage potential complications. Failure to meet this need means that this Mother's Day, and every day, 800 girls and women will continue to die when they could survive and thrive. Every Mother Counts provides solutions to the barriers that make accessing this life-saving care nearly impossible. We know that with the right care at the right time, every mother could survive pregnancy and childbirth. Throughout May, Every Mother Counts is celebrating Mother's Day by highlighting #WhatIsPossible for every mother. Our short film illustrates how Every Mother Counts improves access to care and makes pregnancy and childbirth safer for more mothers. Starting May 1, we invite you to spread the good news about #WhatIsPossible by sharing our film through social media. Join us in becoming part of #WhatIsPossible and help us create the future of maternal health."
