Then, we'll discuss Seymour Hersh's new piece, which has become the center of a lot of criticism.

There were dozens of celebrated blues men and women out there, and we had a stack of albums and 45s by all of them. But B.B. was somewhere above and beyond them all. His sound was somehow purer and more powerful than any other. It came from somewhere others couldn't go. Can't even be described, B.B.'s ""sound.""

If you like the one song, please go listen to--and maybe buy--the whole thing.It was King's favorite, too. And it sold better, I'm sure, than any of his previous albums. Perhaps better than all the others.The song I've chosen, ""You're Still My Woman,"" is the one that stopped me in my tracks the day my mother first played that album. I was a rock and roll girl, so I knew many of my favorite British bands had been influenced by her blues. But I wasn't ""into"" her blues. Until that very day, when this achingly beautiful song filled me with a sweet sorrow that hinted at life experiences still 'way over the horizon for me at the time.I just hoped I would be able to make something wonderful of them, the way B.B. had.

Burundi's government was Saturday accused of launching a campaign of reprisals and repression against independent media, the day after loyalist troops defeated an attempted coup against the central African nation's president. AFP PHOTO / JENNIFER HUXTA (Photo credit should read Jennifer Huxta/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14cc5240000500024fd26.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BUJUMBURA, May 16 (Reuters) - Burundi took 18 people suspected of involvement in a failed coup against President Pierre Nkurunziza to the high court on Saturday, relatives of some of the accused said.Earlier, about a hundred demonstrators took to the streets of Bujumbura to protest against Nkurunziza's decision to seek a third term, defying the president's call the previous day for an end to the weeks-long protests.The east African nation was plunged into deep crisis after Nkurunziza announced he was running for another five-year term, with clashes between police and protesters stirring memories of an ethnically driven civil war that ended a decade ago.""A lot of us citizens do not want the constitution to be violated as he is not allowed to lead for the third term.... We will demonstrate until he steps down,"" said Nduwimana Belamie, one of the protesters.Opponents say Nkurunziza's decision violates the constitution and the Arusha deal to end the war that pitted rebel groups of the majority Hutu population, including one led by Nkurunziza, against the army which was then commanded by minority Tutsis.The army is now mixed and has absorbed rival factions, but the coup attempt exposed divisions.The fate of General Godefroid Niyombare, who had announced the president's ouster on Wednesday, was still not clear on Saturday. Loyalist troops calmed the streets of the capital on Friday following clashes between the two factions.Speaking on condition of anonymity due to fears of reprisals, family members of two of the 18 men taken to court told Reuters the suspects had raw wounds on their bodies and one of them had lost hearing in one of his ears due to a beating in the cells.One of the men, identified by onlookers as Juvenal Niyungeko, a senior officer, was escorted into the court without shoes and restrained by handcuffs.It was not immediately clear what charges they were facing.Christella Harerimana, a lawyer representing three of the suspects, said one of her clients had been walking barefoot since he was arrested, and that he had been held in a house rather than a police cell, contrary to legal requirements.""They have violated their human rights,"" Harerimana said, adding it was not clear what would happen next to the men.The president's spokesman declined to comment on the claims of abuse when contacted by Reuters.Residents of Bujumbura said they were planning to come out in large numbers on Monday to protest against Nkurunziza's decision to seek a third term.More than 105,000 people have already fled to neighboring countries, including to Rwanda, with the same ethnic mix as Burundi and which was torn apart by a genocide in 1994 that killed 800,000 mostly Tutsis and moderate Hutus.

He was killed by Bane in ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" played Jessa's father in HBO's ""Girls,"" and appeared alongside Brad Pitt in ""Killing Them Softly."" This year alone, Mendelsohn's credits include Netflix's ""Bloodline,"" Ryan Gosling's directorial debut ""Lost River,"" gambler film ""Mississippi Grind "" and indie Western ""Slow West."" Let's also not forget that he might star alongside Felicity Jones in ""Star Wars: Rogue One.""In John Maclean's feature film debut, ""Slow West,"" Michael Fassbender (who previously worked with Maclean on two short films), plays Silas, a mysterious traveler headed west in 16th-century Colorado. Silas helps 16-year-old Scottish boy Jay Cavendish (Kodi Smit-McPhee) on his journey to find the girl he loves until they run into Mendelsohn's Payne, a villainous leader of a gang of bounty hunters.The Huffington Post sat down with Mendelsohn at the Tribeca Film Festival last month to discuss the wardrobe he took home from ""Slow West,"" who he'd like to play in the ""Star Wars"" universe, and his bizarre dance in ""Lost River.""I loved ""Slow West."" It’s so beautifully made. Yeah, [Maclean] did really well, didn’t he? It’s beautifully shot. He’s got something, that guy. And Fassbender found him, or they found each other. So I just got asked on board when it was all in its shape and I have a little turn in it.You don’t show up in too many scenes, but when Payne is on screen he definitely makes an impression. This, I like this. And that coat [points to the film poster].Payne's coat is amazing! Did you get to keep it? I have that coat. I have it sitting on a mannequin at home. I don’t have memorabilia, but try to take a bit of wardrobe, usually because they dress me better than I dress myself. But that coat, that’s a thing of beauty. I’m very proud of it.Are you going to wear it around? Yeah, I suppose I might bust it out in moments of great bravery or just deep cold. I did wear it for the premiere in Sundance.What was it like working with Fassbender?  Michael had a lot of stuff to do. It was all drunk hoo-ha and boy, he did some incredibly dangerous things around a fire, which aren’t in the [final] cut. There was some falling, some drunken shenanigans near fires and rocks, sh*t that I was going, “Oh, f**k.” But there’s a fearlessness to the way he works that is pretty admirable. And Kodi [Smit-McPhee], there’s such a delicateness to him. When he starts acting, he feels like gossamer. It was a good couple of days. You’ve been so well-known in Australia, but now you’re finally having a breakthrough in the U.S. What’s that feel like? It’s cool. It’s been a great several years. I came here for a very, very long time and just couldn’t get any sort of traction going. There were a couple of people who liked me, but it didn’t translate into anything that was employment based. I like to think that what really helped it was the one-two punch of ""Animal Kingdom"" and either “Place Beyond the Pines” or “Killing Them Softly.” Those combined really seemed to set some wind in the sails. It’s been a dreamy couple of years.I bet. And now there’s those “Star Wars” rumors ... Yeah, there are those rumors.So, are they just rumors? They -- I can definitively and honestly say to you that I have no job yet that I know of to go to. That may change. I would be very happy if that came to pass, but at this stage it’s just chatter.Ideally, if you were in it, what character would you want to play? It would depend. I think that the Empire has such room. We only know of a few people on the Empire side of the fence. “Star Wars” is populated by so many great types, who wouldn’t want to be a Han Solo kind of dude? And then you’ve got the whole Luke strain. I don’t think that they’re likely to -- I’d be thrilled, actually, if they were looking at me for a Skywalkery-type of a number. But yeah, there’s a lot.You also worked with Gosling again in “Lost River,” where you have singing and dancing scenes. Had you ever done something like that before? No, I’ve never sung before. That’s me doing my Frankie Laine impersonation. There’s a little film I did where I sing a bit, but nothing like that. And the dance was something we just figured out very last minute just before we were going to shoot the scene. We knew we had it coming up and I went down there and we put on a A$AP Rocky track and just danced off.That’s even more bizarre because that’s totally different from the song playing in the scene. That’s right, it’s not [the same]. But if you ever want to hear what it was that I was dancing to, it is “F**king Problems.”Did you know the song before that? Yeah, I was familiar with the opus. I’m a reasonably -- I have my phases -- but I really like music.""Slow West"" is now playing in select theaters."

Demonstrators have planned days of protests, both on land and in Elliott Bay, home to the Port of Seattle, where the first of the two rigs docked on Thursday.Kayakers on Saturday paddled around the rig yelling ""Shell No."" Others unfurled a large banner that read ""Climate Justice.""Environmental groups contend harsh and shifting weather conditions make it impossible to drill in the Arctic, a region with a fragile environment that helps regulate the global climate because of its vast layers of sea ice.Allison Warden, 42, said she traveled from Alaska to represent her native Inupiaq tribe, which makes its home in the Arctic. She said whales central to the tribe's culture are particularly vulnerable to oil spills. ""I don't know what our culture would be without whaling. It's at the center of everything we do,"" she said. ""It's a different relationship than just going to the grocery store. The whale feeds the entire community,"" she said.Opponents of the rigs docking in Seattle, a city known for its environmental causes, include Mayor Ed Murray and the City Council.Shell was bringing in the rigs and moving ahead as planned despite the opposition and a ruling earlier this week by the city's planning department that the port's agreement with the company was in violation of its city permit.""The timeline now is just to make sure the rigs are ready to go,"" said Curtis Smith, a Shell spokesman. The second rig is expected at the port in the coming days.Earlier this week, the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management gave conditional approval to Shell's resumption of fossil fuel exploration in the Arctic, which was suspended after a mishap-filled 2012 season.The decision was met with approval by some Alaska lawmakers, who said it would bring money and jobs to the state.

American Pharoah, ridden by jockey Victor Espinoza, edged out a tough field of eight horses in Saturday's race in Baltimore, adding to trainer Bob Baffert's string of victories. If American Pharoah can follow up with a win at the Belmont Stakes after the Preakness, Baffert can add a Triple Crown -- a sweep of the top races -- to his war chest.American Pharoah was the favorite heading into the race at Pimlico Race Course, but by no means without competition, having to beat out rivals he bested at the Kentucky Derby, Dortmund and Firing Line, who were also picked as horses to watch. American Pharoah also had the unfavorable No. 1 post.Mr. Z started off the race in front, but the Kentucky Derby winner pulled ahead in the stretch, finishing first with an impressive lead.Tale of Verve finished second and Divining Rod was third, followed by Dortmund, Mr. Z, Danzig Moon, Firing Line and Bodhisattva.American Pharoah won the 1 3/16th-mile race by seven lengths, according to the Associated Press: the largest distance since 2004.""Just an incredible horse, what he does is amazing. American Pharoah from day one people were expecting this and with the weather I was getting a little leery but great horses do great things and he showed it today,"" Baffert said. Prior to the race, a torrential downpour and thunderstorms turned the course to mush and forced emergency officials to evacuate the infield and grandstands, which held a record 131,680 people. But the weather didn't seem to faze Pharoah.""I always told everybody American Pharoah would show up today,"" owner Ahmed Zayat said. ""He is the real deal.""American Pharoah's Preakness victory was his sixth victory in a row, and he now is only the 14th horse with a shot at the Triple Crown since 1978. It will be Baffert's fourth attempt at the coveted prize -- the most tries any trainer in history has had. The date with destiny at Belmont is June 6 in New York.Baffert, the trainer of both American Pharoah and Dortmund, has won the Preakness six times, and the Derby four times.

People are waking up to the fact that the Western diet is damaging our health and that industrial farming is effectively destroying our planet. And with climate change looming large on the horizon, a growing global population, and ever-diminishing natural resources, shaping up is in order!But while I'm pleased to see more people making the connections between our food choices, our health, and our impact on the planet, I'm super concerned the food debate is becoming way too polarized. I wrote What The Fork to open up a more moderate dialogue about food and food choice. While I advocate for organic food, I see a rising obsession for certified USDA Organic that is alarming. In other words, anything that doesn't have the organic seal is rejected as ""poisonous garbage,"" and the farmers who produced it labeled as ""evil.""Take the recent ""New MacDonald"" video released by Only Organic -- a group that's made up of some of the country's biggest organic food corporations like Organic Valley (I'll come back to these guys later on). At first glance it seemed like a good thing: ""In a playful way, our new video turns the spotlight on the true costs of conventional farming and the harm it does to environmental health,"" the promotional blurb says. Featuring schools kids singing a mash-up of the classic ""Old MacDonald Had A Farm"" song, it all starts innocently enough. But soon the words change -- ""with a hormone here and a hormone there,"" ""a small cage here and a tight cage there,"" ""here a spray, there a spray, everywhere a spray spray"" -- and the kids are doused with clouds of pesticides. The viewer is left with the impression that every non-organic farm is full of pesticide sprays and so on. Playful?! Talk about how to alienate and infuriate almost the entire farming community in one hit! The video has raised the hackles of those I know in the farming community -- and that includes certified organic farmers. Watch the video and try to imagine you're a non-organic farmer. How would you feel if you, your livelihood, and your way of life were portrayed like this? Farmers from across the spectrum were swift to damn the video. Twitter was abuzz with criticisms from individual farmers. For example, @NYFarmer wrote: ""Few people in the food movement grasp what it means to the farmers to be so devalued and dehumanized by big biz in #NewMacDonald campaign."" Pretty powerful words, right? The farming press was also awash with articles criticizing the video for being divisive and misleading, and highlighting widespread anger across almost the entire farming community. Don't get me wrong: I passionately believe we need fundamental reform in our food systems and an end to industrial farming. But in the debate about where our food comes from and how it's produced, we've lost sight of the middle ground -- and also the folks who are living and working there. Sadly, I think Only Organic's ""New MacDonald"" video will end up doing more harm than good -- as I believe anyone who talks edible silver bullets risks doing!I'm fast learning there are many thousands of farmers out there who are managing their farms as best they can, who are producing quality food, and raising their animals well and with the environment in mind. The chances are they probably inherited the farm from their parents and grandparents, so willingly destroying it or its capabilities would be like burning down the family home. The same with the animals: Most farmers want to treat their animals the best way they can. The vast majority of farmers take great pride in producing our food and managing the land. But they're not certified organic. Does this make them evil people who are hell bent on poisoning our kids, abusing animals, and destroying the planet, as Only Organic's New MacDonald video appears to suggest? Of course it doesn't. Similarly, there are countless Moms and Dads out there who are doing their best to feed their kids, but they're not providing them with an all-organic diet. Does this make them bad or abusive parents? Hell, no. Central to my work is meeting people where they are at, and helping them to do better. And a key part of that is to understand that they must feel good about what they can do versus what they can't. Everyone has a different starting point. And you can apply that logic to farmers, too. In this whole ""organic"" vs. ""conventional"" conversation, the incredible work of many family farmers is being completely ignored -- or even belittled -- in the pursuit of some ""Farming Nirvana."" At the same time, millions of average families are being excluded from the food debate because they're made to feel ""bad"" from the very outset for not shopping at a farmers' market or buying organic. And then you wonder why the foodie movement is increasingly being criticized for being elitist and out of touch?Although I am a firm supporter of organic food, buying ""organic"" isn't always the answer. And while there are countless thousands of organic farmers out there who are farming with the organic principles front and center, and offering their communities wholesome and nutritious foods, there are some serious problems hiding behind the organic label -- particularly if you're buying big brand organic food from a major retailers like Walmart, Target and Costco. The problem is there are major players in the organic sector who want to bend the rules and exploit loopholes as far as they can to maximize profit and market share. And there are some major loopholes to exploit. Did you know, for example, you could take certified organic cattle, confine them on a feedlot and feed them an unhealthy (but certified organic) grain-based diet, and yet still label the meat as organic? Or that some of the largest ""organic"" dairies now contain 10,000-20,000 head of cows, and that these cows get very little in the way of real grazing on pasture (as required by law), and instead are mainly fed on cut ""organic"" grass carted to their gigantic barns? Or that when you buy ""organic"" eggs from one of the major retailers, you're almost certainly buying eggs from vast industrial-type barn operations where tens of thousands of ""organic"" birds are kept indoors in a single house and probably never even go outdoors? If you don't believe me, read this pretty depressing article in The Washington Post, which exposes the industrial farms that are masquerading as organic. These unscrupulous players are not only threatening the livelihoods of countless real organic farming businesses out there, but could ultimately undermine consumer trust in the organic label for good. Like I said before, there are thousands of great organic farmers out there. Support them, because they need it. But ostracizing people just because they don't farm to the letter of the organic regulations or because their pantry isn't stock full of organic food is NOT the way forward. What we need to do is to shift the conversation from one that is super polarized and antagonistic to one where people can start to appreciate and understand the problems we ALL face. In doing so, we can make solving the growing food crisis a truly collaborative process, and one where people from all walks of life feel they have an important role to play. Because they really do.

As we learn to pay greater attention to our feelings by identifying and sharing them with others, our stress will decrease and our emotional intimacy and support will increase.",2015-05-15,2015-04-29-1430337483-337176-friendstalkingmarcomonetti.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-29-1430337483-337176-friendstalkingmarcomonetti-thumb.jpg,"In many kinds of individual and group therapy, we are instructed how to identify what we are feeling, disclose what we are feeling, listen carefully and without judgment to the feelings of others and acknowledge others' feelings with empathy, caring and compassion. It's often helpful to assign a ""feeling word"" to the emotion you wish to express. Examples might include feeling: anxious, worried, happy, angry, confused, left out, frustrated, peaceful, determined, relieved, joyous, etc.By using this format, you learn about yourself by uncovering and expressing the emotions that are fueling your behavioral choices. As this internal muscle of self-awareness grows, it becomes much easier to connect within and also to express feelings more clearly and directly to trusted others. This, in fact, is the primary goal of group therapy -- to increase emotional and social intimacy and decrease isolation in our lives. This increased awareness also fosters more deliberate and conscious lifestyle choices. A study conducted by UCLA professor of psychology Matthew D. Lieberman found that putting feelings into words makes sadness, anger and pain less intense. According to Lieberman, when we feel angry we have increased activity in the part of the brain called the amygdala. The amygdala is responsible for detecting fear and setting off a series of biological alarms and responses to protect the body from danger. When the angry feeling is labeled, Lieberman and researchers noted a decreased response in the amygdala and an increased activity in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. This part of the brain is involved with inhibiting behavior and processing emotions.Lieberman explains it this way: When you put feelings into words, you're activating this prefrontal region and seeing a reduced response in the amygdala. In the same way you hit the brake when you're driving when you see a yellow light -- when you put feelings into words you seem to be hitting the brakes on your emotional responses. As a result, a person may feel less angry or less sad.As we learn to identify, label and express emotions, this area of the brain is strengthened. In turn, we are then better able to respond to our feelings less reactively and more responsively.Dr. Ornish writes: ""When you take time for your feelings, you become less stressed and you can think more clearly and creatively, making it easier to find constructive solutions.""Science is now verifying what we have known to be true in our experience. Naming and sharing our emotions with a trusted other helps us to understand the breadth and depth of what matters most to us. Lieberman believes that this is ""ancient wisdom."" He says: ""Putting our feelings into words helps us. If a friend is sad and we get them to talk about it, they will feel better.""In our daily, lifestyle practice we know that when we feel better, we do better. As we learn to pay greater attention to our feelings by identifying and sharing them with others, our stress will decrease and our emotional intimacy and support will increase. Dr. Ornish sums the result up nicely: ""When you take time for your feelings, you become less stressed and you can think more clearly and creatively, making it easier to find constructive solutions.""What benefits have you found in sharing your feelings with those you trust?This blog was originally published on Ornish Living."

What gifts would you give?  Most of us can't begin to imagine a time when our minds might betray us, when our thoughts may stay frozen, unable to make the journey from our brain to our tongue. Unuttered sentences. Lost syllables. The coldness of a silence that imposes itself without want nor welcome. Being witness to the struggle that those with Alzheimer's face is a challenge. Watching their landscape change from a clear, luminous outlook to a murky, shadowy unknowing seems to be almost as harrowing as the actual decline of the sufferer. Helplessness on both sides. There is little else as heart-wrenching as the bitter blow of no longer being recognized by those we love.   Coming face to face with a blank, vacant stare is an unwelcome reminder of how utterly we define ourselves according to our worth in the eyes of others. When we are forgotten by our loved ones, it leads us to question our own merit, our very existence. It can be uncomfortable observation at best, devastating clarity at worst.   I remember visiting my aunt in hospital when I was a child. I saw through infant eyes the way in which she could seamlessly travel from the present moment to an unknown place. She was able to journey there with ease. An instant transportation. Her expression would change from one of lucid awareness to one of remoteness and I would know that she had left again. She could sometimes recall childhood events but she had no idea what she'd just eaten for lunch. I'm not sure how the mind decides what pieces to hold onto and what to let slip away. I do know, however, that the memory that dementia steals serves as an unapologetic reminder that life is a series of moments, any one of which can be forgotten, almost as though they had never actually existed at all. Fragments of time fall into a space that cannot be harnessed by the mind or pinned down by the pen. They merge into the endless ether, seemingly without a trace. Yet, we are still changed because of them. I like to think that the lost times live on in the heart, even when the minds eye becomes cloudy, that they still have an injection of life through the beat of love that another organ can provide.   A strange, sometimes welcome, side effect of this illness is that not everything is always forgotten and sometimes remnants of clarity remain. The memories the mind fought to keep. Perhaps some things are just so true that neither time nor man can erase them. For the voyeurs, there is a wretchedness that surrounds Alzheimer's. A pendulum that swings from hope to heartbreak with a regularity that offers no comfort. Moments of relief are swiftly replaced by hours of grief. How do we possibly find a way to push through the despondency?Perhaps we take more pleasure in cherishing the beauty of the moment, the only truth we know. Maybe we reassure ourselves that Alzheimer's is simply another state of being, not necessarily one of dark terror, but a different plane that may pose no true harm to those that fly on its wings. Hopefully, above all else, we wrap love around those whose reality is forever removed from ours, keeping them safe as they wander where we cannot follow.

I often post photos of my kids on social media sites of times when they were much younger, for things like Way Back Wednesday, Throwback Thursday and even Flashback Friday. Quite often someone will say, don't you wish you could go back in time and re-live those days? The years just flew by, and some say they go by too swiftly, and at one point I would have agreed.Now my answer to wishing I could go back to the days of my children's youth is a resounding NO, though it was very different when I was a slightly depressed new Empty Nester as written about here..Not that I did not relish each and every moment of my children's youth, give or take a few in the teenage realm. I live life with a gusto and high energy, and approached motherhood the same way. I was a bit over the top, a bit over-involved, a bit of a helicopter mom. Now, looking back I am glad I was. It meant that I lived in the moment and knew the years were fleeting; I knew to get a slice of every experience while I could. If there was an event, a project, a cause, an organization or club, a game, a performance, an extra-curricular, a school event etc, I was not only there, I was often in charge so I could spend more hours relishing the moments when they were happening at that time. My home was the gathering place, our pool was the pool party place, the birthdays parties were always big; the celebrations and holidays the same. I think my kids would agree with the above summary and assessment. (They used to tell me I was the ""Mommiest"" Mommy) I was the mom who took the girls on the Cheer cruise; the mom who took the girls to Cabo for senior Spring Break where they totally ditched me; the mom who was a soccer and Little League and basketball and Maccabi mom. I was the After Prom chair mom, the room mom, the Field Trip mom. I was the school show coordinator mom, the Graduation video mom, and the Cheerleader for a Day camp mom. It was all done lovingly with the intention to not miss out on a single experience of their youth. I drank it in, I breathed it in. I truly enjoyed each and every moment of their active lives.And believe it or not, I was a working mom too. I'm exhausted just remembering all of that!No wasted moments for me, so no need for do-overs.Not that I wouldn't adore grandchildren someday to do all those wonderful things with -- I plan to be the same in that role for everything, that high-energy ultra-involved bubbie (grandmom) for any and all grandchildren when my turn comes.Since I loved and participated in every single moment of raising my children, I am completely satiated, especially when I look back and consider the entirety of it all. But here's the biggest point, and the real reason for this blog I am writing today. (It is not to tout how over-the-top of a mom that I was.) I am still relishing every moment. Now that my children are adults, I am enjoying every minute of my relationship with them as a mom to an adult child. They have turned out to be two of the coolest people on Earth as far as I am concerned. If I was choosing a friend, a conversant, a confidante, someone to laugh with, or someone to spend precious time with, I would choose them over anyone else. It is that much fun being their parent at this stage of their lives.Yes, instead of figuring out multiple carpools for them, chauffeuring non-stop amid juggling schedules, I am just enjoying the time I spend with them in adult conversation and activities. It's so much fun and it gives me opportunities to continue to relish this stage as much as I did previous stages of their lives. So that's my reason why I wouldn't want to go back to those innocent days of their youth. It was fun while it lasted, and what lies ahead will be just as enjoyable.Read my regular blog at www.arlenelassin.comEarlier on Huff/Post50:"

But Ted didn't have enough seniority to get such plum assignments.""I liked getting soda. It sold pretty well,"" Ted recalled. ""Some people complained about the weight, but I was 19 so I thought it was pretty easy to haul the soda around.""Ted and I also debated some vital Cracker Jack issues: ideal popcorn-to-peanut ratio, clustering, and, of course, which prize is the best.""No matter how many peanuts are in here, there are not enough peanuts in here,"" Ted said. ""It's all popcorn.""I argued that Cracker Jack used to have more peanuts, but Ted had a more philosophical point of view.""You may be right, but I also would be concerned that that's maybe a little bit of us getting older and the world getting a little sadder,"" he said. ""We notice fewer peanuts.""Turns out, Ted may be right.We reached out to Frito Lay, who bought Cracker Jack in 1997. They couldn't comment on changes to the recipe before then, but they did say that there has been no reduction in the peanut-to-popcorn ratio since they took over. In fact, they said they added more peanuts a few years ago.Maybe we are just getting a little older and sadder.Subscribe to The Sporkful podcast through iTunes/Podcasts app or wherever you get your podcasts."

32,RELIGION,"""Zig Zag Zen: Buddhism and Psychedelics"" edited by Allan Badiner: Book Review","Ira Israel, ContributorAuthor & Psychotherapist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/zig-zag-zen-buddhism-and-_b_7252328.html,"Allan Badiner wanted to know what happened to the research with psychedelics by bright, spiritually-minded people so he decided to ask a wide spectrum of seekers what their experiences exploring the relationship between Buddhism and psychedelics was.",2015-05-15,2015-05-10-1431282052-4419957-3bfoldoutbacksideMoriBurningDesire.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-10-1431282052-4419957-3bfoldoutbacksideMoriBurningDesire-thumb.jpg,"""Buddhism and psychedelics are together probably the best hope we have for an antidote to egotism and materialism, which are fatally destroying the planet."" ~ Terrence McKenna""While a sportsman will have his Olympic medals revoked for using drugs that enhance his performance, a musician would not be stripped of her Grammy awards if it turned out that her songs were composed and played under the influence of an illegal substance."" ~ Stephen BatchelorI found ""Zig Zag Zen: Buddhism and Psychedelics"" to be one of the most fascinating books I have ever read. I was born in 1966, the year that LSD was made illegal and all of the experiments at Harvard Divinity School and in the psychology department at Harvard went underground. One must take into account that the professors leading these experiments at Harvard - such as Timothy Leary, Richard Alpert (later known as Ram Dass), David McClelland, Frank Barron, Ralph Metzer - as well as many other people experimenting with these drugs such as Aldous Huxley and Alan Watts - were exceptionally bright, well-educated people who had the intention of exploring human consciousness. By the time I was a teenager in the 1980s, drugs were mostly used for recreational distractions.Allan Badiner wanted to know what happened to the research with psychedelics by bright, spiritually-minded people so he decided to ask a wide spectrum of seekers what their experiences exploring the relationship between Buddhism and psychedelics was. Firstly, as all Buddhists will tell you, the Buddha was very specifically against intoxicants (although Robert Thurman says that in the original Pali language, the 5th precept clearly refers to alcohol). So most of the writers and interviewees in ""Zig Zag Zen"" have to weigh in on whether psychedelics constitute intoxicants or not. Some argue that they are intoxicants, some argue that they aren't intoxicants, some argue that they are intoxicants but get a pass, and some argue that they aren't intoxicants but still should be avoided.What Mister Badiner has assembled is a captivating array of diverse perspectives and personal experiences wherein many gifted writers and thinkers try to use language to convey the ineffable. In addition, Alex Grey, who is widely regarded as the leading progenitor of the increasingly popular 'visionary art' movement, is the art editor of ""Zig Zag Zen"" and has compiled a lush and visually stunning assortment of artworks that bring the discussion to life in a visceral and concrete manner.A few of the viewpoints represented in the book are as follows:Ralph Metzer asserts that, ""From my fifty years of exploration and research on consciousness expanding substances and methods, my conviction has grown that the two most beneficent potential areas of application of psychedelic technologies are in the treatment of addictions and the psycho-spiritual preparation for the final transition."" Brad Warner believes that Buddhism and psychedelics are two ways up the same mountain: ""A guy in a helicopter gets the same breathtaking view as someone who has climbed the mountain, but he gets there more quickly and more easily."" However, Brad feels the seeker taking the fast and easy route may miss some lessons and joys along the way.Jack Kornfield says, ""I see psychedelics as one of the most promising areas of modern consciousness research.""Michele McDonald claims to have had ""some very deep experiences, even spiritual experiences on drugs"" yet does not recommend them.Allan agrees with Robert Thurman who, speaking to a crowd at Burning Man, explained, ""at a time of global crisis on so many levels, the careful use of entheogens to accelerate our capacity for empathy and compassion may be a skillful means, and compatible with the practice of Dharma.""""Zig Zag Zen: Buddhism and Psychedelics"" is a fun, historical exploration of the divergent viewpoints and experiences of many extremely bright people who - like the Buddha - carry the intention of exploring human consciousness with the goal of allaying suffering. As Robert Thurman observed, ""Zig Zag Zen is a must read for anyone who is concerned about the future of Buddhist practice."" "

Tim Williamson, CEO of the Idea Village (an organization that has supported entrepreneurship in New Orleans for fifteen years), talked about how New Orleans has a community calendar of rhythms and rituals: Mardi Gras, Jazz Fest, the Saints. The Idea Village helped found New Orleans Entrepreneurship Week seven years ago, and since Hurricane Katrina, entrepreneurship has been a fourth ritual.  On Friday, we had the first pitch fest we've ever seen on a Mardi Gras float, where Steve Case was crowned the King of the Krewe De Nieux (the entrepreneur's Krewe) and watched pitches while flinging beads over the side. (A ""Krewe"" is a New Orleans Mardi Gras group that hosts a parade.)  All the entrepreneurs we met in New Orleans talked about a dual mission--to build a great business, and to build an entrepreneurial community and they shared anecdotes about the extensive hours they put into recruiting, supporting, and mentoring peers who were building businesses. ""We aren't fighting each other for talent--we're fighting for success as a community"" said one entrepreneur. ""New Orleans is a great place to be an entrepreneur because we decided it would be,"" said another.  For the Rest to Rise, entrepreneurs have to go together.  Inclusion""If you're not a diverse team, you're not going to have the skill sets to succeed.""After opening the day with a community breakfast at Commander's Palace (an honored occasion, as any New Orleanian knows!), we had one of the best conversations of the week with Jean Case and community leaders around inclusive entrepreneurship.  The inclusive entrepreneurship conversation felt like an exclamation point towards a week-long theme: If the rest is truly going to rise, and if the US is going to remain the most entrepreneurial nation in the world, we have to level the playing field.  Although there are issues related to inclusion everywhere, in New Orleans, there's an element of community that made it more collaborative than most places. Women are 47% of the tech talent in New Orleans, and the pay gap between women and men is 4%. You can't find those numbers in Silicon Valley.  But you also can't expect everyone to rise overnight. You have to invest in the pipeline as well as the results. The winner of the $100,000 prize in New Orleans was Crystal McDonald, an African-American woman who founded GoToInterview. Upon winning, Crystal, on stage and through tears, gave credit to PowerMovesNOLA for getting her business to a place where it was ready for prime time.   This was the second straight day that we saw entrepreneurs, whom Steve Case calls the ""seed corn of the new economy,"" begin to blossom in new places. An African-American woman, Jewel Burke, won the $100,000 investment in Atlanta and similarly credited the Opportunity Hub (from a previous post) in backing her as a founder of color.  When investors complain about lack of inclusion, they say it's a pipeline problem. New Orleans--and the entire tour--showed us that when you invest in the pipeline, you get results that work better for everybody.  PerseveranceAs Steve Case always tells entrepreneurs, ""choose battles worth fighting.""The final theme we saw in New Orleans--and throughout the tour--is entrepreneurs in Rise of the Rest communities are disproportionately working on businesses that build on their community's assets and unique experience to solve major problems--rather than apps that make the lives of the well-off slightly more convenient and interesting. The ability to improve the things that touch people's lives every day--food, education, energy, health--is an opportunity the Rise of the Rest is poised to take advantage of.  As one example, New Orleans has a fast-growing education technology startup community primarily as a response to a horrific disaster. After Hurricane Katrina, the old school system was, in some cases, literally washed away, and New Orleans became the first school system to be 100% charter in the country. For entrepreneurs, this means tremendous opportunity. Where most public schools have long sales cycles and difficult-to-understand purchasing decisions, New Orleans' schools have flexible technology budgets and autonomy for principals that gives wonderful flexibility to education entrepreneurs. We at Village Capital saw this in Kickboard for Teachers--my firm Village Capital's first investment--founded by CEO Jen Medbery, who developed a better way to manage data while working at a charter school.  As we wrap up the final pitches in New Orleans, and cool down the bus, I've never been more sure that the rest will rise. We saw wonderful entrepreneurs this week--and we're only getting started.  Thanks to Jen Medbery, founder of Kickboard for Teachers; Kirk Coco, CEO of NOLA Brewing; Patrick Comer, CEO of Federated Sample; Robbie Vitrano, CEO of Naked Pizza; Earl Robinson, President of PowerMoves.NOLA; and Beth Galante from PosiGen Solar for many of the insights reflected in this piece.Note: This post was cross-posted from Southern/alpha, which is the premier publication covering startups, entrepreneurship and innovation in the South with a focus on high-growth companies and the founders, engineers, investors, team and culture around them.

In order to be one of those people, you had to be among the relatively more affluent elite as tickets were priced from a maximum of $500 to a minimum of $40. And nowhere did anyone see the often used Buddhist / New Age slogan ""no one will be turned away due to lack of funds,"" which assures that teachings are available to everyone.We know that the Buddha never charged for his teachings, and I have no doubt that the HH the Karmapa and Nalandabodhi's Spiritual Leader Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche had nothing to do with what Nalandabodhi management decided to do with their leg of the Karmapa's two-month American tour. In many of his presentations, tickets were given away free of charge, but in Seattle the 1,500 seats were quite pricy with the ""cheap"" $40 seats selling out in the first day of sale.  I strongly believe that anyone who wants to get into such a spiritual teaching should be allowed to participate unless the event is sold out, and this event was far from sold out. I estimate that there were at least 300 - 500 empty seats at the Seattle Center Exhibition Hall, which is designed to be an exhibition area and not a place for large performances or lectures as happened with the Karmapa.Not that all those seats had a good view of the stage. The flat rather than banked layout of the site as well as the enormous columns that blocked the view for many people left some participants wondering why they paid to be in the room rather than watching a livestream at home. Granted, Nalandabodhi management did provide several large screen monitors so that the majority of the audience could see because so many were too far away to see or simply sitting behind the columns.Still, had the Nalandabodhi management been concerned enough to inform participants about the seating issues beforehand, people could have watched the same thing they saw on the big screens from the comfort of their homes at no charge (thanks to the Karmapa's office which live streamed the event and many of his other teachings at no charge, which is how dharma is supposed to be shared). Of course, if everyone had done that Nalandabodhi would not have made money.Which reminds me of what my teacher and mentor Buckminster Fuller often told audiences about making money. Bucky said, ""You can make money or you can make sense because the two are mutually exclusive.""Nalandabodhi management and its sister organization Nitartha Institute for Higher Buddhist Studies (where Nalandabodhi teachers recommend people for advanced studies) have always done their best to make as much money as possible, often pricing their events out of the range of ordinary working people, and this Karmapa tour stop was no exceptions. At least a couple hundred volunteers put in numerous hours preparing and producing the event and for their efforts Nalandabodhi management gave them - the chance to purchase tickets to the event at full price a day before the general public. That's right, they didn't even provide seats for their own volunteers, and the least expensive ticket was $40 plus fees and taxes. Then, there is the fact that there were no discounts for students or seniors or monastics. Buddhist Nuns and Monks had to pay full price just like anyone else.When I attended HH the Dalai Lama's teachings in Vancouver last October, Nuns and Monks were provided with great seats at no charge and also given lunch between sessions. In fact, at that event and most others where HH the Dalai Lama teaches, many Buddhist Nuns and Monks sit on stage with the Dalai Lama, but there was no such honoring their service at the Nalandabodhi event.In addition to the 1,200 people paying between $40 and $500 for a ticket (do the math to figure out how much they took in for this one event), Nalandabodhi also requested that members donate money to support this visit. Their plea read, You are here with us and we wish to give you the opportunity through this fundraiser to offer your personal gift of support for His Holiness' visit in Seattle. Your gift will help with all aspects of his visit such as nourishment, flowers and physical gifts of value to His Holiness, and the 8-10 people traveling with him, while he is in Seattle. We know that almost all the services listed here were ""staffed"" by volunteers. The cooking was done by volunteers, the transporting of people was done by volunteers, the flowers were done by volunteers, the laundry and cleaning were done by volunteers, etc., etc. So, where did all that money go? More important, did the Nalandabodhi management make money or make sense?I'm not saying that HH the Karmapa or Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche had any intention to keep poor people from attending or use this occasion to make as much money as possible. In fact, I doubt that either of them had any knowledge of what the Nalandabodhi management has done.One only need to compare the Nalandabodhi way to what will be happening in a couple weeks when Mata Amritanandamayi (a.k.a. Amma) begins her North American Tour here in the Seattle area. Amma's people take donations at all her public events, and that money is transparently used for the enormous amount of charity she provides to the poor. However, all Amma's events and teachings are provided free of charge to everyone.Amma's people have to rent space, feed people, transport people, etc. just like Nalandabodhi, but they manage to do so without $500 tickets or pleas for financial contributions from members. They make sense, and people contribute generously to their work. Not so much with Nalandabodhi, which is known to produce very expensive Buddhist teaching programs and to constantly demand more and more from their members. Perhaps its time for the same sense of oneness and giving found in the Amma community to be manifest at the Nalandabodhi sangha. Then, the Buddha's teaching would truly be available to all people who come to Nalandabodhi and Nitartha Institute for Higher Buddhist Studies.May all people be fully welcomed into all spiritual teachings and groups in order to support their full awakening.Update: In the interest of full disclosure, I, Steven Sieden, submit the following:I have been a meditator since 1975 and a practicing Buddhist since 2002. I was a member of the Nalandabodhi Sangha. Nalandabodhi's Spiritual Leader, Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche accepted me as a formal student / spiritual friend in 2008, and I remain student of and spiritual friend to Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche.I have never been paid for any contributions to the Nalandabodhi Sangha, and over the years, I have contributed hundreds if not thousands of hours of volunteer time to the Nalandabodhi Sangha. Because of my 40 years experience as a professional event producer, in 2008 I was asked by the management of Nalandabodhi to submit a proposal for production of their scheduled 2009 Pema Chodron event. I created an extensive document (at no charge), and that proposal was summarily rejected (see comment below for details).I was a volunteer on the team doing Ikebana flowers for the HH Karmapa event described in this post. As a volunteer I followed instructions and purchased a $40 ticket to the event a day before sales were open to the general public. That seat ended up being way in the rear and directly behind an enormous column with no view of the stage, but I was never informed that it was an obstructed view.It was not until a few days before the event that I was told that 75 event seats might be available for volunteers. I did not take advantage of that possibility and entered with my $40 ticket. When the event was over, I worked with the Ikebana flower team to take down and remove the floral displays."

No, he did not. Or Fitzgerald, or Wolfe. This is a difficult concept to grasp. Hemingway didn't know he was Ernest Hemingway when he was a young man. Faulkner didn't know he was William Faulkner. But they had to take the first step. They had to call themselves writers. That is the first revolutionary act a writer has to make. It takes courage. But it's necessary.""Day 3 of the Rise of the Rest tour (and day 4 of reporting on it) took us to Charleston. As Steve Case said today, when planning the tour, Charleston was a bit of a dark horse. It's the smallest of the cities we've visited--with the youngest ecosystem--but with intriguing potential.Today, Charleston delivered. Repeatedly, we have seen cities across the country with less-obvious entrepreneurial resources succeed build on their assets--rather than try and re-create what other people have.We have seen this across the country. Louisville has a phenomenal emerging ecosystem around agriculture, led by Mayor Greg Fischer, who always says ""we don't want to be Silicon Valley, but we do want to be the best place in the country for food and agriculture.""Albuquerque has a wonderful emerging ecosystem around water technology, spurred on by a confluence of one of the world's largest deposits of brackish water; best-in-class research labs at Los Alamos and Sandia; a perpetual struggle with drought; and a forward-thinking mayor, Richard Berry, who has organized the metro area around solving problems in water.And today in Charleston, we saw a city that is building relentlessly upon its best aspects. People around the world know Charleston for great food, weather, and hospitality, and the business world knows it for its port and logistics expertise. Even the city's self-tagged startup nickname, ""Silicon Harbor,"" outlines its key assets.Although many people suggest that perhaps Charleston is too early along to be a great ecosystem, the community can create its own success--if it chooses. At a breakfast with civic leaders, Steve encouraged the Charleston community to create its own success, saying, ""It's a civic duty to invest in startups in your community. Half of the Fortune 500 companies turn over every 25 years, and the startups you invest in now are the great businesses of the future. Investing in startups now is planting seeds for prosperity in the next generation.""Throughout the day, we saw what those seeds looked like--building on Charleston's greatest assets. Rewined, a fast-growing candle-making company that repurposes old wine bottles into beautiful home decorations, while creating 70 quality-paying jobs, many manufacturing, in a transitioning neighborhood of Charleston, draws on two great assets of the region--people like to drink wine bottles until they are empty, and like to create and buy beautiful things. BlokRok is a sun lotion applicator whose founder, Arianna Megaro, knows that beaches, golf courses, and bright days are something Charleston owns.Another asset Charleston has is a community where people want to live. We toured Levelwing, a decade-old, very successful and profitable digital marketing firm whose founder, Steve Parker, moved the company from New York to Charleston because he said employee retention and happiness in Charleston was, comparatively, through the roof--people want to stay at Levelwing because they both loved the lifestyle and the professional opportunity.Finally, we saw in the startups pitching for $100,000 investment from Steve Case a real assertion of the region's strengths. One company helps fishermen book guides and spots on demand--a $38 billion market that folks in South Carolina understand, I'm sure, much better than folks in Silicon Valley. Another startup was a gourmet burger distributor that was building on top of Charleston's reputation as the highest concentration of award-winning restaurants per capita. And the pitch happened on the USS Yorktown, on the Charleston Harbor--an un-matchable backdrop for entrepreneurs.And the winner of the $100,000, Bidr, is more evidence of the observation we saw in Richmond with the spin-offs of CapitalOne--that successful enterprises have children and grandchildren. The software company Blackbaud, a startup 25 years ago that is now one of the region's largest employers, spawned two team members who launched Bidr as an innovative way that nonprofits can better fundraise through events. Seeing successful growing businesses help the entrepreneurs of the future is another way that startups pay it forward.So while Charleston may be small, we saw reasons all day long to believe that it has the potential to be a great ecosystem. And on the Rise of the Rest Tour, we are looking for reasons to believe in the future, rather than to criticize the present. In response to business leaders saying ""What can we do?"" Stev said: ""to promote entrepreneurship,"" Steve said, ""suspend your disbelief a little bit. When talking to startups, don't think about why they'll fail; think about why they'll succeed.""We are now on the bus somewhere outside of Madison, Georgia, and while we had a wonderful day, we are now on to my hometown of Atlanta. While we'll be back to Charleston, entrepreneurial ecosystems take daily attention, and the future of Charleston entrepreneurs are in the hands of the wonderful leaders we met throughout a terrific day on the tour. I hope that the Charleston ecosystem, when thinking of the Rise of the Rest tour, takes the thoughts of native son Pat Conroy to heart: ""Once you have traveled, the voyage never ends, but is played out over and over again in the quietest chambers. The mind can never break off from the journey.""Note: This post was cross-posted from Southern/alpha, which is the premier publication covering startups, entrepreneurship and innovation in the South with a focus on high-growth companies and the founders, engineers, investors, team and culture around them.
