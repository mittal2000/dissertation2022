The journalists were directed to sit in a small corner of an upper gallery instead.According to the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the decision to boot reporters from the floor was made by Virginia Senate Majority Leader Thomas Norment Jr. (R-James City), and was part of the changes to the Senate rules approved on Wednesday.When asked about the change, Norment told reporters: “There’s no comment necessary for it.”According to the Times-Dispatch, the change “effectively revokes media privileges from the floor of the Senate when it is in session.”“Historically, the vantage point [in the chamber] has provided an opportunity for reporters to directly observe proceedings on ground level, review floor amendments, obtain copies of votes and observe interaction among lawmakers in real time,” the newspaper wrote. “Instead, a tight space in the far corner of the upstairs balcony with limited sight lines of the chamber was cordoned off for media, offering no writing space and minimal access to electrical outlets for their laptops.”Speaking on the floor Wednesday, Sen. Ryan McDougle (R-Hanover County) said the rule change had been enacted “to allow more space for lawmakers and pages, the teenage assistants who serve food to senators and run errands for them.”When pressed for more details later, however, McDougle told reporters to “ask Sen. Norment.”State Democrats and journalists have both raised their voices in alarm about the change.“We need more transparency in the General Assembly, not less,” Lt. Gov. Ralph S. Northam, a Democrat who presides over the state Senate, said in a statement. “The media plays a very important role here at the Capitol as we conduct the people’s business. Removing members of the press from the floor only makes their jobs more difficult and, in the end, is a disservice to Virginians.”Reporters are still allowed on the floor of the Virginia House of Delegates, per the Virginian-Pilot. In fact, Speaker of the House William J. Howell (R-Stafford) recently announced actions to make House procedures more transparent, not less. In 2015, the Center for Public Integrity gave Virginia an overall grade of “D” in its state integrity report card. The state also earned an “F” in public access to information, and a “D” in both executive and legislative accountability. Earlier on HuffPost: "
1,POLITICS,"Republicans Expect To Pass All 12 Spending Bills, Don't Ask If Santa Claus Is Real",Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-appropriations-retreat_us_56981412e4b0ce496423df2e,"Don't harsh their buzz, man.",2016-01-14,"House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) presented a united front on Thursday, telling their members they were committed to passing all 12 appropriations bills.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/569825dc2a00002d000308f3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BALTIMORE -- House and Senate Republicans came here for their annual retreat to get on the same page, catch a few panel discussions and celebrate their collective commitment to passing all 12 appropriations bills.Just don't ask them how.""Don't ask questions like, 'Isn't Santa Claus too fat to fit through that flue?'"" one GOP member told The Huffington Post on background, in order to speak more freely about his colleagues burying their heads in the sand. ""Just acknowledge that there's a chimney and something could pass through it and presents do show up.""The member, who reported that he had ""high hopes and low expectations"" about Republican achievements in this election year, told HuffPost that just about everyone in the room for the GOP retreat was excited about passing spending bills through regular order -- an elusive legislative process that gives members greater authority to affect spending and policy decisions, but opens bills up to contentious votes.Indeed, Republican leader after Republican leader came before the press on Thursday to tout his or her allegiance to funding the government through appropriations bills instead of through a continuing resolution or omnibus bill.While Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) acknowledged that Republicans couldn't implement every idea they have with President Barack Obama in the White House, he said Republicans could take steps to advance their priorities.""One obvious step I would mention -- it is not going to titillate the public -- but one obvious step would be, for the first time since 1994, do all the appropriations bills,"" McConnell said. ""And the Democrats in the Senate, who blocked that possibility this year, are at least saying the right things, and we're going to give them an opportunity to step up and help us do that.""Senate Democrats blocked Republicans from moving on to appropriations bills last year because they disagreed with the overall spending level Republicans wanted to use. Now, with a budget agreement already in place that set this year's levels, Republicans think they've removed the highest hurdle to passing appropriations measures.In the words of Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.): ""Why would the Democrats filibuster something they agreed to?""Of course, there are a number of issues that could crop up during the appropriations process. House Republicans discontinued their appropriations process last July, when Democrats made it clear they would force a politically damaging vote on the Confederate flag. But that might have just been an excuse. In the words of the member who spoke to HuffPost on background, the House GOP explanation is a ""fairy tale.""""Anybody that thinks we stopped doing appropriations bills because of a Confederate flag vote is living in a fantasy world,"" he said.The truth of the matter may be that Republicans were about finished with the spending bills they wanted to get through the House chamber. For instance, leaders usually avoid the measure that funds the Department of Health and Human Services because bringing it to the floor could expose members to tough votes on abortion riders.In an election year with a condensed schedule so that members have plenty of time for campaigning, avoiding difficult votes is a common strategy.This makes the inherent tension between the House and Senate all the more visible. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has been emphatic with his Republican colleagues that he will appease members who desire votes on controversial ideas. McConnell wants to protect a vulnerable Senate majority, with 24 Republican seats -- versus only 10 Democratic seats -- going up for re-election in November. There are signs, however, that McConnell realizes he can't completely duck tough votes.“We weren’t sent here to do nothing,"" McConnell said Thursday, ""and we’re going to be looking for opportunities to make some progress for the American people this year.""The question is, how committed is McConnell to doing something? If Democrats stand in the way of getting appropriations bills done, that might be no skin off his back.It's just that most members don't see that calculus at this point.For now, they're satisfied with McConnell's tone, though some do recognize his hedging. ""What he said was, 'I'm committed to the 12 appropriations bills process -- which is different than saying he's going to get it done, without a doubt -- but it's very different than, 'I'm going to try my darndest,'"" Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) said Thursday.Still, most members are happy enough with that answer. They recognize that, without 60 votes in the Senate, Republicans are somewhat at the will of Democrats and the filibuster. And even if some Republicans are pushing for changes to the filibuster, many others recognize the utility of the legislative tool used to protect minority rights in the Senate.Even the member who spoke to HuffPost anonymously had some positive things to say, acknowledging that this retreat had a much different tone than the one that would have taken place if former Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) still had the gavel. ""Or even if John Boehner had retired this fall,"" the member said. ""This is the conference that is happening this way because John Boehner was essentially deposed.""While conservatives were generally happy to take what they could get from House and Senate leaders, the member warned that the mood of groups like the House Freedom Caucus was fickle, and conservatives could turn on Ryan quickly if they felt misled on how vigorously leadership tried to pass appropriations bills.""The question for the people that are happy right now, who are almost certainly going to be disappointed later, is 'What are you going to do about it when it doesn't happen?'"" the member said.And what's the answer?""I mean, it's pretty ..."" the member said before trailing off, seemingly to avoid expressing readiness for a potential coup. ""I don't even want to go there right now, but you can anticipate what I'm going to do if I'm lied to."" Laura Barron-Lopez contributed reporting."

Music blasts from a small set of speakers. Harsh shadows dance wildly beneath the orange hue of lampposts.On the roof of a nearly empty seven-story parking structure, two to three dozens of students dance.“This parking lot is this fun little escape from all our classes and work responsibilities,” says Michael Lim, the creative co-director of Break Through, a hip-hop dance crew at the University of Southern California. “It’s just this kind of way for us to get away for two and a half hours and practice and dance with each other and have fun.”Every Sunday and Wednesday night from 8:00 to 10:30 p.m., the team practices on the roof of a campus parking structure. Lim has been on the team for two and a half years. This is his first semester in a leadership role.“Since I joined the team, I’ve known Break Through to be this amazing family where dancers get together and share their passion with each other,” Lim says. Break Through started ten years ago and is traditionally a noncompetitive performance team. But this year, Lim wanted to make some changes. “So I thought, we’re a performance team, but it would be fun to share that passion that we have and do something with that in the community beyond USC’s campus borders.”In April, Lim contacted Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. He asked if there was a way the team could help the hospital.“Our relationship with Break Through began when one of the members reached out to us,” says Alexandra Field, the manager of the Expressive Arts and Therapies department at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. “Partnership formed and we decided that it would be great for them to come in and share their talents.”Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, or CHLA, is a nonprofit hospital that provides pediatric health care to about 107,000 children every year. Field works for in the Expressive Arts and Therapies department, which has been in existence for 24 years. Field says the department has changed significantly over time.“We have the whole umbrella of the arts and health care,” Field says. “One side of that is the therapy.” Field says art, music and dance movement therapy can be prescribed to the patients. “You can order it in the chart—a doctor, a nurse, a social worker—someone who sees that a patient needs extra support. We can be that creative type of support that can help alleviate anxiety, depression, increase positive compliance with their treatment—the list goes on.”In addition to therapy, the department engages with the community. “Through artists and different groups, they come in and volunteer and share their gifts in the arts,” Field says. “We’re really fortunate to have so many groups that volunteer their time.”One way the hospital collaborates with the community is through a small colorful room tucked away in the hospital. It’s called the Creative Oasis. Every Tuesday and Thursday from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m., the room opens to inpatients throughout the hospital.“The experience at the Children’s Hospital was definitely just a fun environment,” says Kenya Collins, who co-directs Break Through with Lim. On the day Collins went, she went with three other dancers from Break Through. There were also three other volunteers who regularly volunteer at Children’s Hospital.“We were able to make paper flowers and different families came in and kids came in and it was just an awesome environment to be able to be doing things for these kids that they wouldn’t regularly be able to do if they’re at a hospital,” she says. “We showed them a dance we had learned at Break Through and immediately all the children got up and started dancing and they kept saying, ‘Do it again! Do it again!’”“As far as Expressive Arts and Therapies, it’s fully funded through philanthropy and donations,” says Tim Houck, the Assistant Director of Development for the Children Hospital’s Foundation. “We’d love to raise some good funds to go back into our program for staff and activities and equipment.”In addition to volunteering, Lim and Collins are trying to raise funds for the hospital. Through a series of benefit workshops they’re calling “Hip Hop Heals,” they collaborated with local professional dancers to teach choreography at a dance studio. “These are open to everyone in the L.A. environment—all students and all dancers who want to come out and support the cause,” Collins says. “So it’s actually dual action. You’re dancing and learning, but you’re also supporting a greater community.”This year, the group has set out to reach a $2000 goal. They started a support page on the hospital’s website. Through word of email, social media blasts and word of mouth, they hope to hit that goal.The crew’s pinnacle event of the year is their bi-annual free showcase where 600 to 1,000 come to watch their performance. “We thought, why not do something with all of those eyes?” Lim says. He hopes to get the word out at the event and raise some funds through a raffle.“Finding this program was amazing because we can offer these kids this exact same experience that we have twice a week at dance practice to them twice a week at their little Creative Oasis,” Lim says. “I see us supporting the hospital for a bunch of semesters to come.

6,ENTERTAINMENT,Nick Hornby Is Celebrating His 'Brooklyn' Oscar Nomination But Mourning David Bowie's Death,Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nick-hornby-brooklyn-oscar-nomination_us_5697d826e4b0b4eb759d7b21,"This is Hornby's second nomination, following 2009's ""An Education.""",2016-01-14,"Saoirse Ronan and Domhnall Gleeson star in a scene from ""Brooklyn.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5697e6902a00002d00030818.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When North America awoke to a fresh set of Oscar nominations on Thursday morning, Nick Hornby was already midway through his day. The British novelist and screenwriter was reveling in his Oscar recognition from across the pond when The Huffington Post hopped on the phone to hear his reaction. Hornby's ""Brooklyn"" nod could be considered retribution for his ""Wild"" snub last year, were the movie not deserving in its own right. Even beyond that, Hornby had excellent cause to celebrate his Best Adapted Screenplay nomination, as ""Brooklyn"" also nabbed spots in the Best Picture and Best Actress derbies. We chatted with the High Fidelity and About a Boy scribe about how he'll spend the evening and what he makes of David Bowie's death.Hi, Nick! How are you this morning?Very well, thank you. It’s afternoon for me, so it’s much more civilized than it is for you. Congrats on being well past the morning-coffee phase of your day, and congrats on the nomination. Who have you gotten to talk to about it so far? So far, my 11-year-old.And what were his thoughts?Well, he’s not a big fan of awards season. He thinks there’s too much domestic disruption. Because I was involved with “Wild” last year and “An Education” before that, and his mom got a nomination today because she produced the film, basically he’s been very gracious and has pretended to be pleased. But I’m not sure he’s really that keen.Will you bring him along to the Oscars?[Laughs] I don’t know, he’s in school and in this country it’s illegal to take the kids out of school, but maybe we’ll risk it.If not you, who in your category should win this award? It's a good group of movies -- ""The Big Short,"" ""Carol,"" ""The Martian,"" ""Room"" and ""Brooklyn.""I think this is a very strong year. I think Emma Donoghue has done an incredible job with her own book, Room. I can’t adapt my own books. You can’t?No, it’s the idea of sticking with the same story for the two years it takes you to write the novel, or however long it took her, and then four or five years of development for the movie. You know what? When I’m finished with the book, I’m done. So I think what she did to find the movie in her own novel and not lose patience with it and stay hungry for it is incredible.Now that “Brooklyn” is in your rearview mirror and you have an Oscar nomination to boot, what do you see as the chief difference in adapting “Brooklyn” compared to “Wild” and “An Education”? They were three very different projects. “An Education” was a tiny essay -- it was like six pages, so it was a mix of adaptation and original. I had to come up with characters and relationships that weren’t in the original piece. Cheryl Strayed’s book is so stuffed with incident, and it’s kind of loud and funny and tragic, and it deals with sex and drugs and so on. That was really a matter of pruning away to find the story we could use in the movie. Brooklyn is this short, tender novel, and it really felt like working on a ship in a bottle. It was very, very fine work, compared to the violent wrestling I had to do with “Wild” and the imagination I had to use with “An Education.” I loved doing all three, and they all felt really different. By nature of its story, “Brooklyn” is your most graceful script. As a coming-of-age tale, it sails along very smoothly. How much attention did you pay to pacing while writing the script, knowing that film is proverbially thought of as a director’s medium? John Crowley is a writer’s director. He comes from theater and he regarded the script as the text, so we worked on it together. Once we’d arrived at the draft that he was happy with, that’s what was made. We were both conscious of the pacing. It had the potential to be so quiet that nobody would watch it, or nobody would be able to hear it. I think that our job was to turn the volume up a little bit. The book is so beautiful, but it does a different thing. It’s very watchable, the book. If you’re going to put that girl right in the middle of the screen for 100 minutes, you have to get in closer to make people properly feel. That, I think, was the job that we had to do: just make it loud enough that people would hear it.Is there a book out there you’d love to get your hands on for an adaptation?Oh, so many. And they’re all about as difficult as all the others. The kinds of books that I tend to be drawn to, I can see financiers thinking, “Oh, my God, what are we supposed to do with this?’Did you think “Brooklyn” would go the same way?Oh, it was utter misery for the producers. I was done long before I read “Wild,” in fact, pretty much. My wife and her producing partner, Finola Dwyer, had a really, really tough job persuading people that anyone would go and see this movie. In fact, I think that when I started writing the movie Saoirse was 15. So people keep asking me if I had her in mind, but how could I have her in mind? I’m like, “How can I have her in mind? She was in her mid-teens!”High Fidelity is an ode to rock music, so I imagine David Bowie must have had an influence on you and your entire generation. What was your reaction to his death?Well, I think what’s really shocking, for my generation, about Bowie’s death is he’s probably the biggest death for us since John Lennon and Marvin Gaye. But even those two belong to slightly different generations for me. David Bowie was somebody who I loved when I was 14, when his career was just starting. We followed him every step of the way, and I think you can feel a lot of our own mortality in the shock of his death. We thought this generation was somehow immortal.Nobody ever imagined a world without David Bowie somewhere in it. No, and his generation of stars, as well. They’ve managed to age in a way that seems vital. He carried on doing amazing work. It wasn’t like people were being nostalgic about the old days with him. It was, “Which period of Bowie do you like?” And he’s just made a new album that’s clearly interesting and experimental and connecting with people, and also his death clearly was factored in to some of the work around this album, which is extraordinary. It’s just been really shocking, I think. But it shouldn’t be shocking. Let’s face it: It was a guy who was nearly 70, and he died too soon, but he died roughly at an appropriate age -- threescore years and 10, and all that. So in that way, it’s even more stark than somebody who was shot or who died of a drug overdose.Let me let you go on a positive note: Do you have celebratory plans? How will you spend the rest of your Oscar-nomination afternoon and evening? It’s more domestic than I want it to be, with kids running all over the house. Rather nicely, a good friend has a book being published tonight, so I’m going to her publication party. Her publishers will be paying for my celebratory drinks.Excellent, you can show up and steal her thunder. Exactly.Also on HuffPost:"

Sotomayor asked at one point, citing the island's local designation, which means a thousand things to Puerto Ricans. Landau responded with a softball: ""It means free associated state, literally,"" and declined to offer more substance. Sotomayor reminded Landau that Congress' arrangement with Puerto Rico never used the term, and with good reason: Congress knew that ""states have a different meaning in the United States.""But perhaps the greater revelation came when Nicole Saharsky, the federal government's lawyer, rose to the podium. Asked by Breyer whether ""Congress can take back what they gave"" Puerto Rico in the 1950s, when Congress approved the island's constitution, she was unequivocal.""Could Congress revise the arrangements it has with Puerto Rico?"" Saharsky said. ""And we think the answer is yes, and that that follows from the structure of the Constitution and its history.""That's unlikely to happen any time soon.

Lindsey Graham, who participated in the last GOP debate, dropped out last month. And Carly Fiorina and Rand Paul failed to clear the moderator’s polling qualifications, and have been relegated to an earlier, smaller debate with Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum. Paul, however, is boycotting the event. The Kentucky Republican objects to Fox Business’ entrance criteria, which relied on national polls, that he says unfairly counted him out of the main debate. Indeed, it appears he's making a fair argument. The senator told CNN earlier this week that he will not “participate in anything that's not first tier because we have a first tier campaign,” and will rather be holding events in other early nominating states.Unlike the previous Fox Business debate in November, where both candidates and moderators struck a decidedly civil tone, the gathering on Thursday evening is likely be more of a raucous affair. With what appears to be a toss-up in polling between Trump and Cruz in Iowa, and a bare-knuckle brawl for the establishment lane between multiple candidates in New Hampshire, campaigns will be under significantly more pressure to land solid hits against their rivals for the GOP nomination.Already, the crowded race has turned into a wild free-for-all. Candidates and their super PACs have shifted resources from mostly positive, biographical introductions in favor of negative attacks and advertisements on everything from flip-flops to each other’s fashion choices.One of the bitterest rivalries, between friends Rubio and Bush, centers on Rubio’s shifting stance on immigration, as well as his choice of footwear -- a pair of higher heeled boots he was spotted wearing on the campaign trail. Bush subtly drew a contrast with his former mentee earlier this week, stating that he didn’t “have a height issue."" The boots may not become more than a punchline in Charleston -- but immigration is sure to elicit some fiery exchanges. A recent super PAC ad backing Bush accused Rubio of flip-flopping on immigration, comparing the senator to a weathervane.Another likely flashpoint Thursday night will almost certainly be Cruz’s eligibility to run for president, an issue that has put the Texas senator on the defense amid a barrage of attacks from Trump. Cruz, a U.S. citizen under the Constitution's “natural-born” clause, was born in Canada. The issue has never been settled in the courts, however, creating an opening for Trump and other Republicans who continue to troll Cruz over his eligibility for the presidency. The real estate mogul, who continues to lead in the polls, has said he won’t bring up the issue Thursday night -- but that doesn’t mean others won’t. If Cruz can ably respond to the matter, as well answer questions over a late-breaking New York Times story about a major loan he failed to disclose, he’ll be well-positioned to take the Iowa caucuses.Chris Christie is another candidate to watch during the debate. The New Jersey governor has shifted positions on numerous issues over the course of the campaign, a move fact-checkers and his rivals have sought to highlight as he continues to gain traction in New Hampshire. As an elected official in a blue state, Christie once held moderate to liberal positions on guns and abortion. He similarly once backed a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and the Common Core education standards, but later backtracked on both. Most recently, Christie’s support for the National Rifle Association has come into question -- a line of attack his rivals may pursue on Thursday.Finally, as in every previous debate, front-runner Donald Trump will be center stage. Most of his opponents have up to this point been loath to attack the businessman for fear of alienating his army of supporters. That, however, will likely change Thursday night. Cruz, for example, has recently begun to target the real estate mogul for holding what he calls “New York values.”Also on HuffPost:"

11,ARTS & CULTURE,Can Reality Be Spoiled?,Claire Fallon,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/can-reality-be-spoiled_us_5697f745e4b0b4eb759dac7a,We expect every story to surprise us. Even reality television.,2016-01-14,Will these two slippery love-fish wind up together? You could find out right now... but why bother?,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5698131d1a00002d00ab098f.jpeg?cache=ETU9a0oVEv&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last Monday, the 20th season of ""The Bachelor"" premiered on ABC, and I'm looking forward to live-tweeting every moment, as I have during past seasons.This season documents boyish Ben Higgins’ quest for a suitably sweet young thing to make his Denver bride. He’s already found -- or failed to find -- said sweet young thing, and if he succeeded, he already proposed to her. Taping wrapped up weeks ago, before the show even started airing. And somewhere out there are plenty of people who could tell me who won Ben’s hand, in addition to a gem-studded Neil Lane monstrosity presumably designed to strengthen her left ring finger muscles.I know that. I know that specifically I could check the blog of Reality Steve, a long-time spoiler specialist who has a pretty good track record at publishing the endings of ""Bachelor"" franchise shows well in advance. Reality Steve, whose real name is Steve Carbone, fills a vital niche for the industry, though ABC doesn't care for him. People who have information about who's won know exactly where to send it, and people who want information about who's won know exactly where to find it. Perhaps more importantly, we know exactly what sites to avoid if we don't want it. I'm a media professional, and I can't exactly avoid every entertainment blog out there during each ""Bachelor"" season, especially as that would be roughly all of the time. (It feels like those shows never stop.) And reporters and bloggers know full well that most readers either a) care approximately zero percent about who won ""The Bachelor, or b) do not want to find out because they enjoy watching the show in suspense.Reality Steve funnels all of those spoiler-y urges into one convenient place, allowing other media outlets to punt on publishing spoilers and readers to make the choice whether they see the results early or not. It's a public service, really. No one feels that way more than Carbone himself, as became clear from the three major interviews with him that dropped last week, to coincide with the show's season premiere. ""I feel sort of an obligation that this is what I need to do because nobody out there on the Internet is doing it,"" he told Jezebel's Kate Dries. ""I don’t have any competition out there for spoilers because the major entertainment sites ... they’re all in bed with ABC. So the second they start spoiling as a headline ... they’ll be cut off from everything.""Carbone went on to explain that he realizes not everyone reads ""Bachelor"" spoilers -- because we don't know about them. ""I understand ... there are still way more people out there that don’t know of me and of spoilers than do in terms of the viewing audience of the show,"" he conceded. Dries noted in the interview that she does read spoilers to inform her writing on the show -- but oddly, Jezebel is not in the habit of publishing them. The Gawker Media sites, of which Jezebel is one, are known for being scrappy, uncourteous toward the powerful, not into playing nice for access, and, in fact, ABC doesn't exactly bring exclusives about ""The Bachelor"" stars to the women's blog.So why isn't Jezebel, and other such independent entertainment sites, publishing spoilers? I'd venture to guess that it's because their readers don't want to know them, even if they could. I asked one ""Bachelor"" fan named Ainsley Burton whether she worries about members of her two ""Bachelor"" fantasy leagues cheating with spoilers, and she barely gave it a thought -- fans, she pointed out, joined the leagues for the same reason they didn't check spoilers: to enjoy the show more. Carbone's conception of ""The Bachelor"" -- which he says he wouldn't even watch were it not his job -- seems to be that it's basically a vast conspiracy perpetuated by ABC on an audience who doesn't even realize we could find out ahead of time who won. All those viewers choosing to enjoy the competition to the fullest, are dupes, not active consumers. Meanwhile, the rest of the media, held hostage by the network's threats, can only dream of publishing spoilers in his carefree way.This might be the only context in which spoilers are so valorized.In fact, increasingly we live in a spoiler-phobic world. Spoiler alerts litter our conversation, our Twitter feeds, our reviews and news articles. We can spoil movies that came out 10 years ago, or TV episodes that aired last week. With the rise of DVRs and streaming services, as Buzzfeed’s Ariane Lange argued last year, it's never been easier for people to simply watch shows and movies on their own schedule. The day after the ""Breaking Bad"" finale airs isn't a safe time to publicly announce what happened anymore. Perhaps we're even overdoing it. While certain art forms -- competition, mystery, suspense -- thrive on the audience's lack of knowledge, many don't require it. There was a time when few stories contained surprises, when retellings of familiar stories were enjoyed for their narrative magic, artistic expression, and psychological complexity. Most of Shakespeare's plays weren't new to his fans; he pulled his stories from history, folklore, and preexisting tales.Now, we spring to hiss, ""Shhh, spoilers!!"", even when an episode of ""Empire"" would still be inherently gripping without a suspense element. We expect every story to surprise us.When the hit docuseries ""Making a Murderer"" dropped on Netflix last month, some critics urged people to experience its immersive pull and tense pacing ""without spoilers,"" for the full effect. The ""spoilers,"" of course, would be news articles about the all-too-real, all-too-horrifying case at the heart of the documentary. The case isn't a mystery or a competition; it's a real situation profoundly affecting the lives of two traumatized families, the Halbachs and the Averys.Avoiding knowledge of the actual events in order to wholly enjoy watching a documentary about them -- there's no more solipsistic way to consume a work of true crime, an art form that many have worried is inherently ethically troubling. When it comes to real life, spoilers don't apply. To fixate on our desire for the stimulation of suspense and shock in such a case only commodifies a painful tragedy, as well as the broader questions about the justice system raised by Steven Avery's trial. Watching ""Making a Murderer"" informed might actually make for a more thoughtful and engaged viewing experience, rather than the kind of emotional, semi-informed experience that led fans to circulate petitions asking President Obama to pardon Avery (which is simply impossible). Still, when it comes to fluffy competitions and suspenseful fictions, it's hard to see the valor in ruining the enjoyment for the audience. Sure, you might say ""The Bachelor"" is real life ... but is it? Like, really? No one knows it's not real life better than those of us who watch it like a soap opera, well aware that these adult people chose to make their love life temporarily part of a competitive drama to entertain the masses. Spoilers? Why ruin my fun, for no other reason than to learn some information that is irrelevant outside the show, and which I'll learn anyway in just a month or two? If my ""Bachelor"" live-tweeting buddies have taught me anything, it's that you can be aware and critical of how problematic and staged the show is -- while still allowing yourself the pleasurable tension of some speculation.

12,POLITICS,Louisiana Just Expanded Medicaid. Now Obama Is Gunning For Other Holdouts.,Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obamacare-medicaid-expansion_us_5697aa52e4b0778f46f83972,"He's got a good idea, but it requires action from the Republican Congress.",2016-01-14,Obama is proposing a straightforward policy tweak that would help Obamacare -- which means the Republican Congress almost surely won't pass it.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5697ad042a00002c0003077e.jpeg?cache=xzeOSYQyWE&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Louisiana on Tuesday became the 31st state to embrace the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion. That's a big deal. The decision means 300,000 poor and working-class residents will soon have access to comprehensive, government-provided health insurance. Those who enroll will be better off, financially and perhaps medically, according to the best and most recent research.But more than 4 million low-income Americans just like them still can’t get onto Medicaid. That’s because officials in their states despise Obamacare and have refused to expand the program’s eligibility. In order to win over the holdouts, and get coverage to those remaining people, President Barack Obama now wants to tweak the way the federal government pays for its share of Medicaid. Under a proposal that the administration unveiled Thursday, states that come late to the Medicaid expansion, as Louisiana just did, would get the same sweet funding deal as states like Minnesota, Kentucky and Maryland that embraced the expansion initially.Obama can’t do this on his own, however. The small, straightforward adjustment would require an act of Congress. That makes the prospects of enactment extremely dim, because the Republican majorities in both chambers have shown little enthusiasm for modifying the president's health care law -- except in ways that would undermine it.  The proposal would affect the federal “matching” formula for states making their Medicaid programs available to anybody with an annual income of less than 133 percent of the poverty line. That works out to about $27,000 for a family of three and, for most states, represents a significant increase in eligibility from the standards before the Affordable Care Act took effect.In order to help states defray the expense of covering these additional people, the federal government absorbs the bulk of the costs. Up through 2016, it provides all of the funding to insure anybody getting Medicaid as a result of expanded criteria. Starting next year, the federal contribution will start to decline gradually, until settling permanently at 90 percent in 2020. The law’s architects had assumed all states would get the same deal, because all states would expand their Medicaid programs immediately and enjoy three years of full federal matching funds. But in 2012, the Supreme Court struck down part of the health care law affecting Medicaid, giving states much greater leeway to opt out of the expansion -- leeway that Republican officials in more than half the states used initially, and that a substantial portion still do.In order to persuade more of those officials, the administration would like to change the timetable for when the federal contribution declines from 100 to 90 percent. Under the proposal, states that expand eligibility would get three years of full federal matching funds, followed by the same four-year tapering to 90 percent, regardless of what year they joined the program.The change would not just apply to states that expand Medicaid in the future. It would also apply retroactively to states that already expanded, but did so after 2014. In other words, a state like Montana, whose Medicaid expansion began on Jan. 1, would get three years of full federal matching funds plus the four-year phasing down -- just like Florida or Georgia or Texas would when and if officials in those states decide to do the same thing.In a post on the White House blog early Thursday morning, budget director Shaun Donovan and Cecilia Muñoz, director of the Domestic Policy Council, called the proposal “further evidence of the Administration’s willingness to work with states to build on recent progress in improving health coverage and making Medicaid affordable to states and taxpayers alike.” “We hope Congress will act to provide this extra incentive to states that haven’t yet expanded, encouraging them not to miss out on the benefits other states are already enjoying,” they continued.While the appeal isn’t likely to resonate in this Congress, it might get more attention in the future -- particularly if more Republican state officials decide, as some already have, that the Medicaid expansion is a good deal for their constituents.Also on HuffPost: "
13,POLITICS,"Nebraska Mom Pens Worried Letter To Obama, Gets Visit From The Man Himself",Dominique Mosbergen,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nebraska-mom-lisa-martin-obama_us_56975eb6e4b0b4eb759d400e,Lisa Martin's letter expressed her fears for her newborn son.,2016-01-14,"President Obama visited Lisa Martin and her family in their Papillion, Nebraska home on Wednesday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/569762e41a00002d00ab0875.png?cache=x1oVtJWnJt&ops=crop_0_54_1440_638%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Almost a year ago, a Nebraska mom named Lisa Martin woke up in the middle of the night, her heart seized with anxiety. She thought about the troubles of the world and the scourge of climate change; and she worried to herself: “Will my son be able to thrive on this planet?”To assuage her panic, Martin sat down -- her newborn son Cooper by her side -- and wrote a long letter to the one person she felt might have some answers: President Barack Obama.“This morning at four A.M., I found myself feeling very distraught,” the mom wrote. “I began to think about how helpless our children are … and how much responsibility rests on our shoulders. I provide for my child every day through food, and shelter, but I am unable to guarantee he will have a real future on our planet.”Martin continued: “I am sure this email will never reach you, but in this moment, I decided reaching out to the one man that can do something would make me feel some sort of solace. Listening to my son breathing next to me gave me a feeling of urgency.”Obama, it turned out, did receive Martin’s email (which has been reproduced in full below); and on Wednesday, almost exactly a year after the mom penned her note, the president arrived at her doorstep.He came with a message: Don’t worry. Cooper will be all right.According to a White House press release, Obama visited Martin to “talk about what matters most to her: the world Cooper will inherit.”“The future is bright, [Obama] told her and by extension the country, but that requires the nation to follow his policy prescriptions,” per The New York Times.POTUS is said to have lingered at Martin’s home for almost 40 minutes, chatting with the mom and her husband, Jeff. Following the visit, Martin introduced Obama at the University of Nebraska, where the president addressed a crowd of thousands.“I want everybody to remember, America’s been through big changes before,” Obama told those gathered, per the Times. “And each time, we overcame our fears and we overcame our challenges. Each time, we made change work for us. And each time, we emerged stronger and better than we were before. That’s what we do as Americans.”Read Lisa Martin's entire letter, released by the White House, here: Dear Mr. President, Every night while I wake up to feed my newborn child, Cooper, I catch up on news and read current events. This morning at four A.M., I found myself feeling very distraught. I started reading countless articles about the environment and how your Administration is currently trying to conserve the Alaskan wilderness. While I am so thankful policies are being made for Alaska, I still have this sinking feeling of dread and sadness. Will my son be able to thrive on this planet? Will he be able to experience the small things, such as winter in Nebraska, where he has snowdays and sledding? Where he comes home to me cooking homemade hot cocoa for him, like I did?  Sadly I think the answer is no. I found myself coming to tears at this realization with his small body in my lap because I am the type of person that wants to make change happen, to control things and fix them immediately.  I began to think about how helpless our children are to all these issues and how much responsibility rests on our shoulders. I provide for my child every day through food, and shelter, but I am unable to guarantee he will have a real future on our planet. I am powerless to put any real change into action. I realized I am just a high school English teacher emailing the president at four in the morning.  I am sure this email will never reach you, but in this moment, I decided reaching out to the one man that can do something would make me feel some sort of solace. Listening to my son breathing next to me gave me a feeling of urgency.  So, what do I want? I guess I just want to know my son will not have to go to the zoo to see polar bears. I want him to know, like we know today, that they exist out there in the wild. I want him to breathe in the air and not be afraid of pollution. I want him to lay under the trees and for him to feel peace in the simplicity of that moment of breathing in the beauty of grandeur of nature. I want him to one day dream of his own children and for him to know that our generation protected his future through protecting the world we live in.  As I stated above, I am just a high school English teacher who has now become a mother so thank you for reading my early morning fears. I could write for hours about my feelings of dread, but hopefully this small excerpt of my fears will influence some of your thoughts and bring some type of larger change to Cooper's world."

News reports previously pegged the expected settlement at about $3 billion.The bank said it struck the deal to settle “actual and potential” civil claims over Goldman’s mortgage securitization activities from 2005 to 2007 by the Department of Justice; attorneys general in New York and Illinois; the National Credit Union Administration, a federal regulator; and the Federal Home Loan Banks of Chicago and Seattle.Goldman did not admit any wrongdoing in a news release announcing what it described as an “agreement in principle.” Goldman had previously disclosed the state and federal investigation and warned investors that it likely faced a hefty settlement. The bank has told investors that Benjamin Wagner, the U.S. attorney based in Sacramento, California, “concluded” that the bank violated federal law, according to its securities filings.About $2.4 billion of the settlement is in the form of a government penalty. The bank has said that it securitized about $125 billion of home loans between 2005 and 2008, of which about $23 billion eventually soured. The penalty represents about 10 percent of investors’ losses.Goldman can deduct the rest of the settlement, about $2.7 billion, from its future tax bills, according to a person familiar with the accord. The bank said the settlement will reduce its fourth-quarter profit by about $1.5 billion. It reports earnings next week.The U.S. Justice Department and state prosecutors have come under severe criticism for striking deals with big banks over their allegedly illegal activities without requiring them to admit fault, or by structuring the settlements in a way that allow the banks to reduce their taxes. The Justice Department recently has required some banks to acknowledge wrongdoing. Others lately have pleaded guilty to felonies, after a 2013 admission by former Attorney General Eric Holder that some banks may be too big to prosecute criminally led to a public outcry.Goldman’s settlement, if finalized, would be the latest in a long string of deals struck between prosecutors and Wall Street over financial companies’ alleged wrongdoing in the years preceding, during and following the financial crisis. In addition to accusations that Wall Street duped investors who bought home loan bonds, banks have settled allegations that they helped drug cartels launder their illicit proceeds through the U.S. financial system; aided rich Americans who hid money abroad to avoid paying taxes; colluded to rig auctions involving municipal bonds; attempted to manipulate foreign exchange markets and key financial benchmarks; and violated U.S. sanctions against nations including Iran and Sudan."

In a recent interview with on WNYC’s Studio 360, Iñárritu, whose film ""The Revenant"" was nominated for several Academy Awards Thursday morning, spoke candidly about how he ""pities"" Trump for his perspective on immigrants. “What I feel is a little bit [of] compassion,"" the Oscar-winning director said. ""It’s part of the ignorance that is based on fear, and prejudice to find the otherness, to be threatened.To be so rich and to be so bitter -- it's a poor man whose only possession is money."" The filmmaker added that Trump is failing to see the ""humanity"" in the people he publicly condemns. ""When you generalize masses and say 'these guys are rapists' you are taking out the humanity, the integrity of a human being. And that has historically been the way horrible things have happened to humanity. Millions of people have suffered and been killed.""Mr. Trump, take notes.

Yet there’s a part of this story most Americans haven’t heard: the lives of the reporters toiling to create those headlines, observing and documenting every moment on the road with the candidates.As Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) crisscrossed 28 of Iowa’s 99 counties last week, dozens of photographers and reporters followed close behind in a Windstar charter bus, scrambling to meet deadlines, filing stories from rural highways with terrible cell phone reception and often close to no Wi-Fi.Members of the media called the bus home for a week as it covered over 1,000 miles of snowy northwestern Iowa, stopping at diners, college auditoriums and even the basement of a pizza parlor. At the end of the week, the distance they traveled tripping across the Midwestern state was equivalent to driving from central Iowa to Cruz's hometown of Houston.“When I was first covering presidential campaigns, the old joke was that you never passed up a bathroom or a payphone,” said Karen Tumulty, a national correspondent with The Washington Post.Tumulty, who has been covering campaigns since 1988, said the joke has acquired a new meaning.“Now, you never want to pass up a bathroom or a power outlet because all of us that cover presidential campaigns these days, it’s like being Inspector Gadget,” she explained, showing off her assortment of electronics plugged into a few outlets under her seat on the bus. “I have my iPad, my hot spot, my laptop, my cell phone and here, I have my tape recorder. All of which need recharging.”Cruz, who has committed to visiting each of Iowa's 99 counties before the caucuses, is so far the only candidate aside from Hillary Clinton to have a press bus in Iowa. Campaigns typically start offering these a few weeks before the Iowa caucuses as they squeeze in last-minute campaigning.Covering a presidential campaign on the bus is kind of like being on a school field trip. Before the swing through Iowa began, the Cruz campaign sent out an itinerary, detailing all of the stops and the hotels where media would be required to stay. During the entirety of the trip, the bus went directly from event to event before dropping off its passengers at night at their designated hotel. No pit stops, no gas station runs, nothing. (The bus would refuel each night after dropping off the reporters).As temperatures dipped below zero, rooms were packed with voters. Cruz gave his stump speech in crowded restaurants that often felt like saunas. At two separate campaign stops, a woman fainted.Both times, Cruz paused his speech as attendees rushed to help, and once it was determined the woman was doing better, the Texas senator cracked a joke.“All right, good news, she’s doing okay,” Cruz would say, as voters applauded. “Young lady heard the name Hillary Clinton, she immediately fainted.”The crowds were a challenge for crews looking for a place to park their cameras, occasionally stuffing themselves behind checkout counters and bars -- a topic Cruz liked to bring up in his stump speech.“It is particularly amusing seeing all of our friends from the press behind the bar,” Cruz would say as the audience erupted in laughter. “I kind of feel bad that we are driving them to drink.”Throughout the day, it’s common for candidates, especially Cruz, to repeat the same talking points. In the Texas senator’s case, his go-to line is his joke about the locusts and the regulators. He won’t let a stump speech pass without it, and crowds respond well every time.In the joke, Cruz tells the story that he was in West Texas discussing the differences between regulators and locusts with an old farmer.“The thing is,” he says, “you can’t use pesticide on the regulators.” The farmer leans back and, in a thick Texas drawl, says: “Wanna bet?”“What you’re hearing from the candidate is often, very often, the least interesting thing of the day,” Tumulty said. “It can maybe get a little repetitious if you’re listening to it all day. You need to keep reminding yourself that this is the first time the voters are hearing this.""""Increasingly, what these events give you is an opportunity to hear what’s on the voters’ minds,"" she added. ""You can hear what questions they have and then you can pull them aside and sort of talk to them about how they’re making up their minds.""In the three years bus driver Jeff Parris has been working with Windstar lines, this was the first time he’d driven a busload of national media. One thing he quickly learned about the media, he said, is the job isn’t glamorous.“It’s been interesting watching you and your fellow media as you load your gear and get on and off the bus,” Parris said. “Try to get set up in time and be able to get the interviews and then the video footage and still photos that you need of the campaign tour.”The news is typically made at the one to two press conferences (also known as gaggles) that Cruz hosts each day, where the candidate will take a limited number of questions from reporters. There aren’t many candidates running who hold as many conferences as Cruz. Most hold one gaggle per trip, not per day. Sometimes it gets messy, with everyone on top of one another, fighting to get a good shot and sometimes all speaking at once, trying to get in a question.This was the first time this election cycle the Cruz campaign invested in a bus just for press.“It’s mutually beneficial to a campaign and any member of the media to have a press bus,” said Catherine Frazier, Cruz’s national press secretary. “It allows you to cover us at every location, but when you’re on the road going to your next leg, you can file your story, you’re not having to focus on driving yourself.Frazier said renting a bus is a big investment for a campaign, which fronts the cash not only for the bus, but also for meals, and then charges the media outlets for the services provided ($180 per reporter per day.)“I did feel a little bit like a dorm mom, you know, like an RA in college,” she said. “I came on the bus and I saw there was a microphone. It made me feel like I was going to summer camp.”Frazier said organizing the bus came with a lot of added responsibility, and many aspects of the trip didn’t go as planned.“I know there was one leg where we didn’t get everyone’s orders in for lunch,” she admitted. “Overall everyone got to eat. There was one leg where we didn’t have plates for the sandwiches, but we all made do.” Only once did the bus leave behind a reporter.Vaughn Hillyard, a campaign embed with NBC, was still interviewing voters at Danny's Sports Spot in Cherokee when the bus loaded up and drove off. Another passenger realized the mistake as the bus was about to turn onto a highway. The bus went back to collect him. For the rest of the trip, Hillyard was to endure teasing from the rest of the passengers, to the tune of ""Is Vaugh here?"" every time the bus left a stop. Any journalist will tell you that traveling multiple days on the road with a candidate is exhausting. Living out of a suitcase going from hotel to hotel gets old. But what happens on the ground in the Hawkeye state has an impact. As the first-in-the-nation caucuses are on the horizon, candidates like Cruz, are making every visit count.“It’s really fun to do this in Iowa and New Hampshire because the settings are so intimate,” Tumulty said. “You can still get pretty close to the candidate and even still get pretty close to the voters at the event.”She said she’s trying to savor it all because after New Hampshire, when the candidates are usually fewer and higher-profile, the Secret Service comes into the picture.“Once you get into a security perimeter, everything changes,” she said.Also on HuffPost:"

23,POLITICS,"Over 40,000 Ex-Offenders In Maryland Could Regain Their Voting Rights",Samantha Lachman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/felon-voting-rights_us_569805a1e4b0778f46f8af18,Democrats appear to have the votes to override their GOP governor.,2016-01-14,1. Black Lives Matter leaders met with Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56799744160000b300eb9724.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Over 40,000 people with past felony convictions who are on probation or parole will have their voting rights restored if a veto override attempt is successful in Maryland legislature next week. In Maryland, someone with a past felony conviction is barred from voting until he or she finishes their probation or parole. Legislation sent to Republican Gov. Larry Hogan’s desk last spring would have changed that, by allowing people to vote once they’ve left prison. Hogan, who is immensely popular in the state, vetoed the legislation, setting up a fight with Democrats, who control both legislative chambers.On Wednesday, the Democrats’ leadership signaled that they would vote to override Hogan’s veto next Tuesday or Wednesday. If the veto override succeeds, Maryland will join the 13 states, plus the District of Columbia, that allow all people with felony convictions who have left prison to vote in elections. Three states -- Kentucky, Iowa and Florida -- permanently revoke voting rights for all people convicted of a felony, while two states -- Maine and Vermont -- never strip felons of their voting rights, so Maryland would remain in the middle of the felon disenfranchisement continuum.Last spring, Hogan justified his veto by arguing that people with felony convictions should finish their sentences before they regain all of their rights. In a letter to the state’s legislative leaders, Hogan said the current law that makes felons wait to vote until they have completed all aspects of their sentence ""achieves the proper balance between repayment of obligations to society for a felony conviction and the restoration of the various restricted rights.""But voting rights and racial justice advocates say that restoring voting rights for people with felony convictions helps them reintegrate into society.""Democracy means every person deserves a voice,” said Maryland Working Families Director Charly Carter. “In some neighborhoods, thousands of people have had their vote stripped away from them. It is simply wrong to exclude people who have served their time from having a say in the direction of their community, their state and their nation.” Perry Hopkins, a 54-year-old community organizer with Communities United, a Maryland grassroots group that has fought for the rights restoration legislation, told The Huffington Post that it’s frustrating for people with convictions, released from prison, to pay taxes without the corresponding political representation. He doesn’t believe it’s an accident that felon disenfranchisement laws disproportionately affect African-Americans living in Maryland, like him. African-Americans make up 30 percent of Maryland's population but represent nearly three-quarters of its prison population and 65 percent of those disenfranchised by a felony conviction.“You really feel disenfranchised, you feel ostracized, you feel alienated, you feel victimized,” he said. “I’m expected to do the same thing as everyone else, without the same rights. It’s that impact that makes a lot of people recidivate, because you start feeling helpless.” Voting rights advocates say enfranchising ex-offenders upon their release would make the voting process easier for them to understand and would be simpler for election officials to administer. Hopkins, for instance, didn’t know he was eligible to vote -- even though he had completed his probation and parole for his most recent conviction -- until he began working with Communities United.“This is gonna light a fire and bring some new voters into the election process,” Hopkins said.In December, Hogan ordered a review of state rules and regulations that make it more difficult for ex-offenders to re-enter society and find employment. Jane Henderson, the executive director of Communities United, sees some hypocrisy in Hogan’s veto of the voting rights restoration legislation, at the same time that he’s expressing concern about barriers to re-entry.“When it comes to increasing the voting electorate, we see a pattern of Republicans opposing that,” she said. “This is as important to re-entry as any other measure you could put in place.”The American Probation and Parole Association agrees, testifying during debate over the legislation last year that “civic participation is integral to successful rehabilitation and reintegration.”Activists like Hopkins and Henderson have been urging the legislature to override the veto for months. Their effort gained momentum when the Baltimore City Council urged a veto override earlier this week. Maryland Del. Cory McCray (D), who sponsored the voting rights restoration legislation, told The Huffington Post that the veto override is likely to succeed. McCray represents Baltimore, which has the state’s highest concentration of ex-felons, in the lower chamber of the legislature.“People know that the politicians pay attention to votes, that’s ultimately what they look to,” he said. “Elections are decided by very close margins. How are you leaving 40,000 people out of the conversation?”He answered his own question. “It’s just about folks trying to keep power in their hands.”Also on HuffPost:"

The two talked about the former Secretary of State's family life, what it's like being a woman in a male-dominated arena, and what galvanized Clinton to become an advocate for women and girls around the world. De Cadenet told The Huffington post she was surprised by how grounded Clinton was throughout their interview. ""There was no pretense or ego involved. She showed up and we just started chatting,"" she said. When de Cadenet asked Clinton if there was a ""defining moment"" that made her realize she wanted to be an advocate for women, Clinton said her moment came in two phases:""My first phase was as a girl growing up and being told by the boys in the neighborhood that I couldn't play with them because I was a girl. Or being in junior high and being told that we should elect boys to positions of leadership in the school,"" Clinton told de Cadenet. ""I had the experience early on that there were attitudes that people had that really separated boys from girls and in effect discriminated against girls."" Clinton said the second phase came as she entered adulthood: ""As I became an adult I realized how many structural barriers were in place [for women] and how hard it was for a lot of women and girls because they didn't have parents who supported them or the great public schools and opportunities that I had. I became very much involved in [promoting women]."" She said that this ""divide between the sexes"" doesn't need to exist, adding: ""Give more women the chance for education, healthcare, for employment, for whatever it is that they dream to do.""Clinton also talked about how she deals both personally and publicly with being one of the few women in a male-dominated space. ""As a woman in a high public position or seeking the presidency, as I am, you have to be aware of how people will judge you for being 'emotional,'"" Clinton told de Cadenet. ""It's a really delicate balancing act.""Watch the clip below to hear more about how Clinton processes these double standards. Clinton said she ultimately processes the bullsh*t double standards she faces professionally like most of us do: With some good friends.""You vent, sometimes rant, and then you get ready to go out and take on the issues that affect other people,"" she said.And when it comes to criticism, Clinton said she takes it ""seriously, but not personally."": ""You take it seriously because if somebody says something that you can learn from you should. But don't let it tear you down and don't let it disable you.""Watch the full interview below.Head over to ""The Conversation"" to see more from de Cadenet. Also on HuffPost: "

In a blistering Roll Call column on Thursday, Shapiro lambasted the media for its obsession with megalomaniacal presidential candidate Donald Trump, which has helped propel the reality TV star to the top of the Republican primary field.“Since I began covering presidential campaigns in 1980, I can think of nothing as unfair as the disproportionate media attention that has been lavished on Trump from the beginning,” he writes. Shapiro continues:No primary candidate in history (not even Barack Obama in 2008) has ever had most of his speeches broadcast live on cable TV. No political figure has ever been consistently allowed to call into the Sunday interview shows instead of appearing in person. For much of the campaign so far, the only way other Republican presidential candidates could get attention was to be attacked by Trump or to attack the bumptious billionaire.Indeed, network coverage of Trump far outpaces that of any other GOP candidate, according to an analysis from the Television News Archive. Trump accounts for more than 50 percent of mentions of the Republican field. And as The Huffington Post's Michael Calderone pointed out recently, the businessman needn’t have bothered buying air time for his first political ad -- cable networks ran it 60 times for free.News organizations have cited Trump's front-runner status to defend their decision to cover the candidate. A CBS/The New York Times poll released this week shows the businessman with 36 percent support among GOP primary voters, followed by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) at 19 percent.But as Shapiro points out, this justification is a self-fulfilling prophecy.“This saturation coverage, of course, fuels Trump’s poll numbers, which are then used to justify the saturation coverage,” he writes. “And the merry-go-round keeps spinning.”At The Washington Post, political scientist John Sides has looked at the relationship between the media’s coverage of Trump and his poll numbers. Sure enough, Trump’s standing in the Republican field only began to rise after the media began its binge.“It’s tempting to think that each surge is somehow the result of each candidate’s idiosyncratic appeal to Republican voters,” Sides wrote. “But a simpler explanation is this: when a pollster interrupts people’s lives and asks them about a presidential primary that doesn’t formally begin for months, a significant number of people will mention whichever candidate happens to be in the news these days.”The media is certainly rewarded for its coverage: Trump is, as he likes to remind journalists, a  “ratings machine.” Case in point: The candidate hosted NBC's “Saturday Night Live” in November despite Latino groups urging the network to cancel the reality TV star's appearance after he referred to Mexican immigrants as “rapists” and “criminals.” The head of NBC Entertainment said on Wednesday that the ratings were worth the backlash.“What makes this capitulation to ratings and clicks by the news media so depressing is that these decisions are empowering Trump -- the first serious presidential candidate in modern history who exudes disdain for the office of the presidency,” Shapiro writes.

They embarked on a cross-country journey in September to ask people:“It’s the hardest question I could think to ask,” Braunstein told The Huffington Post.The pair has conducted 62 interviews around the country, Braunstein said, for a project they're calling ""Searching for Shraddha."" They've met with teachers, writers, Hindu yogis, orthodox Jews, Buddhist monks, interfaith priests, activists, lawyers, as well as people they've randomly encountered on the street.Hindu chaplain Gadadhara Pandit Das said faith is key to what shraddha represents.""It is upon this faith that we can move forward in our lives,"" Das told HuffPost. ""For example, we can't know for sure whether God exists. However, if we choose to have faith then we can move forward to investigate whether or not there is a God.""It's that inner spark that Braunstein hoped to uncover in each of his interview subjects.“I was curious about the things other people had as far as convictions or beliefs that were so central to them that the idea of living without them was unthinkable,” Braunstein said.Interviews average around 45 minutes to an hour, Braunstein said, and often go remarkably deep.“There comes a point when language fails us and we start to approach the ineffable,"" Braunstein said. ""Eventually, it’s almost like I’m not in the room anymore. They’re focusing that inner lens so intensely.""One interviewee depicted on the website works for the Fellowship of Reconciliation, an interfaith peace organization. (Braunstein and Wrigglesworth are keeping the subjects semi-anonymous to respect their privacy.) Reflecting on his work for racial justice and nonviolence, the reverend said:I get up every day and I do what I was born to do. Every day. It’s life-giving, it’s holy, it’s sacred. I get joy out of it. In the midst of facing tanks and tear gas, I still get joy.Another man spoke of being raised in a conservative Mennonite community but later encountering non-Christians when he went to work with refugees in Vietnam. Many of these people, he said, were ""better pacifists"" than some of the Mennonites he knew -- and the revelation turned his sense of the world on its head.I had to either say, Life is lying to me, or I had to say, What I have been taught as to who are the good people and who are the bad people–I have to go back and relook at that. I think the God that created this world can’t lie to us through life.Many of Braunstein's interviews eventually reach similar conclusions, he said, despite the fact that the subjects come from a wide variety of faiths and background.“People talk of this sense of expansiveness, of love,"" he said. ""People talk about communities in which they’re not the central figure, of charity and giving. Some people talk about God.”The pair hopes to end their project in Oregon by mid-March. Braunstein is planning to write a book based on the interviews,and Wrigglesworth aims to compile a photo book.Before they wrap up the project, though, there will be two final interviews to conduct, Braunstein said. For those, he and Wrigglesworth will have a chance to get in the hot seat and turn the camera back on themselves.Also on HuffPost:"
