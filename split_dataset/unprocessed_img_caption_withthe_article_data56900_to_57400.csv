Not voting is not a ""political option"" in the 2016.",2016-05-15,"U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton leads a discussion on gun violence prevention with family members of victims at the Wilson-Gray YMCA in Hartford, Connecticut, U.S., April 21, 2016. REUTERS/Adrees Latif",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae13df3c000032000b60cb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the February 10, 2016 issue of The Nation Magazine, Michelle Alexander, author of the New York Times best seller, THE NEW JIM CROW-Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness, wrote an article captioned ""Why Hillary Clinton Doesn't Deserve the Black Vote""(Ithttp://www.thenation.com/article/hillary-clinton-does-not-deserve-black-peoples-votes/.)It has been the subject of impassioned online debate among Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders' supporters of their respective presidential campaigns.Professor Alexander's article speaks for itself. I urge all readers of this blog to read it. There are a few excerpts, however, that I will quote that form the basis of my comments in this blog: ""... recognizing that Bernie, like Hillary, has blurred vision when it comes to race is not the same thing as saying their views are equally problematic. Sanders opposed the 1996 welfare-reform law. He also opposed bank deregulation and the Iraq War, both of which Hillary supported, and both of which have proved disastrous. In short, there is such a thing as a lesser evil, and Hillary is not it.""""The biggest problem with Bernie, in the end, is that he's running as a Democrat--as a member of a political party that not only capitulated to right-wing demagoguery but is now owned and controlled by a relatively small number of millionaires and billionaires. Yes, Sanders has raised millions from small donors, but should he become president, he would also become part of what he has otherwise derided as ""the establishment."" ""Even if Bernie's racial-justice views evolve, I hold little hope that a political revolution will occur within the Democratic Party without a sustained outside movement forcing truly transformational change. I am inclined to believe that it would be easier to build a new party than to save the Democratic Party from itself"".On important issues such determining for whom to vote or whether to even vote at all in this forthcoming Presidential election my own personal political experiences and observations require me to respectfully disagree with the advice or suggestions of Professor Alexander, whom I too, greatly admire and respect.As I write this, I can hear in my ear the words from the sonorous baritone voice of legendary labor and civil rights leader A. Phillip Randolph. On more than one occasion, in speaking about the two major parties, Republican and Democratic, and the role that African-Americans should play in voting, he said ""Negroes had no permanent friends(political) or permanent enemies. We have only permanent interests."" Your political ""friend"" today, could be your ""enemy"" tomorrow. He advised that we(African-Americans) should always vote in support of our ""permanent interests""Considered on the historical landscape of what African-Americans have endured and achieved in obtaining the right to vote, not voting as a ""protest vote"" will not assure and protect our ""permanent interest"". Not voting is not a ""political option"" in the 2016. agree with most of the the domestic and foreign policy issues and challenges described by Senator Sanders and some of the solutions he proposes. I plan to vote for him in the Democratic California Primary as my form of voter support for him bringing his views to the public during our presidential election. However, if as a result of the Democratic National Party Convention, Secretary Clinton is chosen as the party's nominee for President instead of Senator Sanders, I will support and vote for Hillary Clinton for President of the United States.Why? First, because not voting at all would be to dishonor the work, struggle, and legacy of so many persons, several of whom I knew and worked with personally during the Civil Rights Movement. These ""Winter Time Soldiers"" worked tirelessly, and, in some cases loss their lives, to insure that I and others living today can vote. How could I ever, or anyone else, who disagrees with several of Secretary of State Clinton's past or current positions on major domestic or foreign policy issues, not vote, because, they like me, preferred several of Senator Sander's proposals for addressing major domestic and foreign policy issues?How would I explain not voting to Fannie Lou Hamer, Michael Schwerner, Andrew Goodman, and James Chaney, murdered by the Klan in Philadelphia, Miss. in the summer of 1964, or to the young girls Cynthia Wesley, Carole Robertson, Addie Mae Collins and Denise McNair, who were also killed by the Klan on September 15th, 1963 in the Sixteenth Baptist Church, Birmingham, AL, or, my friends and colleagues, Rev. James Bevel, James Orange, Reverends King, Abernathy, Billy Kyles, Mrs. Coretta Scott King, Jimmy Lee Jackson, Viola Liuzzo, Unitarian Minister James Reeb and Amelia Boynton, who in March of 1965, was beaten unconscious as she sought to march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, AL to register to vote?Similarly, how I could face and ever speak again to my beloved colleagues and friends, still with us, like Congressman John Lewis, Rev C. T. Vivian, etc., if I followed the advice of Michelle Alexander and others, and chose NOT to vote in this Presidential election for Hillary Clinton because the Democratic Party did not choose MY preferred candidate, Senator Bernie Sanders?A measure of the maturity, sagacity, and political integrity of an African-American political leader today is again, whether or not he or she has the wisdom and courage to know how to vote and support the candidate, best among available choices,most consistent with the permanent interests of the African-American community.Equally, a measure of a non-African-American political leader in the Democratic Party today is to encourage other Sander's supporters that it is also in their best interest to vote for Hillary Clinton, if that is the choice between her and Donald Trump.The son of one of my dearest friends and colleagues, Stanley David Levison, deceased, with whom I often worked daily in our joint efforts on behalf of Dr. King, recently wrote me an email in response to our reflections about Michelle Alexander's article. He wrote: ""Clarence:""One other historical analogy that is relevant to this debate is the agonizing choice many third world national liberation movements had to make in the early 1940's"".""The militants in these struggles had been fighting British imperialism for their entire lives. They had seen friends and family members tortured and killed in the struggle. But, as Hitler began his campaign of conquest they were faced with the imperative to suppress their battle with the British and instead ally with them to defeat Hitler.""""Almost without exception, they made this viciously hard choice. Only the very stupidest of them though there was no difference between the British and Hitler or that it was ""revolutionary"" to stand aloof from the war.""""If the militants of the national liberation struggles could make the agonizing choice to work with their former enemy the British imperialists because Hitler was a greater evil, it's really infantile self-indulgence for current radicals to imagine that Hillary is so great an evil that its worth allowing Donald Trumpallini - a modern version of Mussolini - to triumph.""""But, of course, the kind of people who think this ultra-leftist way don't read enough history to know why they are wrong.""Andy"" Hallelujah! Help me Somebody! If not now, when? If not us, who? ""WE are the Ones That We Have Been Waiting For""!"

""And they let people continue to drink the water and did nothing about it, and I think that's a crime.""""They did it because it's a black city, it's a poor city,"" he added.

2,POLITICS,Here's Why Hillary Clinton's Federal Reserve Plan Is A Big Deal,Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-federal-reserve-plan_us_57363ac4e4b08f96c1833ad3,Progressive nerds love the idea.,2016-05-14,Hillary Clinton just backed an obscure financial reform proposal that could have a huge effect on how the Federal Reserve is run.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57363b782200004207256923.jpeg?cache=uC3IXRV5Cq&ops=crop_47_110_3725_2501%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"On Thursday, Hillary Clinton endorsed a banking reform idea that is more progressive than anything she backed during her long primary battle with Bernie Sanders. Compared to high-profile proposals like breaking up the banks, the plan Clinton backed is a narrow change, but an important one that nerdy liberal activists have been championing for years. Put simply, Clinton wants to shift the balance of power at the Federal Reserve away from private banks in favor of democratic accountability.The Fed is the most powerful economic institution in the world, and perhaps the strangest. The central bank's Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., is a government entity run by presidential appointees who must be confirmed by the Senate. But the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks that perform the bulk of the central bank's grunt work -- handling and processing reserves -- are technically owned by banks. This ownership doesn't mean much in terms of direct earnings; the banks can't sell their Fed stock, and the regional Fed banks don't turn a profit. The trouble is that the regional Fed banks have a lot of power over the Federal Open Market Committee -- the key panel that sets interest rates, directing a tremendous amount of U.S. economic activity. Private banks do have a lot of influence over who manages the Fed's regional outposts through board of director positions. Directors selected by bankers help choose the president of each Fed outpost. These presidents, in turn, serve on the key committee that sets interest rates. On Thursday, Clinton called for getting bankers out of that process.If it all sounds terribly complicated, it is. But the bottom line is that Clinton called to replace one form of banker influence over public policy with a system of democratic accountability. That would be a concrete, progressive change to the status quo. And despite her rhetoric on the campaign trail, the key element of Clinton's financial platform has been to implement existing law.The battle between banker influence and political control at the Fed has been going on since before the central bank was even founded, as journalist and author Roger Lowenstein discusses in the latest episode of the HuffPost politics podcast ""So, That Happened."" Lowenstein's latest book, America's Bank: The Epic Struggle To Create The Federal Reserve, details more than a decade of early 20th-century political combat between Democrats and Republicans, populists and progressives, agrarians and urbanites that culminated in the formation of the U.S. central bank. It sounds, in other words, quite a bit like contemporary politics -- with the caveat that Congress did actually get something done at the end.""When I started this book, it was right after, in the aftermath of our most recent disaster with mortgages and bailouts and everything,"" Lowenstein said. ""I wanted to know how we came through a somewhat similar crash a century ago without a Fed, and why it was that we didn't have one. Because even at that time, we were the only nation in the developed world that was trying to run their economy on this extreme laissez-faire basis.""Listen to Lowenstein's comments in the podcast embedded above. The discussion begins at the 37:00 mark.Nobody in his or her right mind would design the Federal Reserve system from scratch as a way to manage the economy. And Lowenstein shows that nobody, in fact, did such a thing. Creating the Fed was both a political dogfight and a balancing act, with different factions being placated in different ways, resulting in a bizarre public-private hybrid that somehow seems to work.But the battle to shape the Fed didn't stop once the system got up and running. The American central bank has been overhauled several times, most notably during the Great Depression, but also during the 1980s and after the 2008 crash. Clinton's call for further changes is just the latest in a century of struggle over how to govern the world's most potent economic power."

In this edition, we speak with Brian Winter, editor-in-chief of Americas Quarterly, about Brazil's critical state of political uncertainty.With the 2016 Olympic Games around the corner, Brazil is contending with a massive corruption investigation and a dangerous Zika virus epidemic. Now, the country's newly appointed interim president, Michel Temer, is assuming the daunting responsibility of fortifying the nation's fragile democracy as a global audience watches closely. Brazilian senators voted Thursday to begin an impeachment trial against President Dilma Rousseff, amid widespread accusations that she broke budgetary laws -- a crime the embattled leader denies committing.""I have made mistakes, but I have not committed any crimes,"" she said shortly after her trial and resulting suspension were announced, calling it a coup. ""I am being judged unjustly, because I have followed the law to the letter.""Temer, Rousseff's former vice president who is also viewed highly unfavorably, assured Brazilians that the nation would overcome its state of political instability and dire economic recession -- the worst in eight decades.“Political parties, leaders, organizations and the Brazilian people will cooperate to pull the country from this grave crisis,” he said upon taking office. His white, entirely male Cabinet has announced ambitious plans to grow the economy and balance the budget.The WorldPost spoke to Brian Winter, vice president of policy of Americas Society/Council of the Americas and the editor-in-chief of Americas Quarterly, about the political, social and economic challenges that lie ahead for Brazil.What is Rousseff's political future? Can she survive the impeachment trial?I think the odds of her surviving impeachment are very slim. Very, very few people in Brazil expect that she will come back, and that's in part because this impeachment process is -- right or wrong -- as much about the economy and politics as it is about the accusations against her. Particularly on the economy, considering that it's the worst recession in 80 years, there just aren't a whole lot of Brazilians who want to see her come back.What sort of political action or maneuvering can we expect from Rousseff and her allies over these next few months? She's going to try very hard to defend herself during the trial. I see almost zero possibility of her resigning. She's going to say that she was the victim of a coup. She's going to travel Brazil and make this claim. Her supporters will stage street protests and also potential road blocks and more disruptive demonstrations in order to both call attention to her plight and also make life for her successor as difficult as possible. But there are many people who think that her party's main objective in doing this will be to position themselves for the next election, which is currently scheduled for October 2018. The narrative of a coup and the ""illegitimate neoliberal"" Temer government is going to be a powerful one for a segment of Brazilian society.This is a complete shift in political ideology. Is this the end of the Brazil's political left for the foreseeable future?It is a substantial shift in political ideology. The Temer government is going to maintain many of the policies, including the social welfare policies that have been implemented over the last 14 years, largely because they are extremely popular. The Temer government also comes in with very low popularity. Prior to his taking office, just as many Brazilians said they wanted to see Temer impeached as they wanted to see Rousseff impeached.As far as the long-term possibilities for the left, I think they can be back in office in some form or another as soon as 2018. It's hard to have a country that has as much inequality as Brazil has and not have a government that takes that into account. In recent history in Brazil, what's that meant is a government that's left or center-left, whether it openly calls itself that or not.Can Temer earn back Brazilians' trust and respect in the political class?Yes, I do think he can earn back their trust, but it's going to be very hard for him. Neither he nor Rousseff are charismatic, easily lovable people. Unfortunately, the task that awaits him will involve a lot of bitter medicine.Brazil's budget deficit last year was 10 percent of GDP. That is comparable to the worst budget deficit that we had in the United States during the financial crisis. Closing that budget gap, which is at the core of Brazil's current economic problems, is going to be deeply unpleasant. Brazilians are not going to like it. Trying to do that in a context where his legitimacy is being questioned, and where he's not the most personally sympathetic politician in Brazil, is going to be really hard.How will the political turmoil affect Brazil's efforts to recover from its economic crisis?There is nothing fundamentally broken about Brazil. It has an economy that four years ago, everybody thought was going to continue to do really well for the foreseeable future. People were predicting growths of 3, 4, 5 percent into perpetuity. That may have been too optimistic, but there's nothing unfixable about it now.The problem is that it does have structural problems that a government is required to fix. It has the world's most complicated tax code, according to the World Bank. It takes your average company, according to the World Bank, 2,600 hours a year just to calculate what it owes.Bureaucracy and red tape, even by the standards of the emerging world, are atrocious in Brazil. Infrastructure, despite having made some strides this decade, is also bad. And what it all adds up to is, according to the World Bank, a country that is in the bottom half of countries in the world in terms of the ability and ease of doing business.Those are the reasons, in addition to the issues I mentioned with the budget deficit, why investment in Brazil has contracted for 10 straight quarters now. And until investment turns around, the economy is not going to get back on the path to growth.All of those things that I mentioned -- the taxes, the infrastructure, the bureaucracy -- they're all fixable, but fixing them is politically difficult in the short term for a variety of reasons. To fix them you need a certain degree of political consensus, and marshaling that consensus is going to be difficult for a Temer government. It's possible, but very difficult.Brazil's new finance minister, Henrique Meirelles, has plans for economic reform, including the country's generous pension system. This has long been an area of concern in Brazil. What sort of cuts can we expect? We've seen very clearly in the United States how difficult that reform is. Everybody knows here in the United States that we have a problem with our Social Security system. Politicians have been talking about it for 20 or 30 years. Everybody knows what's needed to solve it, but no politician is willing to do it, because it's so politically explosive.Will he be able to fundamentally address that big pension gap that Brazil has? I don't know. How much will he be able to do? I don't know. The problem is big. In fact, some economists say that the pension gap proportionally is much bigger in Brazil than in the United States, but the reasons are the same. People are living longer, and Brazil is also a place that has some incredibly indulgent standards on when people can retire, for example.Does the crisis have ramifications for the country's ability to host the Olympic Games amid concerns about the Zika epidemic?There was a lot of concern about Brazil prior to the World Cup in 2014, and a lot of bellyaching in the international media about all the problems that might occur. I know this because I was one of the bellyachers as a member of the foreign press based in Brazil.As it turns out, everybody believed that the World Cup would be a disaster logistically, but the Brazilian soccer team would do well. It ended up being the opposite. The execution of the Cup went great -- 87 percent of foreign visitors said they wanted to come back to Brazil one day -- but Brazil lost 7-1 to Germany in the semi-final and it was a debacle.I've tried to be cautious this time around about the risks to the Olympics. Brazil and Rio de Janeiro in particular do a really good job hosting parties. They have a deluge of visitors, both local and foreign, every year for New Year's and then for Carnival. I think they'll be fine, but it's worth being concerned about a government that has many issues on its plate.It's valid to worry about them taking the eye off the ball in terms of security in particular. Brazil's a country with 60,000 homicides a year, there's the Zika epidemic that you mentioned, but I think that visitors will go to the Olympics and have a really good time.The impeachment of Rousseff has laid bare major political and social divisions in Brazil. What would it take to unify the country?I think to speak of unification right now, in a classical sense, is probably unrealistic. I think it's true in the United States, too. Sometimes when times are tough, you're going to have healthy debate, especially within a democracy. I don't see a Temer government being able to get 85 to 90 percent of the country on its side.There are too many difficult things to be done, and I think the last few years have just been too contentious. I believe the debate instead will be focused on getting enough consensus in Congress and from society to do the things that can start healing the economy and ensure that important pillars of Brazil's democracy, such as the investigation of the Petrobras corruption scandal, remain in place.If the Temer government can begin to fix the economy and show that justice will still be done and that democratic institutions are working, I think that will begin the process of politically healing the country.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."

Prior to his taking office, just as many Brazilians said they wanted to see Temer impeached as they wanted to see Rousseff impeached.As far as the long-term possibilities for the left, I think they can be back in office in some form or another as soon as 2018. It's hard to have a country that has as much inequality as Brazil has and not have a government that takes that into account. In recent history in Brazil, what's that meant is a government that's left or center-left, whether it openly calls itself that or not.Can Temer earn back Brazilians' trust and respect in the political class?Yes, I do think he can earn back their trust, but it's going to be very hard for him. Neither he nor Rousseff are charismatic, easily lovable people. Unfortunately, the task that awaits him will involve a lot of bitter medicine.Brazil's budget deficit last year was 10 percent of GDP. That is comparable to the worst budget deficit that we had in the United States during the financial crisis. Closing that budget gap, which is at the core of Brazil's current economic problems, is going to be deeply unpleasant. Brazilians are not going to like it. Trying to do that in a context where his legitimacy is being questioned, and where he's not the most personally sympathetic politician in Brazil, is going to be really hard.How will the political turmoil affect Brazil's efforts to recover from its economic crisis?There is nothing fundamentally broken about Brazil. It has an economy that four years ago, everybody thought was going to continue to do really well for the foreseeable future. People were predicting growths of 3, 4, 5 percent into perpetuity. That may have been too optimistic, but there's nothing unfixable about it now.The problem is that it does have structural problems that a government is required to fix. It has the world's most complicated tax code, according to the World Bank. It takes your average company, according to the World Bank, 2,600 hours a year just to calculate what it owes.Bureaucracy and red tape, even by the standards of the emerging world, are atrocious in Brazil. Infrastructure, despite having made some strides this decade, is also bad. And what it all adds up to is, according to the World Bank, a country that is in the bottom half of countries in the world in terms of the ability and ease of doing business.Those are the reasons, in addition to the issues I mentioned with the budget deficit, why investment in Brazil has contracted for 10 straight quarters now. And until investment turns around, the economy is not going to get back on the path to growth.All of those things that I mentioned -- the taxes, the infrastructure, the bureaucracy -- they're all fixable, but fixing them is politically difficult in the short term for a variety of reasons. To fix them you need a certain degree of political consensus, and marshaling that consensus is going to be difficult for a Temer government. It's possible, but very difficult.Brazil's new finance minister, Henrique Meirelles, has plans for economic reform, including the country's generous pension system. This has long been an area of concern in Brazil. What sort of cuts can we expect? We've seen very clearly in the United States how difficult that reform is. Everybody knows here in the United States that we have a problem with our Social Security system. Politicians have been talking about it for 20 or 30 years. Everybody knows what's needed to solve it, but no politician is willing to do it, because it's so politically explosive.Will he be able to fundamentally address that big pension gap that Brazil has? I don't know. How much will he be able to do? I don't know. The problem is big. In fact, some economists say that the pension gap proportionally is much bigger in Brazil than in the United States, but the reasons are the same. People are living longer, and Brazil is also a place that has some incredibly indulgent standards on when people can retire, for example.Does the crisis have ramifications for the country's ability to host the Olympic Games amid concerns about the Zika epidemic?There was a lot of concern about Brazil prior to the World Cup in 2014, and a lot of bellyaching in the international media about all the problems that might occur. I know this because I was one of the bellyachers as a member of the foreign press based in Brazil.As it turns out, everybody believed that the World Cup would be a disaster logistically, but the Brazilian soccer team would do well. It ended up being the opposite. The execution of the Cup went great -- 87 percent of foreign visitors said they wanted to come back to Brazil one day -- but Brazil lost 7-1 to Germany in the semi-final and it was a debacle.I've tried to be cautious this time around about the risks to the Olympics. Brazil and Rio de Janeiro in particular do a really good job hosting parties. They have a deluge of visitors, both local and foreign, every year for New Year's and then for Carnival. I think they'll be fine, but it's worth being concerned about a government that has many issues on its plate.It's valid to worry about them taking the eye off the ball in terms of security in particular. Brazil's a country with 60,000 homicides a year, there's the Zika epidemic that you mentioned, but I think that visitors will go to the Olympics and have a really good time.The impeachment of Rousseff has laid bare major political and social divisions in Brazil. What would it take to unify the country?I think to speak of unification right now, in a classical sense, is probably unrealistic. I think it's true in the United States, too. Sometimes when times are tough, you're going to have healthy debate, especially within a democracy. I don't see a Temer government being able to get 85 to 90 percent of the country on its side.There are too many difficult things to be done, and I think the last few years have just been too contentious. I believe the debate instead will be focused on getting enough consensus in Congress and from society to do the things that can start healing the economy and ensure that important pillars of Brazil's democracy, such as the investigation of the Petrobras corruption scandal, remain in place.If the Temer government can begin to fix the economy and show that justice will still be done and that democratic institutions are working, I think that will begin the process of politically healing the country.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."

Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) said of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton's possible war policies.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57363ce2220000420725692a.jpeg?ops=crop_17_284_2983_1499%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — Republicans in Congress may be struggling to wrap their arms around Donald Trump, but one thing most of them don't seem concerned about is handing the bomb-throwing businessman the power they've granted the current president to throw real bombs.President Barack Obama launched his war against the self-described Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, nearly two years ago. Rather than go to Congress to seek approval within the 60 days required by the War Powers Act, his administration relied on the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force that was passed to attack Al Qaeda. The authorization specifically grants authority to pursue the culprits behind the Sept. 11 attacks as well as their supporters. ISIS did not exist then.Obama did request new authority last year, but Republicans never brought it up for consideration, saying it was too limited and would tie the hands of future presidents. That future president is likely to be Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. On the Republican side, Trump has said his solution to ISIS would be to “bomb the shit out of ‘em.”In the meantime, the 2001 AUMF, which has no end date, remains effective. For most Republicans, including some who have been harshly critical of Trump, that’s just fine. “If I don’t like what the president’s doing, you cut off funding,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). Graham offered a new, open-ended AUMF earlier this year along with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that would grant the next president carte blanche.“I don’t like the idea of telling a commander-in-chief they can’t go where ISIL goes, they’re limited by time, geography and means. If I don’t like the time, geography or means, I can cut off funding,” said Graham, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a former military lawyer.The issue is acquiring fresh relevance not just because the nation is pondering who will take over the unending war on terror, but also because the House is set to take up a new National Defense Authorization Act in the coming week.Some lawmakers, including a handful of vocal Republicans, are planning to try to force Congress to vote on the ongoing war in coming weeks.But most prefer not to have to take a risky or unpopular vote for more war, even if they want the White House to use more force. They'd prefer the president to take the responsibility, and they think either Clinton or Trump would be a step up from Obama.“Both of which would be an improvement,” said Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Ala.), a member of the House Armed Services Committee. “There’s nowhere to go but up from what we’ve got.”“We need to finish what we started,” said another committee member, Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.), emphatically endorsing a more vigorous approach against ISIS — and Donald Trump as the one to carry it out, regardless of Trump’s intemperate bombing comments. “He’s also said work with them, too,” Wilson said. “So it’d be a combination of the above, which I think is a proper policy. Where it’s appropriate, work with people, and where it’s not, be firm.”Some Republicans were not necessarily all in on Trump, but also didn’t want to stir up trouble with a war vote.“I think it kind of depends whether or not whoever is the next president has a plan,” said Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), when asked if he’d be comfortable with Clinton or Trump using the current authority.And while he is unsatisfied with Obama’s war effort, he didn’t want to push the issue.“I think that right now, when you’re almost in between commanders in chief, we shouldn’t do anything that will raise any questions about that,” he said.Similarly, Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) wants the next president to be much tougher than Obama, whose efforts against ISIS he called “shameful.”He said he hopes Trump would “advocate the maintenance and strength of a military capable of dealing with the growing threats to freedom this world faces” and “dismiss the practice of Mr. Obama of emboldening our enemies and disheartening our friends.”But asked if Congress should set some war powers limits ahead of time for either Clinton or Trump, Franks was less certain.“The two of them of course are both wild cards in that regard,” Franks said. “It’s a good question, and one I’ll have to think about more.""Some Republicans who thought Congress should in fact debate the ongoing war nevertheless said they did not think it would happen.“I have heard no conversations about an authorization coming to the floor,” said Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), although he added “we ought to have the debate and the vote on authorization, regardless of who the president is, today or in the future.”Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.), who is retiring after this year but co-sponsored the hawkish measure Graham and McConnell have offered, also said it should be voted on, and also thought it would not be.“It’s clear that we’re not going to initiate it here,” Coats said. “If it were solely up to me, I would say we ought to debate it. I think we can’t continue this kind of commitment without having the support from the American people, and this debate is, I think, necessary.“The issue is, are we at a point where we want define the next president’s strategy? More people think no than yes on that,” he said.A spokesman for McConnell noted that the White House has argued that it has all the authority it needs.“If there is something beyond that scope that a president needs and he presents a plan to Congress, then Congress can act,” said Don Stewart, noting that although Obama asked for a new AUMF, the request did not seek additional authority and came with few details about how the White House would carry out the war. ""I don’t have any hypothetical answers about what a future president may request or need,” Stewart said.A spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan did not know of any plans to try to update the war authorization there.But by asserting no authority over a war that has been going on and changing since 2001 -- with continued funding from Congress serving as implicit authority and no formal objections from lawmakers -- Congress could be considered to have freed the commander in chief from most restraints against any military actions related to the war on terror. And that would leave very little beyond the funding power that Graham mentioned to rein in a President Trump or Clinton.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S. "
8,THE WORLDPOST,Why Kenya Announced An Unrealistic But Alarming Plan To Rid The Country Of Refugees,Charlotte Alfred,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kenya-expels-refugees_us_57364cede4b08f96c183479d,Aid groups warn that forcing hundreds of thousands of refugees out would create instability and a humanitarian disaster.,2016-05-14,"Over 350,000 people live in Dadaab in northeast Kenya, the largest refugee camp in the world.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57364fb2130000010538194a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When Kenya threatened last Friday to shut down the largest refugee camp in the world and rid the country of over half a million refugees, many people initially questioned whether it was serious.The practicalities just didn’t make sense. Over 350,000 people live in Dadaab, a network of camps in Kenya’s northeastern desert, and around 150,000 more live in Kenya’s second refugee camp, Kakuma.It would take a huge amount of money and manpower to dismantle the thousands of tents, huts and buildings in Dadaab, which today include shops and cinemas, churches and mosques. Even more difficult is the prospect of forcibly uprooting hundreds of thousands of people, some of whom have spent their whole lives in the camps.“Actually closing Dadaab and Kakuma refugee camps would be like wiping two large cities off the face of the earth,” said Mark Yarnell, senior advocate at Washington, D.C.-based Refugees International. “Moving ahead with a forced shutdown of the camps would create a humanitarian disaster of massive proportions,” he told The WorldPost.Kenya has threatened to shut down refugee camps in the country twice before in recent years before backtracking. Yet refugees, aid agencies and the United Nations are now grappling with the possibility that the government might actually follow through this time.The first sign was when Kenya dissolved its Department of Refugee Affairs overnight. Then, it formed a task force on Wednesday to manage the closure of Dadaab (without mentioning Kakuma or other refugees in the country), and said it was putting $10 million toward the effort. A Kenyan interior ministry official said the first group of refugees would leave Dadaab by November, and the camp would be fully closed by next May.Even so, experts say Kenya’s plan still doesn’t add up. They were highly skeptical of the government’s claim that refugees would leave voluntarily. “It is difficult to imagine hundreds of thousands of refugees leaving in a short time and in conditions of a voluntary nature,” said Duke Mwancha, a U.N. refugee agency spokesman in Kenya. He said the U.N. agency would not take part in any forced return operation, which is illegal under international law.Then there’s the question of where the refugees will go. Most of Dadaab’s residents are from neighboring Somalia, a country with a fragile government and frequent attacks by Islamist militant group al-Shabaab. While Kenya says Somalia is now safe, many Somalis fear returning. If forced back to the country, they could easily just slip back over the porous border into Kenya.Kenyan officials said some refugees could be moved to other, safer countries, but it wasn’t clear which countries would accept them; Kenya’s neighbors already have large refugee populations.Since the camp was established following Somalia’s 1991 civil war, a whole generation of has grown up in the camp. “Dadaab is the only home we know,” Somali refugee Hassan wrote in Kenyan newspaper the Daily Nation this week. The closure announcement “has left many like me wondering whether we will now be truly homeless.”Kenya says it is necessary to close Dadaab refugee camp because it has been infiltrated by al-Shabaab, which has waged deadly attacks inside Kenya and poses a security threat to the country. Refugee advocates say these claims are overblown for political reasons, and closing the camp could actually have the reverse effect on regional stability.“Kenya says their goal is to increase security, but to force hundreds of thousands of people into an insecure area would only create insecurity,” Yarnell told The WorldPost.Somalia on Thursday warned Kenya against sending refugees back over the border. “The move will make the threat of terrorism worse, not better, given the volatile situation this decision and the proposed subsequent actions will cause,” a statement from the Somali foreign ministry said.Some analysts suspect that Kenya is manufacturing a crisis over refugees to send a message to the international community that it needs to step up funding for refugees, and to accelerate official procedures to resettle them elsewhere. Refugee experts acknowledge these concerns are valid. While world attention has been consumed with the refugee crisis on Europe’s borders, the vast majority of refugees live in developing nations like Kenya. Dadaab is overcrowded, underfunded, and has faced frequent food ration cuts.“This is what happens when the West does not exercise global leadership [over refugees],” said Ben Rawlence, the author of the book City Of Thorns, which tells the stories of refugees in Dadaab. “We can’t expect countries to help refugees when we’re not doing our share.”Kenyan officials have pointed to Europe’s hypocrisy over the global refugee crisis in statements about the closure of Dadaab. “There has been a fall-off in the voluntary international funding for the camps in Kenya, in favour of raising budgets in the northern hemisphere to refugees headed to the West,” Kenya’s Principal Secretary for the Interior wrote in an editorial defending the policy this week. “International obligations in Africa should not be done on the cheap; the world continues to learn the ruinous effect of these persistent double standards.”Further, Europe’s reaction to the refugee crisis, especially the recent deal to stop refugees leaving Turkey in exchange for refugee aid, sets a cynical precedent that Kenya is following, refugee advocates say.“This is happening in a global context where refugees have become trading chips in political negotiations,” Yarnell said. “When Turkey gets paid $6 billion to stem the flow of refugees from their country, it becomes more difficult for international actors to say this is inappropriate.”Doctors Without Borders on Friday urged Kenya to fight the West’s double-standards by setting a good example to Europe. “Rather than endorsing the broken and inhumane policies of the EU and others, now, more than ever, is the time for Kenya to embrace and continue its tradition of providing refuge,” the medical aid group said in a statement.There may be other political factors behind the timing of the announcement. Kenya contributes some 3,500 troops to the African Union force in Somalia, which needs its mandate renewed by the U.N. by the end of the month. Additionally, Kenya’s president Uhuru Kenyatta kicked off his campaign for re-election in 2017 the week before the announcement. “By scoring political points through blaming refugees, [Kenya’s politicians] are taking a page out of Donald Trump’s playbook,” Yarnell said. Human rights groups are concerned that Kenyan politicians’ statements this week linking the camps to terrorism will bring a backlash against refugees. “This has increased the negative and xenophobic attitude against Somali refugees,” said Victor Nyamori, Amnesty International’s refugee officer in Kenya. “Refugees should not be used as a scapegoat for security challenges.”They also fear the police will exploit the threat of expulsion to step up arrests of refugees and demands for bribes to avoid arrest, as had happened in the past, after terror attacks or government warnings about refugees. Community leaders have already reported increased police harassment of refugees since last Friday’s announcement, particularly in urban areas like Nairobi’s Eastleigh neighborhood, Nyamori said. “The mere statement [of closing refugee camps] gives blanket cover for security forces to commit extortion against refugees,” Yarnell said. “Somalis are targeted by police for extortion, especially in Eastleigh, because they are vulnerable -- they are even referred to as human ATMs by the police.” The government’s move to close the Department of Refugee Affairs has also taken a toll on refugees in Kenya. They depended on the bureau to get permits to move around the country, including for medical treatment. Doctors Without Borders said at least four of its patients in Dabaab had been waiting for emergency referrals since last week. The department was also responsible for registering new refugees arriving in Kenya, and around 2,000 people who fled South Sudan were already unable to register this week, the Wall Street Journal reported. “This is unbelievable...everyone is just stunned and really sad,” Abdullahi Aden Hassan, a spokesman of refugees in Dadaab, told The Guardian. “There is still war going on in so many parts of Somalia. It is simply too dangerous to return at this time.”"

Guasp Perez is unhappy with the legislation underway to help the island.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/573777a3160000ae0731ebf9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Many Puerto Rican activists have tired of waiting for help from the U.S. Congress. And now that legislation is advancing to help the commonwealth deal with its debt crisis, they worry that fixing the problem will not be worth the accompanying loss of financial sovereignty.To effect change on their own, some of the island's young people are marshaling scant resources to address social ills and shape Puerto Rico's future.Alejandro Silva Diaz, 28, leads the nonprofit Mentes Puertorriqueñas en Acción, or ""Puerto Rican Minds in Action."" The organization, founded in 2007, aims to fill what Silva Diaz calls a “leadership gap” by making the country’s future political and business elite more attuned to the challenges facing ordinary and underprivileged Puerto Ricans.“A lot of Puerto Rican leaders have read and heard about social problems, but do not know about them firsthand,” Silva Diaz said.Mentes Puertorriqueñas focuses on finding internships for college students as a way of encouraging bright, socially conscious young people to stay on the island instead of moving to the mainland United States.“We noticed that students who study abroad in the U.S. want to come back, but their friends, colleagues and network are based outside Puerto Rico,” Silva Diaz said. “Through the internship program, they have a network through which they can start.”Jobs for young people are in short supply on the island, as a result of Puerto Rico’s decade-long economic slump. Those that are available often come through internships that pay little if any money, creating a barrier to a steady career path for students who cannot afford to work for no pay.“Puerto Rico’s crime rate is pretty high,” Silva Diaz said. “A lot of young people are choosing to get involved in the black market.”To learn about other grassroots activism efforts under-way in Puerto Rico, watch HuffPost RYOT’s documentary below. To watch this 360-degree footage on a desktop browser, tap and drag to look around. On a phone, pan by moving your phone.Mentes Puertorriqueñas, which receives funding from a number of Puerto Rican foundations, matches students with internships in the private sector that pay at least minimum wage, and nonprofits that typically at least pay stipends. The group typically makes 30 internship placements per year, but expects to make 40 this year, which would bring its grand total to 180 since it began the internship program.How did Puerto Rico get into this mess in the first place? Successive Puerto Rican governments relied on borrowing to defer difficult budgetary choices. Wall Street played its part by eagerly granting the island risky loans.Analysts who are sympathetic to Puerto Rico’s predicament note that its in-between status as a U.S. commonwealth has made the current crisis harder to avoid. The island is saddled with many of the costs associated with being one of the 50 mainland states, while enjoying few of the states’ freedoms — including the power to extend bankruptcy authority to distressed municipalities.Puerto Rico insists that it needs to restructure its debts if it is ever to emerge from a fiscal crisis that has forced it to adopt crippling austerity measures. The island’s steep spending cuts and tax increases have sparked a steep deterioration in living standards and a mass exodus.Silva Diaz is worried that the additional austerity measures in impending Congressional legislation offering Puerto Rico limited debt relief will ultimately make the situation worse. A draft of a House bill would allow Puerto Rico’s governor to lower the minimum wage to $4.25 an hour for Puerto Ricans under 25. The island's current minimum wage is the same as the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour.If the governor acted on the proposed new powers, Silva Diaz believes it would “create an incentive” for more young people to leave the island or enter the underground job market.Silva Diaz said he and many of his peers find the current crisis especially frustrating because they view it as the result of decisions made by decades of leaders they did not elect. The prospect of a Washington-based fiscal board with the power to dictate budget choices -- a key element of the congressional aid bill that is almost certain to remain in the final legislation -- adds insult to generational injury, according to Silva Diaz.“The fiscal board they are proposing would reduce our democratic aspirations,” Silva Diaz said.Millennial Puerto Ricans “would have to pay for the debt,” he added. “Plus, we are not going to be able to be involved in the decision-making to get out of the crisis.”Guillermo Guasp Perez, the 22-year-old president of the student council at the University of Puerto Rico’s largest campus in San Juan, has a similarly dim view of the planned congressional assistance in its current form.Guasp Perez recently joined other student leaders in a trip to Washington to lobby Congress for more favorable terms. He said he appreciates the need for congressional oversight given Puerto Rico’s history of fiscal irresponsibility, but is concerned about a board that could have effective veto power over the island’s decisions.That kind of fiscal authority would “make futile our democratic process,” Guasp Perez said.Guasp Perez led the student body of the University of Puerto Rico on a three-day strike in March that shut down his campus. They are demanding a restoration of the university system’s funding levels, which the Puerto Rican government froze in 2014.The strike did not end with concrete policy victories for the students. But Guasp Perez argues that students' actions “showed that students and the university need to be part of the discussion of how to resolve the fiscal crisis.”Silva Diaz’s Mentes Puertorriqueñas also encourages young people to think critically about the island’s politics. The group hosts Café Conciencia, a bi-monthly salon for young people to hear from an expert guest about a relevant policy matter and discuss it.One of the topics that came up at a recent Café Conciencia is whether a significant portion of Puerto Rico’s debt was issued unconstitutionally and thus can be nullified. It's fitting that the biggest advocate for this seemingly radical approach is another young person: Manuel Natal, a 29-year-old lawyer and outspoken member of the Popular Democratic Party, who remains the youngest member of Puerto Rico’s House of Representatives since his election in 2013.The island’s constitution forbids annual debt that exceeds 15 percent of revenues, according to Natal, a threshold the government projected it would pass by a nearly three-fold margin by the end of 2016.“This is not the first default on Puerto Rico"" because the island has already betrayed its people by slashing so many public services, Natal told HuffPost RYOT in an interview for an upcoming video on the island's activists. ""We have defaulted on our obligations with the people of Puerto Rico.""Like many younger Puerto Ricans, the country’s predicament bewilders Natal. He wants to know how local lawmakers let the situation get this bad, and what exact roles Congress and Wall Street played.Natal, nicknamed “muchachito,” or kid, by his party elders, spearheaded the creation of a commission to audit the country’s $70-billion debt with the goal of getting answers to that question. He now serves on the commission, and is confident it will reveal that a significant portion of the debt is “illegal.”Flat-out canceling some of Puerto Rico’s debts is one of many Hail Mary-type plays that have emerged as plausible options in the absence of -- or, perhaps, in spite of -- congressional action. Puerto Rico’s government is hoping the Supreme Court will decide in June to uphold a local bankruptcy law that would allow its municipalities and public corporations to seek redress in court that could force losses on creditorsThe island’s governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, also signed a law in April giving him authority to declare a state of emergency and put a moratorium on debt payments.Puerto Rico already defaulted on May 1 on payments of over $400 million. It is widely expected that the island lacks the funds to meet a $2 billion installment, much of it high-priority general obligation bonds, that comes due on July 1.Whether congressional aid, however objectionable, arrives in time for the July 1 deadline is of less concern to Alejandro Silva Diaz, Guillermo Guasp Perez, Manuel Natal and the island’s other young renegades, than whether Puerto Rico will be a promising place to build a life in five, 10 or 20 years' time. Governors, credit events and congressional aid packages may change, but one way or another, Puerto Rico’s youth will be forced to reckon with what is left.When I spoke to Guasp Perez, he was busy arranging logistics for a speech that Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) will be giving on his campus this Monday.Sanders has declared his opposition to the current House bill to help Puerto Rico, notwithstanding its bipartisan support, citing objections to the proposed fiscal board.Guasp Perez said that students were clamoring for the chance to get one of the limited number of seats to see Sanders speak. The island’s residents are not eligible to vote in the general presidential election, but they will participate in the Democratic primary on June 5.Guasp Perez would not say whom he plans to vote for, but like many college students on the mainland, he had some kind words for Sanders.“Bernie is not a common senator or elected official, specifically with the honesty in how he talks to his audience,” Guasp Perez said.The student leader said that Puerto Rico’s leaders could learn a thing or two from Sanders’ approach.“Sometimes we do not have to tell people what they want to hear; we have to tell them what they should hear,” he said."
13,THE WORLDPOST,Sadiq Khan and the End of Islamophobia,"John Feffer, ContributorDirector, Foreign Policy In Focus; Author, 'Aftershock: A Jour...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sadiq-khan-and-the-end-of-islamophobia_us_57371077e4b07a3866044ca1,"Even his own sister was mortified. In the recent mayoral race in London, the Conservative Party’s Zac Goldsmith was in many",2016-05-14,"London mayoral candidate Sadiq Khan gestures during an interview with Reuters at Canary Wharf in London, Britain November 17, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/573cd94c13000001053821db.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Even his own sister was mortified.In the recent mayoral race in London, the Conservative Party’s Zac Goldsmith was in many ways the perfect candidate: a young, handsome fellow who possessed full-spectrum appeal.To win the election, Goldsmith could have focused on all the work he’d done on the environment, as a journalist and former editor of the magazine The Ecologist. To further woo liberals, he could have highlighted his considerable international experience and his support of the rights of indigenous peoples. Conversely, he could have cemented his popularity among conservative populists by emphasizing his skeptical attitude toward the European Union. If he’d played it safe, Goldsmith could have translated an early lead in the polls into a victory at the ballot box.Instead, the Goldsmith team prompted a huge backlash by suggesting that his opponent, the Labor Party’s Sadiq Khan, was a Muslim extremist because of his associations and his political bedfellows. The rhetoric from the Conservative camp was nothing so blatant or ugly as some of the proposals in the Republican presidential primary, such as prohibiting Muslims candidates from entering the Oval Office (Ben Carson) or prohibiting Muslims immigrant from entering the country (Donald Trump).Still, the insinuations prompted Goldsmith’s sister Jemima, a prominent journalist and convert to Islam, to write on Twitter: “Sad that Zac’s campaign did not reflect who I know him to be.” Even fellow Conservatives distanced themselves from the candidate. Former Conservative cabinet minister Sayeeda Warsi, for instance, decried the “appalling dog whistle racism,” and the Conservative leader in the London Assembly, Andrew Boff, called the tactics “outrageous.”Last week, when Londoners went to the polls to elect their mayor, the billionaire conservative suffered a humiliating landslide defeat. Sadiq Khan will be the new face of multicultural London.What’s most interesting about the handling of Goldsmith’s campaign is the perception, among his advisors, that the instrumental use of Islamophobia would be politically helpful. It wasn’t such a reach, perhaps. On the continent at least, the tactic seemed to work in boosting the fortunes of what should otherwise be fringe parties like the National Front in France, the Alternative fur Deutschland in Germany, and the Sweden Democrats. And the blatantly anti-Muslim UK Independence Party (UKIP) has been steadily gaining support, nearly doubling its representation in the same local elections.London, of course, is a city, and a very diverse one at that. What might work in Britain as a whole clearly failed with the more cosmopolitan voters in its capital. Polling at 20 percent across most of the country in the 2014 elections, UKIP managed only 7 percent in London. One UKIP candidate attributed the difference to the “more media-savvy and educated” population of the capital city. It would be reassuring to believe that Sadiq Khan’s victory will banish Islamophobia from the electoral toolbox, particularly here in the United States. But America is not London. And ourbillionaire conservative is no tree-hugging friend of indigenous peoples. He doesn’t care about offending liberal sensibilities.Moreover, anti-Islamic sentiment has been steadily rising in the United States, thanks to a relatively small group of well-funded organizations and individuals. Even if Donald Trump loses in November, as he most assuredly will, Islamophobia will not slink into the shadows along with its mouthpiece, the disgraced reality star.Astounding MisinformationSince 2001, the United States has resettled about 800,000 refugees inside its borders. Of that number, five have been arrested on terrorism charges. Two were arrested this January, another in 2013, and the other two in 2011. Five out of 800,000 equals .000625 percent. That’s practically the definition of statistically insignificant.Yet, as the Brooking Institution’s Robert McKenzie pointed out at a recent panel in Washington, DC sponsored by Brookings and Duke University, 31 out of 50 governors have announced that they want to bar Syrian refugees from entering their states. All but one of these governors is a Republican. It’s an important reminder that the scaremongering of Trump, Carson, and the other erstwhile presidential candidates poisons the party as a whole.The problem extends beyond individual Islamophobes. Equally troubling is the overall climate of bigotry and fear. Christopher Bail, a Duke University researcher who also participated in the panel, has been documenting the spread of Islamophobia. He presented a series of graphsthat revealed that:Over the past decade, 32 states proposed shariah law bans, controversies about the construction of mosques have increased by more than 800 percent, and the number of Americans with negative opinions of Islam has more than doubled.To understand how astonishing these results are, imagine if I wrote that 32 states had proposed anti-UFO laws, that controversies over the construction of playgrounds had increased by 800 percent, and that the number of Americans with negative opinions of Judaism had more than doubled. You’d think that the country had been taken over by delusional, child-hating Nazis.After all, there is zero evidence of a campaign to impose shariah law anywhere in the United States — the only case ever cited is one in which a domestic court judge based his judgment on shariah law, which the appellate court sensibly overturned — just as there’s no evidence of an alien plot to take over the world. Mosque attendance has been definitively demonstrated to reduce extremism, not encourage it. And although anti-Semitism is universally reviled, anti-Islamic sentiment flourishes because many Americans associate the religion with the tiny number of extremists who call themselves Muslims rather than with the 99.9 percent who are not followers of the Islamic State or al-Qaeda.For information on the negative correlation between mosque attendance and extremism, you can turn to an important 2010 study, also from Duke University. Or you can look at recent polling from the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU), which Dalia Mogahed also presented at the Duke-Brookings panel.Muslim Americans who regularly attend mosques are more likely than those who do not frequent mosques to work with their neighbors to solve community problems (49 vs. 30 percent), be registered to vote (74 vs. 49 percent), and are more likely to plan to vote (92 vs. 81 percent).ISPU also found that Muslims in America are just as likely as members of other religious groups to “oppose the targeting and killing of civilians by individuals or small groups” and far more likely to “oppose the targeting and killing of civilians by the military” (65 percent, versus 45 percent of Jews and slightly less for Catholics and Protestants, say such practices are never justified).The fact that Americans are so ignorant of the basic facts about Muslims in America isn’t simply the result of a lack of contact (most Americans don’t personally know any Muslims) or the absence of information in school curricula. Much of the ignorance around Muslims, particularly as it relates to security issues, is manufactured.A relatively small industry of pundits and activists — Pamela Geller, Frank Gaffney, Walid Phares, Robert Spencer, and their associated donors — have managed to inject their views into mainstream organizations (if you consider the Heritage Foundation mainstream) and into the news media (if you consider Fox to be “news”). And from there, these calculated distortions have entered the political discourse (if you consider what Donald Trump says to be “discourse”).But it’s not just The Donald.From the Margins to the CenterIn her victory speech after the Pennsylvania primary last month, Hillary Clinton gave a shout out to all the various constituencies that make up her voting bloc: women, workers, LGBT, people with disabilities. She also warned of what would happen should candidates “from the other side” prevail:They would make it harder to vote, not easier. They would deny women the right to make our own reproductive health care decisions. They would round up millions of hardworking immigrants and deport them. They would demonize and discriminate against hardworking, terror-hating Muslim Americans who we need in the fight against radicalization. And both of the top candidates in the Republican Party deny climate change even exists.At first glance, Hillary is hitting all the right notes. But as Omid Safi, the head of the Duke Islamic Studies Center, pointed out at the above-mentioned panel, only Muslim Americans merited an ominous qualifier: “terror-hating.”Hillary is implying that, without such a qualifier, Muslim Americans are somehow guilty by association. They are connected in the public mind with the San Bernardino couple who killed 14 people at the end of last year — unless they explicitly say otherwise — in a way that white Christians are not expected to disavow their connection to Dylann Roof, who likewise killed nine people last year.For most Americans, Muslims are the “other,” a group of people who have to constantly prove the negative: that they’re not terror-loving. Good luck proving the negative. In such an environment, Muslims will never be above suspicion. Muslim organizations have repeatedly decried every terrorist act linked to Muslims, but the mainstream media has just as repeatedly ignored them. And so continues the myth that Muslims secretly approve of what al-Qaeda and the Islamic State are doing.To defeat Islamophobia, or at least to stigmatize it to the same degree as racism and anti-Semitism, political victories over candidates who use both dog whistles and megaphones to trumpet anti-Islamic sentiment are, of course, essential. But the challenge is greater.First, as Omid Safi pointed out, you shouldn’t fight intolerance with tolerance. A concept emerging from ancient pharmacology, “tolerance” meant the degree to which a body could put up with a toxin. Muslims are not toxins. They are part of the fabric of American society. Like all other Americans, they deserve to be respected for how they are the same as everyone else — and different.On the side of difference, they practice a religion that has features in common with other monotheisms as well as quite a few unique features. But whether it’s praying toward Mecca, making annual charitable contributions, or undertaking the hajj (pilgrimage), the essential features of Islam have been part of the American landscape since before even the birth of the country. Difference is what makes America great. Those who prefer cultural uniformity should relocate to, well, Saudi Arabia, for instance.On the side of similarity, it’s time to stop securitizing Muslims — thinking of them only in terms of terrorism, national security, and “threat.” As the ISPU polling indicates, American Muslims have the same preoccupations as the rest of America: the economy. They identify strongly as patriotic, and the more religiously observant they are, the more being American is important to their identity. They are far more satisfied than any other religious group with the direction the country is currently heading. And they are far more diverse a group than any other religious community. With large numbers of African American, Latino, and Asian adherents, the American Muslim community looks more like America than Protestants, Jews, or even Catholics.The victory of Sadiq Khan has “normalized” Muslims in UK politics in much the same way that JFK normalized Catholics in American politics. American Muslims are still waiting for their JFK moment. True, for the last seven years, large numbers of Americans have thought that their president is a Muslim, which in Islamophobic America has been just another way of saying that these conspiracy theorists don’t like Obama. So, obviously, that doesn’t count.The presidential victory of Obama was not the end of racism. But it did serve as a watershed moment in the evolving status of the African American community and represented a significant nail in bigotry’s coffin. Some day in the future, when the grotesqueries of Donald Trump are a fading memory and even the Islamophobia-lite of mainstream politicians will seem as archaic as the anti-Semitic insinuations of polite 1950s America, the occupant of the Oval Office will state that she is proud to be both American and Muslim.There will be cheers. There will be boos. But we’ll know that the era of Islamophobia has passed when the most common reaction is a shrug and a yawn.Crossposted with Foreign Policy In Focus"

Before he was dead and then alive again, Harington's character, Jon Snow, ventured with the Night's Watch beyond the wall and into the vast winter lands in the beginning of ""Game of Thrones"" Season 2. Soon enough, he found himself alone in the wilderness with his recent capture, a wilding girl by the name of Ygritte (Rose Leslie). And, well, you know the rest of the story. It turns out that the tundra setting fueled a connection between Harington and Leslie, transforming the on-screen Jon Snow-Ygritte romance into a real-life love story. When asked in a recent Vogue Italia interview about his best ""Game of Thrones"" memory, Harington made our collective hearts swoon with a response that we plan to recite verbatim on our wedding day regardless of the wishes of our future spouse. “The three weeks in Iceland when we were shooting the second season,"" he said. ""Because the country is beautiful, because the Northern Lights are magical, and because it was there that I fell in love.""He added, “If you’re already attracted to someone, and then they play your love interest in the show, it becomes very easy to fall in love.""Rumors about their relationship swirled for years before the pair made their official red carpet debut together at the Olivier Awards in April 2016. Harington and Leslie were first linked in 2012 and reportedly dated for a short time before splitting. But the two still remained friends after the break up, until they were spotted kissing earlier this year.Finally, a happy ""Game of Thrones"" ending. "

On Thursday, the two actresses both attended an event in Los Angeles celebrating the fashions of ""Alice Through the Looking Glass,"" Hathaway's latest film, and posed together for a picture so chic it belongs in the pages of Runway. Hathaway's appearance marks her first public debut since giving birth to her son, Jonathan Rosebanks Shulman, less than two months ago. The new mom, stunning in a black-and-white floral getup, attended the soirée with husband and fellow actor Adam Shulman in tow, posing for pictures and mingling with other celebs. The Oscar winner now has more than film credits in common with Blunt, who is currently pregnant with her second baby. She and husband John Krasinski welcomed their first child, Hazel, in 2014. The ""Into the Woods"" actress donned a simple black jumpsuit and bowtie heels for the event and walked the stone (?) carpet with Krasinski in style. The two have clearly developed their keen fashion eye since ""Devil Wears Prada"" was released in 2006, but we have one bone to pick with Hathaway. Florals? For spring? Groundbreaking. "

In some of his scientific papers, Hilborn failed to disclose industry funding, Greenpeace alleged.Hilborn acknowledged receiving the $3.56 million in funding, but said the figure includes money from Alaskan community groups that depend on fishing. Greenpeace cited is a 2006 paper published in the Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences on the orange roughy in New Zealand, which said the fish population needed no changes in fishery management. Hilborn failed to disclose $58,000 in funding from the New Zealand Seafood Industry Council around the time of the study, Greenpeace said.Greenpeace also pointed to a 2007 article in the journal Ecosystems, which said current fishing management was working in some places, but not in others.

He said he acknowledges funders of research that is the main subject of each paper.Industry funding, he said, helps support student and staff salaries, and pays for field expenses.Hilborn said more of his funding has come from environmental foundations than from industry, including the Society for Conservation Biology, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Defense Fund.""I am a vocal advocate for where marine conservation has worked, and identifying where it is not working,"" Hilborn said.""In fact, it is in the financial interest of fishing communities and industries to find solutions that are sustainable and provide for healthy stocks into the future,"" he wrote on his blog.

Industry funding of scientific research has stirred significant debate in recent years.

Some scientific journals, including some that have published Hilborn's papers, have created or toughened policies for disclosure of that funding.UPDATE: June 8 -- The University of Washington and the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences both concluded that Hilborn properly disclosed his funding sources. Additionally, the university said he didn't violate its policies on conflicts of interest or outside work."

Hilborn should have disclosed in that paper that he was receiving funding from Trident, Peter Pan, the New Zealand Seafood Industry Council and the Bering Sea Fishermen's Association, Greenpeace said.Hilborn argued in his blog post that if he had to disclose every group that contributed to his research on every paper, the list would be ""as long as some of the papers."" He said he acknowledges funders of research that is the main subject of each paper.Industry funding, he said, helps support student and staff salaries, and pays for field expenses.Hilborn said more of his funding has come from environmental foundations than from industry, including the Society for Conservation Biology, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Defense Fund.""I am a vocal advocate for where marine conservation has worked, and identifying where it is not working,"" Hilborn said.""In fact, it is in the financial interest of fishing communities and industries to find solutions that are sustainable and provide for healthy stocks into the future,"" he wrote on his blog. ""And funding from these groups should be considered part of an inclusive, transparent and honest research process.""Hilborn’s work challenging the claims that marine ecosystems are being depleted by overfishing has drawn the scorn of conservation groups and other scientists for years. ""The major threat to sustainable jobs, food, recreational opportunity and revenue from U.S. marine fisheries is no longer overfishing, but underfishing,"" Hilborn wrote in a 2013 testimony submitted to Congress. Industry funding of scientific research has stirred significant debate in recent years. A 2015 New York Times report exposed scientists backed by Coke for downplaying the link between soda and obesity. But as public funding for science declines, researchers are turning to industry and other groups for financial support. Some scientific journals, including some that have published Hilborn's papers, have created or toughened policies for disclosure of that funding.UPDATE: June 8 -- The University of Washington and the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences both concluded that Hilborn properly disclosed his funding sources. Additionally, the university said he didn't violate its policies on conflicts of interest or outside work."

20,POLITICS,Friday Talking Points -- Our 'Dopey Donald' Contest,"Chris Weigant, ContributorPolitical writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/friday-talking-points_b_9964940.html,"Pretty much every pundit in the mainstream media got down on their knees and thanked a recent poll which showed Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton neck-and-neck in three key swing states this week, because they truly want this gravy train to continue.",2016-05-14,"CHARLESTON, WV - MAY 5: Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump wears a coal miner's protective hat while addressing his supporters during a rally at the Charleston Civic Center on May 5, 2016 in Charleston, WV.

It just seems appropriate, somehow. Maybe because it's Friday the 13th? For whatever reason, silliness seems like the place to begin (and end) this week. Because, after this silly start, we're going to end this column with a contest to come up with the best playground taunt to call Donald Trump -- and you can't get much sillier than that!There was both some sad news and some amusing news from the internet recently, so let's get the sad news out of the way first. There will be no ""RSS Boaty McBoatface."" The British government announced that after it had held an online contest to name its new polar research vessel, the will of the online voters would be ignored. ""Boaty McBoatface"" won in a landslide, but the vessel will not be christened the RSS Boaty after all. Instead, in a massively disappointing downgrade, one of the robot probe ships on board the research vessel will get the name instead. Our favorite tidbit from this story: one of the other rejected names was: ""RSS It's Bloody Cold Here,"" which we feel would also have been a great name for a polar research vessel.The amusing news from the internet this week was the announcement that a new dating site will attempt to match up Americans fleeing their country (after Donald Trump wins the presidency) with lovely (but lonely) Canadians. Its name is ""MapleMatch.com,"" and its slogan is: ""Make dating great again."" The site also helpfully explains: ""Maple Match makes it easy for Americans to find the ideal Canadian partner to save them from the unfathomable horror of a Trump presidency."" This could become wildly popular, say about mid-November. We hope it won't, of course, but it's good to know someone is paving the way, just in case.In other silly news, the circus came to Washington D.C. Well, not really -- it was just an overhyped meeting between Donald Trump and Paul Ryan, but the media went absolutely bonkers over covering it. This was so over-the-top that the media themselves had to sheepishly cover the story of how ridiculous their own coverage efforts were. Life imitating art, or something.Pretty much every pundit in the mainstream media got down on their knees and thanked a recent poll which showed Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton neck-and-neck in three key swing states this week, because they truly want this gravy train to continue. If the election becomes an absolute blowout for Clinton (something we pondered earlier this week), then it would become boring -- and nobody in the media ever wants to see ""boring"" in the same sentence as ""Donald Trump.""This was pointed out by a man who otherwise seems to be losing his mind this week, former Reagan official Bruce Bartlett (more on his craziness in a moment). In the midst of gleefully applauding the destruction of his own political party, Bartlett took a few interesting shots at the media in general, tweeting: ""Until the very last minute the media will maintain that the race for president is close in order to keep people interested,"" and following it up with: ""My guess is that around November 1 the mainstream media will suddenly notice that Trump is nuts and launch an all-out assault on him."" It's hard to say he's wrong, really, knowing how the political media normally operates.In other crazy Republican news, the mills of justice grind slow, but sometimes they grind the right person to dust. That's our conclusion, at any rate, after hearing that Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore has been suspended from the bench by a judicial inquiry commission, over his absolute refusal to follow the United States Supreme Court's ruling on gay marriage. Moore ""flagrantly disregarded and abused his authority as the chief administrative officer of Alabama's judicial branch,"" the commission reported as it levied six charges of violating judicial ethics against him. When the process is complete, Moore could be removed from the bench altogether. Astoundingly, if this happens it will be the second time Moore has had to be kicked out from his post. This is the same guy who insisted on displaying a stone monument to the Ten Commandments, back in 2003. But since the position is an elected one, we fully expect that even after getting booted from office twice, Alabama voters will likely send him right back, at some future point.Before we move along to our awards and our talking points (complete with our contest to come up with the best anti-Trump playground taunt!), we've got one final silly item to address. Hey, it's been that kind of week.Budweiser has just announced that they're renaming their beer ""America"" for the next few months. You just can't make this stuff up, folks! Obviously Trump is beginning to have an influence even outside the world of politics.Now, personally, we haven't touched a Budweiser in years, since we actually possess taste buds (""this bud's for tasting!""). Budweiser is precisely the beer Canadians think of when they tell the following joke (warning: adult language is an inescapable part of this joke):""Why is drinking American beer like having sex in a canoe, eh?""Taste aside, however, we have another reason for not drinking Budweiser. It was revealed, during the height of the War On Weed in California that Budweiser was underwriting the ""Campaign Against Marijuana Planting,"" to the tune of millions of dollars. They pledged five cents of every dollar made in the state to the CAMP effort, and that's when millions of Californians permanently stopped drinking Budweiser.Now that they've renamed their product ""America,"" the jokes just write themselves. I mean, really, this is like a bad comedy movie or something. Anyone up for a six-pack of America? Will ""tossing your cookies"" become ""upchucking America""? Will shotgunning America become outlawed, since it could be considered treasonous? Inquiring minds want to know.With Trump as the Republican Party's nominee, we are all clearly through the looking glass now, folks. Look for more reality to imitate bad satire in the upcoming months, because we predict there'll be a lot more idiocy to come, shortly. But enough silliness, let's get on with our political awards instead.We have two Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week awards to hand out this week, because we couldn't see downgrading either one to the level of a mere Honorable Mention. Both, in different ways, were worthy of the full MIDOTW, we felt. The first goes to President Barack Obama, for taking another step towards bending the arc of history in the right direction.It's hard to even remember now, but President Obama actually got a lot of heat in his first term for moving too slowly on the issue of gay rights. It even got to the point where major gay rights donors were threatening to withhold their donations if he didn't start moving faster on their agenda.Obama, obviously, is going to go down in history as the president who did more for gay rights than any other -- probably before and after his term in office. The end of the road is obviously to add LGBT definitions to federal civil rights laws, so their basic civil rights are just as protected as people of different races, religions, and ethnic origins. That will likely not take place until Congress is Democratic once again, so Obama won't get credit for this final victory, but when you look at how far gay rights have come in the last eight years, it is nothing short of downright astounding.Obama furthered this legacy this week, making changes in federal regulations to protect transgender people in two major ways. Since the Supreme Court ended the fight over gay marriage, the battlelines have shifted towards transgendered issues. Obama's Justice Department is forcefully challenging reactionary laws in places like North Carolina, and the next fight will likely happen over school bathrooms. This week, Obama aggressively staked out the federal government's position, so there'll be a lot of skirmishes fought during the upcoming election at the local level in school districts across the country. By being pro-active on the issue, Obama is getting out in front of these inevitable political frays, which is why he fully deserves another MIDOTW for his leadership.However, our second MIDOTW goes to a Democrat who is fighting to get the Obama administration to do the right thing, and live up to the promises of how wonderfully transparent things were supposed to be under Obama.Former Senator Bob Graham is pushing very hard to get the censored 28 pages of the official government report on 9/11 released to the public. Graham served on the congressional Joint Inquiry committee which looked into the 9/11 attacks, and knows what the 28 pages have to say about Saudi Arabia's possible involvement in either funding or assisting the attackers. Saudi government officials have even been implicated by some, so it is important that the public know about this (since Saudi Arabia is usually described as ""America's closest ally in the region"").Graham lays out four unanswered questions in an opinion piece he wrote this week which urges the Obama administration to reveal the 28 pages:Did the hijackers have foreign support? If so, who provided it?These are not questions asked by some conspiracy theorist on the internet. These questions are posed by someone who already knows the answers (but who is sworn to secrecy and cannot publicly reveal them).Bob Graham is right. The American public deserves to know what is in those 28 pages. American foreign policy towards Saudi Arabia needs examination and re-evaluation, to put it mildly. The only way that is going to happen is if the truth is revealed to the public.The White House swears it'll make a decision by June. Bob Graham is fighting hard to convince Obama to live up to his campaign promises of transparency. It has been a decade and a half since the attacks happened, and it is high time the American people knew everything his committee discovered. For his ceaseless efforts to make this happen, Bob Graham wins his second Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week (his first was way back in FTP [78]).[Congratulate President Barack Obama via the White House contact page, to let him know you appreciate his efforts. Bob Graham is a private citizen, and it is our standing policy not to provide contact information for such people, sorry.]We're not going to hand out a Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week this week, instead we're going to create a Most Disappointing Pundit Of The Week award instead. We realize we're going to have to use these new MDPOTW awards very sparingly, because otherwise we'd be handing them out by the dozen, each and every week. But this week in particular was notable for the continuing chorus of ""Mea culpa!"" echoing through the halls of just about every news organization around, as the reality sinks in that Donald Trump is indeed the 2016 Republican nominee.The entire mainstream press corps pretty much completely screwed the pooch on covering Donald Trump, right up until about last week. The circus atmosphere (of their own creation) blinded them to the reality, to be blunt.It's entirely fitting that a fake pundit created specifically to be pure satire has a better record this year than people like Nate Silver, who absolutely refused to believe what his own poll numbers were telling him about Trump for far too long. Carl ""The Dig"" Diggler, a fictional character created as a parody of horserace ""journalists,"" called 77 out of 87 primary races correctly -- an astounding record of being right 89 percent of the time. Carl was ""predicated on being myopic, vain and -- frankly -- wrong,"" but his predictions turned out to be better than those of most of the professional pundits out there. That, more than anything else, sums up the kind of year it's been. The comedians have been better than journalists in predicting reality. An example of Carl's deep thoughts: ""Wisconsinites are mostly a simple people. They eat their three lunches, kiss their often enormous children on their often featureless faces, and go to church so they can pray for the 2 Broke Girls."" And yet, Carl was right 89 percent of the time. The whole article on the ruse is worth reading, because it is the most brutally accurate scathing indictment about how everyone else got everything wrong this year that we've yet read.Back in the real world of punditry, the respected Dana Milbank of the Washington Post ate one of his own columns this week. No, that's not a metaphor -- he physically consumed a page of newsprint. Milbank was making good on a promise he made back in October, when he ran a column titled ""Trump Will Lose Or I Will Eat This Column,"" where he reassured his readers that Trump simply was not going to become the Republican nominee, because he said so. At the same exact time, we were trying to point out the cold fact that Trump was still doing a lot better than anyone else, to anyone who would listen to what the actual data indicated:The pundit world has been trumpeting the fall of Donald Trump for quite a while now, and in the past few weeks they've been joyously pointing out that Trump's poll numbers have fallen for the first time. What this fails to acknowledge is that Trump is still leading the pack, and still has poll numbers any of the other candidates would kill for.... While most pundits breathlessly await that one gaffe that will take down Donald Trump forever, I'm paying more attention to Carson and Fiorina -- because I think it equally likely that one (or both) of them could implode spectacularly at some point, given their inexperience at politics. The rest of the media is already writing Donald Trump's political obituary, but methinks that's a little premature. He's still leading the race, after all -- just not as comfortably as he used to.Milbank, to his credit, did actually eat his column. But our very first MDPOTW goes to Ben White at CNBC, who made a similar promise, back in July. From his confident article:Donald Trump is not going to be the next president of the United States. This reporter is already on record pledging to eat a bag of rusty nails if the real estate tycoon with the high hair manages to snag the GOP nomination, much less takes down likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton next fall.White had plenty of soothing conventional wisdom for nervous Americans, about how Trump's numbers ""would dwindle following the debates."" You know, the usual inside-the-Beltway cocktail party chatter:For those who think Trump has a real shot at winning the nomination, a little history lesson is in order. Republican primary voters often flirt with charismatic, fringe candidates but in the end almost always come home to the next-in-line, establishment figure. Think George W. Bush, John McCain and Mitt Romney.Ben White wins the very first MDPOTW this week, for not following Dana Milbank's brave lead in living up to your promises. In print, White stated that he would ""eat a bag of rusty nails."" We have yet to see him actually sit down and do so. While we would advise him to at least get a tetanus shot before doing so, we do think it important that anyone calling themselves a journalist should either keep their own promises made in print, or else retire permanently from the job of holding politicians accountable for the promises they make. Put up or shut up, in other words. Milbank put up. Ben White, so far, has not. Maybe this will make him think twice about making such rash predictions in the future, at the very least.[We're not going to provide Ben White's contact information at CNBC, because he is neither in office nor even a politician. So you'll have to look it up yourself, if you'd like to let him know what you think of his inaction on the promise he made.]Volume 391 (5/13/16)As the general election campaign truly gets underway, we've been avoiding directing our talking points at Donald Trump, mostly because this field has been so crowded with Republicans badmouthing their own party's nominee. We couldn't hope to ever reach the scathing levels of what Lindsey Graham has been saying (just as one example). But this week, we have to gear up for what is likely going to be a very long and nasty campaign.Other than our first talking point, we're devoting the rest to ideas for how to attack Trump. We only included one surreal one, and only one from a fellow Republican. And then in the last one, we're announcing a contest to see who can come up with the best playground taunt for Donald Trump, just because. Hey, we've got six months of this to look forward to, so we're all going to have to pace ourselves. Too, too funny, MitchWe had intended to devote all of these to Trump, but this one was just too juicy an opportunity to pass up.""Mitch McConnell seems to be trying his hand at being a comedian. This week, on the floor of the Senate, he said to his fellow Republican senators, quote:Some have said because it is an election year, you can't do much. I'd like to remind everyone: We've had a regularly scheduled election in this country every two years since 1788, right on time. I've heard people say, 'Well, we can't do it because we have an election next year.' And people have said, 'We can't do whatever it is because we have an election this year.' It is not an excuse not to do our work.Unquote. This is either his attempt at comedy or else he is more clueless than he normally looks. Funny how the election is 'not an excuse to not do our work' for everything other than actually doing your job by holding confirmation hearings and a vote on the president's Supreme Court nominee, isn't it? If Mitch McConnell really wants to become a comedian, perhaps he should ask for some tips from Senator Al Franken, because this was a pretty weak attempt at humor -- unless, of course, it was just sheer and blatant hypocrisy."" Bruce Bartlett losing his marbles?Bruce Bartlett is not the only Republican currently going off the deep end, but he is perhaps the most amusing, these days.""Now that Donald Trump is the Republican nominee for president, some Republicans are just flat-out losing it. Bruce Bartlett, a man who once worked for none other than Ronald Reagan, is excited that Trump will be the GOP nominee, because he thinks it will hasten the end of the Republican Party -- a group that Bartlett now refers to as (you'll have to excuse me for this): 'wankers.' Bartlett not only calls Trump 'the surest path to complete and total destruction of the Republican Party as we know it,' but also gleefully tweeted: 'With Cruz out and Trump guaranteed the wanker nomination, Phase 1 of my plan to destroy the wanker party is now complete.' You can almost hear the evil-genius cackling in the background, can't you? Bartlett does have a few good points to make, such as: 'All wankers who oppose Trump should prove they opposed Sarah Palin in 2008 or else they have zero credibility,' as well as: 'If Newt Gingrich is Trump's VP he will be worse than Dick Cheney at filling the president's head with terrible ideas.' But he seems to be strangely eager to see his own party destroyed, don't you think? I mean, while other Republicans may be thinking such things privately, Bartlett is openly predicting: 'Does anyone believe the wankers will come out of their convention more unified? I think not.' Grab hold of your seats, folks, because this rollercoaster ride has just gotten started!"" Get naked to protest Trump!No, seriously.""Photographer Spencer Tuck, famous for his landscapes filled with nude bodies, is looking for 100 women to pose nude in Cleveland, during the Republican convention this year. The women will all be holding up mirrors in an attempt to shine some light on the Republican convention, which seems entirely fitting. So if you have nothing better to do on July 17, if you're comfortable with your body becoming part of an artistic piece, and if you'd love to make a bold anti-Trump statement, Tuck wants to hear from you! We look forward to seeing the results of what could be the best street theater of the entire convention."" He's not as rich as he says he isOK, the rest of these are direct talking points for Hillary Clinton (or her surrogates) to consider attacking Trump with. Clinton better have some zingers ready, because she's definitely going to need them during the upcoming brutal campaign season. These are just the first that sprang to mind, really.""Donald Trump is quite obviously not as rich as he claims. This is really the only reason he is so scared to release a single tax return, because then it would be painfully obvious to all just how much Trump lies about his wealth. Audits don't go back to the beginning of time, so why hasn't he at least released a tax return from before the period he says he's being audited for? I'll tell you -- because he isn't worth ten billion dollars now, he wasn't worth whatever he said he was back then, and he really, really doesn't want the American people to know it. That's why he's so afraid to release a tax return, because it would show people what a complete blowhard he truly is."" Speaking of being afraid...Fear grips the countryside, over in Republicanland.""Ever since Donald Trump won Indiana (and the nomination), other Republicans have faced a stark choice. Either swallow their fear and support him, or denounce their own party's nominee. Republicans are caught between being afraid of Donald Trump and being afraid of Trump's voters. Most of them know, deep down, that Trump is not presidential material, but at the same time they envy his fervent support among the GOP base. What we're about to see is a whole lot of Republicans attempting to run with Trump and away from Trump at the same time. I don't ever remember such a bizarre situation, where Republican politicians are essentially afraid of their own voters. Even the Tea Party wasn't this bad, when you think about it."" Establishment paper tigerThis also needs pointing out, just to rub salt in their wounds.""For a long time, the so-called Establishment Republicans have been a force to be reckoned with in the GOP. The Establishment was to be feared, as it controlled the party's levers of power. But Donald Trump has just proven how toothless they really are. They poured millions of dollars into attempts to stop Trump, to no avail. They were caught flat-footed when he secured the nomination. All they've done is mutter about some mythic third-party conservative candidate, without actually doing any of the groundwork that would have made such a thing possible. Now more and more of them are kowtowing to Trump, in the hopes of being re-elected. It's really pathetic to see the powerlessness of the supposedly omnipotent Republican Establishment laid bare in such brutal fashion. I guess they were nothing more than a paper tiger all along."" Dingbat, anyone?OK, as promised, we've saved our contest for last. We were prompted to create this contest by an article about how Team Clinton was test-driving ""Dangerous Donald"" as a playground taunt to level at Trump. The article expresses some skepticism that this will work, and we tend to agree. So what label can you come up with for Hillary Clinton (and all the Clintonistas) to use for the next six months?We'll start the suggestions off with a few of our own, to get the playground ball rolling (as it were). Trump has reached into the land of cartoons to come up with ""Goofy"" as a label for Elizabeth Warren, so we thought ""Dopey Donald"" might be a good comeback. Of course, this one would have to get tweeted from Warren to be the most effective. Or how about ""Dingbat Donald""? The idea is to ridicule Trump, which ""Dangerous Donald"" doesn't really achieve. Get under his skin. Make him tear his hair out (now that would be worth watching!). The last one we came up with (before we open up the comments for your entries) is a bit long-winded, but it does have a nice 50's rock-n-roll ring to it: Trumpa-Lumpa-Ding-Dong. Can you do better than this? Sure you can!

The traditional mold of a uniformly pale and willowy classical ballet ensemble is gradually being broken, not just by the vanguard Dance Theatre of Harlem and Ballet Black, but by companies like Ballet Memphis, Rambert Dance, and Birmingham Royal Ballet. Misty Copeland's leap into American mainstream consciousness has lit a rocket under ticket sales, inspired the creation of a Barbie doll in her image, and prompted at least one television announcer to admire the ""Misty Copeland-esque moves"" of a leading wide receiver in college football. Copeland's advocacy, her travels to Kenya to work with young dance students, her mentorship role in Project Plié, American Ballet Theatre's program to nurture young dance students of color, have all spotlighted for the broad public what was once a concern debated in relatively small circles: why aren't there more black ballet dancers?   Today, with more training opportunities available to talented young black students, filling the pipeline for these programs remains a challenge. How do you spot talent and recruit students when they may have no idea what ballet is? Unlike sport, which has long saturated mass media, ballet is still trying to shed its elitist reputation as the art form of kings who, pre-French Revolution, codified its vocabulary and used it to instill courtly manners.  Among the handful who are on a mission to diversify ballet's stages, one remarkable teacher zeroes in on that codification as a boon: ""Ballet is an international language - you can take ballet class anywhere and we are already united in our language,"" contends Kristine Elliott, former American Ballet Theatre soloist who has traveled to South Africa for the past 12 years to teach in the townships around Cape Town and Johannesburg. Several of the young students she has mentored have gone on to make extraordinary lives for themselves, both in South Africa and outside the country - chalking up more wins for diversity on ballet stages, and lifting themselves and their families out of poverty.  The indefatigable Elliott - who once performed on world stages with Rudolf Nureyev and Mikhail Baryshnikov, and whose leading roles include a memorable Giselle with Kevin McKenzie (now artistic director of American Ballet Theatre) - created and ran the ballet program at Stanford University before founding the Gugulethu Project, in partnership with local dance schools in South Africa, and with the support of the Flora Family Foundation and others. The Gugulethu Project (film by Ben Pierce):On her first trip to the country in 2004, Elliott taught for a program called Dance For All, which serves underprivileged youth in the South African townships, as well as for the University of Cape Town's School of Dance and the associated Cape Town City Ballet Company. On that trip, I witnessed firsthand how classical ballet training can bring about social change in a country where widespread poverty, violence and crime still pose serious threats to children and teens. The principles inherent in the study of ballet, including self-discipline, perseverance, respect for the self and the integrity of the body, are all transferable into the daily lives of the students who are fortunate enough to be involved in such training. - Kristine ElliottElliott has since returned annually from her home base in northern California. Her Gugulethu Project sends talented South African students to study in the U.S. and brings American choreographers, teachers, and dancers to teach in South Africa. ""This is not just a mission to train young dancers - it's an exchange, a sharing of traditions. I teach, but I learn a great deal, too, from this project,"" says Elliott.She understands how arts education has been integral to the healing of South Africa post-apartheid. In addition to giving people a way of working through trauma, immersion in the arts has given impoverished children a way to imagine a better future. It has equipped them with life skills, and helped to direct them away from destructive behavior.With an assist from the Gugulethu Project, a handful of youngsters with innate talent and tenacity have broadened their horizons and forged fulfilling career paths.Seeing them succeed and, in many cases, return to their communities to act as mentors for the next generation of youngsters, has been an inspirational learning process, and one that I look forward to continuing. - Kristine Elliott Mbulelo Ndabeni danced in Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake, was a member of the Rambert Dance Company in London, and now spearheads his own troupe in London, N'da Dance Company.

Both Richard Gibson and Amy Seiwert created ballets especially for the South African dancers to perform back in South Africa. American schools that have offered Gugulethu students scholarships include the Academy of Ballet and LINES Ballet School in San Francisco, Zohar School of Dance in Palo Alto, Kaatsbaan International Dance Center in New York, and the Alvin Ailey School in New York, while Stanford University created a residency in 2009 for four South African dance students. Kristine Elliott's journey through the dance world has been an uncommon one indeed, and she has brought many along with her on this joyous and rewarding ride.A LEAP class at the Cape Academy of Performing Arts:A children's class at the Zama Dance School in Gugulethu (filmed by Andrew Warth):"

Maybe you have a great boss who gives you the freedom to be creative, rewards you for going the extra mile, and helps you to reach your career goals.Maybe you have none of the above and are updating your résumé as we speak.It's pretty incredible how often you hear managers complaining about their best employees leaving, and they really do have something to complain about--few things are as costly and disruptive as good people walking out the door.But managers tend to blame their turnover problems on everything under the sun while ignoring the crux of the matter: people don't leave jobs; they leave managers.Bad management does not discriminate based on salary or job title. A Fortune 500 executive team can experience more dissatisfaction and turnover than the baristas at a local coffee shop. The more demanding your job is and the less control you have over what you do, the more likely you are to suffer. A study by the American Psychological Association found that people whose work meets both these criteria are more likely to experience exhaustion, poor sleep, anxiety, and depression.The sad thing is that this suffering can easily be avoided. All that's required is a new perspective and some extra effort on the manager's part to give employees autonomy and make their work feel less demanding. To get there, managers must understand what they're doing to kill morale. The following practices are the worst offenders, and they must be abolished if you're going to hang on to good employees.Overworking people. Nothing burns good employees out quite like overworking them. It's so tempting to work the best people hard that managers frequently fall into this trap. Overworking good employees is perplexing for them as it makes them feel as if they're being punished for their great performance. Overworking employees is also counterproductive. New research from Stanford showed that productivity per hour declines sharply when the workweek exceeds 50 hours, and productivity drops off so much after 55 hours that you don't get anything out of working more. Talented employees will take on a bigger workload, but they won't stay if their job suffocates them in the process. Raises, promotions, and title-changes are all acceptable ways to increase workload. If managers simply increase workload because people are talented, without changing a thing, these employees will seek another job that gives them what they deserve.Holding people back. As an employee, you want to bring value to your job, and you do so with a unique set of skills and experience. So how is it that you can do your job so well that you become irreplaceable? This happens when managers sacrifice your upward mobility for their best interests. If you're looking for your next career opportunity, and your boss is unwilling to let you move up the ladder, your enthusiasm is bound to wane. Taking away opportunities for advancement is a serious morale killer.Management may have a beginning, but it certainly has no end. When blessed with a talented employee, it's the manager's job to keep finding areas in which they can improve to expand their skill set and further their career. The most talented employees want feedback--more so than the less talented ones--and it's a manager's job to keep it coming. Otherwise, people grow bored and complacent.Playing the blame game. A boss who is too proud to admit a mistake or who singles out individuals in front of the group creates a culture that is riddled with fear and anxiety. It's impossible to bring your best to your work when you're walking on eggshells. Instead of pointing fingers when something goes wrong, good managers work collaboratively with their team and focus on solutions. They pull people aside to discuss slip-ups instead of publicly shaming them, and they're willing to accept responsibility for mistakes made under their leadership.Frequent threats of firing. Some managers use threats of termination to keep you in line and to scare you into performing better. This is a lazy and shortsighted way of motivating people. People who feel disposable are quick to find another job where they'll be valued and will receive the respect that they deserve.Not letting people pursue their passions. Talented employees are passionate. Providing opportunities for them to pursue their passions improves their productivity and job satisfaction, but many managers want people to work within a little box. These managers fear that productivity will decline if they let people expand their focus and pursue their passions. This fear is unfounded. Studies have shown that people who are able to pursue their passions at work experience flow, a euphoric state of mind that is five times more productive than the norm.Withholding praise. It's easy to underestimate the power of a pat on the back, especially with top performers who are intrinsically motivated. Everyone likes kudos, none more so than those who work hard and give their all. Managers need to communicate with their people to find out what makes them feel good (for some, it's a raise; for others, it's public recognition) and then to reward them for a job well done. With top performers, this will happen often if you're doing it right. This doesn't mean that managers need to praise people for showing up on time or working an eight-hour day--these things are the price of entry--but a boss who does not give praise to dedicated employees erodes their commitment to the job.Bringing It All TogetherIf managers want their best people to stay, they need to think carefully about how they treat them. While good employees are as tough as nails, their talent gives them an abundance of options. Managers need to make people want to work for them.What other mistakes kill morale?

We know intuitively when there is a situation, a possibility, to observe and hear life and people unedited, which can yield such fascinating results. Let me relate an experience we had recently.   We were visiting a place that we did not know at all, the new British Library near Saint Pancras Station in north London. (It was new to us because it opened in the '90s just as we were leaving for the States.) A real treasure, the Library doesn't look anything like a gem when you first see it, more like one of those Soviet mausoleums that we used to see on TV as the backdrop for May Day marches. But don't be off put by its appearance because there is beauty here, which validates architect Colin St John Wilson's assertion that ""the meaning lies in its use."" He has produced a building that really works internally. You enter and there is space. Tons of it. Very high ceilings and this monumental six-story bronze and glass tower that confronts you the moment you try and get your bearings. It contains the King's Library, 65,000 books acquired by King George III and later given to his son the Prince Regent later to become George IV. It is magnificent and the signature image for the whole building. Today the Library is the biggest in the world, which surprised me to discover as the Americans always make that claim for everything ever built. The collection includes the Magna Carta, (which I must say is a pretty untidy piece of work for something of such historic importance) along with the Papal Bull that annulled it almost instantly. The latter is a much better produced document although less democratic for sure (they just had more stylish scribes in Rome at that time.) There's Nelson Mandela's trial speech; Da Vinci's Notebook; the original Penny Black postage stamp of 1840 which you can just pull out of a wall for a really close up view; Jane Austen's writing table with a prim and proper copy of Persuasion in her own very neat hand contrasted with Ian Fleming's The Living Daylights the handwriting of which is perfectly dreadful. And for me that great example of courage and tragedy, Tyndale's Bible (in photo right), which led him to be tried and then burnt at the stake during the reign of Henry VIII for heresy, his offence being to translate the Bible from Latin into English, which obviously offended the Church's regime of ""authority, miracles and mystery,"" just as Dostoyevsky's Grand Inquisitor would have said.And I am only just skimming the surface of what the Library has on offer. It is heaven for the scholar and it is a paradise for every thinking living human being curious about our world and our great heritage. And it's all free.........So forgive the circuitous introduction, but it is relevant because on the day we visited the Library, there were streams and hordes of school kids being given every chance to develop their intellectual capacity and understanding of the world. And it was the kids' response to the place that suddenly captured our intense interest. The encounter happened in front of a large glass case. We found ourselves looking at an ancient and most beautifully illuminated version of the Quran displayed in its own case and open to a particular page. A group of children aged about 8 years old came over with their teacher to take a look and she asked them in a squeaky high voice:""So who knows what this is?"" ""It is the Quran,"" said a young boy of medium height wearing a heavy coat. ""And how do you know that?"" ""Because I read it every day."" At which point this particularly stupid teacher (that was my immediate assessment at least) just sort of walked off, leaving this boy with two of his friends. His friends said, ""Why do you want to be a Muslim then?"" ""I am a Muslim"" said in the most dignified and quiet way. ""But your religion is sick,"" and they said this almost by rote, certainly unthinkingly. It was a default comment and it was not meant to cause harm. ""But I am a Muslim."" ""Sick, sick, sick,"" they said as they wandered off trying to find their teacher, I imagine, leaving this very brave, noble young soul looking at the Quran.What came into our view almost immediately then was a group of eighth graders, all young men of colour who had just come from the audio section and were singing of all things, the ""Hallelujah Chorus"" from Handel's Messiah. They weren't sending it up; in fact they were singing it with gusto, with good intonation and with some delight. They found their teacher, a bright, youthful 40-something dressed in a kaftan who was obviously taking great delight in his students' rendition. It was all so accepting, so understanding, seeing the beauty in Handel whilst at the same time experiencing the beauty in the Muslim faith because they too looked with some interest at the illuminated Quran. This inspired a spousal discussion about the power of teachers to influence and provide messaging, but the message to us was without doubt heartening and hopeful. Then we wandered into ""Shakespeare in 10 Acts"", commemorating the 400th anniversary of the Bard's death with an exhibition celebrating his enormous influence. It was fascinating. Among the highlights, we saw some sketches, in what is purported to be Will's own hand, of a play that came to nothing based on the life of Sir Thomas More. Also the Folio from 1623 of his complete works, produced seven years after his death and at great expense by his close friends including Ben Jonson. We are in their debt as they preserved virtually everything that now sustains our experience of Shakespeare. Best of all, there was the original Quarto (a kind of cheap paper-back version of some of the plays) from 1603. It was open to what was apparently Shakespeare's first go at Hamlet. So just try this for truly terrible writing:To be, or not to be, I there's the point,  To Die, to sleepe, is that all? I all:  No, to sleepe, to dreame, I mary there it goes,  For in that dreame of death, when wee awake,  And borne before an euerlasting Iudge,  From whence no passenger euer retur'nd,  The vndiscouered country, at whose sight  The happy smile, and the accursed damn'd.

Which pusles the braine, and doth confound the sence,  Which makes vs rather beare those euilles we haue,  Than flie to others that we know not of.

Maybe, just maybe, we should not have been overhearing him as he tried to get this one just right. It made me wonder what Will would have made of our contemporary maelstrom, our ability to be tolerant and, in turn, murderous of ideas and peoples, our sense of beauty and reverence for our culture contrasted with our promotion of extremism and destruction for other cultures. His intuitive analysis of the human psyche would perhaps have recognized a few more contradictions and paradoxes over the last 400 years.

We found ourselves looking at an ancient and most beautifully illuminated version of the Quran displayed in its own case and open to a particular page. A group of children aged about 8 years old came over with their teacher to take a look and she asked them in a squeaky high voice:""So who knows what this is?"" ""It is the Quran,"" said a young boy of medium height wearing a heavy coat. ""And how do you know that?"" ""Because I read it every day."" At which point this particularly stupid teacher (that was my immediate assessment at least) just sort of walked off, leaving this boy with two of his friends. His friends said, ""Why do you want to be a Muslim then?"" ""I am a Muslim"" said in the most dignified and quiet way. ""But your religion is sick,"" and they said this almost by rote, certainly unthinkingly. It was a default comment and it was not meant to cause harm. ""But I am a Muslim."" ""Sick, sick, sick,"" they said as they wandered off trying to find their teacher, I imagine, leaving this very brave, noble young soul looking at the Quran.What came into our view almost immediately then was a group of eighth graders, all young men of colour who had just come from the audio section and were singing of all things, the ""Hallelujah Chorus"" from Handel's Messiah. They weren't sending it up; in fact they were singing it with gusto, with good intonation and with some delight. They found their teacher, a bright, youthful 40-something dressed in a kaftan who was obviously taking great delight in his students' rendition. It was all so accepting, so understanding, seeing the beauty in Handel whilst at the same time experiencing the beauty in the Muslim faith because they too looked with some interest at the illuminated Quran. This inspired a spousal discussion about the power of teachers to influence and provide messaging, but the message to us was without doubt heartening and hopeful. Then we wandered into ""Shakespeare in 10 Acts"", commemorating the 400th anniversary of the Bard's death with an exhibition celebrating his enormous influence. It was fascinating. Among the highlights, we saw some sketches, in what is purported to be Will's own hand, of a play that came to nothing based on the life of Sir Thomas More. Also the Folio from 1623 of his complete works, produced seven years after his death and at great expense by his close friends including Ben Jonson. We are in their debt as they preserved virtually everything that now sustains our experience of Shakespeare. Best of all, there was the original Quarto (a kind of cheap paper-back version of some of the plays) from 1603. It was open to what was apparently Shakespeare's first go at Hamlet. So just try this for truly terrible writing:To be, or not to be, I there's the point,  To Die, to sleepe, is that all? I all:  No, to sleepe, to dreame, I mary there it goes,  For in that dreame of death, when wee awake,  And borne before an euerlasting Iudge,  From whence no passenger euer retur'nd,  The vndiscouered country, at whose sight  The happy smile, and the accursed damn'd.  But for this, the ioyfull hope of this,  Whol'd beare the scornes and flattery of the world,  Scorned by the right rich, the rich curssed of the poore?  The widow being oppressed, the orphan wrong'd,  The taste of hunger, or a tirants raigne,  And thousand more calamities besides,  To grunt and sweate vnder this weary life,  When that he may his full Quietus make,  With a bare bodkin, who would this indure,  But for a hope of something after death?  Which pusles the braine, and doth confound the sence,  Which makes vs rather beare those euilles we haue,  Than flie to others that we know not of.  I that, O this conscience makes cowardes of vs all,  Lady in thy orizons, be all my sinnes remembred.It's so terrible because we know how good it was to become. Maybe, just maybe, we should not have been overhearing him as he tried to get this one just right. It made me wonder what Will would have made of our contemporary maelstrom, our ability to be tolerant and, in turn, murderous of ideas and peoples, our sense of beauty and reverence for our culture contrasted with our promotion of extremism and destruction for other cultures. His intuitive analysis of the human psyche would perhaps have recognized a few more contradictions and paradoxes over the last 400 years. And if he were with us now might have inspired another great tragedy or perhaps even a comedy."
26,QUEER VOICES,The Ongoing Battle Over Transgender Bathroom Access: The 'Problem' in Lieu of the Problem,"Anastasia Walker, ContributorEssayist, scholar, poet",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-ongoing-battle-over-t_b_9969856.html,Two bookending clashes between the Obama administration and conservatives over bathroom and facilities access made the week just ended a momentous one for transgender Americans.,2016-05-14,2016-05-14-1463256346-1585192-HuffPostblogimageProbleminLieu.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-14-1463256346-1585192-HuffPostblogimageProbleminLieu-thumb.jpg,"Two bookending clashes between the Obama administration and conservatives over bathroom and facilities access made the week just ended a momentous one for transgender Americans. On Monday, the United States Department of Justice exchanged lawsuits with North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory and his Republican cronies over the state's discriminatory ""solution in search of a problem"" known to the world as HB2. Then on Friday, the DOJ issued a joint statement with the United States Department of Education clarifying for schools across the country how to comply with Title IX where trans students' access to restrooms and locker rooms is concerned.Both federal actions provoked a lot of sabre rattling from the right. Responding to the DOJ's request not to implement HB2's restriction on bathroom access, McCrory et al. accused the department of ""baseless and blatant overreach"" in asserting that gender identity is a protected class under federal law. They reiterated their desire to protect ""privacy rights,"" and paraded out yet again the zombie fiction about men entering women's restrooms to engage in all sorts of nefarious doings. McCrory repeated many of these complaints after the release of Friday's joint DOJ-DOE statement. Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant, who signed a more sweeping discriminatory bill into law shortly after HB2 was passed, also chimed in, joining Tennessee Senator and chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Lamar Alexander in declaring the issue a matter ""better left to the states.""In the midst of all this, McCrory declared during a Monday press conference that he ""wholeheartedly"" supports ""fighting discrimination.""Where to begin?The North Carolina lawsuit's claim about the questionable status of gender identity as a protected class at the federal level is not wholly groundless. While both Title IX and Title VII, which covers discrimination in the workplace on the basis of ""sex,"" have recently been interpreted by the Obama administration to extend to gender identity as well, legal protections in other areas, notably housing and ""public accommodations"" like restaurants and retail outlets, exist primarily or solely at the state and local level as of now, and coverage is spotty. In rejecting the administration's interpretation of existing federal law, then, McCrory and his conservative comrades-in-arms across the country do have a little legal wiggle room. The larger question, of course, is what are they wiggling about?To repeat for the umpteenth time, there is no credible evidence whatsoever that transgender women - because where access to public facilities is concerned, we're the primary targets - pose any threat to cisgender women and girls.How about the highfalutin and suddenly fashionable phrase ""privacy rights""? According to the North Carolina lawsuit, it refers to people's ""expectation"" that they will ""encounter only other people of the same biological sex"" in public restrooms, locker rooms, etc. In other words, the right to ""privacy"" has nothing to do with people's safety - at least not the safety of cisgender women - but rather with their comfort. Or to put it more bluntly, we trans women should be made to sacrifice our dignity and risk getting the shit kicked out of us in the backs of men's rooms because we - or at least the idea of us - makes some people squirm.It would seem, then, that in doubling down on HB2, the self-professed supporter of ""fighting discrimination"" is fighting for the right to discriminate.Unsurprisingly, neither McCrory nor supporters of similar bills elsewhere see it that way. The North Carolina governor notes that HB2 doesn't prohibit state agencies or school boards from making ""accommodations"" for trans citizens by providing separate (but equal) facilities for us to use - thereby stigmatizing us by quarantining us from the general (cisgender) population, and pointing out to the bigots and bullies who to harass. Ultimately, though, the right-wing gender police don't seem to think there's any discrimination happening because they don't believe being transgender is a real thing. In the face of increasingly vociferous attestations from the medical community, affirmed unequivocally on Monday by DOJ Civil Rights Division Head Vanita Gupta, that ""transgender women are women,"" they repeatedly refer to us as ""men."" And what's wrong with making men use men's rooms?It would be easy to write off these ""bathroom bills"" as an instance of collective hysteria, or even as a bizarre legal fad. But as Samantha Michaels reported recently in Mother Jones, there's strong evidence that the push for their enactment is a well funded, nationally coordinated effort. Moreover, the fact that the conservative group which seems to be spearheading this push, the Alliance Defending Freedom, is simultaneously attacking Planned Parenthood and women's health care, suggests that all this fuss over bathroom use must be about more than easing the cares of the nation's womenfolk.So what wrong(s) is HB2 and its partners in crime-fighting ""really"" attempting to redress? We can approach this question by first considering what makes these bills an attractive means of combating whatever it is they're meant to combat. The simple answer is that besides being one area not yet protected by federal law (at least outside of schools and most places of employment), the issue of transgender bathroom use plays well among large segments of the population. If the threat posed by the predatory trans woman is (like the pedophilic gay man of yesteryear) pure fantasy, the fears that fantasy gives expression to are very real; and exploiting those fears by demonizing us has proven to be a very effective mobilizing tool.This begs two further questions: What are those fears? and Mobilized for what?To address the second question first, these bills have been widely linked to the conservative pushback against last year's Supreme Court decision on gay marriage as well as recent federal efforts to extend legal rights and protections to - and to urge civility and common decency in dealings with - LGBT folks. In essence, the bathroom bills are tactical maneuvers in a turf war between broadly conflicting value systems. The right is using them, in concert with assertions of states' rights and calls for respecting ""religious liberty,"" to marshal support for the larger goal of creating federal no-fly zones, ghettos of intolerance where existing attitudes - including those that discriminate against certain of the regions' citizens - may be left to fester (and victimize) in peace.Why the imaginary threat of the predatory trans woman serves this purpose so well has to do with the fears it encapsulates. At the heart of the ""turf war"" is another dystopic fantasy popular among members of what I'll call the conservative phallocracy: the fear that their influence is eroding on all fronts. Demographic changes, so the recipe reads, and the rise of cultural pluralism (aka ""political correctness"") that those changes have helped spur, are menacing the group's longstanding dominance at home. Stir in some truly intractable threats in the international and planetary spheres - terrorism, instability across the Middle East and the Maghreb, and a ballooning global population in the former case; increasingly dire warnings about the effects of climate change and environmental neglect in the case of the latter - and you have a perfect gumbo of apocalyptic paranoia. So while clamoring about federalism and religious freedom is at least buying some time domestically, the downplaying or outright denial of the science around global warming and environmental degradation, and absurd, even hysterical claims about building multi-billion dollar border walls and carpet bombing desert strongholds to find out ""if sand can glow in the dark,"" evince strong fears of impotence and futility.Cue the trans women.We're an easy outlet for this thwarted anger and anxiety because of our relative lack of legal protections and our marginal political, social, and economic status. But we're so useful as scapegoats, I think, because we seem to embody a primal source for these feelings. Seen as feminized men (rather than women), we're the very picture of lost virility, and thus ready receptacles for projected insecurities. More damningly still, because our decision to affirm who we are is viewed instead as the embracing of a degraded status, we become not merely fantasy objects of contempt, but criminally negligent citizens as well. At a time when the would-be wall builders and the carpet-bomber wannabes are proclaiming the need for virile men to take up their guns and fight the good fight to make America great again®, we trans women's denial of our God-given maleness, dangling between our legs at birth and duly documented on our birth certificates, is a treasonous dereliction of our ""natural"" duty - and as such, deserving of punishment.In the current legal and cultural climate, policing our bodily functions is a practicable measure for redressing the Wrong that is, ultimately, us. But make no mistake, the punishment that haters on the right desire for us is far greater. Viz. the persistent misgendering of us by McCrory, former presidential hopeful and ""miserable SOB"" Ted Cruz, and others of their ilk. Viz. the toxic trolling that dogs online discourse about trans issues, with its anonymous threats of GBH and frequent use of the pronoun ""it"" in reference to us. Viz. the occasional candor of lawmakers like Tennessee State Rep Richard Floyd, who in 2012 told a Chattanooga newspaper he would ""try to stomp a mudhole"" in any trans woman he found sharing a bathroom or dressing room with his wife or daughters.Let the punishment fit the crime. We exist - our transness must be denied. We speak - our voices must be silenced. We live - we must die.It's been observed that racism cannot be legislated out of existence. The same is true of transphobia and homophobia. But continuing to right legal and systemic inequities, it seems to me, is a prerequisite for a larger societal change of heart. We are a nation founded on, and defined by, a set of legal principles and political ideals. As such, possessing the same legal protections extended to our fellow citizens will bring those of us who are members of minority groups a long way towards the larger recognition that we desire, and deserve: to be seen as fully human."

The Iraqi Christian community has been devastated. Syria's civil war loosed the murderous Islamic State on Christians and others. Libya's disintegration opened the nation to IS fighters bent on killing anyone of the wrong faith.Also at risk are Egypt's Copts, who make up about ten percent of that country's population. Coptic Christians predate Islam and played an important role in Egypt's development. But they long suffered from discrimination and persecution. Under dictator Hosni Mubarak the U.S. State Department called the status of religious liberty ""poor"" and noted that Christians and Baha'is faced ""personal and collective discrimination, especially in government employment and their ability to build, renovate, and repair places of worship."" Moreover, explained State, the government ""sometimes arrested, detained, and harassed"" those ""whose beliefs and/or practices it deemed to deviate from mainstream Islamic beliefs and whose activities it alleged to jeopardize communal harmony."" At times state-controlled media and -funded mosques encouraged violence. Attacks on Copts were common and perpetrators rarely were prosecuted. Indeed, victims sometimes were arrested too. The government also failed to respond seriously to the kidnapping of Christian girls who were forced to marry Muslims.Even when the authorities did not actively persecute Copts, observed Michele Dunne of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, ""a prejudicial legal framework has created a permissive environment that allows Egyptian officials and private individuals to discriminate against Christians freely and with impunity."" As elsewhere in the Middle East, converts and Baha'is tended to be most at risk. Reported William Inboden of the Strauss Center for International Security and Law: ""Egyptian converts from Islam to Christianity, though very few in number, suffered particularly heinous treatment--including imprisonment and sadistic torture."" Dina Guiguis of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy blamed Mubarak's regime ""for creating the fertile ground on which pernicious and egregious sectarian violence has become routine."" Understandably, Mubarak's overthrow led Copts to hope for a freer and safer Egypt. But President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood failed to accept checks on executive authority, accommodate political opponents who feared centralization of power, and reassure those who feared the Brotherhood was determined to Islamize Egyptian society. Indeed, violent attacks on Copts increased. Morsi was not the only culprit. Responsible for many incidents were Salafists, who emerged as allies of the army against the Muslim Brotherhood. Moreover, reported the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, after the revolution ""military and security forces reportedly have used excessive force and live ammunition targeting Christian places of worship and Christian demonstrators."" In one infamous case the military, then headed by Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, shot down more than a score of Coptic protesters. As a result, USCIRF recommended that Egypt be designated a Country of Particular Concern.Two years ago al-Sisi overthrew Morsi and eventually became president. While the previous Coptic Pope Shenouda III was controversially connected to Mubarak, Pope Tawadros II publicly supported the coup and subsequently called al-Sisi a ""hero."" Coptic film critic Joseph Fahim said the revolt ""was a renewal of hope, a promise of a secular Egypt where political Islam will never have a say again. The then-field Marshall Sisi was no mere military leader; he was the great savior."" Alas, secular saviors rarely keep faith with Christians. This case was no different. The military used extreme brutality--killing hundreds of demonstrators on the streets of Cairo--to maintain control. But the church remained as vulnerable as it was visible, and found itself targeted by angry Islamists because of its high profile support for the military. Dozens of churches were destroyed. A priest at the Church of Two Saints in Alexandria, Father Mina Adel, told Breitbart that ""Most of our people are afraid"" and many were leaving.In January al-Sisi celebrated Christmas at a Coptic service and promised to rebuild churches that had been destroyed. He apologized for past inaction: ""This year everything will be fixed,"" he said. Some Copts, including in the U.S., appeared to take al-Sisi at his word and believed he would act as defender of the church. So far, however, the government has delivered more promises than actions. Mina Thabet of the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms complained that al-Sisi was no liberal and ""doesn't care about religious freedom."" Certainly he evidenced no interest prior to assembling support for the coup.Nor is the only problem attacks on churches (which have diminished). Egypt's blasphemy law is frequently deployed against Christians. In fact, the government never stopped targeting Copts. Fahim pointed out in July 2014: ""Copts, too, are not safe from the new government's oppressive measures. Two weeks ago, a 23-year-old Coptic teacher was sentenced to prison for six months for insulting Islam. On June 23, a Christian convert reporter was sentenced to five years in prison for allegedly reporting false information about discrimination against Copts. The following day, a 29-year-old Copt from Upper Egypt was given a five-year prison sentence for liking a Facebook page put up by a group of Christian converts--so much for the secular utopia we conjured in our imagination."" The State Department's most recent religious freedom report, from 2014, noted that Egypt's government did not recognize conversion from Islam, prosecuted people for religious defamation and blasphemy, and failed to respond to attacks on Christians. ""Accountability for previous sectarian crimes was uneven,"" noted State. Moreover, ""The government failed to prevent, investigate, or prosecute crimes targeting members of religious minority groups, which fostered a climate of impunity."" Last year's USCIRF annual report concluded: ""the Egyptian government has not adequately protected religious minorities, particularly Coptic Orthodox Christians and their property, from periodic violence. Discriminatory and repressive laws and policies that restrict freedom of thought, conscience, and religion or belief remain in place. Egyptian courts continue to prosecute, convict, and imprison Egyptian citizens for blasphemy, and new government initiatives to counter atheism emerged during the year."" Those who commit sectarian violence generally are not convicted, leaving conditions for Copts ""precarious."" Baha'is and Jehovah's Witnesses are banned, while anti-Semitism is rife. Blasphemy cases are on the upswing. Most cases are brought against Sunni Muslims but, noted the Commission, ""the majority of those sentenced by a court to prison terms for blasphemy have been Christians, Shi'a Muslims, and atheists, mostly based on flawed trials."" In February four teenage Copts were sentenced to five years in prison for a video directed against the Islamic State but treated as an attack on Islam. At the end of March the court upheld a three-year sentence against the poet Fatma Naoot for ""contempt of religion"" and ""insulting Islam."" Indeed, al-Sisi may be consciously using ostentatious state piety to maintain power in a society in which social hostility runs high against religious minorities. In reporting on the conviction of Naoot, who, ironically, had supported al-Sisi, the Washington Post's Sudarsan Raghavan explained: ""there have been more religious-based convictions during President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi's time in office than under the Islamist government the former general replaced two years ago."" Film director Ama Salama argued that ""What happened with Fatma Naoot would have never happened under the time of Mubarak, or under the time of the revolution, or under Morsi.""Even if Copts believe they remain safer under al-Sisi, they may have sold their liberty birthrate for what turns out to be a mess of security pottage. With the al-Sisi government instituting its own reign of terror, the Coptic Church appears to be on the side of the oppressors. Fahim contemplated Cairo's urban massacre, which was bloodier than Tiananmen Square: ""The Coptic Orthodox Church watched the bloodshed and did nothing."" And that was just the beginning. Copts live in the same unfree society as everyone else. Fahim wrote two years ago: ""more than 40,000 arrests have been made since Morsi's overthrow, journalists have been prosecuted, artists have been censored, opposition voices have been violently silenced, dissented politicians have been witch-hunted, the Mubarak regime has successfully reassembled itself, institutional corruption has grown more rampant, the country has descended into further chaos and fear has become the prevailing sentiment of the day.""Today the government targets all critics, including many who opposed Mubarak. In fact, the regime outlawed the April 6 democracy movement which organized protests against the previous dictator. Some activists received lengthy terms for participating in similar demonstrations against al-Sisi. TV host Wael al-Ibrashi originally supported the military but recently told the Wall Street Journal that the Mubarak ""apparatus"" is using violence to return to power.The State Department's 2015 human rights report on Egypt is a depressing read: ""The most significant human rights problems were excessive use of force by security forces, deficiencies in due process, and the suppression of civil liberties. Excessive use of force included unlawful killings and torture. Due process problems included the excessive use of preventative custody and pretrial detention, the use of military courts to try civilians, and trials involving hundreds of defendants in which authorities did not present evidence on an individual basis. Civil liberties problems included societal and governmental restrictions on freedoms of expression and the press, as well as on the freedoms of assembly and association.""The human rights group Freedom House recently judged Egypt to be ""not free"" and getting worse. The group cited ""the complete marginalization of the opposition, state surveillance of electronic communications, public exhortations to report critics of the government to the authorities, and the mass trials and unjustified imprisonment of members of the Muslim Brotherhood."" In the name of fighting terrorism journalists who contradict the government face fines and arrest.Many people simply disappear. Explained Khaled Mansour, a writer and former executive director of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights: ""Security officers kidnap individuals they believe are activists, force them to provide information or testify to wrongdoing, and deny for days, weeks or months that they are keeping them in custody. Some of those kidnapped are then taken to court--or released--while the whereabouts of others remain unknown."" The security forces appear to be largely unaccountable, perhaps even to the government.To be so detained is said to be going ""behind the sun,"" a phrase dating back to the dictatorship of Gamal Abdel Nasser, since anyone looking for you may go blind. Last year Human Rights Watch documented several cases of ""enforced disappearances."" Public attention in Egypt focused on student Esraa al-Taweel, who was kidnapped along with two male friends and taken to the headquarters of state security, where the two men were tortured into confessing to violent activity. The latest case to embarrass the government involves 28-year-old Italian graduate student Giulio Regeni, who was investigating Egyptian labor unions. He disappeared in January; his mutilated body, which sustained the sort of torture typically inflicted by the security forces, was discovered several days later. The government initially blamed his death on a car accident, but later claimed he was murdered by a newly discovered criminal gang, whose members all happened to be killed at a police checkpoint.Finally, Cairo currently is engaged in a systematic campaign to shut down organizations which simply report on government abuses. Scores of domestic and international NGOs engaged in documenting human rights violations reportedly are under criminal investigation. In March the government sought to freeze the personal assets of Hossam Bahgat and Gamal Eid, founders respectively of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights and Arabic Network for Human Rights Information.Another human rights advocate, Negad al-Borai, had been detained and threatened with criminal charges. The regime also launched legal attacks on the women's organization Nazra for Feminist Studies and the anti-torture Nadeem Center. The Working Group on Egypt, whose members include leading neoconservatives such as Robert Kagan and Elliott Abrams, warned that these efforts are part of the ""Egyptian authorities' campaign to crush the last remnants of Egypt's independent civil society and human rights community.""Two years ago I was a member of a delegation of lawyers who visited the Nadeem Center. We met with co-founder and psychiatry professor Aida Seif al-Dawla, who told us that torture was more pervasive then than at any point during the Mubarak era. Security personnel acted with complete impunity. Last year, reported the organization, the government abducted 464 people, caused the death of nearly 500 detainees, and tortured at least 676 people. Since February the government has been attempting to shut down the center. Seif al-Dawla told the Associated Press: ""The problem now is that you cannot predict what can put you in jail or not.""In short, Egypt is scary for anyone who dissents. People disappear and die. Prison conditions are harsh. Judicial verdicts reflect political demands. Journalists are punished for expressing independent opinions. Academic freedom is restricted. Human rights organizations are harassed and closed. Official corruption has spread. Security forces act with impunity. Unfortunately, sustained repression has only encouraged radicalization and more terrorist attacks. Which raises questions about the stability of al-Sisi's rule. In April public protests erupted over the gifting of two islands to Saudi Arabia, apparently in exchange for financial ""aid"" received. Egyptians unwilling to turn out on behalf of democracy demonstrated against this public prostration before Riyadh. Scores of protesters were arrested and imprisoned. Rumors of military dissatisfaction with al-Sisi abound.In the end Coptic Christians could end up more vulnerable than ever. The al-Sisi dictatorship does little to protect them and his promises of aid remain unfulfilled. Yet the Coptic Church has tied itself to his rule, which grows ever more repressive. If he falls, Copts again could find themselves targeted, but this time by a much wider proportion of the population. Christians and other religious minorities in the Middle East have few good options. Unfortunately, Coptic reliance on Egypt's al-Sisi increasingly looks like a bad deal. He is delivering little of the secularism that was supposed to accompany his dictatorship. And his brutal repression risks triggering another revolution, one in which Copts might find themselves to be targets. Now is the time to search for a new approach that doesn't sacrifice national liberty for sectarian security.This article was first posted to Forbes online."

And people have said, 'We can't do whatever it is because we have an election this year,'"" he continued. ""It is not an excuse not to do our work.""Sound familiar? The upcoming presidential election is the reason McConnell and other Republicans have cited for not granting a confirmation hearing for Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee.Democrats quickly seized on the apparent hypocrisy.McConnell has said he intends to bar Garland's nomination until after the November election, even as Republicans grapple with whether to back their presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump. Many in the GOP fear Trump may lose, thus leading to a more liberal Supreme Court nominee.“Republicans continue to believe that the American people should have a voice in this decision and the next president should make the nomination,” McConnell's spokesman said last week.Some senators, like Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), have said that they will back Garland if Trump loses the general election."

In the U.K., 74 percent of antibiotics are prescribed by general practice physicians, the researchers write in the journal Family Practice. Many patients may request the drugs for viral infections, which are not treatable with antibiotics, they add.Antibiotics work on bacterial infections, but not on viruses. Antibiotic resistance occurs when the bacteria causing common infections evolve so that the drugs no longer work on them.“Most coughs, colds, sore throats, flu and sinus infections are self-limiting and will get better on their own. Antibiotics only improve symptoms by about 8-12 hours,” McNulty told Reuters Health by email.Antibiotic resistance is one of the greatest health threats worldwide and leads to longer hospitalizations, higher medical costs and death, according to the World Health Organization.The researchers used an independent research agency to conduct a face to face survey of randomly selected homes across England. The 1,625 adult participants answered questions about their use of antibiotics, whether their doctors gave them information about antibiotics in general and about resistance in particular, and whether they trusted their doctors’ knowledge.Just over one third of participants said they had been prescribed an antibiotic in the past year.Among those with prescriptions, 62 percent of people with throat infections, 60 percent with sinus infections, and 42 percent of those with a cough or cold took antibiotics, although all these conditions tend to be caused by viruses.Asked whether most coughs, colds and sore throats get better on their own without the need for antibiotics, 86 percent of survey participants agreed, but only 44 percent correctly answered that antibiotics treat bacterial and not viral infections.Just 45 percent of participants agreed that healthy people can carry bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics.Two-thirds of participants remembered getting advice from their doctors about their infection or about antibiotics, but only 8 percent said they got information about antibiotic resistance.Eighty-eight percent of subjects trusted their doctors to decide if they needed antibiotics.“It’s extremely important for providers to share information with patients and parents about the benefits and harms of using antibiotics,” said Dr. Lauri Hicks, director of the Office of Antibiotic Stewardship at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Doctors should talk to patients about when antibiotics are and are not needed and about possible issues with antibiotics like allergic reactions and antibiotic resistance, said Hicks, who was not involved in the study.“Doctors are often under a lot of time pressure, so doctors can also provide resources to guide patients, like hand-outs and, if appropriate, websites that have more information about appropriate antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance (e.g. www.cdc.gov/getsmart),” Hicks told Reuters Health by email.McNulty said that antibiotics can be life-saving drugs for serious infections, but they are not needed for colds or flu-like illnesses. She noted that having a stuffy or runny nose with your other symptoms is often a sign that antibiotics are not needed.“Trust your GP or nurse to prescribe antibiotics when you need them. Do ask them to share information with you about how you can self-care, how long the symptoms should last and when you should return (if symptoms are not improving or you are feeling worse),” McNulty said.SOURCE: bit.ly/1VUFxeL Family Practice, Online April 12, 2016."
