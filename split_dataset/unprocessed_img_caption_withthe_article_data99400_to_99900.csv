There is no more 'good' or 'bad' Taliban.""Kerry specifically pressed for action against the Haqqanis, including banning the group,"" the official added.A second official, a minister who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed the decision to outlaw the Haqqani group.The United States accuses the Pakistani intelligence agency of supporting the Haqqani militants and using them as a proxy in Afghanistan to gain leverage there against the growing influence of its arch-rival India. Pakistan denies this.A formal announcement of the ban would show the government is keen to convince the United States it will no longer differentiate between 'good' and 'bad' militants.But it remains to be seen if the ban will translate into significant action.There has been intense debate within the government on whether to brand the group a terrorist organization.Some officials have argued the move would have little battlefield impact but risks setting back Afghan reconciliation efforts and unleashing more attacks against Pakistan.In June last year the Pakistan army launched a long-expected military operation in the troubled North Waziristan region, said to be the base of the Haqqani group.""Pakistan has done a lot already to disrupt the activities of the Haqqanis...within Pakistan,"" said a Western diplomat.""But they must also take follow up steps ... to ensure the Haqqanis and other groups are not allowed to regroup or return to sanctuaries, their assets are frozen, their funding is blocked and their networks dismantled.""

There is no one better than Marcus to teach me how to do that. When I vent to my husband about people's actions I have seen or read, Marcus gently reminds me, ""No one is perfect, Mom.""",2015-01-15,When I go to have lunch at KFC I always have to pass under these pigeons. There are like hundreds of them that gather up and fly around in this area just before KFC. I hate them. I always feel like one of them will end up shitting on me and ruining my day.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e7dd724000050005402d3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This season as I mulled over each habit or practice I should change, improve, or drop, I also gave thought to the wisdom my son Marcus shared with me last fall while we sat at our favorite coffee shop. We're regulars at one particular Scooters where they are nice to us. The general public, on occasion, puts me on edge. You see, I'm a bit paranoid and particularly attentive to how folks look at and react to us because Marcus, my adult son, has Down syndrome, and the patrons and employees at this Scooters tend to acknowledge Marcus but not bristle, are nice but not patronizing, a surprisingly tricky balance for some.That month a website called The Road We've Shared was preparing to ""spotlight"" Marcus. So while we sipped our hot drinks, I asked him a few questions, finding out some of his favorite things to include in the note. I learned that Marcus' favorite Muppet is Walter (the new guy). His favorite pop song is ""On Top of the World"" by Imagine Dragons, and his favorite food is peanut butter and jelly. (Of course, I knew that last one. He makes at least one PB&J a day -- it can be breakfast, lunch, or dinner.) As I typed up his replies, I sat a little surprised at his quick answers because, historically, Marcus doesn't pick a single favorite. Usually he answers with, ""A-bunch."" But this day, he popped out answers easily and wanted more questions when I was done. It had become The Favorites Game. ""All right,"" so I continued. When I got through all of the favorites I could think of, I asked, ""What do you want to be when you grow up?"" It's one of my go-to questions to ask anyone, regardless of age. Marcus blinked once and said, ""Myself.""Somewhere in my brain I heard a snap. By Jove, he's right! The majority of us with only 46 chromosomes tend to talk about being something, like some title or some job. ""I want to be a manager,"" ""a chef,"" ""a rock star."" Wouldn't it be neat if, instead, we said to ourselves: ""When I grow up, I'm going to be myself. The most true and best possible me."" Holy cow!When Marcus was born, I was bombarded with strangers telling me what he would never do or could never be (most of it was baloney). However one book, which I have sadly lost over the years, emphasized instead the concept of potential. As I remember it, people with Down syndrome, given the opportunity, will continue learning their whole life and have a much better chance of reaching their potential than many of us ""normal"" folks, who pretty much plateau on the learning front after age 18. Marcus is 24 and still learning all the time. I am amazed at the new concepts he embraces or new skills he attains. Here's something else to consider. Studies show that most people with Down syndrome are happier than the general public and are also happier with themselves and who they are. It's only speculation as to if this is inherent in the genetics. Nature or nurture, we can learn from this attitude.My job as a mother is to help Marcus become the best possible version of himself. I do this by encouraging his strengths and his creative nature. I try to enable further opportunities to learn and embrace new skills. I also am working on doing better at letting go, not my strength, and allowing him more independence as reaches for it (harder some days for me than for him).""Go ahead, Mom,"" he says, ""I do it myself.""My job as a human is to become the best possible version of myself. There is no one better than Marcus to teach me how to do that. When I vent to my husband about people's actions I have seen or read, Marcus gently reminds me, ""No one is perfect, Mom."" When I don't know what to say to a friend in pain, Marcus responds to them with only a hug. The best and right answer, of course. When I'm too self-conscious to dance, he dances anyway. How about you? What are you going to be when you grow up? Try the answer, ""Myself."" Where would that take you next? Are you walking that path? Now is the perfect time to follow Marcus' lesson.If you're interested in learning more about Marcus and his path, join us on Grown Ups and Downs. "
5,BUSINESS,The 14 Principles of a Future Organization,"Jacob Morgan, ContributorAuthor, The Future of Work, Speaker, Futurist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-14-principles-of-a-fu_b_6468682.html,"We are seeing an amazing evolution around how we work, how we lead and how we structure our companies.",2015-01-15,2015-01-14-14_principlesof_the_future_organization.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-01-14-14_principlesof_the_future_organization-thumb.jpg,"Over the past few months I've been sharing a series of posts on the 7 Principles of the Future Employee and the Evolution of the Employee. This was followed by the 10 Principles of the Future Manager followed by the Evolution of the Manager. Today I want to introduce the 14 Principles of the Future Organization (which will eventually be followed up by the Evolution of the Organization). This is a concept that is taken from my latest book on The Future of Work and one that I feel is quite important. We are seeing an amazing evolution around how we work, how we lead and how we structure our companies. These are the 14 Principles of the Future Organization.Globally distributed with smaller teamsWe are absolutely seeing a shift towards organizations ""command and conquering"" where they are distributed their real-estate and their employees among various pockets around the world. It's not unusual to see a single employee working in a remote location just so the company can say they have an ""office"" there. Talent is no longer dependent on proximity to the corporate headquarters. In addition the Jeff Bezos ""two pizza rule"" is a must in order to allow employees to actually get work, that is, a team should be able to be fed by two pizzas, if the team is larger than ""two pizzas"" it's too big.Connected workforceA company cannot have a distributed workforce unless that workforce is able to stay connected with the right people and information; anytime, anywhere and on any device. This means deploying the right collaborative technologies that enable this to happen. Technology is the central nervous system of an organizaiton.Intrapreneurial The same spirit, passion and creativity that entrepreneurs have must also be fostered inside of organizations. Employees should be able to test out ideas, run experiments, pitch new projects and ""run"" with the ones that have potential.Operates like a small companyA small company make decisions quickly, isn't bogged down by bureaucracy and are more agile and adaptable. In a rapidly changing world organizations cannot operate as their stereotypical ""larger selves"" where employees spend all their time checking emails, have meetings about having meetings and basically operate at the speed of sludge.Focuses on ""want"" instead of ""need""Organizations used to assume that employees worked there because they needed to. Today, talented employees are seeing all sorts of opportunities to make a living beyond traditional employment. This means that in order to attract top talent organizations must create an environment where employees actually WANT to be there instead of assuming that they NEED to be there.Adapts to change fasterToday, ""late followers"" means ""out of business."" Years ago it was acceptable to see what other companies were doing and being a ""fast follower,"" not so today. Decisions have to made faster and actions need to be more swift. This isn't just an adaptation to technology either, new behaviors entering the workforce are also crucial to pay attention to and embrace.Innovation everywhereInnovation no longer comes from a team, a department or from a few people at the top of the food chain. In order to succeed in a rapidly changing world innovation must have the ability to come from anywhere including outside of the company. ""Idea"" and ""innovation"" are also two different things. Ideas happen all the time but the process of taking that idea and turning into something is innovation. Does your organization enable anyone to come forward with an idea and then give them the opportunity to turn that idea into something?Runs in the cloudOn-premise technologies have a shelf life and their days are surely numbered. How much longer do you think your company can sustain it's on-premise deployments before falling behind every single other competitor that is able to adapt to technological change faster than you? Three years? five years? Maybe ten years? Stall as much as you want but the ""future organization"" runs in the cloud.More women in senior management rolesThere are nowhere near enough women in senior management and leadership roles at companies around the world . This means that most companies are missing out and an increase talent pool with access to new skills and perspectives. Women have the majority of purchasing power, will soon become the majority of the world's population, will soon earn more than men and will quite frankly end up kicking ass in the next few years. The forward thinking organizations recognize the value of having more women in senior level roles and are taking actions to help encourage and support this.Flatter structureNo organization that I am aware of has ever embarked on a journey to create a more hierarchical structure with more layers, more management, more bureaucracy and less collaboration. Yet this is the stereotypical idea of what a strict hierarchy looks like and how it operates. Some structure within an organization is good but there needs to be a balance between being completely flat and being a pyramid. In other words structure is fine provided that it serves the purpose of helping employees understand where they fit within the company and what the relationship structure looks like. However, this structure doesn't mean that everything flows ""top down."" Communication and collaboration flows up, down and side to side.Tells storiesOftentimes organizations focus on telling stories to customers to build relationships with the, elicit an emotional response, align with customer values and get them to buy something. But it's also crucial to tell stories to employees as well. Employees want to work for organizations that they believe in and whose values align with their own there is no better way to do this than through telling stories about how the company started, why it exists and where it's going.Democratizes learningIn most companies today, if you want to learn something you have to book a class or a training session, oftentimes days or weeks in advance. Learning is a very structured and linear process which is completely outdate today. For the future organization any employee is able to act as a teacher or student that can learn from colleagues anytime and anywhere. Of course, this is largely facilitated through the use of collaborative technologies.Shifts from profits to prosperityProfit is just the financial gain that an organization receives and it's the primary measure of success for most of them. Prosperity on the other hand looks beyond just how much money a company makes and looks at things such as employee health and wellness, community involvement, sustainability and making a positive impact on the world. These are the values and attributes that the future organization must and will possess.Adapts to the future employee and the future managerIt goes without saying that the organization of the future must adapt to the changes we are seeing around how employees work and how managers lead. Both of these are things discussed in previous posts which were mentioned above.Jacob Morgan is a futurist, best-selling author and keynote speaker, learn more by visiting The Future Organization.com or check out his latest book,""The Future of Work: Attract New Talent, Build Better Leaders and Create a Competitive Organization,"" on Amazon."

Rand Paul, R-Ky. speaks in Highland Heights, Ky. The presidential contest that's starting to take shape is exposing divisions among likely Republican candidates on the nation's role in global affairs. Among those outlining foreign policy this week: Bush, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz and Bobby Jindal, as well as the party's 2008 presidential nominee, Sen. John McCain. (AP Photo/Timothy D. Easley, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e41c260000350083becb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ronald Reagan created a mythological character -- the ""Welfare Queen"" -- and taught America that it was OK to be racist, OK to hate poor people, and OK to resent paying taxes. More than 30 years later, a substantial number of Americans still believe that lazy black women make millions of dollars a year by popping out babies and signing them up for welfare.In an article in Politico, Rand Paul attempts to create a mythology that he hopes will convince Americans to hate science. Paul knows that if he can get voters to resent scientific research as much as they resent minorities and poor people, then he and his fellow Republicans will be free to ignore inconvenient facts about climate change, population trends, and other data that goes against the Republican agenda.Paul questions the wisdom of paying for research funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). NSF is the primary source of government funding for research in economics, mathematics, computer science, and social sciences -- basically things that Republicans don't understand. Paul pointed to a study of Tea Party activity on social media, another study to determine whether Turkish women wear a veil because it is fashionable, and other examples of what he considers wasteful spending. Like Reagan, Paul reduces his examples to the most inflammatory terms possible. An NSF grant for an interactive website designed to teach users about nutrition and how to combat obesity is reduced to ""$258,000 for a website for the first lady's White House garden."" Meanwhile, more than one-third of Americans -- 78.6 million people -- are obese, including many Kentuckians that Rand Paul was elected to represent.The Kentucky senator wants us to believe that Republicans are not anti-science. They simply want to be responsible stewards of the taxpayers' hard earned money. But the $7.2 billion NSF budget represents less than 1 percent of the $1.1 trillion Cromnibus bill recently passed by Congress. Congress could eliminate the entire NSF program and still have 99 percent of the budget left. But through the magic of Republican magnification, one percent is really all you need. The food stamps program (TANF) amounts to only 2 percent of the total federal budget, but it generates much more than that in political capital for Republicans. Republicans in the House and the Senate could eliminate the entire NSF along with the entire food stamp program and still have 97 percent of the budget left.Rand Paul has to know that reducing or even eliminating the NSF and other federal science research programs will not lead to any meaningful reduction of the federal budget. But discrediting science will make it more difficult for scientists to conduct credible research in a variety of issues, many of which would haved direct implications for politics and public policy. Reducing research on carbon emissions will discourage environmental regulations. Restricting research on the health implications of income inequality would only serve to preserve inequailty. It is not a stretch to imagine Republicans railing against government funded research on the impact of voter registration laws on the outcomes of elections. Warnings about climate change could be easily dismissed if credible independent scientists can no longer afford to study the problem. The favorite Republican catch phrase -- ""I am not a scientist"" -- would be transformed from a disclaimer to a badge of honor.The thing about science is that you never know where these discoveries will lead. Research on the Tea Party's use of the Internet, to use one of Rand Paul's examples of wasteful spending, could lead to a better understanding of how all groups use social media, including groups that might not be friendly to the United States or to American citizens. An investigation of what motivates Turkish women to wear a veil could lead to a better understanding of Islamic culture and the attitudes of women who live in it. Is it possible that not every veil-wearing Muslim woman is a terrorist? That might be a good thing to know.Today's silliness is tomorrow's norm. It is not hard to imagine a 1960s version of Rand Paul criticizing government spending on a ridiculous program designed to see if computers can talk to one another. We cannot afford to dismiss questions simply because their potential relevance cannot be appreciated by a Tea Party Congressman. Just as Reagan wanted us to believe that it is OK to be racist, Rand Paul wants us to believe that it's OK to be ignorant. It's OK to resent money spent on scientific research, regardless of the potential benefits of that research.Rand Paul wants us to believe that science is too expensive, a luxury that we cannot afford. The reality is that Republicans cannot afford an informed electorate that engages in critical thinking. We cannot afford to stop learning. We can't afford to stop asking questions.If the Congressman wants to portray the Republican War On Science as a budgetary crisis, then he might want to check his facts.Bob Seay is the Editor of NewsPrism.com"

We consider all sexes to be equal.""The panel will send details of the measure to the National Reform Council by April. It will need to be formally approved by the ruling junta, also known as the National Council for Peace and Order.In 2012, a group of lawmakers and LGBT activists formed a committee to draft legislation recognizing same-sex couples that would, among other things, enable them to marry.But discussion of the draft law was put on ice while Thailand struggled with political protests in 2013 and 2014.Gay rights activists welcomed the decision to include the term ""third gender"" in the new constitution.""It would treat all citizens equally and help to protect from discrimination in all areas including ease of doing business and also personal life,"" said prominent gay activist Natee Teerarojjanapongs.The army seized power on May 22 to restore order after months of political infighting that killed nearly 30 people.

Jared Bernstein, TV commentator and former chief economic advisor to Vice-President Biden, has called Van Hollen's plan ""new"", ""bold"", ""far-reaching"". The Roosevelt Institute's Richard Kirsch called it ""an economic and political home run"". Huffington Post's Zach Carter referred to the pay-for as a ""Wall Street Tax"". Well, guess what boys and girls? This was proposed in these pages in September, 2014. You remember September, 2014, don't you? It was just when the mid-terms began getting traction with the American people. Despite what the always-wrong pollsters were saying, the election was up for grabs, for whomever would seize it.September, 2014, was when Democrats decided to run away from President Obama by shuffling their feet and looking at their shoes when attacked for supporting him. [As the Carter article makes clear, offering this would have been running away from the president, but in a ""new, bold, far-reaching"" direction as the Bernstein article says].It was before they handed the right wing the Congress on a silver platter.It was called the ""Wall Street Tax"". Along with the minimum wage, it was proposed as the both awesome economics and politics, as the Kirsch article explains. Indeed, it was bolder, more far-reaching, and simpler to convey than Van Hollen's proposal. It raised $350 billion per year by taxing Wall Street transactions in stocks, bonds and derivatives all at less than 1 percent. It was also more practical -- a movement, a wave, could perhaps have passed it. Depending on loophole closing has not shown itself to be as lucrative as was supposed.The proposal was well-publicized, highlighted here on the front page, and received a substantial commentary.Republicans could not have wailed about deficits, debt, raising taxes or spending. Deficits would actually go down as the economy would tick up; taxes would be shifted, not raised; government spending would remain the same.Elections are not ""locked"" as early as politicians and pollsters would have you believe. Moods change, and a constant drum beat for relief of Main Street via fractional taxes of Wall Street could have permeated the electorate's consciousness.So, how did Van Hollen et al. respond to this proposal?Silence.

""you clean it up & call me. till then, STFU & eat your crayons, plz""""And if this offends you, then you're exactly who he's talking about,"" someone else wrote.""bingo"" Nugent answered. Nugent is scheduled to appear on Sarah Palin's Sportsman Channel show, ""Amazing America,"" on Jan. 29. Palin, who has a son with Down syndrome, has in the past attacked people for using the slur. As Raw Story points out, Palin called for Rahm Emanuel to be fired from his job as White House chief of staff when he reportedly used the phrase ""fucking retarded."" ""Just as we’d be appalled if any public figure of Rahm’s stature ever used the 'N-word' or other such inappropriate language, Rahm’s slur on all God’s children with cognitive and developmental disabilities –- and the people who love them -– is unacceptable, and it’s heartbreaking,"" Palin wrote on Facebook at the time. ""As my friend in North Andover says, 'This isn’t about politics; it’s about decency. I am not speaking as a political figure but as a parent and as an everyday American wanting my child to grow up in a country free from mindless prejudice and discrimination, free from gratuitous insults of people who are ostensibly smart enough to know better... Have you no sense of decency, sir?'"" Palin has yet to respond to Nugent's use of the word. However, in 2012, she defended Rush Limbaugh when he used the word to describe liberal groups. ""Rush Limbaugh was using satire,"" Palin said. ""I didn't hear Rush Limbaugh calling a group of people whom he did not agree with 'f-ing retards,' and we did know that Rahm Emanuel, as has been reported, did say that. There is a big difference there."" "

Most often, they inhabit long forgotten places and toil with hopes that their mortal lives have not been lived in vain. A few years ago, I first traveled to a forgotten place to meet a forgotten man. ""For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them rubbish, in order that I might gain Christ and be found in him..."" Though I had heard the words of Philippians 3:8 many times before, I had never heard them like this. We all know that the setting and the speaker often increase the magnitude of words. I knew that the man speaking to me despite a mangled jaw was someone who had sacrificed his life to be on the side of justice. A veteran of the Civil Rights Movement and many other struggles, Rev. Ed King is a complicated man. Long forgotten by everyone except the most meticulous of historians, Rev. King truly has suffered the loss of all things in order to authentically gain and be found in God. While I went down to Jackson to collect and tell his story, Rev. King ended up changing mine.We have very little cultural space for alternative heroes of the Civil Rights Movement. In an age of certainty, we have constructed clear lines of what we think an authentic hero is supposed to look like. Rev. King believed that the only line that should have consequence on the way that we engage the world is the one between justice and injustice. Desiring to stand on the side of justice, Rev. King was mentored early on by Medgar Evers. Serving as chaplain of historically black Tougaloo College, Rev. King helped to strategize, organize and lead the Civil Rights Movement in Mississippi. There are few other figures as close to almost every major event in the Mississippi Movement. From talking to Evers before he was assassinated to being a part of the demonstration at Woolworth's Lunch Counter to being heavily engaged in Freedom Summer to being an early participant in and candidate for the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, Rev. King was consistently there and paid the price. Why do so few people know who he is? From experiencing numerous acts of violence (including the crash that left his jaw mangled) to constant threats and psychological torment, Rev. King is forever scarred by the Civil Rights Movement. In the 50 years since, Rev. King has divorced, sometimes been broke and struggled to find his place in the emerging historical consciousness of the Movement. There were four people in the service when I met Rev. King. When I left, I felt sad that so many people were missing out on a chance to interact with such a historical figure. Sometimes, I still feel sad when I talk to him. I guess I shouldn't. Rev. King has chosen to suffer the loss of all things and count them as rubbish so that he might be found in God. Through Rev. King I have learned that true discipleship is costly, especially in a society that has such strict interpretations of what authenticity is supposed to look like. During this time of celebration of the life of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., let us all not forget that there were other Kings and that life is about engaging in our own authentic pursuits of justice no matter what the cost.Amen."

An armed man walked up to two New York Police Department officers sitting inside a patrol car and opened fire Saturday afternoon, killing one and critically wounding a second before running into a nearby subway station and committing suicide, police said. (AP Photo/John Minchillo)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e445220000ba01dd803b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Here in New York City, the past few weeks have been fraught. First, in early December, protesters took to the streets to protest a Staten Island grand jury's decision not to indict a policeman involved in the choking death of African-American Eric Garner. The police were attempting to place Garner under arrest for selling loose cigarettes.The protests made cops angry, especially because of certain anti-police chants and an assault during one of the demonstrations against two police lieutenants on the Brooklyn Bridge. But their anger escalated into fury on December 20 when two officers were gunned down in their patrol car by a seemingly deranged assailant from out-of-town who may have thought he was exacting revenge for police killings of African-American men.The police response has been a work slowdown -- although they've denied it -- that's just beginning to end, and acts of disrespect directed against New York's Mayor Bill de Blasio. He was booed by spectators at a recent police academy graduation, but the main gesture of contempt has been police turning their backs to the mayor at the funerals of the two murdered officers, Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu.Such actions began the night of the killings when de Blasio and Police Commissioner William Bratton entered a media briefing at the Brooklyn hospital where the two policemen had been brought after the shootings, but really, they were the latest in a series of attacks on the liberal Democratic mayor that began during his election campaign in 2013. Some have alleged that the latest of these are being orchestrated by police union officials coordinating with Republican allies.At his own press conference outside the hospital, Patrick Lynch, the man who helped organize the back-turning, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association (PBA), the largest of the city's police unions, blamed the deaths on the mayor and on demonstrators who had been protesting the grand jury decision not to indict the policeman involved in the death of Eric Garner. Lynch referred to them as ""Those that incited violence on the street, under the guise of protest,"" and those ""that tried to tear down what New York City police officers did every day."" He continued, ""That blood on the hands starts on the steps of City Hall, in the office of the mayor.""The homicides and the Brooklyn Bridge assault are serious crimes. But here's the thing: The right of free speech the police are angry about when it comes to the demonstrators is precisely the same right of free speech they're using to harass de Blasio. And it's that same ideal of free speech, no matter how noxious it might seem, for which those police in Paris died last week.Noxious is just what Patrick Lynch's talk of blood-covered hands was, demagoguery to exploit what he saw as an opportunity to rally public sentiment on behalf of the police and against the protesters.Counter to his spurious accusations are the simple facts about race and the police that so many journalists and non-partisan investigators have uncovered. For example, ProPublica reported, ""Young black males in recent years were at a far greater risk of being shot dead by police than their white counterparts -- 21 times greater."" A Reuters survey of 25 current and retired NYPD officers found, ""All but one said that, when off duty and out of uniform, they had been victims of racial profiling.""""... The officers said this included being pulled over for no reason, having their heads slammed against their cars, getting guns brandished in their faces, being thrown into prison vans and experiencing stop and frisks while shopping. The majority of the officers said they had been pulled over multiple times while driving. Five had had guns pulled on them.""How further to explain Lynch's bombastic rhetoric? Well, for one thing, it conveniently comes as the city and the PBA remain at a negotiating impasse, both sides without a contract since 2010 and binding arbitration soon to begin. ""Continents Apart on Pay Issues"" -- that was the headline in the civil employees weekly newspaper The Chief on December 22.Mention this coincidence, however, and Lynch and his associates tend to scream bloody murder, quite literally it seems. For another, Lynch's polarizing polemics come as he prepares to run for reelection this spring to what would be his fifth consecutive term. No one is likely to successfully take him on now; as Kenneth Sherrill, an emeritus political science professor, told New York Metro, ""A challenger saying he'll be nicer to the mayor can't get him very far.""Some perspective is helpful, too. David Firestone at The Guardian writes, ""Only New York City has ever experienced decades of sustained militancy by its police unions."" And as Commissioner Bratton asked Bloomberg News, ""Can you point out to me one mayor that has not been battling with the police unions in the last 50 years? It's nothing new, it's part of life and it's part of politics and it is what it is. This is New York City. We voice our concerns and we voice our opinions.""We do indeed, which makes Lynch's bullying complaints and accusations about the anti-police protests all the more vexing, especially as all members of the police force take an oath when they are sworn in to uphold the Constitution of the United States, freedom of speech included, no matter which side of an issue any individual cop is on and no matter how obnoxious he or she may think the opposing viewpoint is.I have lived in New York City for more than 40 years. We have an extraordinary police force facing extraordinary pressures and danger. They always have come running when I needed them. On 9/11, two policemen from my neighborhood precinct died trying to save lives at the World Trade Center: Officer James Leahy and Detective Danny Richards, a member of the Bomb Squad. Another, Sergeant Edward Thompson died in March 2008 of lung cancer, very possibly contracted from the weeks he spent working on The Pile, the mountain of debris at Ground Zero so carefully sifted for remains.Over more than four decades in the city, my interactions with police have been routine. But I also know that because I am white, I am nowhere near as likely to be challenged or harassed as others are; nor have I had the conversation that Mayor de Blasio had with his mixed-race son, ""The Talk"" that so many men and women of color have with their kids about how to behave around police.So we live a world of conundrum. We expect the police to protect and not harm us; in return, they expect our respect regardless of any transgressions. Satirists like the cartoonists of Charlie Hebdo actively seek to offend the core beliefs of others, sometimes just for the hell of it, sometimes with or without common sense, but we defend their freedom to make us mad -- or laugh. World leaders descend on Paris to decry the suppression of speech while committing that very same sin in their own backyards.As the sign of one of those in Sunday's Paris demonstrations read: ""I'm marching but I'm conscious of the confusion and hypocrisy of the situation."""
