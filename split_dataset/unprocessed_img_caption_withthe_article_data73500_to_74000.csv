0,HEALTHY LIVING,Most People With Tattoos Don't Get Proper Care Instructions,"Cari Nierenberg, Live Science",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/better-instructions-for-tattoo-care-could-prevent-infections-doctors-say_us_563d36b6e4b0411d307134fe,Only seven states require tattoo artists to give customers public health-approved aftercare instructions.,2015-11-07,"""Your skin tells people if you're healthy, how old you are, whether you're embarrassed, nervous or sick. That's the language of skin.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55d4d4cc1d00002f001454c4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"People who get tattoos need better instructions on how to properly care for their skin afterward, and most states need stronger guidelines for tattoo artists about this topic, a new opinion paper suggests.Only seven states in the U.S. — Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan and North Dakota — have strong policies, requiring that licensed tattoo artists provide customers with instructions on tattoo ""aftercare"" that has received prior approval from state public health officials, the skin care experts wrote. Such instructions can prevent skin infections after a person gets inked, according to the paper, published online today (Nov. 4) in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Dermatology.Dermatologists are caring for an increasing number of people who come to them with skin infections after getting a tattoo, said Dr. Jared Jagdeo, a dermatologist at the University of California, Davis Health System in Sacramento and a co-author of the paper. There is a need for better information on the topic for the general public as well as the doctors who treat them, he said.Whether they are visible on the body or concealed with clothing, tattoos have become increasingly popular. At least 21 percent of Americans have one or more tattoos, according to the paper. However, because obtaining this body art involves sharp instruments that puncture the skin and release blood, the skin may become infected if the procedures are not done safely.Surveys of people in the U.S. who have recently gotten a new tattoo have found that about 3 percent of them developed a skin infection from it, and about 4 percent of people had at least one short-term complication, such as pain, infection or itching.""Actual skin-infection rates from tattoos may be higher,"" Jagdeo told Live Science. And there may be regional differences in infection rates, he noted. Larger studies are needed to understand what problems may be cropping up, he said.Post-tattoo careCurrently, regulations for tattoo parlors are made at the state or local level, so the requirements vary by state or location, according to the paper.The regulations may include requiring tattoo artists to wear gloves and be trained in sterile techniques to prevent infections, and for the parlor to properly dispose of blood and report adverse reactions.The paper also calls for better oversight on the national level to ensure the safety of the inks and procedures used when people get tattoos. Seven states have no laws requiring that tattoo artists be licensed, and six states require artists to be licensed but have no laws stating that tattoo customers be given aftercare instructions. In 30 states, tattoo artists are required to be licensed and to provide some type of either written or verbal guidance to customers to prevent complications from their new tattoo, but that guidance is not subject to any approval process, according to the paper. (The remaining seven states have strong policies, according to the paper.)The paper also urged skin-care experts to create a set of safety standards for tattoo aftercare that could be used by state public health departments and tattoo artists. This would make customers more aware of the possible skin reactions that may develop after they get a tattoo and tell them how to properly care for their skin.In the meantime, Jagdeo offered the following tips:When the tattoo is completed, cover the area with a thin layer of white petroleum ointment and a bandage. Remove the bandage one day later, wash the area with soap and water, and pat it dry with a soft cloth. Do not scrub skin with a washcloth, sponge or loofah, and resist the desire to scratch or pick at the skin.Every day until the area fully heals, gently wash skin, pat it dry and apply a thin film of petroleum ointment. Avoid using an antibacterial ointment because it may cause an allergic skin reaction, Jagdeo said.It may take two to four weeks for skin to heal completely.If a person notices any signs of infection, irritation (or redness) that lasts longer than one day, or scarring, he or she should see a physician, preferably a dermatologist, as soon as possible, he said.Follow Live Science @livescience, Facebook & Google+.

1,ENTERTAINMENT,"'Love,' Gaspar Noé Style, Means Complicated, Graphic 3D Sex",Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/love-gaspar-noe_us_563d100be4b0b24aee4a5ae4,"""We’re making a movie that represents something we all know.""",2015-11-07,"Gaspar Noé attends the Cannes Film Festival on May 21, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/563d10b21400002b003ca295.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Nestled among fall's awards-bait onslaught is something that won't attract the Oscars' attention but might arouse yours -- that is, if a theater near you is willing to screen it. That movie is ""Love,"" the latest offering from provocateur Gaspar Noé. It is, in effect, a 3D sex film. But don't tell Noé that.The Argentinian director wrote ""Love"" around the same time he penned his previous two features, the 2002 thriller ""Irreversible"" and the psychedelic 2009 drama ""Enter the Void."" He presented the project to Vincent Cassel and Monica Bellucci ""many years ago,"" around the time they starred in ""Irreversible"" and were, as Noé told The Huffington Post last week, ""the magic couple of French cinema."" Cassel and Bellucci read Noé's treatment and decided it wasn't for them. After seeing ""Love,"" it's not hard to imagine why. The movie, which opened in limited release last weekend, begins with a couple engaging in three minutes of mutual masturbation that results in a young woman licking her partner's emission off of his erect penis.Said partner is Murphy (Karl Glusman, who appeared in September's ""Stonewall""), the central fixation of ""Love."" After the aforementioned scene ends, we discover that Murphy is an American filmmaker living in Paris with his girlfriend (Klara Kristin, who Noé spotted dancing in a club) and their young daughter. Through extensive flashbacks, it is revealed that Murphy's bedmate from the film's opening (Aomi Muyock, who Noé met via a mutual friend) is now his ex. He was dating her when Murphy unintentionally impregnated the woman who became the mother of his child. In the present day, Murphy receives a phone call from his ex's mother, who informs him that her daughter has gone missing, having possibly committed suicide. That sets him on a downward spiral of longing that turns into agony over the absence of the woman he declares the love of his life. Our shallow protagonist is not the family man his current girlfriend assumes he is. Along the way, the decade's most explicit sex scenes trace the evolutions of Murphy's relationships, resulting in a cum shot that flies out of the screen. Oh, the things a filmmaker can do with 3D.""On the first day of shooting, when we’re wrapping, I said, 'No, no, no, let’s do now today the cum shot on the camera,"" Noé said in slightly broken English. ""Then I remember, I was behind the camera and Karl looked at me and said, 'Can you please move? I cannot concentrate.' And then we shot that scene and he said, 'I thought maybe I should just take a plane and run back to my country.' But then he slept and the next morning he was back. We’re making a movie that represents something we all know.""Even if audiences focus on the fornication that feels more at home in an adult film than something playing in mainstream cinemas, Noé doesn't. His movies may seem outre, but in the director's eyes, he's simply depicting something not often seen onscreen. With ""Love,"" he wanted to showcase the ""realistic"" sex that ""makes your life so exciting,"" just as he wanted to make ""Enter the Void"" in an attempt to leap inside the head of someone traversing his way through a hallucinogenic trip. Not many movies exemplify Noé's intentions, but he cited the 1976 art film ""In the Realm of the Senses"" and 2013's ""Blue Is the Warmest Color"" as precursors to ""Love."" He also listed 2012's decidedly unsexual ""Amour"" as inspiration. (Fellow firebrand Lars von Trier should also be mentioned, as his films, like ""Love,"" are said to incorporate unsimulated sex.) The movie is certainly unlike anything else on the big screen this year, and Noé, for his part, relishes anyone's hesitancies, particularly in regard to whether theaters are willing to screen the film. Russia's culture ministry, for example, has banned it, even though the distributor offered the country a ""softer"" version of the one that premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May. ""If people tell you a movie has been banned, you want to see it,"" Noé said. The primo example, of course, is the racist 1915 Civil War epic ""Birth of a Nation,"" which frequently inspires ""should it be banned?"" queries. ""Love"" offers a wink-wink in its direction by plastering a poster of ""Nation"" on Murphy's kitchen wall. It seems, so far, that Noé is correct about heightened intrigue. The movie's initial rollout entailed a mere two screens, but it collected an impressive per-theater average that rivaled the weekend's dismal wide-release revenues. ""Love"" expands to additional theaters this weekend, meaning you can send your kiddos to ""The Peanuts Movie"" while you take in a 135-minute ode to lovemaking whose thesis can be summed up in a line of dialogue that makes Murphy seem like a Noé analogue: ""My biggest dream is to make a movie that truly depicts sentimental sexuality.""""Why wouldn’t you do a movie about that?"" Noé said.Also on HuffPost:"

Carson is offended that some people don't believe him when he claims he attempted to take a hammer to his dear old mom, stab a friend, and throw a rock at another fellow. What? He wants to convince us this shocking behavior is true, and is upset if we don't buy it? This all seems upside-down inside-out backwards to me. Trump pounced on this, tweeting, ""The Carson story is either a total fabrication or, if true, even worse-trying to hit mother over the head with a hammer or stabbing friend!""I seldom agree with Trump, but his logic here is hard to dispute. However, for the record, I believe Carson -- as I look into his calm and cool eyes, he looks to me to have been crazy enough to have done this. But don't worry, America -- he assures us that's all in his past. I suppose one of the reasons Carson's credibility is questioned is this-- he previously claimed he received a full scholarship to West Point. When the academy stated they had no record of this, the Carson camp reportedly admitted it wasn't true. Where there's smoke, someone's pants are on fire. Tomorrow night, in spite of protest, Trump triumphantly returns to NBC to host Saturday Night Live. That's entertainment -- he is, after all, a comedic genius!It may be recalled that this was the same network that in June issued this statement: ""At NBC, respect and dignity for all people are cornerstones of our values. Due to the recent derogatory statements by Donald Trump regarding immigrants, NBCUniversal is ending its business relationship with Mr. Trump.""Carson wouldn't do SNL. He reportedly told Bloomberg, ""I think the presidency of the United States is a very serious thing. I don't even want to begin to put it in the lightness of comedy.""Hmmm? Well, if that's true it's difficult to understand why Carson would release a rap song promoting his presidential bid. Judge for yourself -- click here to listen.Trump got a bit of a rapper's repetitive beat going in a recent speech in Iowa, where he distinguished himself from Carson, stating "". . . I'm Presbyterian. Can you believe it? Nobody believes I'm Presbyterian. I'm Presbyterian. I'm Presbyterian. I'm Presbyterian. Boy, that's down the middle of the road folks, in all fairness. I mean, Seventh-day Adventist, I don't know about. I just don't know about. But, so I'm Presbyterian . . .""Six times he said he's Presbyterian. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.No doubt about it, Trump has the oomph, always able to lather up his followers. And Carson has the metabolism of a 100 year old giant tortoise, and his slow methodical monotones could cure insomnia. Trump says Carson has ""super low energy."" I supposed compared to Trump, Speedy Gonzales is lethargic. (Gee, I hope Trump doesn't have him deported.)Trump better watch his back-- remember the story of the race between The Tortoise and The ""Hair."""
3,POLITICS,"Ben Carson and West Point's ""Full Scholarship""","Robert Shireman, ContributorSenior Fellow at The Century Foundation; former education offi...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ben-carson-and-west-point_b_8499670.html,"In the kerfuffle over presidential candidate Ben Carson's claim that he was admitted to West Point, the news media have pointed out that the ""full scholarship"" part of his story adds even more confusion because, as the New York Times story today put it, ""Technically, West Point does not offer scholarships.

Ben Carson was back on the campaign trail a day after the third republican debate held at the University of Colorado Boulder. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb91d6b2400005100578751.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the kerfuffle over presidential candidate Ben Carson's claim that he was admitted to West Point, the news media have pointed out that the ""full scholarship"" part of his story adds even more confusion because, as the New York Times story today put it, ""Technically, West Point does not offer scholarships. It is free."" Actually, no, West Point and the other military academies are not free, technically or otherwise. The enrollment agreement of the United States Military Academy at West Point (see page 43) commits the student, after the first year, to completing the training and then to serving a total of eight years in the Army. Failure to complete the training or service or refusing to ""at all times obey the legal orders of my superior officers"" results in having to repay the Army's cost of providing the education, which I calculate at between $250,000 and $300,000.Rather than ""free,"" therefore, it would be more accurate to say that West Point provides cadets with massive student loans, ten times what the average undergraduate incurs, and then forgives those loans over an 11-year period depending on the Army's view of the borrower's behavior as a student and then as a soldier. ROTC loans - er, scholarships - come with similar military service commitments.As with free phones connected to long-term contracts, ""free"" is frequently a marketing gimmick, verging on a deception. In the case of the military academies the lure of free does not seem to present major problems because cadets experience a full, intensive first year before they are on the hook for any repayment. One cadet told me that as the commitment deadline approached at the end of the second summer she was counseled to seriously think about whether she wanted to continue. She decided to leave. She gave West Point the old college try and, fortunately, was able to bow out, fully informed, before having a big debt to repay.Forgivable loans marketed as free money can go awry, however, as in the case of a government program called TEACH Grants. The nation needs more excellent teachers, so in 2007 Congress thought an effective way to lure good students into teaching would be with an ROTC-like commitment. Under the well-intentioned program students receive ""grants"" that turn into loans if the student fails to teach in a high-poverty school for four years. Big mistake. As the policy group Third Way points out, undergraduate students drop out, change their majors and their career plans, cannot control whether they get hired or where they are placed, and, as the newest teachers in a school, are the first to get laid off. As a result, a whopping 75 percent of the so-called grants may end up as loans, revealing the program as a classic bait and switch. Few West Point students end up saddled with unexpected debt because the selection, the first year trial, and the fact that West Point is part of the Army that will be employing the graduates, all mitigate against the loan penalty ever being applied.Like the TEACH grants, a deceptive claim of ""tuition-free"" is also what gave political appeal and national attention to a college financing approach Oregon lawmakers considered last year. The approach would require students to sign away a portion of their future income instead of paying up-front tuition, an idea that re-emerges every few of years since it was first suggested 60 years ago (each time it is portrayed as an exciting new concept). These pay-it-forward or income-share plans are intriguing but ultimately deeply problematic without adequate safeguards. And they are decidedly not free. Given all the media attention to student debt these days, here's my script for Ben Carson to explain his West Point claims: I was encouraged to apply to West Point but I decided that given the two or three hundred thousand dollars of loans and the long commitment I might as well become a doctor instead."

8,MEDIA,Ben Carson Bristles At The Media Vetting His Stories Of Youth Violence: 'A Bunch Of Lies',Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ben-carson-youth-violence-cnn-investigation_us_563cc7c5e4b0411d3070aacb,The candidate's past gets more closely scrutinized as he rises to the top of the Republican field.,2015-11-06,Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson has slammed the media for vetting his stories of youth violence.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/563cc7ec1800002a00304055.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson slammed CNN’s investigation into his oft-repeated stories of violent youthful acts as a “bunch of lies” during a Friday morning phone interview on the network.“This is what it is, a bunch of lies, attempting, you know, to say I'm lying about my history,” Carson told “New Day” co-host Alisyn Camerota. “I think it's pathetic and basically what the media does is they try to get you distracted with all of this stuff so that you don't talk about the things that are important.”The soft-spoken Carson has described several violent acts from his youth in books, interviews, and on the campaign trail, including hitting a classmate with a lock, nearly striking his mother with a hammer, and trying to stab his friend ""Bob"" only to have the knife snap on the boy's belt buckle. The episodes are a critical part of Carson’s redemption story, in which he has described finding God and moving beyond that violence stage of his life to grow up to be a world-class surgeon. What Carson is now facing is to be expected as the media typically vets candidates' biographies more thoroughly as they rise in the polls. National journalists began examining Democratic candidate and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ personal biography and 40-year-old alt-weekly essays after he began drawing thousands of people at events and began to pose more of a threat to Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton. And after Carly Fiorina’s strong Republican debate performances, the media looked more critically at her record while she was CEO of Hewlett-Packard and her failed 2010 Senate bid. Since Carson has reached the top of the Republican field, he’s inevitably going to be under more scrutiny, not only over his policy positions, but also accounts of his life. Carson's campaign admitted Friday he never received a full scholarship to West Point after Politico raised questions about the claim. When it comes to the teenage stabbing incident, The Daily Beast’s Gideon Resnick recently wrote about how Carson’s account had shifted over the years. CNN's Scott Glover and Maeve Reston followed up with an investigation Thursday, which found that ""nine friends, classmates and neighbors who grew up with Carson ... have no memory of the anger or violence the candidate has described.""The CNN reporters' inability to find direct witnesses to the events doesn't mean Carson is lying. But the investigation raised legitimate questions about stories that Carson included in his biography. Carson's campaign didn't respond to CNN's questions, but instead called the investigation a “witch hunt,"" and the candidate himself bristled that afternoon at a book signing when asked about the network's report. “Why would you be able to find them?” Carson said of the people described in his stories. “What makes you think you would be able to find them unless I tell you who they are?”Carson clarified Thursday night on Fox News that the person he tried stabbing was a “close relative,” not a friend as he’d previously described. “I never use the true names of people in books, you know, to protect the innocent,"" he told Fox News’ Megyn Kelly. Carson said he had spoken to the person that day, but the individual wants to avoid the media spotlight. On CNN Friday, Carson not only criticized the network's reporting on him, but suggested President Barack Obama’s life story wasn't similarly vetted. “The so-called vetting that you all did with President Obama doesn't even come close -- doesn't even come close to what you guys are trying to do in my case,” Carson said. “You're going to keep going back, trying to find, 'he said this 12 years ago.' It is just garbage. We have too many things that are important to deal with.”Camerota pointed out that journalists examined Obama's recollections from his memoir Dreams of My Father, including a past girlfriend, who the president acknowledged is a composite character.The news anchor then shifted to other topics, such as Syria and the refugee crisis, before returning to Carson’s media critique by playing a clip of him, in which he said the U.S. would “be Cuba if there were no Fox News.”Carson suggested he didn’t literally mean the U.S. would turn into a communist country, but argued that ""the general mainstream media all seems to move in the secular progressive direction.""Fox News, he said, has provided a necessary counterbalance to the traditional news media, which became “very partisan and very ideological.”“That's what I mean having Fox come in to counterbalance what you've done,” he said. “Others have come in and joined since that time. It's good that they have but it's unfortunate that that has to happen.”This article was edited slightly after publication to reflect updates made to a Politico article about Carson.Also on HuffPost:"

Charles Joseph Gliniewicz on Sept. 1. That was the day the Fox Lake, Illinois, officer was found dead 50 yards from his squad car amid a crime scene we now know was an elaborately staged suicide.""In this case it was not a line-of-duty death. That is clear,"" Joe Ahern, the group's CEO, told the Chicago Tribune Wednesday. ""We will ask the family for the money back.""""This is an unfortunate thing to have to do and we, of course, feel for the family,"" the 100 Club said in a statement to the Chicago Daily Herald. ""We know, however, that we must stay true to the mission and purpose of our organization and reserve financial benefits for families who lose a loved one in the line of duty.""Authorities say Gliniewicz embezzled $50,000 from a community youth program and was on the verge of getting caught.Before deciding to kill himself, the officer may have attempted to hire a hitman to murder the woman who was looking into the financial discrepancy, police told ABC 7. Gliniewicz also appears to have considered planting drugs on her; packets of cocaine were later found in his desk.Motorola Solutions had announced a $50,000 reward in September for information leading to the arrest of Gliniewicz's killer, the Associated Press reported. On Wednesday the company announced it would donate that money to the program Gliniewicz stole from.The officer's death triggered a lengthy manhunt that cost taxpayers well over a quarter of a million dollars and fueled a broader narrative of a ""war on cops"" erroneously linked to the Black Lives Matter movement. That narrative has little supporting data. According to an analysis by the American Enterprise Institute, 2015 is actually on track to be ""the safest year for law enforcement in the US since 1887.""Also on HuffPost:"

Kelly and Cameron Marshad, that could be about to change.The two have embarked on a new feature-length documentary, titled “The Gateway Bug,” that delves into the current state of America’s edible insect industry. A state, they say, is booming thanks in no small part to the environmental and nutritional advantages insects present amid questions of how the world will feed some 9 billion people by the year 2050.Over the course of just a few months, the duo has accumulated 60 hours of footage including interviews with key players in the nascent industry and, this week, they launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for them to complete post-production work on the film, which they hope to finish in February.To learn more about why we’ll probably all be chomping down on crickets in the not-so-distant future, The Huffington Post recently spoke with Kelly and Marshad.HuffPost: What motivated you to make this documentary? Why do you think it’s such an important issue to be digging into right now?JK: I really think there are three really critical parts to this movement. You’ve got the environmental part and that really is huge importantly to us. We think there’s lots of misinformation being spread around about the causes of our environmental climate problem and we want to get the facts out there and get people really educated on those issues.We also have huge problems with obesity and diabetes and nutrition in America. I don’t think it’s enough to educate people on the problem. What you need to do to make significant change is to show strategies around that and offer solutions -- otherwise it’s a very bleak outlook. The edible insect industry does that.CM: It’s also interesting to see how many people around the world already eat insects and how in the west we’ve been trying to keep insects away from us and kill them for such a long time with the use of insecticides and pesticides, which so much of our agricultural system is based on. It’s a groundbreaking thing to start eating these insects. A lot of people around world already eat them and they’re extremely nutritious, and part of our movie really does touch on the stigma but doesn’t really focus on how “gross” they are. It really talks about the positive aspects of eating bugs.The title for the film is “The Gateway Bug” and your trailer names the specific “gateway” bug as the cricket. How did you choose that title and why do you think that is?JK: To tell the truth, the title came from our documentary. After watching all the footage, we found that almost everybody said that line. And we’re not so much saying that crickets are the gateway bug, we’re asking the question if they are. The industry is definitely moving very fast and crickets seem to be at center of it but, as with all farming and food production, the first thing that proves successful isn’t always the best thing and isn’t the one that will carry it forward.There are lots of variables to trying to predict American palates for the future. The palate seems pretty abused at this time with high sugar and high fructose corn syrup, but I think we’re in the process of a huge overhaul right now as more people become educated and more information comes to light about the damaging effects the ingredients of your diet might have on your health and physical wellbeing. We feel that as that escalates, which it no doubt will, a lot of people will be looking for alternatives and perhaps the cricket will lead them down that path.CM: I think there actually is a good reason why it’s called the gateway bug, however. It’s because crickets have been farmed in the U.S. for the reptile feed market for the last 50 years. There’s an infrastructure created around it that only recently has been approved for human consumption and had infrastructure designed for that. That’s not to say other bugs are not worthy of human consumption. But crickets contain a lot of protein, they’re crunchy and they’re one of the most palatable insects out there, I’d say.In the trailer, Dr. Sonny Ramaswamy of the USDA suggests that the biggest obstacle to this industry’s growth is consumer taste. Do you agree?CM: I don’t think consumer taste is what’s preventing this from taking off. Through our investigation, we’ve seen demand for this really outstripping supply and I think it’s really going to take off through more products being created and supply being generated. That’s really going to happen through advancements in agricultural technology. We interviewed specific companies that are developing amazing technology that will allow for the mass production of crickets in the near future. I think that’s really what’s stopping it.JK: The problem isn’t being helped that it’s pretty difficult to get these products on the shelves until very recently, I would imagine. But I feel we are making progress in this area. I think we’ll see various cricket products flying into Whole Foods or Trader Joe’s or other places where people are already interested in products based on their health benefits and environmental impact more so than their price point or taste. The other issue is the yuck factor. The way that’s being tackled right now is through the usual way of making things palatable: Grinding it up, making flour and using that flour in products. It’s much harder to be grossed out by it then when you’re looking at a protein bar that looks like all the other protein bars.What were some of the most surprising things you learned along the process of shooting this film?JK: I was really surprised with the amount of products on the shelves. When I started opening my eyes, I realized there were so many already out there.CM: The biggest surprise for me is that it went way beyond human consumption and that there were a number of companies looking into feeding animals. The first person we met doing this -- Tyler Isaac [of Slightly Nutty] in Santa Barbara -- had the idea to take the boiled grains that a brewery would normally throw away and instead feed them to crickets and take them and create insect meal and feed that to fish or chickens, both of which are natural insectivores. It solves part of the food waste problem we have today, too. A lot of really valuable resources and lots of money, water and fertilizer go into creating food that just goes to waste.JK: Essentially he’s converting waste into protein and creating something to feed people.Do you feel we've reached a point where eating bugs is genuinely on the cusp of going mainstream here in America?JK: I think we’re extremely close. One of the prime reasons we’re making this film is we considered ourselves educated, foodie, environmentalist type people who are pretty much no board with all that. We watch Jon Stewart, you know what I mean? And we had not heard of this, it wasn’t on our radar at all! So, suffice it to say, we’re trying to get it on the radar. We’re confident based on supply and demand and the number of businesses starting out.We interviewed Andrew Zimmern of ""Bizarre Foods"" and he said there were no cricket flour products when he started in the industry and now he’s inundated with people talking about it. Once we get the chance to share this film, you won’t be asking if it’s on the cusp. We’ve traveled all over the U.S. and Canada, where you expect people to have more of that yuck factor than they are in reality. Mostly you’ll find people who are kind of curious. And curiosity is a great thing.

We feel that as that escalates, which it no doubt will, a lot of people will be looking for alternatives and perhaps the cricket will lead them down that path.CM: I think there actually is a good reason why it’s called the gateway bug, however. It’s because crickets have been farmed in the U.S. for the reptile feed market for the last 50 years. There’s an infrastructure created around it that only recently has been approved for human consumption and had infrastructure designed for that. That’s not to say other bugs are not worthy of human consumption. But crickets contain a lot of protein, they’re crunchy and they’re one of the most palatable insects out there, I’d say.In the trailer, Dr. Sonny Ramaswamy of the USDA suggests that the biggest obstacle to this industry’s growth is consumer taste. Do you agree?CM: I don’t think consumer taste is what’s preventing this from taking off. Through our investigation, we’ve seen demand for this really outstripping supply and I think it’s really going to take off through more products being created and supply being generated. That’s really going to happen through advancements in agricultural technology. We interviewed specific companies that are developing amazing technology that will allow for the mass production of crickets in the near future. I think that’s really what’s stopping it.JK: The problem isn’t being helped that it’s pretty difficult to get these products on the shelves until very recently, I would imagine. But I feel we are making progress in this area. I think we’ll see various cricket products flying into Whole Foods or Trader Joe’s or other places where people are already interested in products based on their health benefits and environmental impact more so than their price point or taste. The other issue is the yuck factor. The way that’s being tackled right now is through the usual way of making things palatable: Grinding it up, making flour and using that flour in products. It’s much harder to be grossed out by it then when you’re looking at a protein bar that looks like all the other protein bars.What were some of the most surprising things you learned along the process of shooting this film?JK: I was really surprised with the amount of products on the shelves. When I started opening my eyes, I realized there were so many already out there.CM: The biggest surprise for me is that it went way beyond human consumption and that there were a number of companies looking into feeding animals. The first person we met doing this -- Tyler Isaac [of Slightly Nutty] in Santa Barbara -- had the idea to take the boiled grains that a brewery would normally throw away and instead feed them to crickets and take them and create insect meal and feed that to fish or chickens, both of which are natural insectivores. It solves part of the food waste problem we have today, too. A lot of really valuable resources and lots of money, water and fertilizer go into creating food that just goes to waste.JK: Essentially he’s converting waste into protein and creating something to feed people.Do you feel we've reached a point where eating bugs is genuinely on the cusp of going mainstream here in America?JK: I think we’re extremely close. One of the prime reasons we’re making this film is we considered ourselves educated, foodie, environmentalist type people who are pretty much no board with all that. We watch Jon Stewart, you know what I mean? And we had not heard of this, it wasn’t on our radar at all! So, suffice it to say, we’re trying to get it on the radar. We’re confident based on supply and demand and the number of businesses starting out.We interviewed Andrew Zimmern of ""Bizarre Foods"" and he said there were no cricket flour products when he started in the industry and now he’s inundated with people talking about it. Once we get the chance to share this film, you won’t be asking if it’s on the cusp. We’ve traveled all over the U.S. and Canada, where you expect people to have more of that yuck factor than they are in reality. Mostly you’ll find people who are kind of curious. And curiosity is a great thing. It’s where education and knowledge stem from.This interview has been edited for length and clarity.Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food and water.

17,POLITICS,DOJ: No Civil Rights Charges For Border Agents Over Death Of Anastasio Hernandez-Rojas,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anastasio-hernandez-rojas-doj-border-patrol_us_563d2bf7e4b0411d307131a3,Officials said there was insufficient evidence to pursue charges.,2015-11-06,U.S. Border Patrol was criticized after the 2010 death of Mexican national Anastasio Hernandez-Rojas. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Five years after a Mexican national named Anastasio Hernandez-Rojas died after an encounter with Border Patrol agents, the Justice Department announced Friday it had closed its investigation into his death and will not pursue federal charges. Prosecutors concluded that there was insufficient evidence for federal criminal civil rights charges, or to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that government agents violated homicide statutes, according to a release from the Justice Department.Hernandez-Rojas was detained by Border Patrol agents in May 2010 after illegally crossing the border into the U.S., in an attempt to rejoin his family in San Diego. He resisted, and video footage taken at the time shows the man being struck with a baton and shocked with a taser while surrounded by agents from Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Some onlookers yelled for the agents to stop. Hernandez-Rojas had a heart attack and died two days later, which a medical examiner attributed to ""acute methamphetamine intoxication, pre-existing heart disease, the level of physical exertion during the struggle, the electro-shocks from the taser and positional restraint,"" according to the Justice Department.Hernandez-Rojas' death prompted outrage over border agents' use of force, which Customs and Border Protection officials said was necessary but others said was over the top. More than 36,000 people signed on to a petition calling for an investigation. In 2012, 15 House members along with Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) wrote to federal officials to demand the investigation move more quickly. On Friday, the Justice Department stated its prosecutors were unable to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that any of the agents involved had willfully deprived Hernandez-Rojas of a constitutional right. The department similarly ruled out other federal charges against the agents. The release states that being restrained and shocked from the taser were ""contributory factors in his death,"" but that ""there is no evidence that any of the federal agents deployed the taser or restrained Hernandez-Rojas with malice."" They also concluded there was insufficient evidence to show that the agents violated a federal manslaughter statute.  ""While the loss of life is regrettable, the facts of this matter do not support a federal prosecution,"" the statement reads. Government officials from the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of the Inspector General informed Hernandez-Rojas' family earlier Friday, the department said. A lawyer for the family did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The family previously filed a wrongful death suit but has not yet gone to court, according to a KPBS Fronteras Project report in May. The Los Angeles Times found in an investigation that agents from Customs and Border Protection, which includes Border Patrol, documented 450 uses of tasers from 2010 to 2013. Among those, three people died after being shocked. Overall, CBP reported 768 use of force incidents in the 2015 fiscal year, down from 1,037 the year before.Neither CBP nor the Department of Homeland Security immediately responded to a request for comment on the Justice Department's decision."
18,POLITICS,HUFFPOLLSTER: Here's What We Can Learn From The Polling Miss In Kentucky,"Natalie Jackson, Ariel Edwards-Levy, and Janie Velencia",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/polling-miss-kentucky-2015_us_563ca715e4b0307f2cacffc1,"A combination of factors led pollsters to miss the mark in the Kentucky governor's race. Marco Rubio, while still the underdog, is gaining significantly in the polls. And several low-polling candidates won't make it to the next Fox debate. This is HuffPollster for Friday, November 6, 2015.",2015-11-06,Republican gubernatorial candidate Matt Bevin defies poll expectations and wins in Kentucky. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/563cace029000030004dc582.jpeg?cache=ce1Hw3hrRF&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"RECAPPING ELECTION DAY 2015 - Republicans scored some significant victories on Tuesday, including an unexpected win in the Kentucky gubernatorial race. Although polls indicated that Democratic candidate Jack Conway had a slight lead, Republican Matt Bevin won, taking 53 percent of the vote.Why did Kentucky polls miss the mark? Although it’s difficult to know for sure, evidence points to the timing of the polls, the partisan composition of likely voters in the polls and the presence of an independent candidate. None of these alone explains the wide discrepancy between the polls and the result, but combined, they contributed to the miss. HuffPollster: “There were only six publicly released polls between August and Election Day. As HuffPost pointed out, that’s pretty sparse polling. Any last-minute campaigning or changes in opinion were completely missed -- simply because there were no polls.” [HuffPost]The role of the independent candidate - More from HuffPollster: “Drew Curtis, the independent candidate, was another problem for Kentucky pollsters. He pulled an average of 7 percent support in polls, but only got 3.7 percent of the vote. If Curtis’ extra supporters in the polls turned out to be Bevin voters, this could explain part of the error in Bevin’s poll estimates.” Polls regularly overestimate support for third candidates when they are named in polls, according to research Edison Research’s Joe Lenski presented at the American Association for Public Opinion Research conference last May. However, Lenski also noted that not naming the third candidate leads to underestimates of the non-major party vote in polls. Either way, a third candidate has the potential to add to polling error.The role of likely voter selection - About 31 percent of Kentucky registered voters showed up to vote on Tuesday. That is likely a smaller fraction of the state's potential electorate than the possible ""likely voters"" contacted by pollsters. It’s impossible to know whether tighter likely voter screens would have resulted in different poll results, but there is some evidence that the polls missed the mark in the distribution of voters by party identification. A series of tweets from Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll, compares poll registration and identification numbers to statewide party registration and past exit poll party identification. There’s a big difference between registration and identification -- as a result of changing partisanship and the decline of Southern Democrats, there are many more Kentucky voters who selected Democrat as their party choice when they initially registered to vote than say they are Democrats when a pollster asks if they are Democrats or Republicans in a poll. While the polls seemed to get fairly close on registration, their proportions of Democratic and independent identifiers were generally too high. Polls also underestimated the Republican vote among independent identifiers. Since lower turnout often favors Republicans, a likely voter screen that projects higher turnout would contribute to the pattern of overestimating those who identify as Democrats and Independents.Higher turnout wouldn’t necessarily have changed election result, though - Franklin notes that there wasn't a gap in turnout rates by party in Kentucky in the last few elections.The Kentucky polling miss in perspective - Harry Enten: “I would be careful of making too much of the Kentucky results. Only three polls not sponsored by a candidate came out during the final three weeks of the campaign. That’s far less polling than was conducted in other recent polling mishaps, such as in Israel and the United Kingdom over the past year. The Kentucky results match most of the bigger misses in the U.S. during the 2014 midterm elections, such as in the Maryland gubernatorial race and Virginia Senate election, when few polls were released during the final weeks of the campaign. That’s a good thing for 2016, when the most highly anticipated races will have lots of polls in the field.” [538]Turnout did matter in the Virginia state senate races - University of Florida political science professor Michael McDonald: “The key race for control of the nearly-evenly divided Virginia Senate was the Tenth District, a district that stretches from portions of downtown Richmond City, west through portions of Chesterfield County to encompass the entirety of Powhatan County…. If all the voters in each precinct within the district turned out to vote at the same rate relative to the 2012 election, and these voters cast their ballots the same way those who actually voted did, [the Democrat] would have won by roughly 1,300 votes.” [HuffPost]MARCO RUBIO GAINING IN THE POLLS -HuffPollster: ""Republican presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) is experiencing a post-debate boost, three new surveys find, with two New Hampshire polls and a national poll this week all showing him rising to third place. A WBUR poll conducted by MassINC of likely Republican voters in New Hampshire shows Rubio with 11 percent of the vote, up 9 percentage points since a September WBUR poll. Rubio received a greater boost than any other candidate tested in the survey…..[F]avorable rating is also up by 10 points...making him the second-most favorably rated candidate in the field, just after former neurosurgeon Ben Carson….A Monmouth University New Hampshire poll released Monday also shows Rubio taking the third place spot in the race with 13 percent of the vote. His share of the vote has tripled since a September Monmouth poll….On the national stage, a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday also shows Rubio jumping to third place, with 14 percent. His favorable rating also holds strong in the poll at 71 percent. "" [HuffPost]Not solely a result of a strong debate performance - Philip Bump: ""The last Monmouth poll also coincided with Rubio's worst position in the polls, as The Post's polling guru Scott Clement pointed out. He'd already gained six points since mid-September in the Real Clear Politics polling average in the state….That's additional good news for the Rubio camp, since it suggests that the senator was building momentum even before his good performance. What's more, Rubio and Carson are much more likely to be the second choices of voters -- an important consideration assuming the field of 15 ever gets any smaller….Combining first and second choices, Donald Trump, Rubio and Carson form a top tier of candidates in the state, each getting more than 25 percent combined support."" [WashPost]He's winning the endorsement game too - Jonathan Bernstein: ""Marco Rubio is the most likely candidate to win the Republican 2016 presidential nomination. I said early on that Rubio was in a first tier of contenders with Jeb Bush and, before he dropped out, Scott Walker. There was a solid case for and against each of them. Well, the case against Walker turned out to be correct, while the one for Rubio has looked stronger and stronger. Ross Douthat of the New York Times recently described Rubio’s oddly intangible front-runner status. After good reviews for his debate performance (and terrible ones for Bush), that has changed. Rubio has picked up his first two endorsements from his fellow U.S. senators -- Colorado’s Cory Gardner on Monday and Montana’s Steve Daines on Tuesday. After getting off to a slow start in high-visibility endorsements, Rubio has been on a roll for a while now. He has nailed down seven members of the House since Sept. 21. Over the same period, the other 14 Republican candidates had 10 new House endorsements combined."" [Bloomberg]A shifting moment? - Nate Cohn: “In the fourth quarter of 1991 and of 2011, Democratic and Republican officials broke toward candidates who would ultimately become their party’s nominee: Bill Clinton and Mitt Romney….It’s still too early to say whether the Republican primary has reached a similar moment, but when analysts look back on the 2016 election, they may conclude that the G.O.P. reached a similar inflection point this week. Last week’s debate might have been a clarifying moment for party officials and donors, moving many toward deciding in favor of Marco Rubio and ultimately sending him on a path to the nomination."" [NYT]DIFFERENT RULES AND CANDIDATES FOR NEXT GOP DEBATE “Fox Business Network on Thursday announced the candidate line-up for the Nov. 10 Republican presidential debates.The candidates qualifying for the prime-time, 9 p.m. ET debate are: Billionaire businessman Donald Trump; retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson; Florida Sen. Marco Rubio; Texas Sen. Ted Cruz; former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush; former HP CEO Carly Fiorina; Ohio Gov. John Kasich; and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. The candidates qualifying for the earlier, 7 p.m. ET debate are: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie; former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee; Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal; and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum. The criteria were different than for past debates. In a change, Christie and Huckabee ‎did not qualify for the prime-time event, while former New York Gov. George Pataki and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham did not qualify for either; neither did ex-Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore. To qualify for the prime-time debate, a candidate had to score 2.5 percent or higher in an average of the four most recent national polls. Candidates scoring under that had to receive at least 1 percent support in at least one of the four most recent national polls to qualify for the 7 p.m. debate.The four polls used were conducted by: Fox News; Investor’s Business Daily/TIPP; Quinnipiac University; and The Wall Street Journal/NBC News.” [Fox News]CONFLICTING POLL HEADLINES ON FOREIGN POLICY Fox News and AP-GfK both released polls measuring public sentiment about Obama’s planned actions in Afghanistan and the Middle East, but with contrasting findings. Fox News: “A 54-percent majority of American voters approves of President Obama’s decision to send a small number of U.S. troops to Syria to help in the fight against the Islamic extremist group ISIS. … In addition, by a 49-38 percent margin, voters approve of Obama’s decision to delay withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.” The AP: “More than 6 in 10 now reject Obama's handling of the threat posed by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, where Obama has been escalating the U.S. military's involvement in a bid to break a vexing stalemate. ... Concerns about Obama's strategy overseas resonate deeply when it comes to Afghanistan, where Obama abruptly dropped his plans last month to pull nearly all U.S. forces by end of 2016. Roughly a third of Americans said they approve of that revamped plan, with one-third opposed and another third neither in favor nor against.” [Fox News, AP] Why the difference? - For one thing, the polls were conducted almost two weeks apart As the AP article noted, “The AP-GfK poll was conducted before Obama's announcement last week that up to 50 U.S. special operations troops will head to northern Syria.” Fox News asked whether respondents approve or disapprove of the specific policy Obama announced, while AP-GfK asked more generally if respondents approve of how Obama is handling ISIS. In addition, the questions about Afghanistan were structured differently. Fox News asked whether respondents “approve or disapprove” of delaying the troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, and AP-GfK asked whether respondents “favor, oppose, or neither favor nor oppose” the plan. The explicit “neither” option in the AP-GfK poll attracted nearly a third of respondents, whereas in the Fox News poll respondents didn’t have a middle option -- and only 12 percent volunteered a “don’t know” response. “CONTROL” MATTERS IN ASKING ABOUT GUN LAWS “In a test of how language influences attitudes, half of the respondents were asked one question and the other respondents were asked a question with different wording: Support for 'stricter gun control laws,' asked of the first group, is a negative 46 - 51 percent; Support for 'stricter gun laws,' without the word 'control,' asked of the second group, is 52 - 45 percent. Republican voters oppose either option by wide margins, while Democrats support either option by similarly wide margins. The most pronounced difference is among independent voters who oppose 'stricter gun control laws' 57 - 39 percent, but support 'stricter gun laws' 50 - 45 percent.” [Quinnipiac]THIS WEEK'S POLLS-Marco Rubio rises to third place in two New Hampshire polls, with Chris Christie also getting boost.

To put it into perspective, the company did $5 billion in revenue for its 2015 fiscal year.""We’ve looked at every single female employee's salary,"" Benioff said at the Fortune Global Forum on Tuesday. ""So we can say we pay women the same as we pay men."" ""My job is to make sure that women are treated 100 percent equally at Salesforce in pay, opportunity and advancement,"" Benioff told The Huffington Post earlier this year when he announced that the company would audit everyone's pay.Salesforce expects this to be an ongoing process that it will continually monitor, head of HR Cindy Robbins explained in a blog post in September. Plenty of companies analyze salary for pay inequities, but typically they're looking for red flags that would lead to discrimination lawsuits. And they're rarely public about the work. What Salesforce is doing -- trying to achieve pay equality and speaking loudly about it -- is different. The tech company has already inspired others, including Pinterest, to take a look at their pay practices. Salesforce's efforts send a strong message about what can be done for women in the workplace when leadership makes a real effort. Benioff's push for equality has also led to an increase in promotions for women at the firm. Thirty-two percent of female employees at Salesforce were promoted in a 12-month period ending in July, compared to 24 percent in the year prior, Robbins wrote in her blog post.The gender pay gap is a problem both within companies and throughout the economy. Women make 74 cents to a man's dollar in the U.S., according to a report out this week from PayScale. Even when you control for job type, experience or college major, the gap persists, HuffPost reporter Shane Ferro wrote on Thursday.""The message is pretty clear: Time to give women a promotion and a raise,"" said Ferro.Benioff got that message from two of his own female employees -- Leyla Seka, a vice president, and Robbins. They approached him about the pay issue earlier this year, sparking the pay audit of the company's more than 17,000 employees.Benioff was already thinking about encouraging women at Salesforce. He'd launched an internal program -- called Women's Surge -- in 2013, with an eye to putting more women in leadership positions.Seka was one of those women who rose in the company because of the ""Surge,"" she told HuffPost in April. ""I feel lucky to work for a CEO that is passionately devoted to creating a workforce that we want,"" she said. Seka and Robbins told Forbes that they hope Salesforce's efforts will inspire other companies. ""We want an equal world,"" Seka said.Like its peers in the tech industry, Salesforce has a male-heavy workforce, particularly on the technical side: Men hold 77 percent of tech roles at the company. And women hold only 19 percent of leadership position -- though that's up from 15 percent a year ago. “We have a ways to go,” Mr. Benioff told the New York Times in July. “If we started the company again, we would have a 50-50 ratio among employees, engineers and leaders. But once you get this big, it’s hard.”You can't go back in time, but, as he's proving now, there's plenty of other things you can do."

Teen Tatiana Ticknor asked him how schools can work to reduce stereotyping and racism against American Indian and Alaska Native students. In response, Obama talked about the negative impact offensive Native American mascots and imagery can have on students and praised sports apparel company Adidas for its offer Thursday to provide financial assistance to schools looking to replace Native American mascots. ""In terms of eliminating racism or stereotypes, that’s an obligation of the entire society, but it's especially important in the school,"" Obama said. ""If you walk into a school on the first day and you're already feeling that stereotypes are embedded in the culture and the cheers and all that, that kid is feeling set apart and different.""""I want to give credit to Adidas,"" he continued. ""They've really come up with a smart, creative approach, which is to say: If we can't get states to pass laws to prohibit these mascots, then how can we incentivize schools to think differently?""Psychologists and sociologists maintain that Native American mascots and imagery can have a negative impact on the self-esteem of Native youth by portraying outdated or offensive stereotypes. Adidas North America president Mark King echoed these sentiments in a statement released Thursday. ""High school social identities are central to the lives of young athletes, so it's important to create a climate that feels open to everyone who wants to compete,"" he said.The movement to replace Native American mascots has gained steam recently. In October, California passed a law that prohibits public schools from using the term ""Redskins"" as a nickname or mascot.In a speech immediately before the panel, Obama also praised the resilience of Native American students -- who face high rates of suicide, poverty and dropping out of high school -- and emphasized his commitment to their success.""When we talk about the future of Indian country, we’re really talking about the future of young people. I don’t need to tell you the enormous challenges they face,"" he said. ""A lot of the young people I've met have gone through a lot more than anybody should have to go through during a lifetime at a very early age.""""But for all our young people have endured, the young people I’ve met have also given me incredible hope,"" he added. ""I see so much promise in them, so much determination.""The conference came on the same day the Departments of Education and the Interior announced $2.5 million in grants to help tribes bolster and take more control of their education programs. Several months ago, the White House began distributing $5.3 million in separate Native Youth Community Project (NYCP) grants to tribal communities to help make youth more college-and-career ready.Indeed, the White House has made engaging Native American youth a priority in recent years. Obama has ""visited more Indian country than any sitting president,"" he noted at the conference. At the 2014 White House Tribal Nations Gathering, the administration announced the launch of an initiative called Generation Indigenous, which gives increased funding to tribal communities. The initiative also created the first ever Tribal Youth Gathering this summer, at which first lady Michelle Obama spoke. However, there is still much to be done. Last fall, federal officials traveled the country to hear more about the lives of Native youth during a listening tour organized by the White House Initiative on American Indian and Alaska Native Education and the Office for Civil Rights. Much of what they heard focused on academic challenges and bullying, a recently released report on that listening tour shows.""Ninety-five percent of American Indian and Alaska Natives attend schools where they are less than 10 percent of the population,"" William Mendoza, the initiative's executive director, told The Huffington Post in October. ""This population is not only underserved and underrepresented, but they're darn near invisible.""Still, in a survey of Native youth HuffPost conducted with United National Indian Tribal Youth this summer, many young adults also expressed optimism for the future. “We see all of the negative statistics, and the youth themselves know that when it comes to social ills, they are among the worst in terms of suicide, teen pregnancy, drug abuse, you name it,” said UNITY Executive Director Mary Kim Titla. “They are keenly aware of that -- and despite that, the majority of them, I would say, are committed to overcoming all barriers and want to be among positive statistics.”"

""High school social identities are central to the lives of young athletes, so it's important to create a climate that feels open to everyone who wants to compete,"" he said.The movement to replace Native American mascots has gained steam recently. In October, California passed a law that prohibits public schools from using the term ""Redskins"" as a nickname or mascot.In a speech immediately before the panel, Obama also praised the resilience of Native American students -- who face high rates of suicide, poverty and dropping out of high school -- and emphasized his commitment to their success.""When we talk about the future of Indian country, we’re really talking about the future of young people. I don’t need to tell you the enormous challenges they face,"" he said. ""A lot of the young people I've met have gone through a lot more than anybody should have to go through during a lifetime at a very early age.""""But for all our young people have endured, the young people I’ve met have also given me incredible hope,"" he added. ""I see so much promise in them, so much determination.""The conference came on the same day the Departments of Education and the Interior announced $2.5 million in grants to help tribes bolster and take more control of their education programs. Several months ago, the White House began distributing $5.3 million in separate Native Youth Community Project (NYCP) grants to tribal communities to help make youth more college-and-career ready.Indeed, the White House has made engaging Native American youth a priority in recent years. Obama has ""visited more Indian country than any sitting president,"" he noted at the conference. At the 2014 White House Tribal Nations Gathering, the administration announced the launch of an initiative called Generation Indigenous, which gives increased funding to tribal communities. The initiative also created the first ever Tribal Youth Gathering this summer, at which first lady Michelle Obama spoke. However, there is still much to be done. Last fall, federal officials traveled the country to hear more about the lives of Native youth during a listening tour organized by the White House Initiative on American Indian and Alaska Native Education and the Office for Civil Rights. Much of what they heard focused on academic challenges and bullying, a recently released report on that listening tour shows.""Ninety-five percent of American Indian and Alaska Natives attend schools where they are less than 10 percent of the population,"" William Mendoza, the initiative's executive director, told The Huffington Post in October. ""This population is not only underserved and underrepresented, but they're darn near invisible.""Still, in a survey of Native youth HuffPost conducted with United National Indian Tribal Youth this summer, many young adults also expressed optimism for the future. “We see all of the negative statistics, and the youth themselves know that when it comes to social ills, they are among the worst in terms of suicide, teen pregnancy, drug abuse, you name it,” said UNITY Executive Director Mary Kim Titla. “They are keenly aware of that -- and despite that, the majority of them, I would say, are committed to overcoming all barriers and want to be among positive statistics.”"

""Something could happen anytime between now and [the premiere]. And a lot of it is going to be driven by Tarantino, who is nothing if not predictable.""Pasco said the plan isn't a threat of physical violence. It will aim to hurt Tarantino ""in the only way that seems to matter to him, and that's economically,"" he said.Whether union members can hit Tarantino in the wallet remains to be seen. The Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, a union representing New York City police, the Los Angeles Police Protective League, and the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police all have called for a boycott of his films.That said, the media circus surrounding Tarantino's original statement has turned new eyes toward his upcoming film, which premieres on Christmas Day.Cops are enraged because of what Tarantino said at a rally in Manhattan in October. ""I'm a human being with a conscience,"" he told the crowd. ""And if you believe there's murder going on then you need to rise up and stand up against it. I'm here to say I'm on the side of the murdered."" Tarantino took plenty of flak after the quote, and recently appeared on MSNBC to defend himself. ""Just because I was at an anti-police-brutality protest doesn't mean I'm anti-police,"" he said."

""Unless you count piano lessons,"" he said. But that's hardly hindered his success. Burwell is perhaps best known for his decades-long collaboration with the Coen brothers, whose films ""Miller's Crossing,"" ""Fargo"" and ""True Grit,"" among others, are enlivened by his musical prowess. Last month, the Middleburg Film Festival paid homage to the composer with a live performance of his works by the Loudoun Symphony Orchestra. In a conversation with critic Ann Hornaday, Burwell shared his thoughts on music and the movies. Music plays a recognizable role in film, working to underscore rather than overpower the actors' performances. Burwell's mastered this nuance. ""I only notice the music in the film if there's something really wrong or something really right,"" he explained. ""Taking into account a couple of films that I've worked on, for example, 'No Country for Old Men,' we found that the presence of anything that sounded like music at all repressed the feeling of anxiety and made things feel a little less tense. And of course, the film's whole value is this dry tension. So the music that's in that movie is snuck in underneath wind or underneath car sounds so you hopefully never notice the score.""Conversely, Burwell's score for ""Carol"" -- the impossibly beautiful Todd Haynes film, with knockout performances from Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara -- is boldly placed, memorable and exceedingly appropriate. ""The last scene of [""Carol""] has no dialogue, nothing else, and the music is very loud and very upfront,"" said Burwell. ""Todd Haynes is a melodramatist and he likes the music to be like that, almost more up front than I would choose, but I knew that's what he wanted. It should be whatever is going to make the most dramatic experience for the audience."" ""Carol"" explores a life-altering relationship between a headstrong, wealthy housewife (Blanchett) and a quietly courageous store clerk (Mara), in a time when such love affairs were to be kept silent. ""Really what the score is there to do is to speak,"" Burwell said. ""The culture they are in hasn't given them the language with which to describe their feelings. [...] We are watching the carefully paced development of love and at first comes desire, which is not easy to put into words ever but the music is behind a lot of that pacing, that development of the relationship."" As film scores are used to manipulate emotions as often as to inform the audience, Burwell approaches his vocation as dynamic, transitional. ""You can see over the history of the movies that what's acceptable has changed. In movies from the '40s, they're telling you who everyone is and what they're like. It's on top of, if not a little ahead of the action. What I prefer is very much the opposite, to leave the audience a little more uncertain about what's going on,"" he said. ""But there is also an element of attempting to find something in the film that's not already there on the screen and speak to that, bring that out. Sometimes that means bringing something that's completely different on the screen. And you can call that irony, but I think it doesn't always serve an ironic purpose, I think that sometimes it can just be another layer. Sometimes music isn't playing what's there, but it's still informing it in some other way.""Skilled emotional manipulators in their own right, the notoriously unconventional Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan, have tapped Burwell again and again over the past 30 years. ""We talk before they shoot about what the problem the movie presents,"" Burwell said. ""So for 'True Grit,' it was that it was a Western, but we didn't want to necessarily do a Western score. I read the book, I read their script and I noticed one of the things that isn't in the script is that the book is written from the point of view of this girl, and she's constantly reading scripture. I thought that the churchiness wasn't in the script, so I thought we'd use hymns in the score of the movie. But sometimes I don't know until we have the picture."" Despite hours spent dissecting their scripts, Burwell remains frequently perplexed by the filmmakers. ""They are very taciturn though, I do miss the face-to-face because on the phone they are people of very few words. They hate to ever talk about what their movies are about, so sometimes it can be difficult to claw out of them, they refuse to discuss the meaning. So it's a challenge."" Starring George Clooney, Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum,""Hail, Caesar!"" marks Burwell's latest effort with the Coen brothers. ""We had to try so many things because it's a film with many films within it,"" Burwell explained. ""There are five or six films within the film, and they're all different styles: there's a Western, there's a Roman swords-and-sandals movie, an Esther Williams water ballet, and the question becomes how they come together to make one movie. It's something we're still figuring out."" In order to get a piece of music out of his head, Burwell says all he has to do is record it. He's amassed a collection of over 1,500 works yet to be used in film.""I'm always looking for something new to listen to. I don't have a lot of listening time because I'm often writing, so I don't listen to as much as I used to,"" he said. ""I'm not worried about unconscious influences because influences are good and important, but I actually have a very poor memory for music,"" Burwell said. ""That's why I improvise, I write something and record it and that way I can remember it. If I'm worried about something, I ask my wife and she can tell me if I stole it.
