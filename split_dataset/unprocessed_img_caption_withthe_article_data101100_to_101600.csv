Businesses make mistakes almost daily, and industries can transform rapidly, eroding even a market leader’s competitive advantage.Companies that are struggling may have declining fundamentals, such as revenues and earnings. Ultimately, however, it is the market that determines how well, or poorly, a company is run. All of the eight businesses identified by 24/7 Wall St. as America’s worst run companies declined in three key measures — earnings per share, revenue, and share price — in the last year.In order to be considered truly poorly run, a company must have a track record of missed opportunities, mismanaged risks, poor operational decisions, or executive malfeasance. In short, a company must demonstrate a pattern of decision making that calls into question the ability of its management and directors to adequately provide returns to shareholders.While the U.S. stock market has enjoyed a rally in the past five years, the worst run companies reviewed by 24/7 Wall St. failed to match the S&P 500 rise of 82% during that time. Some of these companies have actually lost market value over that stretch. Avon Products (NYSE: AVP) is the most notable example. Avon’s share price tumbled nearly 74% over the last five years, as its China business transformed from a huge growth opportunity into a boondoggle.Some of the poorly managed companies have missed opportunities on which others capitalized. Among the best examples is McDonald’s (NYSE: MCD), which did not follow fast-casual rivals in creating a menu that was simplified and customizable. GameStop (NYSE: GME), too, missed a major opportunity to make a name for itself in digital distribution for video games, a market that game maker Valve entered over a decade ago when it launched Steam.In other instances, companies have made poor operational decisions. An example is the slow pace at which Staples (NASDAQ: SPLS) has closed locations. Staples built an online business without adequately downsizing its brick-and-mortar locations, even though sales did not justify the large number of stores.Click here to see the worst run companiesIn some cases, management decisions may not have had shareholders’ best interests at heart. Freeport-McMoRan’s (NYSE: FCX) acquisition of two oil producers in 2012 immediately raised questions of self-dealing and led to a shareholder lawsuit. The lawsuit alleged that, with six board members holding seats on one of the companies involved, Freeport directors were effectively using company funds to bail out their own investment.Many of these companies are not without hope. McDonald’s could outperform if it is able to again draw in customers with an improved menu. Mattel (NYSE: MAT), too, might surge if kids rediscover the appeal of Barbie. And IBM (NYSE: IBM) may rise if the company becomes more competitive in cloud computing.In order to determine America’s worst run companies, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed all S&P 500 stocks that declined in the past year. We then screened for companies where the trailing 12-month revenue and diluted earnings per share had declined from the year before. 24/7 Wall St. editors then reviewed this list for companies that had missed major opportunities to expand, made operational choices that undermined their financial performance over a multiyear period, or whose managers and directors failed to adequately serve shareholder interests. Figures on revenue and diluted EPS, as well as industry classifications, are from S&P CapIQ. One-year share price data, also from CapIQ, is as of December 8, 2014.These are America’s Worst Run Companies"

I've seen it performed several times, watched the DVD of the original Broadway production many times, and lost count of how often I've listened to the original cast album.As a writer, I'm awed by Sondheim's trademark wit, his long elegant vocal lines, his surprising rhymes, his dark humor, his complex music. I was worried that the Disney musical would be too cute, but I was wrong; it's fairly true to the spirit of his work. Disney's found ways through cinematography and specials effects to capture the heart and soul of a bittersweet American masterpiece.The movie is full of surprises. Emily Blunt and Meryl Streep have rich expressive voices and break your heart. Johnny Depp is appropriately creepy as the Wolf and Chris Pine isn't just a wonderful singer, he's even funnier and sexier than he was in Star Trek. He almost steals the show--uh, movie---in the beautifully staged ""Agony."" There's more: ""On the Steps of the Palace"" is absolutely brilliant and it's not the only show-stopper in the movie which looks and sounds beautiful all the way through. Well, almost. The casting of Jack is a complete dud. Perhaps to appeal to kids, Disney picked the actor who played Gavroche in Les Misérables. He doesn't have the acting or singing chops to put over ""Giants in the Sky""--his diction and accent turn a soaring hymn into mush. But just think of it as ""a peculiar passing moment""--in the words of the Baker's wife--and let it go.There are other gaps. The ""Mysterious Man"" isn't here in person. Lyrics are trimmed throughout and the two Princes only sing together once. More seriously, ""No More"" is cut, and it's a pivotal song that makes the Baker turn and face his responsibilities. Perhaps most sadly, most of the ensembles have been axed, and so you lose Sondheim's glorious harmonies and the true sense of solidarity built through ""No One is Alone."" You also lose that amazing group finale on screen which is all about the never-ending journey into darkness towards self-discovery: ""Into the woods, each time you go/There's more to learn of what you know."" So the movie ends with pathos rather than bravado.But hey, none of that should stop you from seeing Into the Woods, because it's deeply moving and sometimes even spectacular. And then you can go home and watch the truly terrific Bernadette Peters and Joanna Gleason in the Broadway production on BluRay to fill in all the gaps.

""I have done and I am doing everything to ensure a president is elected and snap elections are averted,"" Samaras said.Samaras repeated an invitation to other parties to cooperate in exchange for an agreement to hold elections late next year but offered few concrete details.He dismissed Syriza's plan to renegotiate the multi-billion euro bailout agreement with the European Union and International Monetary Fund and roll back the austerity policies imposed under the program as a ""joke,"" accusing it of ""political blackmail.""His comment came on the same day German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble warned that any Greek government would have to respect commitments already made by Athens.Samaras' uncompromising tone suggests he is looking past Monday's vote towards an election campaign.""If there are elections, we will win, I can feel it,"" he said. ""I don't believe Greek people will accept being led back with easy promises to the edge of the cliff where they were two-and-a-half years ago.""""Even though elections would be convenient for me, I want to see the ship safely into port,"" he said.Syriza dismissed his comments, accusing Samaras of being ""obsessed with power.""An opinion poll on Saturday by the Alco polling institute showed Syriza leading over New Democracy by 3.3 points, a slightly narrower lead than in the previous poll. If elections were held now, Syriza would get 28.3 percent while Samaras' New Democracy would get 25 percent.Another poll by Kapa Research put Syriza on 27.2 percent, 2.5 points ahead of New Democracy on 24.7 percent.

It appeared to be working again Monday evening.Pastor Mark Driscoll may be aiming for comeback.The disgraced evangelical preacher, who recently resigned from the Seattle megachurch network he spent 18 years building, has reportedly launched a website filled with sermons and other free resources.News about the website emerged just days before Mars Hill Church formally dissolves on Dec. 31, Seattle PI reports.Along with offering sermons and free ebooks, the website also asks for donations. It claims the funds will be sent to “Learning For Living,” an “application-pending registered 501(c)3 nonprofit organization.” Mark DeMoss, a friend who serves as Driscoll's pro bono spokesperson, told HuffPost that the pastor recently set up Learning For Living to manage his Bible teaching content, since he can't provide content through Mars Hill anymore. It is a low-key operation with no paid staff. He simply wanted a way to make sermon and written content available, much of it for free, some of it for a contribution, and is doing so now at markdriscoll.org. Learning for Living is the non-profit organization name through which people can contribute and/or order materials. He just got it up and running in recent days.The Huffington Post used the IRS’ “Exempt Organizations Select Check” to search for an organization in Washington state named “Learning for Living” that is currently eligible to receive tax-deductible charitable contributions. The search yielded no results on Tuesday.Patheos blogger Warren Throckmorton noted that that Driscoll’s website was registered to the Mars Hill Fellowship. In fact, Driscoll's design closely resembles the church’s current site. However, Mars Hill’s current Communications & Editorial Manager Justin Dean told The Huffington Post that the similarities end there: That domain is one that Mars Hill has had registered for quite some time but we never used. It has now been transferred to Mark Driscoll, and the domain registration to Mars Hill Fellowship is outdated (I believe it is now updated). The site is in no way affiliated with Mars Hill Church or Mars Hill Fellowship.Driscoll has largely stayed under the radar since his resignation in October. He did, however, preach briefly at the Gateway Church Conference in Dallas-Ft. Worth. He told the crowd that his family was receiving death threats, and asked for prayers.“I’ve cried a lot lately,” he said. “It’s been a rough season for the family.”The pastor’s fall from grace can be traced back to a number of factors -- including allegations of plagiarism, crude comments he made online under a pseudonym, and questions about church finances. He was removed from the church planting group Acts29 last August, according to Seattle PI.However, the bio on his website omits that stain on Driscoll's reputation. It simply notes that Driscoll is the organization’s co-founder, while listing other redeeming qualities.Pastor Mark Driscoll is a Jesus-following, mission-leading, church-serving, people-loving, Bible-preaching pastor. . . With a skillful mix of bold presentation, accessible teaching, and unrelenting compassion for those who are hurting the most—particularly women who are victims of sexual and physical abuse and assault—Pastor Mark has taken biblical Christianity into cultural corners rarely explored by evangelicals.But can Driscoll's reputation survive the fall? According to megachurch expert Scott Thumma, it depends on how many people he can draw back into his fold. “If (Driscoll) can continue to draw people in and have a successful ministry, then his authority — even if it has been questioned — will still rest on what he’s producing,” Thumma told RNS."

Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook, has been the subject of much ire following his decision to oust top editor Franklin Foer. ""The country suffered a great loss this year with the destruction of The New Republic at the hands of its callow and incompetent owner, Chris Hughes,"" Brooks wrote. ""Before it was obliterated a few weeks ago, it churned out the usual stream of outstanding essays.""Following Hughes' decision to replace Foer with former Gawker editor Gabriel Snyder, dozens of New Republic editors and writers resigned in protest. Additionally, several contributing editors, like New York magazine's Jonathan Chait and The New Yorker's Ryan Lizza, demanded that their names be removed from the masthead. The departing journalists claimed Hughes and CEO Guy Vidra have turned their backs on the groundbreaking work that the magazine was known for. ""The New Republic is a kind of public trust,"" the editors wrote in an open letter. ""That is something all its previous owners and publishers understood and respected. The legacy has now been trashed, the trust violated.""Even New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet has piled on.In addition to pushing out Foer, Hughes and Vidra also cut the magazine's annual issues from 20 to 10.Hughes responded to the backlash earlier this month in an essay for The Washington Post.""If you really care about an institution and want to make it strong for the ages, you don’t walk out,"" Hughes wrote."

(Photo by Ulet Ifansasti/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e4f03102300008b040bec09.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Sadna SamaranayakeDecember 26 marks the 10 year anniversary of one of the worst natural disasters we have witnesses in our time. The Asian Tsunami claimed nearly 230,000 lives across Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India and Thailand. About 35,000 of those lives were lost in Sri Lanka, my native country, where thousands were slowly waking up, or choosing to sleep in on the day after Christmas. In the decade since, I have returned to Sri Lanka many times, as a relief worker, as a development sector professional, and as a native daughter. I was one of the lucky ones. I did not lose anyone dear to me in the tsunami. Instead I had the privilege of meeting countless mothers, fathers and children who continue to persevere despite having once lost absolutely everything. The decade has left me with two deeply ingrained lessons: Firstly, that humanity has a seemingly boundless capacity for resilience. And secondly, that hope has no bastion, no champion, like a determined mother. This week 10 years ago, I watched CNN's Anderson Cooper interview family after family in front of ruins and remnants of their lives from the comfort of my Portland suburban home. As I stayed glued to my TV, I felt a weight and force within me so overwhelming that I suddenly understood how the terms ""heavy hearted"" and ""gut-wrenching"" had taken root in the English language. I listened for the stories being told in my mother tongue, Sinhala, and tuned out the dubbed-over translation. It angered me that the English sound bites were so woefully inadequate at capturing the full and searing depth of these survivors' pain. With everything lost, wasn't the least they deserved to have their stories told with the same raw, open-eyed and open-hearted honesty that they shared them with? Story after story; devastation, resilience, hope, more devastation. At times the intensity of the emotion, and the empathy that gushes with the familiarity of your own people looking at you from behind the glass and telling you their stories in your language, all that nuance and sub-text that you perfectly understand... sometimes it was all too much. At the time I ran a tech start up in Portland, and wanted desperately to work in international development instead. It would happen eventually, I kept telling myself. Eventually was now I decided, so I called the Red Cross. I called Mercy Corps. I offered my language skills and time for free. I had a degree in international development. I was willing to travel and do pretty much anything. But I had no experience... A few months later, I did end up getting to Sri Lanka, largely because the support of loved ones and family who encouraged me to forget about conventional ways to work in the development sector. Start your own small non-profit, they urged. Once on the ground, the learning was unrelentingly fast, brutal, and overwhelming.Ten years later the one word that sums up the impression that Sri Lanka has left me with is ""resilient."" This resilience is cast in stories that are debilitating just to hear, like the mother of four who lost every single one of her children including her youngest who was celebrating his birthday when the wave came into their home, and another mother who helped to save three of her neighbor's children but could not save her own. And yet, these are stories that these individuals live through, survive, imbibe, and inexplicably seem to propel them forward in service of others in their community. Humanity has a seemingly boundless capacity for resilience. Resilience is the ability to recover from difficulties, to bounce back; it's the capacity of humans, systems and organizations to adapt and to bend, so that they don't break. We all know of someone who has overcome devastating circumstances. And that someone, hopefully, strives and thrives still. Resilience in the face of loss of livelihood, support systems, and loved ones is an unimaginable and yet daily reality in the lives of some, particularly the ultra-poor and chronically marginalized.In the development sector, a focus on resilience has gained steady momentum. Organizations from the World Bank to Rockefeller Foundation are emphasizing resilience in their programming efforts. If the past 10 years in Sri Lanka is any indication, they are on to something. It's good business to invest where capacities are ready and latent. While individually, we may tire and fail at times, collective human resilience appears to be an inexhaustible, limitless and very natural human resource. Key to resilience is hope, and if there has been one other lesson that I have learned, it is this: Hope has no bastion, no champion, no natural home like a determined mother. It's a different kind of hell hath no fury, really... The development sector has made a point over the last decade to focus on the girl child, and women. I have seen firsthand how and why this makes sense. It's not just that women spend money in ways that reinforce the family, or that they emulate behaviors and values, or impart education to their children. Their natural capacity for hope for their children and for their communities against all odds is a formidable force that can only amplify the best of NGO interventions. I no longer work for the small nonprofit I started, that took me to Sri Lanka and into the development sector. I now work for the largest development NGO in the world called BRAC. BRAC has its own story of resilience in Sri Lanka. Founded over 40 years ago in Bangladesh, BRAC came to Sri Lanka right after the Tsunami to assist a neighboring country in its greatest time of need, and then charted an unlikely course for a relief initiative. From 2005 to 2014, BRAC transitioned from an aid organization utilizing foreign aid to provide emergency relief and rehabilitation in the wake of the tsunami, to becoming the largest microfinance institution in the country, to entering the for-profit financial services sector and finally engineering a sale and departure from the market. Few organizations respond to a natural disaster with a view to sustainability and exit. On the ten-year anniversary of the disaster BRAC has released a case study on its experience in Sri Lanka, ""From Aid to Enterprise: BRAC's Evolution from Relief to Sustainable Financial Services in Sri Lanka"" chronicling this story.Today, almost anywhere on Sri Lanka's coastline, you would hardly know the magnitude of horrors endured there. I've witnessed caring and curious tourists asking hotel staff, waiters and new friends, ""Was this particular establishment affected? Were you in the tsunami?"" Invariably, the resilient and the hopeful smile a knowing smile and tell the stories that are theirs to tell.10 years on, let's take a moment to remember lives lost, and fundamentally changed in an instant. And let's pause to reflect and wonder at the resilience and hope within all of us."

""I wish...,"" they each sing as the film begins, convinced that the one thing that eludes them is the only thing that can make them happy.The heart of the film lies in a select few of these characters: The Baker (James Corden) and his wife (Emily Blunt), childless and desperate to break the curse that keeps them from having a baby; and Cinderella (Anna Kendrick), who is the object of scorn and derision by her awful step-family. And, of course, there's Jack and his poor mother and the cow and the magic beans -- and the giant. Plus Red Riding Hood and her close-encounter with a wolfish wolf, blending the threat of sex and death (Johnny Depp in an elaborate cameo).So the first half is fun: Sondheim and Lapine's clever reworking of familiar children's stories pays off in songs that pop (even if they don't stick in the brain), leading to a first-act finale in which everyone lives happily ever after.Sondheim's point, however, that there is no such thing as a happy ending, even in fairy tales.This review continues on my website."

WS/48 is a measure of how many wins a player contributes for every 48 minutes he is on the floor. All numbers courtesy of Basketball Reference)The Book of Basketball by Bill Simmons should be considered the bible for basketball fans everywhere, and its crown jewel is The Pyramid, Simmons's idea for a new basketball Hall of Fame and his ranking of the 96 best players in basketball history. The only problem: the last edition of the book came out in 2010 and clearly a lot has changed since. When the book was published: LeBron had only just signed in Miami, Chris Paul was a member of a long forgotten team called the New Orleans Hornets, and Kevin Durant had only made his first All-Star Game. Let's take a look at how our contemporary players rankings should change if we could update the list today. Kevin Durant (Career Win Shares: 89.9, WS/48: .206):Kevin had understandably not made it onto the Pyramid in 2010, but leaving him off at this point would be insane. Despite only having played eight seasons in the NBA, Durant has more career win shares than 34 players already ranked on the Pyramid. Two players already on the list he compares closely with are George Gervin at #34 and Bernard King at #58. Large small forwards who could score at will, and all without a single ring. In fact, Gervin and King both never made an appearance in the Finals, at least Durant can claim he did that in 2012. Even though Durant hasn't played for very ling, there is no justification to rank him below Bernard King. However, I'm also not quite ready to have him jump George Gervin. Until Durant claims a championship of his own, I'm going to slide him in just behind Paul Pierce at #47. Dirk Nowitzki (Career Win Shares: 187.2, WS/48: .208)Nowitzki was placed at #39 in the 2010 edition, the season before the Mavericks stunned the Big Three Miami Heat team to give a lot of veterans their first rings. With his ring, and the 15th best WS/48 of anyone on the list, Nowitzki should vault ringless players like Allen Iverson, Steve Nash, and George Gervin into the 29th spot, bumping David Robinson (who despite winning two rings, was not the best player on either team). And who is at #28? Dwyane Wade. These two are forever linked by the epic 2006 and 2011 Finals, and it is fitting to see them so close together. LeBron James (Career Win Shares: 171.2, WS/48: .242)James's ranking among the all time greats still remains almost impossible to fairly assess. Since the last ranking, James has won two Finals and two MVP's, but also lost two Finals in spectacular fashion to the Mavericks and Spurs respectively. It's hard to know whether to give credence to the LeBron is a choker argument, how do you balance his disappearance in the 2011 Finals with his evisceration of the Celtics in Games 6 and 7 of the 2012 ECF? And what do we make of the fact that he would have a career record of 1-4 in the Finals if it wasn't for Ray Allen hitting the most clutch shot in the history of the NBA?Ultimately, I think it's too hard to answer these questions about legacy for a player only turning 30 this week (How is that possible?). We also can't penalize a player with the sixth-best WS/48 and the fifteenth-best career Win Shares on the Pyramid this early in his career. For earning another two MVP's, I'm moving LeBron from #20 to #16, Doctor J's old spot. With that said, it will be a disappointment if LeBron doesn't move into the top 10 by the time he retires, and if LeBron plays another 6 or so seasons at something resembling how he's played to this point, he can pass Kareem for the most Win Shares in league history. Chris Paul (Career Win Shares: 119.6, WS/48: .249)No, that is not a mistake. According to Basketball Reference, Chris Paul has a higher WS/48 than LeBron James, and the fourth highest in NBA history. Now Win Shares isn't the gospel, if that was the case David Robertson would be the second best player of all time. Advanced stats have always loved Chris Paul for his blend of Isiah Thomas like passing with effortless scoring and a proclivity for steals on the defensive side of the floor. But not only has Chris Paul not won a ring, he hasn't advanced past the second round of the playoffs. It is really hard to overlook that. After playing out of his mind in a very memorable first round matchup against the Warriors last years, Paul was largely responsible for the Clippers late-game meltdowns against the Thunder in the second round. Of course, the Clippers were dealing with the Donald Sterling fallout last year during the playoffs, so we can't put too much value into that one series. But it is a microcosm for Paul's playoffs failures throughout his career. Paul's WS/48 in the playoffs takes a HUGE drop off, falling all the way to .189. That's not a bad number, but it is legitimate evidence to backup Paul's post-season struggles. Paul simply has to make a deep run into the playoffs this year to take some of the pressure off himself.Despite the poor postseason performances, after four more years of being the best point guard in the game, Paul deserves a bump up from #90. For now, I'm placing Paul with another consistent highlight-making, but ringless, guard in Pete Maravich, at #68. Winning a ring or coming close will push him into the 50's, and possibly even the 40's.Tim Duncan (Career Win Shares: 193.8, WS/48: .211)Duncan was already ranked #7 in the 2010 edition of the book so there is not a lot of room him to shoot up in on the list. The debate with Duncan is if he should pass Wilt Chamberlain at #6. Duncan can't compete with Chamberlain's completely ridiculous WS/48 of .248. But Duncan's late career run to two straight Finals appearances and his fifth ring might compel some to make the case for Duncan over Chamberlain. However, under any real analysis, if Duncan wasn't better than Chamberlain in 2010, the past four years haven't moved the needle. Over the past four years, Duncan has averaged about .178 WS/48. Over the last four years of his career, Chamberlain averaged .214 WS/48, and added three Finals appearances and a ring. Everybody loves Duncan, and he's clearly a first-ballot Hall Of Famer, but I can't buy the argument of putting him over Chamberlain despite his recent postseason heroics. To cap it off, I have a plea for a non-active player to make the Pyramid:Yao Ming (Career Win Shares: 65.9, WS/48: .200)Who is the only starter who played post-merger with a top 50 WS/48 that didn't make Simmon's Pyramid? Yao Ming. In Bill Simmons entry on Bill Walton, he says he would always take a few years of utter brilliance over 15 years of decent play. If that's how we're ranking players, Yao deserves a place in the Pyramid. Ming was not a flash in the pan, he played 7 years of incredibly high-level basketball. His defensive reputation sometimes takes a beating when he is discussed now, but his Defensive Win Shares compare favorably with any mortal big man. Ming wasn't the complete rebounding, defending, and passing savant Walton was, but he could do a bit of everything and was just an unstoppable scorer. For his contributions as a player and an ambassador of the game, Yao deserves a spot somewhere on the Pyramid."

And, the more astute foreign policy journalists and commentators are beginning to realize the extent of how ""liberal interventionists"" work in sync with neocon warhawks to produce and sustain a perpetual state of U.S. war.More and more ""peace and social justice"" groups are even being twisted into ""democracy promotion,"" U.S. militarism style. But rarely do we get a window to see as clearly into how this Orwellian transformation occurs as with the ""Committee in Solidarity with the People of Syria"" (CISPOS) based in Minnesota's Twin Cities, a spin-off of ""Friends for a Nonviolent World"" (FNVW), steering its Quaker-inspired founding in nonviolence to promote speakers and essayists with strong ties to the violent uprising to topple the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad, resulting in a war that has already taken some 200,000 lives.Do the real pacifist members approve? Or even know?Middle Eastern expatriates who support U.S. intervention in their countries are especially effective in promoting their message to Western audiences because they provide ""proof"" of the demonization of governments that the U.S. plans to invade and dominate, and often peace groups include these expats in presentations believing them to be representatives of an entire country.In Minneapolis, FNVW and its spin-off CISPOS hosted several events with Syrian expats who were on record as supporting the U.S. bombing of their country. (This isn't only happening in the U.S. In April 2011, a Vancouver peace group documented its objection to the fact that other Canadian ""peace"" groups were sponsoring speakers who justified and advocated ""in favor of the NATO bombing of Libya."")Often Syrian ""experts"" speaking to peace groups, such as FNVW/CISPOS's upcoming speaker, Mohja Kahf, have ties to the early destabilization of Syria. This American Prospect article documents how Najib Ghadbian, Kahf's husband of over 20 years (apparently up to last year when they divorced) was one of the Syrian dissidents who attended the early 2006 meeting with Liz Cheney (then-Vice President Dick Cheney's daughter), along with other Syrian dissidents to plan how to destabilize Syria and topple its government. Like some Syrian version of Ahmed Chalabi, the neocons' choice to run post-invasion Iraq, Kahf's husband apparently got himself invited to Liz Cheney's ""Iran-Syria Operations Group"" by having signed the ""Damascus Declaration"" in 2005, the year before.When Najib and Mohja sat down for a long 2011 interview with The Arkansas Traveler, they discussed their involvement with the Syrian Revolution, even joking about Ghadbian becoming the next Prime Minister. Kahf and Ghadbian reportedly divorced in 2013 but when CISPOS-FNVW first published her long essays, they were still appearing together at Syrian revolutionary meetings and speaking forums. Additionally, CISPOS's latest handout (December 2014) lists Ghadbian's organization, www.etilaf.us (The National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary Forces) as a resource ""For More Information on Syria and How to Help.""Resources for information on Syria often come from ""citizen journalists"" with deep ties to neocons and U.S. government sources. From the State Department's website, the $330 million in support for the Syrian opposition includes training for networks of citizen journalists, bloggers and cyber-activists to support their documentation and dissemination of information on developments in Syria.Syrian dissidents received funding from the Los Angeles-based Democracy Council, which ran a Syria-related program called the ""Civil Society Strengthening Initiative"" funded with $6.3 million from the State Department. The program is described as ""a discrete collaborative effort between the Democracy Council and local partners"" to produce, among other things, ""various broadcast concepts.""James Prince, the founder and President of the Democracy Council, is also an adviser to CyberDissidents.org, a project created in 2008 by the Jerusalem-based Adelson Institute for Strategic Studies, founded and funded by Sheldon Adelson, a patron and confidant of Benjamin Netanyahu.Other resources include postings on social media and alternative websites with sensational stories such as the anti-Assad activist ""Gay Girl in Damascus"" who turned out to be a middle-aged American man in Scotland or Syrian Danny Abdul Dayem, who was frequently interviewed using fake gun fire and flames in his interviews.With all of the information about Syria, what are we to believe as true? We know the facts about recent U.S. interventions in Middle Eastern countries. Why would Syria be any different?Afghanistan is still in shambles with the majority of the people living in extreme poverty; Libya, which had the highest GDP per capita and life expectancy on the continent, is now a failed state; Western intervention transformed Iraq from an emerging country with moderate prosperity into an impoverished country with a starving population. In the lead-up to each intervention, ""experts"" emerged to explain that while anti-imperialism is good in general and in past scenarios, this time is different. Is it?Isn't it time for war-weary Americans to wise up and stop falling for these pretexts of bringing democracy and human rights to foreign countries through training and funding of ""color (and umbrella) revolutions,"" inciting of coups and regime changes and eventually, through U.S.-NATO military might?Liberal interventionists clearly assist neocon warhawks towards their mutual goal of ""full spectrum dominance"" under the euphemistic guise of Pax Americana. Only the ""Pax"" always turns out to be endless war and occupation.--Margaret Sarfehjooy is an anti-war activist and registered nurse in Minnesota.
