So in perhaps the best possible response to a letter published last week that deemed him a bad role model, Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton acted out his character and kindness on Sunday when he gave away each of his five touchdown balls to children in the crowd.While Newton threw for each of the touchdowns, his handoffs were maybe the most notable moments of Sunday’s contest against the Washington Redskins. After each score, he’d jog to the grandstands and hand over the pigskin, to the delight of young kids wearing Panther blue. His acts of kindness came six days after The Charlotte Observer published a letter in which a woman called Newton’s on-field “dabbing” celebrations “arrogant struts” and accused him of looking “like a spoiled brat.” When Newton refused to further fuel the fire surrounding his dancing, the woman apologized for her comments, writing that she was sorry she didn't ""understand him better."" Newton had tried to deescalate tension by stating that “everybody is entitled to their own opinion. You can't fault her for that … If she feels offended, I'll apologize to her, but at the end of the day, I am who I am.""And Newton was who he was on Sunday, both when he dabbed on the Redskins and when he gave away those five footballs to the fans in the stands. So next time we accuse someone like Newton of being “a spoiled brat,” let’s look at the complete picture, watching to see what he does after the whistle is blown, when he stops dancing and heads to the sideline to bring smiles to the faces of the young kids in the crowd.Also on HuffPost:"

Prosecutors believe Francis is the first inmate in Orange and Osceola counties to be released under the new guidelines.The high-profile attorney pursued the case because he found Francis to be humble and remorseful for what he had done, said Angela Starke, a spokeswoman for Ashton’s office.“The State Attorney vividly remembers Francis’s acceptance of his responsibility, his humility and his willingness to testify against the actual killer,” Starke told The Huffington Post by email Sunday.Starke said that at the time of Francis’ trial, the teen testified against the man who pulled the trigger and killed 28-year-old Kenneth Lewis after he had been beaten, bound and gagged following a botched robbery attempt. Francis was convicted of murder and kidnapping.“Francis testified -- even though he had nothing to gain as he had already been sentenced to Life. This is an unusual and surprising attitude for a defendant with a Life sentence and the [state attorney] thought about this intermittently through the years -- to the point that when he retired in 2011, he reached out to Edward Francis to encourage him,” Starke said.Prosecutors and defense attorneys agreed on Friday that Francis did not intend to kill Lewis, though it was the judge who ultimately made the decision for his release.Outside the courthouse, friends and family gathered to greet Francis, who called himself lucky.“That was one of the best things I have ever received in my life even though I am not worthy,” he told reporters, according to WESH-TV.“I didn’t want to acknowledge it at the time but yes I was wrong for my crime and I deserved to be punished for it,” he said. “It took me to lose the freedom and it took me to actually see what the face of no love is, to actually find love.”Steven Evans, who was in his 20s when he pulled the trigger on Lewis, is on death row after being convicted of first-degree murder. A second teen, who was 16 at the time, pleaded guilty to armed kidnapping and was sentenced to 10 years in prison, the Orlando Sentinel reported.According to the terms of his release, should Francis commit a crime while out of prison, his life sentence will be reinstated.Also on HuffPost:"

So they've continued to try to shape policy relating to the region, offering punditry in the wake of each fresh crisis.It wasn't a surprise, then, that they seized on last week's tragic attacks in Paris to argue that the Islamic State group could only be eliminated by their preferred mode of U.S. intervention: large-scale troop deployment.""If it takes 50,000 troops going in there and cleaning out Raqqa, the capital of the Islamic State, do it,"" Bill Kristol said on ABC two days after the attack.We've heard this before. Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard, told the Senate in 2002 that he endorsed U.S. military action against Saddam Hussein -- despite the absence of credible links between Hussein and the Sept. 11 attacks that launched the Bush administration's War on Terror.Other cheerleaders for the war said the absence of such proof didn't matter because the strike would be an essential pre-emptive step. ""One of the things the American people learned on September 11 is that there are implacable enemies seeking to destroy us. Everybody knows that. And if those enemies are not identified and disarmed and/or destroyed, 'they will come for us,' to quote the president of the United States,"" former Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) said during the same hearing at which Kristol testified.These advocates believed the end result of a foray into Iraq would be, in Kristol's own words, ""a friendly, free and oil-producing Iraq."" The pesky skeptics warning about the risks of launching two concurrent U.S. invasions in the Middle East -- one in Iraq and one in Afghanistan -- were ignoring the potential rewards, Kristol argued. What really happened? The Bush administration invaded Iraq and made policy calls that are central to how the Islamic State group became the force the world is so worried about today. (Though there are, of course, many other reasons for the group's rise.)Just in case anyone needs a reminder of why we should treat recommendations from folks like Kristol with caution, here's a rundown of the many ways the Iraq War helped a small extremist group formed in Jordan in 1999 become the focus of the world's fears today.Disenfranchised Iraqis became well-armed recruits for the extremists. The Bush administration decided, less than a month after it toppled the Saddam Hussein regime, that it would disband Hussein's army. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis who had previously been among the most privileged in their desperate country were suddenly unemployed, though they retained all the ingenuity and discipline they had gained working for the dictator.Veteran New Yorker correspondent Dexter Filkins called the move ""probably the single most catastrophic decision of the American venture in Iraq."" Multiple Iraqi soldiers were willing to work with the Americans, and some U.S. military commanders wanted to keep the institution alive, but those messages went ignored, Filkins wrote earlier this year.After the Bush decision, many of these disenfranchised soldiers -- who were doubly alienated because they were largely Sunni, like Hussein, in a country now being run by the other major sect of Islam, the Shiites -- joined the insurgency against the U.S. presence. Deep investigations into ISIS's workings show that the group has benefited from having well-trained Sunni army lieutenants from the Saddam era in its leadership.Mismanaged Iraqi prisons ended up fostering radicals. Camp Bucca, a U.S.-run facility that held tens of thousands of Iraqi prisoners during its tenure, was once home to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi (captured by American forces in 2005) and many of the extremists who are now his top aides.Military veteran Andrew Thompson and University of Texas at Austin professor Jeremy Suri referred to the prison and other detention centers as ""virtual terrorist universities"" in The New York Times last October, saying they gave radicals captive audiences and hubs they could use to grow. Those extremists were able to exert influence over former members of Hussein's Baath Party and regular small-time criminals, pressuring them to join the insurgency and accept their twisted version of Islam if they wanted to avoid retribution.Though the U.S. military instituted programs to counter radicalization, it wasn't clear whether those efforts had any impact. After Bush transferred thousands of potentially enraged detainees to Iraqi custody under a 2008 agreement, hundreds of them were released -- fresh with bomb-making expertise and other dangerous skills.Iraq became a lightning rod for regional players. Bush's adventure had a ripple effect throughout the Middle East that empowered violent radicals. Just a year after the U.S. invasion of Iraq, extremist groups were already gaining recruits thanks to the propaganda value of an unpopular, visibly ineffective occupation.""Al-Qaeda has added Iraq to its list of grievances. With Osama Bin Laden's public encouragement, up to 1,000 foreign jihadists may have infiltrated Iraq,"" the International Institute for Strategic Studies reported in October 2004. U.S. officials testified before Congress about the trend the following year. At the same time, more established anti-American forces in the Middle East -- notably, the regimes in Syria and Iran -- saw the massive U.S. presence in Iraq as a juicy target and began ramping up their support to extremists who would later attack U.S. soldiers, undermine stability in Iraq and, you guessed it, help ISIS grow.Dictatorial Syrian President Bashar Assad allowed thousands of extremists to move through Syria to Iraq (even as he aided the CIA's torture program), and Iran's top intelligence agency supported al Qaeda in Iraq as recently as 2012, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. The group eventually became the Islamic State group's predecessor.Iraq was left with a divided, uneven political system. The Bush administration decided that power in Iraq should be split three ways: between Sunni Arabs, Shiite Arabs and Kurds. That simplistic approach -- still encouraged in some corners in Washington -- ignored other important dynamics of class or religion. (Most Kurds, for instance, are Muslims with some sectarian identity, and many secular Iraqis like prominent politician and one-time presidential candidate Ayad Allawi do not see their loyalties as sectarian -- Allawi has worked closely with Sunnis.)Any distribution of power on this basis should have accounted for factors like Sunnis' worries about disenfranchisement, given their previous dominance under Saddam, and many Shiite politicians' links to Iran, which has little interest in keeping Iraq united or seeing power devolved to the Sunnis. That failure to guarantee Sunni Arab buy-in for the central Iraqi government helped the anti-American insurgency -- and its most worrying component, al Qaeda in Iraq.Though U.S. engagement with Sunni tribes during the 2007 surge and ""Sunni Awakening"" helped undercut those radicals, Sunnis' relationships with the Shiite-dominated government in Baghdad remained precarious. The Islamic State group, then known as the Islamic State in Iraq, exploited those worries to target top Sunnis loyal to the Baghdad government as it become clear that the Americans would be leaving and might take fragile sectarian unity away with them.There are scores of other reasons for ISIS's growth. President Barack Obama's approach to Iraq did not help.The Republican complaint about ISIS being a product of Obama's troop withdrawal from Iraq in 2011 is largely baseless, given that U.S. troops could not have remained in the country without an agreement that the Iraqi government was not willing to sign.But the Obama administration did support controversial Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki for years after it became clear that he was not serious about working with Sunnis in Iraq, and did not attempt to increase aid to Iraq or take steps that might give Washington leverage over him.The White House didn't pressure the prime minister to step down until after Maliki's shocking treatment of Sunnis -- including the persecution of top Sunni politicians -- led Sunni Iraqis to welcome ISIS with open arms in the summer of 2014. Though his successor, Haider al Abadi, has attempted reform, his hands seem tied by the Iranian influence that Maliki allowed to grow for years under Obama's nose.Syria's Assad is another factor. He violently reacted to a largely peaceful Sunni opposition movement in 2011, sparking a civil war that gave ISIS a new power vacuum to move into. In what many see as an attempt to let the radical group look like the only alternative to his rule, Assad has helped ISIS by releasing extremists from his jails and largely ignoring its advances through his country. An Associated Press report earlier this week revealed that Assad continues to enable the extremists: last month, his regime released a militant chemical weapons expert who may end up helping ISIS.Some of the blame also goes to Turkey, for border policies ISIS has exploited; to private donors in U.S.-friendly Gulf states; and to Arab rulers who continue to suppress their populations with U.S. backing and guarantee future radicalization.Still, the consequences of the Iraq War are important for any talk of how to defeat ISIS. And they make it clear that that war's proponents are not exactly the best experts to consult in these conversations.Also on HuffPost:"

Bush's adventure had a ripple effect throughout the Middle East that empowered violent radicals. Just a year after the U.S. invasion of Iraq, extremist groups were already gaining recruits thanks to the propaganda value of an unpopular, visibly ineffective occupation.""Al-Qaeda has added Iraq to its list of grievances. With Osama Bin Laden's public encouragement, up to 1,000 foreign jihadists may have infiltrated Iraq,"" the International Institute for Strategic Studies reported in October 2004. U.S. officials testified before Congress about the trend the following year. At the same time, more established anti-American forces in the Middle East -- notably, the regimes in Syria and Iran -- saw the massive U.S. presence in Iraq as a juicy target and began ramping up their support to extremists who would later attack U.S. soldiers, undermine stability in Iraq and, you guessed it, help ISIS grow.Dictatorial Syrian President Bashar Assad allowed thousands of extremists to move through Syria to Iraq (even as he aided the CIA's torture program), and Iran's top intelligence agency supported al Qaeda in Iraq as recently as 2012, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. The group eventually became the Islamic State group's predecessor.Iraq was left with a divided, uneven political system. The Bush administration decided that power in Iraq should be split three ways: between Sunni Arabs, Shiite Arabs and Kurds. That simplistic approach -- still encouraged in some corners in Washington -- ignored other important dynamics of class or religion. (Most Kurds, for instance, are Muslims with some sectarian identity, and many secular Iraqis like prominent politician and one-time presidential candidate Ayad Allawi do not see their loyalties as sectarian -- Allawi has worked closely with Sunnis.)Any distribution of power on this basis should have accounted for factors like Sunnis' worries about disenfranchisement, given their previous dominance under Saddam, and many Shiite politicians' links to Iran, which has little interest in keeping Iraq united or seeing power devolved to the Sunnis. That failure to guarantee Sunni Arab buy-in for the central Iraqi government helped the anti-American insurgency -- and its most worrying component, al Qaeda in Iraq.Though U.S. engagement with Sunni tribes during the 2007 surge and ""Sunni Awakening"" helped undercut those radicals, Sunnis' relationships with the Shiite-dominated government in Baghdad remained precarious. The Islamic State group, then known as the Islamic State in Iraq, exploited those worries to target top Sunnis loyal to the Baghdad government as it become clear that the Americans would be leaving and might take fragile sectarian unity away with them.There are scores of other reasons for ISIS's growth. President Barack Obama's approach to Iraq did not help.The Republican complaint about ISIS being a product of Obama's troop withdrawal from Iraq in 2011 is largely baseless, given that U.S. troops could not have remained in the country without an agreement that the Iraqi government was not willing to sign.But the Obama administration did support controversial Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki for years after it became clear that he was not serious about working with Sunnis in Iraq, and did not attempt to increase aid to Iraq or take steps that might give Washington leverage over him.The White House didn't pressure the prime minister to step down until after Maliki's shocking treatment of Sunnis -- including the persecution of top Sunni politicians -- led Sunni Iraqis to welcome ISIS with open arms in the summer of 2014. Though his successor, Haider al Abadi, has attempted reform, his hands seem tied by the Iranian influence that Maliki allowed to grow for years under Obama's nose.Syria's Assad is another factor. He violently reacted to a largely peaceful Sunni opposition movement in 2011, sparking a civil war that gave ISIS a new power vacuum to move into. In what many see as an attempt to let the radical group look like the only alternative to his rule, Assad has helped ISIS by releasing extremists from his jails and largely ignoring its advances through his country. An Associated Press report earlier this week revealed that Assad continues to enable the extremists: last month, his regime released a militant chemical weapons expert who may end up helping ISIS.Some of the blame also goes to Turkey, for border policies ISIS has exploited; to private donors in U.S.-friendly Gulf states; and to Arab rulers who continue to suppress their populations with U.S. backing and guarantee future radicalization.Still, the consequences of the Iraq War are important for any talk of how to defeat ISIS. And they make it clear that that war's proponents are not exactly the best experts to consult in these conversations.Also on HuffPost:"

The mines and debris dump sites are hazardous and deadly accidents are common.As of 4 p.m. local time (0930 GMT) on Sunday, 97 bodies had been pulled from the landslide, said Tin Swe Myint, head of the Hpakant Township Administration Department.That number was expected to rise, but it remains unclear exactly how many people may be buried.""We just don't know how many people exactly were buried since we don't have any data on people living there,"" he told Reuters by telephone.""It was just a slum with these...workers living in makeshift tents. Nobody knows for sure how many and where they had come from.""Workers, many of them migrants from elsewhere in Myanmar, toil long hours in dangerous conditions for little pay searching for the precious stones.The landslide occurred at around 3 a.m. when many miners were sleeping, according to Ko Sai, a miner who was sleeping at a nearby camp.It was unclear what triggered the landslide in the mountainous region that is almost entirely off limits to foreigners.CHINESE TRADE""We just heard a loud noise sounding like thunder and saw that the huge mountain collapsed and a huge wave of rubble was moving and sprawling on a wide area,"" said Ko Sai.""It was just like a nightmare,"" he said.Tin Swe Myint said that rescue efforts were continuing and that heavy machinery was being used, but he was not hopeful survivors would be found.""I think chances of finding anyone alive are very thin,"" he said.Several companies had dumped mining debris at the 200-acre dump site, he said. The dump was near a mine controlled by Triple One Jade Mining Company, he said.An official with the Hpakant Township Fire Brigade earlier told Reuters by telephone that an estimated 100 people were still missing.Much of the jade that is mined in Hpakant is believed to be smuggled to neighboring China, where the stone is highly valued.According to researchers from environmental advocacy group Global Witness, which published a report on the opaque sector earlier this year, the value of jade production in Myanmar is estimated to have been around $31 billion in 2014.While most of that jade was destined for China, only $12.3 billion of it was accounted for in Chinese trade data, according to Global Witness.Also on HuffPost:"

Today, we've invited education expert Tony Wagner and entrepreneur and filmmaker Ted Dintersmith to imagine the school of the future. Tony is currently the Expert In Residence at Harvard University's Innovation Lab. Previously he has worked as a high school teacher, K-8 principal, university professor, and founding executive director of Educators for Social Responsibility. He is also the best-selling author of Creating Innovators: The Making of Young People Who Will Change the World, and The Global Achievement Gap.Ted is focused on issues at the intersection of innovation and education. He produced the documentary, Most Likely To Succeed, which premiered at Sundance 2015, and which Education Week called ""among the best edu-documentaries ever produced."" Most Likely To Succeed is currently being screened in schools all over the country. Tony and Ted's critically acclaimed book, Most Likely to Succeed: Preparing Our Kids for the Innovation Era, presents a new education vision which puts creativity, imagination, passion and initiative at the heart of the learning process in order to prepare kids for today's world. Gentlemen, how will the school of the future be more environmentally conscious?Tony: It will have the challenge of sustainability as a fundamental organizing principle of its interdisciplinary science curriculum. The study of ecology will replace other required science courses and will be combined with learning math and social science, as needed. Students will best learn principles of ecology, fundamentals of math, and key social science concepts by studying real environmental issues, both locally and globally. Availability and quality of water resources will be the most frequent problem that students will study.Ted: Lots of students are concerned about healthy food. I get excited when I visit a school that is encouraging student-driven initiatives around what can be produced onsite, how offerings can be optimized given a food budget, and how to encourage all students to take food seriously. Or how to reduce the overall carbon footprint of the school and its community. Kids will learn so much more -- biology, chemistry, math, economics, etc. -- when it's tied to a project they create that seeks to make progress on something they care about. ""One of the most powerful classroom experiences I've observed in recent years was a ninth-grade social studies class at Beaver Country Day in Chestnut Hill, MA. The students were asked to analyze what steps the U.S. should take in dealing with the insurgent revolution in Syria."" -- Ted DintersmithHow will the school of the future be more globally inclusive?Ted: One of the most powerful classroom experiences I've observed in recent years was a ninth-grade social studies class at Beaver Country Day in Chestnut Hill, MA. The students were asked to analyze what steps the U.S. should take in dealing with the insurgent revolution in Syria. They scrambled and found a classroom in Damascus with Skype capabilities, set up a class-to-class Skype call, and got feedback directly from the students there. The perspective these students had on U.S. foreign policy was more informed than that of many adult journalists in our country reporting on developments there. Imagine this approach being used more broadly, and how it might transform history, social studies, foreign language, and perhaps even science classes here. Tony: The school of the future will take as a fundamental premise that understanding and appreciation of diverse cultures is an essential educational outcome for all students. Students will frequently partner, via technology, with teams of students from other countries to better understand both local and global issues from multiple cultural perspectives. To use my earlier example, students might come to better understand how challenges related to water quality and availability are impacted by culture, politics, and geography.How will technology be integrated into the curriculum and how will the school handle the integration of continual advancements in technology?Ted: The important advance we need to make is to focus on education experiences that recognize what is readily available to any of us on our smartphone, and not re-invent the wheel. For example, I've seen a math class that lets kids use smartphones for low-level procedures (with some exposure on poorly-constructed standardized tests) to make room for time to take on challenges like coming up with a sound way to predict the world's population in 2100.Tony: Just as successful schools today employ Bloom's Taxonomy of Learning, schools of the future will understand and employ what I call a new Taxonomy of Technology as an essential tool of learning and creation.What will be left of traditional craft work and writing?Ted: When formulaic writing can be done by advanced software, few adults will be able to contribute to society by being mediocre writers. A compelling written voice will be able to make a difference, so our goal with students needs to be to help them develop a distinctive and powerful written voice.Tony: High quality craft work that cannot be replicated by machines will be in even greater demand as societies transition from acquiring a greater quantity of things to having more quality objects and experiences. Demand for beautiful, but practical products -- pottery, fiber, or wood -- will continue to increase as people seek beauty in their everyday lives. Writing skills will continue to be critical but writing will be increasingly integrated into more artistic and graphics-based presentations for a deeper understanding. Storytelling in written, animated, and movie forms will grow in popularity as people seek new ways to understand the world and one another.Given the efficiency of the Internet and home learning, how much time will students be needed in school?Ted: I don't believe much of anything consequential is learned strictly through online lectures and simplistic multiple-choice questions. Real learning hinges, to a very large extent, on peer interaction and the impact of engaged and inspiring adults. Tony: Learning will increasingly be seen as an anytime, anywhere event. Instead of a diploma being a certificate of ""seat time served"" in a collection of courses, students will work towards earning ""merit badges"" representing diverse competencies - much in the way that Scouts do today - at times and places that are consistent with their learning interests and goals. When students are ready, they will present and defend their work in digital portfolios and exhibitions of mastery as the basis for learning a diploma -- much in the way that doctoral students do today. ""The school of the future will take as a fundamental premise that understanding and appreciation of diverse cultures is an essential educational outcome for all students. Students will frequently partner, via technology, with teams of students from other countries to better understand both local and global issues from multiple cultural perspectives."" -- Dr. Tony WagnerHow important will the presence of physical teachers be?Ted: If we view a teacher as the subject matter expert standing in front of a class lecturing, I'd argue that they're already obsolete. But if our teachers work closely with students, provide informed and caring instruction and feedback, and help students discover their passions and purpose, they will be - for all eternity - essential.Tony: Students will increasingly study necessary or relevant academic content independently -- often by electronic means. Teachers will be increasingly important as skilled performance coaches. They will help students learn to self-assess and will, with colleagues, determine when students have met the required performance standards necessary for a diploma. Teachers will no longer be isolated, but rather will work together with colleagues to better understand the work, learning, and citizenship competencies that students must master for their diplomas. Team-teaching will be the norm as educators come to understand that ""isolation is the enemy of improvement and innovation.""Will technology advancement lead to further personalization of education to individual students or will it also increase the techno-bureaucratic need for standardization?Ted: People who believe that an ocean of short online lectures, quick quizzes, and big data will advance education are just wrong. Very little is learned, and almost nothing is retained, with these experiences. Udacity, to its credit, pioneered the MOOC pedagogy and recognized how little real learning takes place with strictly online resources. The only reason people conclude that this form of education is effective is that they never reflect on how totally-forgettable their lecture courses were.Tony: Technology will increasingly allow students to be the architects of their own learning. For example, imagine a student who becomes interested in bicycle design. She or he will study the relevant history, as well as the physics and math of bicycle design, learn CAD CAM and perhaps welding, and then apprentice with a team of innovators who can teach practical skills related to iteration of designs, marketing, and business principles. ""Students will also learn stress reduction through regular classes in meditation, yoga, tai chi, etc. Perhaps more important, students will learn to listen to themselves and to reflect through one or more of these disciplines."" -- Dr. Tony WagnerWill we teach students specific ""subjects"" in traditional classrooms like we have today or will classes be more about integrated/hybrid learning?Ted: Most of what's interesting in life is interdisciplinary. The subjects were defined in 1893, and those boundaries are as obsolete as the covered wagon. There are powerful options that cut across traditional school subjects. What if athletic coaches encourage their players to use math to come up with ways to predict the outcome and score of future games? To develop their own team constitution laying out how the team will make its important decisions (and, maybe, ease out of the model of coach as dictator), and tie it to the way our founders laid out our nation's constitution. There are opportunities everywhere to capitalize on passions of students to deepen engagement more broadly.Tony: ""Required"" classes will be increasingly interdisciplinary, with classes organized around understanding a real problem or addressing a big question. For example, students will no longer take US History. Rather they will have a year-long American Studies course organized around a few big questions, such as: Who are we as Americans? What are the most significant influences that have shaped us as a country and a people? And what are the greatest challenges that we face in the future? Students will learn material relevant to answering these questions through history, literature, economics, social science, the arts, and music.Faced with increasing time spent on digital devices, how can we teach more practical skills, including coping with stress levels and interpersonal conflict?Ted: In the film Most Likely To Succeed, students are scrambling to complete their initiatives in time for Exhibition Night, and students deal with all sorts of interpersonal issues that, in a profound way, teach them skills that they'll use for the rest of their lives -- in jobs, in families, and in being productive citizens.Tony: Students will work in teams on most assignments. Teachers will coach individual students as they collaborate with their colleagues, and students will regularly review one another's contributions to projects through ""360"" reviews. Students will also learn stress reduction through regular classes in meditation, yoga, tai chi, etc. Perhaps more important, students will learn to listen to themselves and to reflect through one or more of these disciplines. Increasingly, students will come to see the value of both traditional Eastern and Western ways of approaching problems.Very inspiring - Thank you GentlemanFor more information on Most Likely to Succeed: Preparing Our Kids for the Innovation Era Tony Wagner, C.

When students are ready, they will present and defend their work in digital portfolios and exhibitions of mastery as the basis for learning a diploma -- much in the way that doctoral students do today. ""The school of the future will take as a fundamental premise that understanding and appreciation of diverse cultures is an essential educational outcome for all students. Students will frequently partner, via technology, with teams of students from other countries to better understand both local and global issues from multiple cultural perspectives."" -- Dr. Tony WagnerHow important will the presence of physical teachers be?Ted: If we view a teacher as the subject matter expert standing in front of a class lecturing, I'd argue that they're already obsolete. But if our teachers work closely with students, provide informed and caring instruction and feedback, and help students discover their passions and purpose, they will be - for all eternity - essential.Tony: Students will increasingly study necessary or relevant academic content independently -- often by electronic means. Teachers will be increasingly important as skilled performance coaches. They will help students learn to self-assess and will, with colleagues, determine when students have met the required performance standards necessary for a diploma. Teachers will no longer be isolated, but rather will work together with colleagues to better understand the work, learning, and citizenship competencies that students must master for their diplomas. Team-teaching will be the norm as educators come to understand that ""isolation is the enemy of improvement and innovation.""Will technology advancement lead to further personalization of education to individual students or will it also increase the techno-bureaucratic need for standardization?Ted: People who believe that an ocean of short online lectures, quick quizzes, and big data will advance education are just wrong. Very little is learned, and almost nothing is retained, with these experiences. Udacity, to its credit, pioneered the MOOC pedagogy and recognized how little real learning takes place with strictly online resources. The only reason people conclude that this form of education is effective is that they never reflect on how totally-forgettable their lecture courses were.Tony: Technology will increasingly allow students to be the architects of their own learning. For example, imagine a student who becomes interested in bicycle design. She or he will study the relevant history, as well as the physics and math of bicycle design, learn CAD CAM and perhaps welding, and then apprentice with a team of innovators who can teach practical skills related to iteration of designs, marketing, and business principles. ""Students will also learn stress reduction through regular classes in meditation, yoga, tai chi, etc. Perhaps more important, students will learn to listen to themselves and to reflect through one or more of these disciplines."" -- Dr. Tony WagnerWill we teach students specific ""subjects"" in traditional classrooms like we have today or will classes be more about integrated/hybrid learning?Ted: Most of what's interesting in life is interdisciplinary. The subjects were defined in 1893, and those boundaries are as obsolete as the covered wagon. There are powerful options that cut across traditional school subjects. What if athletic coaches encourage their players to use math to come up with ways to predict the outcome and score of future games? To develop their own team constitution laying out how the team will make its important decisions (and, maybe, ease out of the model of coach as dictator), and tie it to the way our founders laid out our nation's constitution. There are opportunities everywhere to capitalize on passions of students to deepen engagement more broadly.Tony: ""Required"" classes will be increasingly interdisciplinary, with classes organized around understanding a real problem or addressing a big question. For example, students will no longer take US History. Rather they will have a year-long American Studies course organized around a few big questions, such as: Who are we as Americans? What are the most significant influences that have shaped us as a country and a people? And what are the greatest challenges that we face in the future? Students will learn material relevant to answering these questions through history, literature, economics, social science, the arts, and music.Faced with increasing time spent on digital devices, how can we teach more practical skills, including coping with stress levels and interpersonal conflict?Ted: In the film Most Likely To Succeed, students are scrambling to complete their initiatives in time for Exhibition Night, and students deal with all sorts of interpersonal issues that, in a profound way, teach them skills that they'll use for the rest of their lives -- in jobs, in families, and in being productive citizens.Tony: Students will work in teams on most assignments. Teachers will coach individual students as they collaborate with their colleagues, and students will regularly review one another's contributions to projects through ""360"" reviews. Students will also learn stress reduction through regular classes in meditation, yoga, tai chi, etc. Perhaps more important, students will learn to listen to themselves and to reflect through one or more of these disciplines. Increasingly, students will come to see the value of both traditional Eastern and Western ways of approaching problems.Very inspiring - Thank you GentlemanFor more information on Most Likely to Succeed: Preparing Our Kids for the Innovation Era Tony Wagner, C.

Either title's applicable. Who looks forward to sitting down at the Thanksgiving table, surrounded by squabbling relatives? I don't excel in the kitchen. No magnificently stuffed, basted and roasted turkey will ever emerge from my seldom-used oven to my gleaming good Lenox serving platter. Unless someone else makes it. I don't care about the secret to making the perfect pie crust to stuff with pecans and pumpkin. I am not interested in collecting recipes for 12 satisfying side dishes or coming up with the most original sweet potato pie casserole recipe -- or delectable chocolate spice cake recipe either. I must confess: I am more interested in what goes on around the table rather than what dishes get placed on the table.That being said, to get in the right frame of mind, you need to ""like the people you love."" Daunting task. But my friend Paula sent me this link as added reinforcement. In keeping with that mindset, here are some suggestions for a memorable, enjoyable and richly textured Thanksgiving experience:Cultivate a Thanksgiving frame of mind before the knot in the stomach grows to epic proportions: Compose a handwritten note of thanks to a few people who have extended to you the gift of kindness in the past year.   ""Fill your car with frozen turkeys and cart them down to a local food bank to be distributed,"" suggests my friend Joyce. ""I do this a couple of days before Thanksgiving. And I stuff boxes there as well. I feel good and it enables the family receiving the food able to celebrate Thanksgiving too.""   This year, having grandchildren old enough to wield a marker, I am passing out white cloth napkins and fabric pens. I am instructing each one to draw a picture about family or Thanksgiving. And sign their name and the date. (Willing adults are welcome to participate too.) We will use their new creations at dinner. When done, I will collect them, launder them and haul them out next year for further adornment. (If you aren't too fussy, you could allow everyone to draw on the white tablecloth under which everything on the Thanksgiving table rests. I am not that brave.)Once around the table, be creative and strategic: One of my more outrageous friends, whose identity will remain hidden, boldly suggests sitting around the table and recalling ""Disasters of Thanksgivings Past."" Aunt Connie, slightly more than slightly inebriated, confessing to adultery before her divorce from Uncle Ralph. Grandma burning the turkey to a crisp. Cousin Billy vomiting on the perfectly set table before dinner. Or Willy and his wild sons knocking over the entire Thanksgiving dessert table while tossing a Nerf football over it. With a twinkle in her eye, my friend cautions me that only those with a well-endowed sense of humor and tolerant of some good-natured ribbing should attempt this.  ""My family fights over everything,"" another friend who will remain nameless, admits. ""We always need diversion to prevent arguments from flaring up. Because we don't get together over the December holiday season, we make a practice of exchanging gifts at the Thanksgiving table. The person in charge for that year passes out one name to each person a few weeks before Thanksgiving. That person buys a book for the person whose name he received, based on their interests. He wraps it and presents it to the person, along with an explanation of why he picked that particular book for him. It's fun and prevents much dreaded smoldering family resentments to inflame -- at least until the meal is over."" ""We used to do family predictions each year,"" says Lori. ""Each person would take a piece of paper and write down every person's name that was present and then add a prediction for the coming year about each of them -- either professionally or personally. My mom collected the lists and tucked them away to be read the following year. And then we would read last year's predictions."" Lori pauses. ""My mother finally put a stop to it because each year people were predicting I would meet someone and get married. After a few embarrassing years of that not working out, my mother abruptly stopped the prediction tradition."" Lori laughs, ""Two years later, I met my husband and the predictions re-started!""  ""Take a group picture before the food courses commence -- and add it to a collage of group pictures, which get displayed each year. It's hysterical to see how people age,"" my friend Nina remarks wickedly. ""And great motivation for pre-Thanksgiving dieting."" ""It's tried, true and trite but what can it hurt? Go around the table and ask each person to talk BRIEFLY about one thing they are grateful/thankful for,"" suggests Gail. ""With technology surrounding us, we often save it for Skype or Face time with relatives celebrating elsewhere.""  Remember the disconcerting scene from the movie, ""Avalon,"" directed by Barry Levinson? One brother yells at the other, ""You cut the turkey without me."" A long lasting feud is born. Remember the quote written by Oscar Wilde? ""After a good dinner, one can forgive anybody, even one's own relations.""Let's face it. We wait to cut the turkey until all guests have arrived. We make sure the food is delectable. Still, there can be folks seated around our Thanksgiving table that we just can't stand. How do we get through the meal without a major meltdown? Knife fight? Or hair-pulling ruckus?Here's a few suggestions from me -- a self-proclaimed know-it-all -- who sports absolutely no professional qualifications: Lower your expectations Dwell on the positive Don't look for a slight -- or you'll be sure to find one Listen more than talk Avoid expounding on religion, Obamacare and Donald Trump. And if things start heating up, pop open another bottle of white wine and slug awayAnd when the meal's been digested, the leftovers stowed away and the next day dawns, what then? My friend Joyce has a suggestion to cap off the festivities. ""The women in our family take the hostess out for high tea the day after our dinner. No men allowed. Following that, we shop and shop and shop all the sales at our favorite mall stores.""For more Iris Ruth Pastor, sign up for her weekly newsletter at www.irisruthpastor.comEarlier on Huff/Post50:"

Perhaps that there's so much to do, so many great places to dine, so many ways to access a growing community spirit: all for a fraction of what it would cost in other picturesque locales on the East Coast. These, too, are all good reasons to visit and spend a few days as well. But beware; you might be tempted to hang about. As one 20-something former New York City dweller admitted to me, ""I came to Lewes to visit my retired parents and ended up staying myself."" Southern Delaware can have that effect on people.For more about what to do and see in these towns and others in the Northeast USA, consult the Getaway Mavens.DOVER1. Climb into the cabin of (decommissioned) Air Force 2, and into the cargo hold of one of the world's largest transport planes at the Air Mobility Command Museum @ Dover AFB. What is Air Mobility, you ask? Anything to do with the movement of troops, food and equipment, or, as tour guide Jon Andrews quips, ""You call, we haul."" It's the only museum in the USA dedicated to airlift and refueling history. Interactive and compelling, there are over two dozen aircraft to learn about and explore. People come from all over the world because they can actually get on the planes. The Air Mobility Command Museum is arguably one of the best military museums in the country. 2. Learn why Delaware is called ""The First State"" on a compelling, entertaining walking tour of Dover Green, part of First State Heritage Park. You'll hear accounts of delegates and suffragettes and one of the most sensational stories of the Victorian age: the first Murder By Mail. The Green, anchored by the renovated Old State House (also worth a tour) is an emerald jewel in the midst of Delaware's State Capital, and often missed by tourists. But I'm letting you know, these stories told by animated guides are too juicy to pass up. 3. Listen to music played on original Victor Talking Machines and Victrolas at the extremely fun Johnson Victrola Museum. Why wasn't the Victrola named after its inventor, Eldredge Johnson, and how did Nipper the Dog get all the fame? You'll find out at this terrific homage to Dover native Johnson, who as a youth was deemed ""too stupid for college.""MILFORD4. Take a stroll on the lovely Mispillion Riverwalk. In the 18th and 19th centuries, seven shipbuilding companies were situated along the Mispillion River, which runs about 15 miles to the Delaware Bay. Young artists have provided a fresh take on this history, fashioning 18 decorative replicas of the classic yacht, Augusta, that line the landscaped brick walkway through town. In the summer, the river comes alive with kayakers and canoers, but it's a wonderful stroll any time of year.5. Purchase a ""Git Box"" (ukulele made from an old cigar box), ceramic horseshoe crab or other high-end crafts and jewelry at Gallery 37. This shop was voted ""Best Gallery Downstate"" by Delaware Today Magazine, drawing patrons from Washington DC and other surrounding cities to this sleepy town. Owner Marcia Reed, a painter in her own right, handpicks the furniture craftsmen, sculptors, ceramists, fiber artists and jewelry makers herself. ""This is not tourist trade stuff,"" she states. 6. Try Bison Burger, Moroccan Salmon Cake, Scrapple Pieroges or other inventive farm-to-table fare at Abbott's Grill. The setting might be nondescript, but the food sure isn't: this kitchen has spawned a cadre of hot chefs who've opened up their own restaurants throughout the region. 7. Stay in a former Governor's villa -- the Causey Mansion -- so packed with Asian antiques you feel as if you're staying in a high-end antique shop. Sitting on a rise on the edge of downtown, the Causey Mansion is a grand Georgian, Neo-Classic Colonial, with high ceilings, big windows, expansive gardens and welcoming patios and statuary. Inside, it appears to be an exotic and eclectic emporium of Chinese and Japanese woodblock prints, ""Even Louis"" (14th and 16th) pieces, an 1840 room-dividing screen from the Iran Embassy in DC, and a cornucopia of other antiques extending to four magnificent rooms. LEWES8. The Lewes Historical Society runs so many compelling walking, trolley and boat tours, even locals scramble to sign on. Guides are passionate historians, and an hour can seem like a few minutes as they talk about local legends and events, and point out anomalies, like the tombstone of Elizabeth Cullen whose date of birth was engraved as Feb 30th, 1760 for all eternity, or a cannonball wedged in the exterior wall of a home, dating from the War of 1812. American History has never been so fascinating.9. Some museums are exceptional for the stories they tell, and the Zwaanendael Museum, built in 1931 as a replica of the Hoorn City Hall to commemorate the 300th anniversary of this Dutch Whaling Settlement, is one. To whit: 1986 was not a good year for treasure hunters. Just a few months after the highly anticipated opening of Al Capone's vault (whoops; empty), the recovery of the HMS DeBraak, which sunk off the Lewes coast in 1798 laden with, many believed, chests of gold, was also a bust, booty-wise. The story of the deBraak, what it was, how it sunk and why it was so sought after is told in thrilling detail by museum exhibits and guides.10. Cape Henlopen State Park has some top-secret history, but that's just a fraction of its appeal. What makes Cape Henlopen such a crucial location on the Atlantic Ocean and Delaware Bay is also the reason it makes for such an incredible recreational experience. Hike, bike, look for birds, fish, swim, or come to check out WWII sites. As a strategic position on the East Coast, there were 17 bunkers, a manned fortress, watchtowers, and lots of mysteries (some still classified, while others now public). The Top Secret SOSUS (Sound Surveillance System) operated from here, tracking Russian submarines along the coast. At least one bunker, now covered with pop art, was used as a bar in the '70's. Climb into one of the iconic Delaware ""Beach Towers,"" concrete cylindrical watchtowers used to determine the target range of enemy fire. And then tour what remains of decommissioned Fort Miles - now a National Historic Area left with cement block barracks and WWII artillery. 11. Take deep breaths of lavender at Lavender Fields @ Warrington Manor in Milton. Just a few miles away from Lewes, this shop/farm/cottage industry is worth a few hours of your time. Marie Mayor and Sharon Harris were Federal Employees and bought the 5-acre property ""for retirement."" They've done anything but. ""We want people to come here and learn about things that can make you feel happy - by taking care of yourselves,"" says Mayor. Harris and Mayor grow lavender and nurture small businesses, like natural soap maker, The Soap Fairy, on site. Plan to spend a restorative couple of hours. 12. Taste the antioxidant-rich Blueberry Wine at Delaware's first commercial winery, Nassau Valley Vineyards (a few miles from Lavender fields), and learn the 8,000 year old history of ""Winemaking Through the Ages"" in cool catacomb-like galleries. Open 22 years ago, the family business is now run by Peggy Raley-Ward and her sister Suzette Hopkins, who oversee this vineyard known for its terrific fruit wines, Cabernets, Chardonnays and other vintages. 13. Lewes has positively bloomed of late, culinarily speaking. Dining-wise, ""you can't go wrong with anything here,"" say most locals. I choose the uptown ""Friends meets Victorian Tea Parlor"" spot, Nectar Café and Juice Bar, for creative salads and fresh juices. To satisfy my real-NY-Italian-food urges, I scarf up the baseball-sized meatballs at Touch of Italy, and when I want ""fresh fish my way"" and inventive sushi, I head to Striper Bites. 14. Lodging, too, has gone berzerk - in a good way - in Lewes. You'd be hard pressed to find one franchise in town, and instead, an indie inn to fit every personality and mood. I like lots and lots of color, free wine, and an owner with the bantering cadence of Vince Vaughn. And so, I choose The Blue Water House, just a block from the beach. But if you're a hipster beer-lover, head to the brand new Dogfish Inn, the former fisherman's dump, Vesuvio, now a trendy motel owned by the same people who bring you Dogfish Head Brews (made in the next town). But if you're into Yoga and want an upscale tranquil space, stay at the newly renovated Savannah Inn. Boutique hotel fans who don't want to walk more than one foot to shop will love the newly redone Rodney Hotel. And yes, even traditionalists will be happy at the 25-room ""Nantucket-style"" Inn @ Canal Square."

It's the only museum in the USA dedicated to airlift and refueling history. Interactive and compelling, there are over two dozen aircraft to learn about and explore. People come from all over the world because they can actually get on the planes. The Air Mobility Command Museum is arguably one of the best military museums in the country. 2. Learn why Delaware is called ""The First State"" on a compelling, entertaining walking tour of Dover Green, part of First State Heritage Park. You'll hear accounts of delegates and suffragettes and one of the most sensational stories of the Victorian age: the first Murder By Mail. The Green, anchored by the renovated Old State House (also worth a tour) is an emerald jewel in the midst of Delaware's State Capital, and often missed by tourists. But I'm letting you know, these stories told by animated guides are too juicy to pass up. 3. Listen to music played on original Victor Talking Machines and Victrolas at the extremely fun Johnson Victrola Museum. Why wasn't the Victrola named after its inventor, Eldredge Johnson, and how did Nipper the Dog get all the fame? You'll find out at this terrific homage to Dover native Johnson, who as a youth was deemed ""too stupid for college.""MILFORD4. Take a stroll on the lovely Mispillion Riverwalk. In the 18th and 19th centuries, seven shipbuilding companies were situated along the Mispillion River, which runs about 15 miles to the Delaware Bay. Young artists have provided a fresh take on this history, fashioning 18 decorative replicas of the classic yacht, Augusta, that line the landscaped brick walkway through town. In the summer, the river comes alive with kayakers and canoers, but it's a wonderful stroll any time of year.5. Purchase a ""Git Box"" (ukulele made from an old cigar box), ceramic horseshoe crab or other high-end crafts and jewelry at Gallery 37. This shop was voted ""Best Gallery Downstate"" by Delaware Today Magazine, drawing patrons from Washington DC and other surrounding cities to this sleepy town. Owner Marcia Reed, a painter in her own right, handpicks the furniture craftsmen, sculptors, ceramists, fiber artists and jewelry makers herself. ""This is not tourist trade stuff,"" she states. 6. Try Bison Burger, Moroccan Salmon Cake, Scrapple Pieroges or other inventive farm-to-table fare at Abbott's Grill. The setting might be nondescript, but the food sure isn't: this kitchen has spawned a cadre of hot chefs who've opened up their own restaurants throughout the region. 7. Stay in a former Governor's villa -- the Causey Mansion -- so packed with Asian antiques you feel as if you're staying in a high-end antique shop. Sitting on a rise on the edge of downtown, the Causey Mansion is a grand Georgian, Neo-Classic Colonial, with high ceilings, big windows, expansive gardens and welcoming patios and statuary. Inside, it appears to be an exotic and eclectic emporium of Chinese and Japanese woodblock prints, ""Even Louis"" (14th and 16th) pieces, an 1840 room-dividing screen from the Iran Embassy in DC, and a cornucopia of other antiques extending to four magnificent rooms. LEWES8. The Lewes Historical Society runs so many compelling walking, trolley and boat tours, even locals scramble to sign on. Guides are passionate historians, and an hour can seem like a few minutes as they talk about local legends and events, and point out anomalies, like the tombstone of Elizabeth Cullen whose date of birth was engraved as Feb 30th, 1760 for all eternity, or a cannonball wedged in the exterior wall of a home, dating from the War of 1812. American History has never been so fascinating.9. Some museums are exceptional for the stories they tell, and the Zwaanendael Museum, built in 1931 as a replica of the Hoorn City Hall to commemorate the 300th anniversary of this Dutch Whaling Settlement, is one. To whit: 1986 was not a good year for treasure hunters. Just a few months after the highly anticipated opening of Al Capone's vault (whoops; empty), the recovery of the HMS DeBraak, which sunk off the Lewes coast in 1798 laden with, many believed, chests of gold, was also a bust, booty-wise. The story of the deBraak, what it was, how it sunk and why it was so sought after is told in thrilling detail by museum exhibits and guides.10. Cape Henlopen State Park has some top-secret history, but that's just a fraction of its appeal. What makes Cape Henlopen such a crucial location on the Atlantic Ocean and Delaware Bay is also the reason it makes for such an incredible recreational experience. Hike, bike, look for birds, fish, swim, or come to check out WWII sites. As a strategic position on the East Coast, there were 17 bunkers, a manned fortress, watchtowers, and lots of mysteries (some still classified, while others now public). The Top Secret SOSUS (Sound Surveillance System) operated from here, tracking Russian submarines along the coast. At least one bunker, now covered with pop art, was used as a bar in the '70's. Climb into one of the iconic Delaware ""Beach Towers,"" concrete cylindrical watchtowers used to determine the target range of enemy fire. And then tour what remains of decommissioned Fort Miles - now a National Historic Area left with cement block barracks and WWII artillery. 11. Take deep breaths of lavender at Lavender Fields @ Warrington Manor in Milton. Just a few miles away from Lewes, this shop/farm/cottage industry is worth a few hours of your time. Marie Mayor and Sharon Harris were Federal Employees and bought the 5-acre property ""for retirement."" They've done anything but. ""We want people to come here and learn about things that can make you feel happy - by taking care of yourselves,"" says Mayor. Harris and Mayor grow lavender and nurture small businesses, like natural soap maker, The Soap Fairy, on site. Plan to spend a restorative couple of hours. 12. Taste the antioxidant-rich Blueberry Wine at Delaware's first commercial winery, Nassau Valley Vineyards (a few miles from Lavender fields), and learn the 8,000 year old history of ""Winemaking Through the Ages"" in cool catacomb-like galleries. Open 22 years ago, the family business is now run by Peggy Raley-Ward and her sister Suzette Hopkins, who oversee this vineyard known for its terrific fruit wines, Cabernets, Chardonnays and other vintages. 13. Lewes has positively bloomed of late, culinarily speaking. Dining-wise, ""you can't go wrong with anything here,"" say most locals. I choose the uptown ""Friends meets Victorian Tea Parlor"" spot, Nectar Café and Juice Bar, for creative salads and fresh juices. To satisfy my real-NY-Italian-food urges, I scarf up the baseball-sized meatballs at Touch of Italy, and when I want ""fresh fish my way"" and inventive sushi, I head to Striper Bites. 14. Lodging, too, has gone berzerk - in a good way - in Lewes. You'd be hard pressed to find one franchise in town, and instead, an indie inn to fit every personality and mood. I like lots and lots of color, free wine, and an owner with the bantering cadence of Vince Vaughn. And so, I choose The Blue Water House, just a block from the beach. But if you're a hipster beer-lover, head to the brand new Dogfish Inn, the former fisherman's dump, Vesuvio, now a trendy motel owned by the same people who bring you Dogfish Head Brews (made in the next town). But if you're into Yoga and want an upscale tranquil space, stay at the newly renovated Savannah Inn. Boutique hotel fans who don't want to walk more than one foot to shop will love the newly redone Rodney Hotel. And yes, even traditionalists will be happy at the 25-room ""Nantucket-style"" Inn @ Canal Square."

The protest was among numerous campus actions around the country following the racially charged strife at the University of Missouri. (AP Photo/Steven Senne)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae5fef1f0000250122ea8e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Are you sick of reading about pampered college students and their safe spaces, trigger warnings and coddled minds? I know I am. Generations of parents and grandparents have long loved to shake their heads at the apparent absurdities of the young. It's practically an American tradition: Our founding fathers shook their heads about dueling and drinking on campus. When I was a college student, oldsters questioned my generation's patriotism and work ethic. Now my graying generation (with plenty of coloring) questions whether the young people of today have grown too sensitive, and, of course, whether they are ready to take on the world of work that we have prepared for them.  What do pundits mean when they say that students have grown too sensitive? They usually refer to some isolated incident when students become enraged by what seems a minor provocation, like an email from a university administrator about Halloween or about fitting in. But why not turn the question back on the carping columnists? Given the grave issues facing the world, why are pundits so focused on the micro issue of protests on college campuses?  It must be easier for conservative columnists to fret about those crazy students instead of focusing on the intellectual wasteland sprouting from what was supposed to be their think tank driven ""revolution of ideas."" These writers are aghast that students from groups long discriminated against aren't just grateful to their institutions for allowing them on campus. Defenders of the land of opportunity don't mention that those institutions have long practiced affirmative action for the over-tutored but often still dim offspring of wealthy donors. And liberal columnists, for their part, can't understand why the particular struggles of their heroic youth aren't simply taken up by their militant descendants. Ought these writers really be shocked when their own hierarchy of values based in secularism and fair procedures (values I share) aren't simply embraced by students from groups who have seen how ""fair procedures"" can obscure discrimination, intimidation and worse?   I have been teaching college students for over thirty years, and now I am president of Wesleyan University. When I look around my campus and visit others, I don't find pampered students with coddled minds. I find math majors in the gym every day preparing for a soccer match or a swim meet. I find writers pulling all-nighters to finish a project working side by side with computer science students developing new software. There are more double majors than ever, and on every campus I visit there are impressive percentages of students doing volunteer work or creating organizations that will have a positive impact locally, even globally -- be it making their campuses more sustainable or improving the education of girls in Africa.  These hard working, dedicated students fill the ranks of those now protesting for more equitable and inclusive educational institutions. Admittedly, there are plenty of times when I disagree with student activists at Wesleyan, and they are often angry when I don't see things their way. I have rejected boycotting Israeli scholars and I have my doubts about some of the latest consultant-driven training to make everyone more aware of their unwitting participation in systematic oppression - and we have vigorous discussions to bring our disagreements out into the open. And ""student activists"" don't all see things the same way. In this respect they are not unlike older alumni who may like some of my policies, say fiscal sustainability, and not others, say co-educating residential fraternities. Like student activists, alumni make their views known, often with dramatic gestures. We are an educational institution: It is a good thing when we can articulate why and how we disagree.   The image of students concerned only with the micro frustrations of everyday life as opposed to ""real"" issues bears no relation to the real students I encounter at colleges and universities. These students are well aware, for example, that climate change may significantly alter their lives, and that it will surely disrupt the lives of people around the world. They are learning about this accelerating catastrophe in STEM classes and political science seminars, and they are striving to find ways of mitigating its effects through sophisticated science and through policy analysis.  Our students are also well aware that they will graduate into an economy and society with greater inequalities and less social mobility than in any time since early industrialization. American college students recognize that powerful forces are dynamically increasing the accumulation of wealth in the hands of a few. They are studying how one can create robust economic growth without just reinforcing this inequitable trend, while grappling with a political arena ever more responsive to money.  On many campuses, students from different social classes live in close proximity with one another. Given the tendencies toward economic segregation in this country, they may not have had this experience before, and may not have it again. So many of the tensions on campus stem from the close up recognition -- intellectual and visceral -- of unequal economic opportunity and its intersection with traditional forms of discrimination and prejudice.  Yes, our colleges and universities have become more inclusive and less discriminatory over the last 40 years. When I was a student, many male professors thought sleeping with students they were grading was just a job perk; racist and homophobic speech and actions were routine. This has changed, and people with various political views can agree that this is real progress. Today campuses are more diverse because some Americans fought for educational opportunities to be more equitably distributed. Thanks to their achievements, todays students have higher awareness and higher expectations, so we can expect continued tensions on our campuses. Racism and inequality are still powerful beyond the borders of the university, and campuses themselves are not immune.   These are not ""minor"" or ""micro"" issues, and our students know it. They are faced with a world beyond the university that is threatened ecologically, economically and culturally, and they are doing their best to prepare themselves for these challenges. They are studying physics and religion, design and economics, and sometimes they stand up and make themselves heard. Sometimes they are filled with rage, sometimes with fear. They will make mistakes, but they don't need columnists to tell them that the main problem isn't Halloween. If only it were.Cross-posted with the Washington Post.Michael S.

From determining how to get your gifts from point A to B to navigating unexpected disruptions to squeezing carry-ons into crowded overhead bins, holiday travel creates plenty of stressful scenarios. But hang in there: With guidance from travel experts, we've come up with clever techniques to mitigate frustrations and make the journey a little more enjoyable this season. Prepare for the Unexpected by Arriving Early No matter where you're headed, your best bet for reaching your final destination is getting to the airport well in advance, says Christopher Elliott, a consumer advocate and journalist. Last year, Airlines for America, an industry group that represents major U.S. airlines, forecasted 24.6 million travelers to fly the friendly skies around Thanksgiving, up by 1.5 percent from the previous year. And this year shows no signs of less traffic at major domestic hubs. ""The best present you can give yourself, for peace of mind, is more time. An extra hour to get to the airport, to get through security,"" he says.George Hobica, founder of Airfarewatchdog.com, recommends arriving at least two hours in advance. Between travel accidents, slow-moving lines, technological glitches and security threats, it's best to account for extra variables during the busy travel period and adjust your plans accordingly, he says. See: The Early Bird's Guide to Holiday Travel  Fly Direct The flight itself may be less expensive, but you'll put yourself at risk of being disrupted by weather or other delays by choosing a connecting flight, says Colleen Clark, managing editor of Jetsetter. ""If you think about it, that extra 40 or 50 bucks can be the difference of seeing your family and friends for Thanksgiving or not,"" she adds. And because flights are so full, she cautions that if you miss your connecting flight, you'll be hard-pressed to catch the next flight and might even end up paying more to get rebooked on a new one.Another major selling point of booking a direct flight: ""It's just one less step that your bag can get lost,"" Clark adds. She also advises booking the first flight of the day available on your preferred carrier to mitigate the chances of your plane being delayed. If You Have a Connection, Avoid Disruption-Prone Airports Rather than putting your travel plans at risk by flying through hubs that are notoriously affected by severe weather, Hobica suggests choosing airports that are less susceptible to inclement weather conditions. For example, if you're planning to catch a connecting flight, travel through a warm-weather hub such as Phoenix or Houston rather than Minneapolis or Chicago, where flights are consistently delayed due to snowy conditions, he says. Though you may tack on a few extra hours by passing through a warmer locale, you'll minimize your odds of being indefinitely stalled due to unforeseen weather delays in cold-weather destinations. Also, plan ahead by giving yourself extra time between flights and having a backup plan, regardless of whether you have a non-refundable fare, he says.""Get on a flight that's going to minimize your odds of having a problem,"" advises Jeff Klee, CEO of CheapAir.com. He also recommends skipping cold-weather hubs for connections. Know the Rules ""Don't discount the dangers of unexpected expenses,"" cautions Clark, pointing to extras like Wi-Fi access, carry-ons and other ancillary fees. She also highlights the importance of doing your homework to understand which carriers are going to be your best bets for scoring a deal and rebooking your flight in the event your flight is canceled. And if your flight is impacted by weather delays, and you haven't been booked on another flight, she suggests heading to the gate as if you're flight was leaving. ""If it is indeed canceled, you'll be the first in line for rebooking,"" she says, highlighting that if you are delayed for reasons such as weather or mechanical issues, the airline is only obligated to put you on the next available flight. Because flights are so full during the holidays, it can be tricky securing a seat, she says.See: 9 Steps to Trim Holiday Travel Costs  Stay With Your Suitcase If you have the choice, keep your bag in your possession, Clark advises. And if that's not a viable option for you, forgo a short layover and prep your bag ahead of time with a colorful identifier such as a brightly colored scarf, she says. That way, you'll prevent your bag from getting lost in the shuffle when being transferred. You should also take a photo of your suitcase, so in the event it gets lost, you have a record. Another tip: ""As soon as the attendant prints your luggage tag, make sure it's correct,"" Clark says. Choose the Right Flight If you're clamoring for a comfortable premium-class seat during the peak holiday season rush, you might be out of luck. ""The reality is that economy seats are getting smaller,"" Klee says. ""There's no real silver bullet solution to avoid that.""But nevertheless, it's important to be selective since ""all seats and all flights are not all created equal,"" Hobica says. For example, if you want to be seated next to your travel companion, up your chances by booking your flight now while you can still be selective, he explains.It's also important to consider the airline's available amenities, such as in-flight video streaming, Wi-Fi access and meal options , he says. That way, if you are in fact stranded on a tarmac, you'll at least have free entertainment, he adds. He also advises bringing along water and something to eat to stay hydrated and prepare for delays. See: 6 Hacks for Scoring Seat and Room Upgrades Over the Holidays  Fly Gift Wrap-Free When it comes to flying with gifts in tow, your best bet is packaging presents after your flight. ""The TSA doesn't like wrapped presents,"" Elliott explains. It's tricky, because there's no hard-and-fast rule for carrying gifts through security or checking gifts, Clark says. And while the TSA does caution that its officers try their best not to damage gift packaging upon inspection, ""they're not guaranteeing that they're not going to get opened,"" Clark says. And if you're carrying heavy presents, keep in mind that you could be slapped with and extra $100 for overweight baggage fees, she adds.Alternatively, if you don't want to schlep gifts through security, consider sending presents through UPS Ground or FedEx Ground, Hobica advises. Travel on Thanksgiving and Christmas Day It might seem counterintuitive, but flying on the holidays will yield fewer crowds and cheaper airfare. You can score up to a $100 or more in savings by opting to fly on Christmas Day rather than the day before or after, Clark says. Plus, crew members are in good spirits, she addsAnd according to Elliott, traveling during the holidays is much better since demand decreases. Rather than going with the crowds, he says, ""zig when everyone else zags."" Rely on Real-Time Updates and Ride-Sharing Services Before you head for the airport, download your airline's app to stay abreast of a schedule or gate change to ensure a smoother journey, Klee advises. And if you're planning to hit the road over the holidays, make the most of navigation tools such as Waze, Clark suggests. ""It can update you on quirky ways of getting places and alerts you of accidents,"" she says. And if you're toying with the idea of renting a car from the airport, Hobica suggests opting for Uber over renting a new set of wheels to cut unnecessary expenses.Liz Weiss is an editor for the Travel section at U.S. News.
