He's wearing a faded green army jacket and a mauve shemagh, huddling to keep warm as an autumn wind rustles the trees.We're in his orchard - a beautiful cluster of almond, lemon and olive trees at the foot of Mount Sinai - where he lives with his family. It used to be a favourite stopping point for hikers in the mountains: they'd visit his orchard every week, drinking tea and buying fruit or handicrafts made by local women. Sometimes, they'd even stay overnight, sleeping in stone rooms and shelters between the trees. He has enough room for a hundred people. But it has been a long time since a hundred people have done anything here. The orchard is quiet and the rooms and shelters stand empty; a reminder of better, more optimistic times in the past.Like many parts of Egypt, South Sinai has been in the grip of a crippling tourism crisis in recent years. Towns that once thrived with tourism - like Sharm el Sheikh, Dahab and Taba - have resembled ghost towns at times since the 2011 uprising.But nowhere in South Sinai has suffered as much as the interior.Here in the rugged mountains around the town of St Katherine - home mostly to Bedouin communities - times have been exceptionally tough. Without tourism - which has been woven so tightly into local livelihoods in recent decades - there is little else to fall back on in these harsh deserts; at least nothing in the modern economy. Abu Omar, a local Bedouin guide on the hike, on Jebel Abbas BashaThe Bedouin say it's the toughest crash they've ever known.Harder and more prolonged than even the tourism crash which followed the bombings in the tourist resorts of Taba, Dahab and Sharm el Sheikh between 2004 and 2006.But that the tourism crash has happened like this and - moreover - that it's still happening shouldn't be a surprise. Over the last few years, the Sinai has been portrayed as the setting of an Islamic insurgency, with a string of near-weekly stories about bombings, ambushes and extremism in the peninsula. There has been little meaningful distinction in the mainstream media between North Sinai - in which there are pockets of persistent unrest - and South Sinai, which has remained largely peaceful and quiet.Clich√©s about the 'Lawless Peninsula', the 'Troubled Frontier' or the 'Restive Province', or stock sentences about 'Sinai - the peninsula that has become increasingly lawless since the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak' - have been recycled from one article to the next, as if 61,000 square kilometres of desert could be talked about in simple, singular terms. As if the Sinai - North and South - was a plain uniformity.The Sinai has been portrayed as Egypt's proverbial Heart of Darkness. And government advisories about the Sinai have only reinforced such an image.Two hikers, watching the sun go down from Jebel Abbas BashaTravel warnings have been issued by most Western governments about South Sinai. And even when these have been removed for coastal resorts - like Sharm el Sheikh and Dahab - they have remained in place for the interior. These warnings don't only lend credence to the perception that South Sinai is a dangerous place to visit. They make it harder for tourists to get travel insurance, creating real, practical obstacles to tourism.Many deterrents have grown around tourism in South Sinai in recent years.For local Bedouin communities, these narratives about their homeland read almost like they're about another place. As if they're written to conform to an unquestionable truth established by previous stories in the media; or as if the drive to theoretical neatness and a single-peninsula theory is prioritised above the actual reality on the ground.The Sinai has been chronically misrepresented for years.Sheikh Ahmed Abu Rashid of the Jebeleya tribe near St KatherineRecently, a community group in St Katherine - led by Bedouin figures of the Jebeleya tribe - met to discuss ways of challenging this ongoing misrepresentation and connecting with the outside world in a more accurate, positive way, on their own terms; of doing something to challenge perceptions of the Sinai and encourage the return of tourism to the area.Out of this meeting came the idea of arranging a special hike. A hike that would bring people together from all over the world to send out a message about safety in the region.Last weekend - after a solid month of planning - the hike became a reality.More than 60 people gathered in the town of St Katherine. They came from mainland Egypt and countries as far away as Austria, Chile, Russia, the UK and New Zealand. There were Bedouin from different tribes of the Sinai, as well as families with children as young as six. Together, the hikers climbed one of the biggest mountains in the region - Jebel Abbas Basha - and slept in an old Bedouin orchard, walking out the next day through a spectacular gorge with water pools.They came to support the local Bedouin community - who ran the hike from start to finish - and to explode the narrative about South Sinai as a place of danger. They walked deliberately in the area Western governments mark on the map as the danger zone.Credit: Khalid AbdullaTogether, they united around a single message: SOUTH SINAI IS SAFE.Before the hike, some people decided not to come for safety concerns. Others questioned why it was still going ahead after the recent bombing in North Sinai, saying it was a foolhardy risk.To the contrary though, the hike was never at risk: safety was at the forefront of every consideration about it and it went ahead only because the organisers felt completely sure it was secure. Judgements about safety weren't made by outside commentators: they were made by the most influential figures in the local Bedouin community. Which is to say, by the people who understand the region in its own cultural language, better than anybody.When it's seen through Bedouin eyes, the Sinai is a different place.Glance at the Sinai on a modern political atlas, and you'll see a land of neat, straight-line borders; a single peninsula, usually shaded a single colour. With Bedouin eyes, it's much more complex; a patchwork of small territories, each belonging to a different Bedouin tribe.The tribe is the major unit in Bedouin society and its importance is hard to overstate.Children as young as six joined the hike, sleeping out in the mountainsEach Bedouin tribe has its own sense of history, identity and independence. Sometimes tribes even have their own dialect and cultural traditions. Each tribe was forged through centuries of shared survival experiences in one of the hardest desert environments on earth and the bonds that hold its members together are extraordinarily strong. The tribe is a grouping that commands an exceptional sense of loyalty for the Bedouin; one that trumps anything else.There are over twenty Bedouin tribes in the Sinai, each functioning much like a mini state. And, like any sort of state, each Bedouin tribe feels a strong emotional connection to its territory; to the ancestral lands in which it has lived through the centuries.To outside eyes, familiar with icons of modern security - like the army and police - the Sinai might look insecure. It might look like a land of open deserts and bare mountainsides into which anybody could wander unchecked. But it doesn't work like that.The Bedouin have their own forms of tribal security, their own ways of watching the land.It isn't done by people who wear uniforms, who address each other in ranks and take home a salary at the end of each month. Ordinary Bedouin do it, perhaps a shepherdess herding goats, an ibex hunter looking for his prey, the resident of a Bedouin village or a wayfarer passing through the mountains. Each has a firm sense of loyalty to the tribe and a vested interest in protecting its territory and each watches it carefully, distinguishing outsiders from members of the tribe easily. Information about who's where gets passed around fast - even in remote tracts of the mountains - and any concerns are raised quickly with the Sheikhs.Waterpools in Wadi Shagg, near Jebel Abbas BashaThis is especially the case in the interior areas of South Sinai, where the Bedouin remain the only - or at least the majority - inhabitants of the land, and where their traditional security systems remain strong. Down on the coasts, where the Bedouin have been mixed into more diffuse urban societies, traditional ways of monitoring the land have been weakened.The coasts might look the safest, with all their checkpoints and security.Actually though, the historical record tells another story. The interior parts of South Sinai have never seen an attack against tourists. They're said to be the most hazardous by governments but - statistically - they're the safest. And they always have been.Camping in an ancient Bedouin orchard in Wadi ZawatinThe Bedouin in the mountains of South Sinai know who's where and what they're doing and - for this reason - the hike went ahead in the full knowledge the area was safe.And it wasn't just this. Travellers accompanied by the Bedouin have an extraordinary degree of protection in Bedouin lands. Tribal law still holds strong across these parts of the Sinai, regulating Bedouin behaviour to a remarkable degree. The tourist kidnaps which began in South Sinai in 2012 - which it's important to state were never the sort of militant kidnaps seen elsewhere in the Middle East and which were brought to an end by inter-tribal Bedouin meetings - all involved tourists who were travelling without Bedouin escorts, which is no coincidence. This isn't to justify the kidnaps; it's simply to underline the weight Bedouin law still carries in regulating these remote, interior parts of the Sinai.Nasr Mansour, the chief Bedouin guide, surrounded by hikers on Jebel Abbas BashaThe organisers of the hike knew it'd be safe for other reasons too. Ultimately though, it came down to the same thing: local, Bedouin knowledge about the region.Narratives that portray South Sinai as one half of a wholly dangerous peninsula are invariably written by outside commentators. The Sinai isn't the same as mainland Egypt - or anywhere else - and it can't be understood using the same frames of reference. Unfortunately, the Sinai is a place whose story is told by virtually everybody except its own Bedouin communities. If it could be summed up with a catch-all clich√© it wouldn't be the Troubled Frontier, the Restive Province or the Lawless Peninsula: it would be the misunderstood one.That the Sinai has so few home-grown Bedouin journalists to tell its story is a major loss to its cause. So too, that it doesn't have a community of bi-lingual Bedouin bloggers and social media activists who can challenge mainstream narratives where they appear online, at least not one that can compare with mainland Egypt, where bloggers have challenged mainstream news - in a language the world can understand - so effectively in the last few years. Unfortunately, with the Sinai, many stories go unchallenged for these reasons.Layla Farid, the youngest hiker of the event, on a camel in Wadi ZawatinHopefully the hike in the mountains around St Katherine will go some way - even if just a small way - to showing that South Sinai is not the danger zone it's made out to be. To showing the region in a more positive light and emphasising that there are alternative - and better - ways of understanding it than what underpins the bulk of what's written. People who joined the hike have already shared hundreds of pictures on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter which - as much as sending a message to the world about safety - might showcase the beauty of these mountains and revive tourism on other grounds.The more people who visit, the more it will become clear mainstream narratives don't fit the place they're written about. The more the name of Sinai can be reclaimed and coupled with positive associations and the more things might begin to change for its local Bedouin communities, whose livelihoods and name have suffered through misinformed narratives about the Sinai for too long.BEN HOFFLER is a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and an author of Trailblazer's Sinai: The Trekking Guide.

And they always have been.Camping in an ancient Bedouin orchard in Wadi ZawatinThe Bedouin in the mountains of South Sinai know who's where and what they're doing and - for this reason - the hike went ahead in the full knowledge the area was safe.And it wasn't just this. Travellers accompanied by the Bedouin have an extraordinary degree of protection in Bedouin lands. Tribal law still holds strong across these parts of the Sinai, regulating Bedouin behaviour to a remarkable degree. The tourist kidnaps which began in South Sinai in 2012 - which it's important to state were never the sort of militant kidnaps seen elsewhere in the Middle East and which were brought to an end by inter-tribal Bedouin meetings - all involved tourists who were travelling without Bedouin escorts, which is no coincidence. This isn't to justify the kidnaps; it's simply to underline the weight Bedouin law still carries in regulating these remote, interior parts of the Sinai.Nasr Mansour, the chief Bedouin guide, surrounded by hikers on Jebel Abbas BashaThe organisers of the hike knew it'd be safe for other reasons too. Ultimately though, it came down to the same thing: local, Bedouin knowledge about the region.Narratives that portray South Sinai as one half of a wholly dangerous peninsula are invariably written by outside commentators. The Sinai isn't the same as mainland Egypt - or anywhere else - and it can't be understood using the same frames of reference. Unfortunately, the Sinai is a place whose story is told by virtually everybody except its own Bedouin communities. If it could be summed up with a catch-all clich√© it wouldn't be the Troubled Frontier, the Restive Province or the Lawless Peninsula: it would be the misunderstood one.That the Sinai has so few home-grown Bedouin journalists to tell its story is a major loss to its cause. So too, that it doesn't have a community of bi-lingual Bedouin bloggers and social media activists who can challenge mainstream narratives where they appear online, at least not one that can compare with mainland Egypt, where bloggers have challenged mainstream news - in a language the world can understand - so effectively in the last few years. Unfortunately, with the Sinai, many stories go unchallenged for these reasons.Layla Farid, the youngest hiker of the event, on a camel in Wadi ZawatinHopefully the hike in the mountains around St Katherine will go some way - even if just a small way - to showing that South Sinai is not the danger zone it's made out to be. To showing the region in a more positive light and emphasising that there are alternative - and better - ways of understanding it than what underpins the bulk of what's written. People who joined the hike have already shared hundreds of pictures on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter which - as much as sending a message to the world about safety - might showcase the beauty of these mountains and revive tourism on other grounds.The more people who visit, the more it will become clear mainstream narratives don't fit the place they're written about. The more the name of Sinai can be reclaimed and coupled with positive associations and the more things might begin to change for its local Bedouin communities, whose livelihoods and name have suffered through misinformed narratives about the Sinai for too long.BEN HOFFLER is a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and an author of Trailblazer's Sinai: The Trekking Guide.

4,FIFTY,'Don't Lose The Body' And 8 Other Tips For Funeral Planning,"Elaine Ambrose, ContributorAuthor, syndicated blogger, featured humor speaker, publisher,...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/funeral-planning-tips_b_6121166.html,"In a wedding, you have months to prepare. With a funeral, you have days and you'll need to interrupt your own grieving to organize the deadly details.",2014-11-15,1. Are You Looking For Bingo Or Competitive Tennis On Thursdays?,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55ac54891700004000bafbcd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"I've helped organize weddings, including a few of my own, but planning a funeral is a different type of hectic -- emotional activity with a demanding timeline. The details could leave you breathless. Oops, wrong word.In a wedding, you have months to prepare. With a funeral, you have days and you'll need to interrupt your own grieving to organize the deadly details. A few generations ago, the family would clean and dress the body, prop it on the dining table next to the potato salad, throw a party, and then bury the dearly departed in the family plot on a nearby hill. Now, there is a complicated checklist that rivals the NASA instructions for a lunar landing to make sure your loved one has a proper burial.Because everyone eventually dies, someday you may need to organize a funeral. Here are some helpful tips:1. Don't lose the body. My sweet mother recently passed away. I had arranged for a local funeral home to pick up the body and transport it to another funeral home 100 miles away to her hometown. Two days later, she still hadn't arrived. After frantically calling and trying to use my inside voice, I received an email saying that the driver was in route and my mother was near Bliss. I responded, ""Of course, she is."" (Bliss is the name of a village near her intended destination.) I have no idea where she went for the weekend, but I assume she had a good time and that, somewhere, my parents were laughing.2. Don't allow details to be the death of you. Notify key family members, but tell them you don't need any help because planning through a committee could be fatal. Open a bottle of wine, sit down with a notebook or computer, and begin to make decisions: choose pall bearers, write the obituary, approve the death certificate, notarize details for the IRS, finalize the funeral place and program, choose the music and performer, arrange for food and flowers, contact the cemetery, make decisions about embalming and donations, and decide what clothes the person will wear and who should do the hair. Do you want rings removed? Do you want the casket with the pretty roses or the sunset? And, don't forget the musical video. Do all this in a few days while keeping a stiff upper lip. Sorry, wrong word again.2. Don't present a stupid program. If you think Aunt Bernice will go to the podium and wail for 20 minutes, discreetly suggest she save her remarks for the reception, preferably after the first two rounds of drinks. If you want to include some literary orations, avoid Robert Service's famous poem, ""The Cremation of Sam McGee."" And, finally, if all your music sounds like the ""The Funeral March of the Marionette"" followed by a requiem, a dirge, and a lone bagpiper, expect some of your guests to fall onto the ground and beg to be the next to die.4. Don't overwhelm the undertaker. I'm thankful I chose a reputable funeral director instead of Billy Bob's Burial and Tire Changing Service. After my mother died, I had numerous questions. The Funeral Director patiently listened when I called in alarm and asked who would dig the grave. ""We'll handle everything, ma'am,"" he said. I was so relieved that I wouldn't need to ask my son to bring a shovel and a backhoe.5. Don't turn the funeral into a bazaar. I once attended a wedding where one of the guests brought along Cutco knives to sell to the attendees. This is not appropriate for weddings or funerals. Even though I'll have a captive, emotional audience, I don't plan on arranging a book signing event after my mother's service. She always bragged to her friends that I wrote books, even though she never read any of them. I told her I wrote under the pen name of JK Rowling.6. Don't allow expenses to haunt you. You may need to dig deep to unearth some money because the base cost for a funeral can range from $5,000 to $10,000. The choices vary from a pine box tossed into a swamp to an elaborate $25,000 casket carried by a procession of white limousines into a private plot. If you're hosting a boisterous reception after the funeral, save enough money to buy some quality liquor because you care enough to say goodbye with a fine Scotch instead of cheap moonshine.7. Don't forget the living. After the funeral is over, use your energy and emotions to appreciate and connect with those around you. There are still a lot of people who aren't dead yet, and some of them need a friend.8. Don't stop celebrating life. If anyone cares to organize a funeral for me (after I'm dead, or course), I want a full marching band to play John Philip Sousa marches and an open bar with plenty of exquisite Cabernet. And, I'm requesting lots of pie with ice cream because finally gaining weight will no longer be an issue.Earlier on Huff/Post50:"

Black Friday, the start of the holiday shopping season, has traditionally been the busiest shopping day in the United States. (Photo by Allison Joyce/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb31662240000510055c011.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Black Friday is coming early this year to many retailers, which plan to open on Thanksgiving Day. But in three New England states, shoppers will have wait until midnight for door-buster deals. So-called blue laws -- first drafted in the colonial era to push people to go to church on Sunday and holidays -- bar retailers in Massachusetts, Maine and Rhode Island from opening on Thanksgiving and Christmas. Such laws were once far more restrictive, prohibiting the sale of alcohol on Sunday. But Jon B. Hurst, president of the Retailers Association of Massachusetts, told The Huffington Post that few businesses there have called for lifting the ban on Thanksgiving hours.‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt really been under pressure to change the laws here,‚Äù Hurst said Saturday. ‚ÄúFrankly, it wouldn‚Äôt be my cup of tea to go out on Thanksgiving night and shop. I‚Äôd rather watch football.‚ÄùStill, he said, he is concerned that Massachusetts residents may simply be driving to nearby Connecticut or New Hampshire to shop that day.‚ÄúWe know those stores are busy on Thursday night,‚Äù Hurst said. ‚ÄúSo it raises the question: Are Massachusetts blue laws stopping consumers from shopping? Or are they just stopping them from shopping in Massachusetts?‚ÄùNational retail chains such as Target, Toys R Us and Kmart are extending Black Friday hours even earlier this year, encouraging shoppers to wolf down the turkey on Thursday and come on in. For critics who lament a ""war on Thanksgiving,"" the surviving blue laws protect the peace of a holiday traditionally spent feasting with loved ones.‚ÄúI used to work in retail and it stinks to work on the holidays,‚Äù said Juliana Bondor, of Holyoke, Massachusetts, in a segment aired on local ABC affiliate WGGB. ‚ÄúEspecially for Thanksgiving -- that was started as a holiday for Americans to be together with family -- I think the laws are important to protect workers.‚ÄùSome national chains, including Costco, Marshall‚Äôs and Barnes & Noble, decided to remain closed on Thanksgiving. Hurst said that if the law changed in Massachusetts, he imagines most businesses would probably still do the same. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never been illegal to open on Easter,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut very, very few open because there‚Äôs just not much of a demand.‚Äù"

After finishing as the runner up in the American League MVP race for the last two seasons, the 23-year-old has officially been recognized as the best position player in the game. Don't forget that many considered him him the best in the league even when he finished second in the MVP voting. In his rookie season in 2012, in which he only made $482,500 in salary, Trout recorded the highest WAR since Barry Bonds in 2001. He made $510,000 in his second season and finished with the highest WAR in the league again. Before the 2014 season, he signed a one-year contract worth $1 million. Once again, he finished with the highest WAR in the league. Here are four numbers that show just how valuable Trout has been. The highest-paid player on the Los Angeles Angels' Opening Day roster was Albert Pujols, who earned $23 million. Along with Pujols, there were 14 Angels players who made more money in annual salary than Trout. There were 468 players in Major League Baseball who made more money than Trout, via USA Today Sports. That's how much less Trout made in 2014 than the average MLB player salary, via USA Today Sports. That's his league-leading WAR in 2014. "

At least a dozen women died this week following a state-run, mass sterilization program that has raised serious ethical questions about India's drive to curb a booming population by paying women to undergo tubectomies. India has one of the world's highest rates of sterilization among women, with about 37 percent undergoing such operations compared with 29 percent in China, according to 2006 statistics reported by the United Nations. About 4.6 million Indian women were sterilized in 2011 and 2012, according to the government.

At least 15 women have died, most of whom had attended the camp.Authorities tested the tablets after being informed that zinc phosphide was found at the nearby factory of Mahawar Pharmaceuticals, the firm at the center of investigations into the deaths at a government-run family planning camp, Pardeshi and Chhattisgarh health minister Amar Agarwal said.Samples of the drugs have now been sent to laboratories in Delhi and Kolkata to verify that the tablets were contaminated as the preliminary report suggested, Pardeshi said.""But, this is what we anticipate,"" he said. ""Symptoms shown by the patients also conform with zinc phosphide (poisoning).""Mahawar, run from an upscale residential street in state capital Raipur, had been barred from manufacturing medicines for 90 days back in 2012 after it was found in to have produced sub-standard drugs, but it did not lose its license.An investigation is now under way into why the drugs were bought locally when there was enough stock of the medicine with the state's central procurement agency, Agarwal said.""There was no incentive to procure locally so we need to investigate why it was done. This means something is wrong,"" he said.More possible victims arrived at hospitals from villages on Thursday and Friday, some clutching medicine strips from Mahawar and complaining of vomiting, dizziness and swelling, a doctor at the district's main public hospital said on Friday.The new patients had not attended the sterilization camps, but had consumed the drugs separately, the doctor and another official said.The state government said it had seized 200,000 tablets of Ciprocin 500 and over 4 million other tablets manufactured by Mahawar.Police have arrested Ramesh Mahawar, the firm's managing director, and his son. Mahawar has said both are innocent.India is the world's top sterilizer of women, and efforts to rein in population growth have been described as the most draconian after China. Indian birth rates fell in recent decades, but population growth remains among the world's fastest.Sterilization is popular because it is cheap and effective, and sidesteps cultural resistance to and problems with distribution of other types of contraception in rural areas.
