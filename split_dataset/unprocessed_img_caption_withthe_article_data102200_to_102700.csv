(AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7f41324000032005729bd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"VATICAN CITY (RNS) The Roman Catholic Church in Australia acknowledged that “obligatory celibacy” may have contributed to decades of clerical sexual abuse of children in what may be the first such admission by church officials around the world.A church advisory group called the Truth, Justice and Healing Council made the startling admission Friday (Dec. 12) in a report to the government’s Royal Commission, which is examining thousands of cases of abuse in Australia.The 44-page report by the council attacked church culture and the impact of what it called “obedience and closed environments” in some religious orders and institutions.“Church institutions and their leaders, over many decades, seemed to turn a blind eye, either instinctively or deliberately, to the abuse happening within their diocese or religious order, protecting the institution rather than caring for the child,” the report said.“Obedience and closed environments also seem to have had a role in the prevalence of abuse within some religious orders and dioceses. Obligatory celibacy may also have contributed to abuse.”The council’s CEO, Francis Sullivan, who has held various administrative roles in the health sector, including heading Catholic Health Australia, said clergy training should include “psychosexual development.”“It’s a no-brainer,” Sullivan said. “You need to address how sexuality is understood and acted out by members of the clergy.”But the Chicago-based Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, which represents around 20,000 victims worldwide, said the latest report did little to help protect those at risk from abuse.“Decisive action is needed, not more reports,” SNAP national director David Clohessy said. “The church hierarchy knows what’s needed. It simply refuses to give up its power and enable secular authorities to investigate and prosecute those who commit and conceal sexual violence against the vulnerable.”The Vatican’s chief spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, could not be reached for comment Friday. But Maltese Bishop Charles Scicluna, the Vatican’s former chief prosecutor for abuse cases, tried to put the report in context in remarks to the Italian daily La Stampa.“You mustn’t forget that most abuse occurs in the family,” he said. “Obviously I don’t exclude individual cases where celibacy is lived badly that may have psychological consequences. But it should be said clearly that it is certainly not the origin of this sad and very painful phenomenon and remember that there is no nexus between cause and effect.”The suggestion of a link between celibacy and child sexual abuse has divided Australian Catholic leaders in the past.Cardinal George Pell, former archbishop of Sydney and now head of the Vatican’s powerful economic ministry, acknowledged there may be a connection when he testified before a separate government inquiry in Australia last year. He was unavailable for comment at the Vatican Friday.The independent Australian council is made up of church and lay members and is supervised by some of the nation’s senior archbishops, though its views do not necessarily reflect those of all senior clergy."

He called on religious leaders to speak out against the Taliban.""These acts are not Islamic and are inhuman,"" he said.The Taliban's increasingly bold attacks in Kabul have led to the government being criticized for serious security failures.Ghani said he was seeking to revive a security body last seen during a Soviet-backed government in the 1980s. He did not give more details, but his spokesman said the new body would coordinate between police, military and intelligence agencies.""The number of forces we have in Kabul is sufficient, but the way they are being used is a problem, we have to change that,"" spokesman Nazifullah Salarzai said after the event.Kabul houses thousands of soldiers and police armed with light and heavy weapons. It is fortified with razor wire-topped concrete blast walls and dotted with checkpoints. But this does not seem to have curbed the Taliban's confidence.On Thursday, a suicide bombing at a French cultural center guarded by the army in central Kabul killed a German man, who was attending a performance of a play denouncing suicide bombs.When two Kabul guest houses used by foreigners were targeted within days of each other last month, the Kabul police chief lost his position, although the official reason for his dismissal remains unclear. ""FRAGILE SECURITY""In the past two days, Taliban fighters shot dead a dozen workers removing landmines in the south of the country, killed seven soldiers and blew up a military convoy, killing two U.S. soldiers near Bagram Airfield, north of the capital.On a trip to northern Afghanistan on Saturday, German defense minister Ursula von der Leyen described the security situation as ""fragile.""Ghani has yet to announce a cabinet two months after he took office in a power-sharing agreement with his main rival, Abdullah Abdullah, a situation critics say has left the country adrift while the Taliban are cranking up violence.Salarzai said the president devoted a third of his time to security and that, in the long run, the slow selection of officials would assure good governance in a country plagued by political corruption.He added that the government was committed to naming the cabinet within the next two weeks.Officials say the delay in selecting ministers is the result of Ghani's power tussle with Abdullah, who joined the government after a disputed election.

Sadly, Sandy Hook was not the last shooting to impact our schools... far from it.According to an updated report by Everytown for Gun Safety and Moms Demand Action, there have been at least 94 shootings at schools across the country since the Sandy Hook tragedy, resulting in 44 deaths and 78 injuries. That's 94 times a gun has gone off in or around an American school. These incidents include suicides, gang-related gun violence, accidental shootings, and simple arguments that may not have been fatal had a gun not been present.When people discuss school shootings, what immediately comes to mind are those like Sandy Hook that shatter entire communities within minutes, even seconds. And yes, mass shootings take a devastating toll, but they are not the only senseless acts of gun violence that threaten our schools.Often times, the media dismisses school shootings that resemble so-called ""gang violence,"" not to mention accidental shootings and suicides at schools. But the bottom line is that any time a gun goes off at school, children and parents should be terrified. Should a victim's mother feel any less heartache knowing her child was killed in an accidental shooting or because of gang activity?I recently met a Chicago mom -- Pamela Wright -- whose only son, Tyrone, was shot and killed nearly two years ago following a high school basketball game -- one of the 94 school shootings since the Sandy Hook tragedy. Tyrone was doing nothing wrong -- he was simply leaving a basketball game on Friday night, like any other high school kid. Is his death any less meaningful than those who have died in mass shootings? It is irresponsible and dangerous for the media to dismiss Tyrone's death as just another kid in the wrong place, at the wrong time. Anytime a gun is fired on school grounds, fear strikes the parents and members of that community. That could be my son, or yours.This week, Moms Demand Action released a powerful video that depicts the lockdown culture in American classrooms, and reminds us that these kinds of threats confront kids in schools everywhere, every day. While our children are facing these fears in their classrooms, our elected officials are hesitant to take action. We owe our children a world where they don't have to practice shielding themselves from a barrage of bullets in their classrooms, and a country where our leaders take the security of our schoolchildren seriously.We do not send our children to school to learn how to hide from gunmen, nor should we expect sharpshooting to be a job requirement for educators. The work to change the culture of gun violence in America has begun, but with nearly 100 school shootings since Sandy Hook, it is apparent there is so much more to be done. Until Americans step up and demand policies and laws that will keep guns out of dangerous hands and keep our schools safe, these tragedies, this new normal, will continue. It's time we hold our elected leaders accountable and demand more. I will never forget Sandy Hook, nor will the moms and other supporters who have joined me in this fight. But we also must never forget the 44 young lives that have been ripped from their families and loved ones in the school shootings since. We cannot allow these victims to become merely statistics, and Moms are more determined than ever to make real progress on this issue in their name. Join us."

But if the contents of the stolen emails sound somewhat familiar to comic-book fans, that's because so much of the information was already previously reported. Ahead, a brief guide to all the superhero news you already knew about before the Sony Pictures hack:Spider-Man could have joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe While Spider-Man and Captain America are both part of the Marvel Comics universe, they exist in different realms onscreen. Spider-Man is a Sony property; Captain America and his fellow Avengers belong to Disney. But according to emails sent on Oct. 13 and published by The Daily Beast, Sony and Disney discussed putting Spider-Man in ""Captain America: Civil War."" One week before those notes were sent, however, on Oct. 6, HitFix writer Drew McWeeny alluded to the same thing:While I can't get the confirmations I need to verify the story, I'm hearing that there are some very cool ""Spider-Man"" plans being discussed that would help Sony refocus their enormously important franchise while also opening up some connections in the onscreen Marvel movie universe that would blow fandom's minds. Will it work out? I don't know. I would love to be able to state for sure that it's happening. What seems clear from what I've heard is that Marvel wants to be able to play with all of their characters, and if they can make that work creatively and on a corporate level, they will, and that means the world gets bigger again.On Oct. 7, one day after McWeeny's report published, Entertainment Weekly's Anthony Breznican revealed that ""delicate preliminary conversations"" were underway between Sony and Disney regarding Spider-Man.Sony could reboot Spider-Man again Following the disappointing box-office returns for ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"" there was much discussion online about the future of Spider-Man. The same thing happened inside Sony: As reported by The Daily Beast, Sony executives, in emails dated Nov. 13, had conversations about rebooting the Spider-Man franchise for a third time. Three months earlier, on Aug. 4, Deadline.com reported that similar discussions had occurred. On Oct. 7, in a post that provided a rundown of various Spider-Man rumors, Badass Digest editor Devin Faraci reported that one of Sony's options was to ""soft reboot"" Spider-Man within the studio's ""Sinister Six"" film. That movie would have ""a new actor playing a Spidey who works with the villains.""There could be an all-female Spider-Man movie A Sept. 20 email exchange discussed a female superhero movie within the Spider-Man world and the possibility of building a shared universe on par with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Deadline.com also reported on that news in August:Having pushed the next installment of its Spider-Man franchise out of 2016 and into 2018, Sony Pictures is doing a top-to-bottom revamp of its most important property, insiders say. And that includes a female superhero movie which is being eyed for a 2017 release date, Deadline has learned.On Oct. 30, Faraci wrote that the potential project, called ""Glass Ceiling,"" would bring together female characters in the Spider-Man world.Joss Whedon might not direct ""Marvel's The Avengers: Infinity War"" While not part of Sony, the Marvel Cinematic Universe was discussed in emails too. One correspondence apparently revealed that ""Captain America: Civil War"" directors Anthony and Joe Russo would likely take over for Joss Whedon on the third ""Avengers"" film, ""Infinity War,"" which will get split into two parts. That was known before as well: Faraci reported the Russos rumor in October. In a November post about Daniel Bruhl joining ""Captain America: Civl War,"" Deadline.com confirmed the speculation was real:The Russos are building up their Marvel cred with this all-star outing, and I keep hearing they will step up to the ultimate Marvel all-star team and take the reins of The Avengers franchise from Joss Whedon, possibly with that next film that will shoot back to back."

Much-awaited budget flights between Singapore and the Malaysian city of Kuala Lumpur started Friday, ending the decades-old virtual duopoly of the lucrative route by the two countries' flag carriers. It was a move analysts believe would increase demand on the route - already Asia's fourth busiest - and spur other Southeast Asian nations to speed up efforts to liberalize the region's air services. (AP Photo/Wong Maye-E)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc1424e260000520070a5a5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BEIJING -- Attacks with scalding water, a bomb threat and a half-hearted suicide attempt -- all in one plane ride. Mark this down as one of the most bizarre stories in a long time of bad behavior on a flight. Passengers who were aboard a Thai AirAsia flight from Bangkok to the Chinese city of Nanjing told China's Shenzhen Satellite TV that the drama started with a dispute over the beverage service, and quickly spiraled out of control.According to passengers who spoke with the TV station, a female passenger threw scalding water on a flight attendant. Cell phone footage posted online then shows a man who other passengers identified as her boyfriend threatening to blow up the plane. When the woman was eventually asked to apologize, she began threatening suicide while pounding on the airplane windows, according to the TV report.The chain of events worried the pilots enough that they turned around and flew back to Bangkok’s airport, where multiple reports said the troublemakers were promptly arrested.The incident occurred on Thursday, but with cell phone videos and eyewitness accounts continuing to pour out, Chinese state media reported Chinese authorities issued a statement on Saturday night saying the passengers have been put on a travel blacklist in their home province after they “severely tarnished the image of the Chinese people.”Eyewitnesses interviewed by Shenzhen Satellite TV described a bizarre sequence of events in which petty complaints quickly escalated into threats of mass murder. The couple first lashed out over seating assignments, but things truly heated up over a cup of boiling water, witnesses told the station.After ordering a cup of hot water for her instant noodles, the woman was told hot water costs money and that it couldn’t be served during takeoff, according to the television interviews. After the water for the noodles was delivered, disputes over currency and receipts rapidly escalated. When a flight attendant turned around, the woman threw the hot water on her back, passengers told Shenzhen Satellite TV.When flight attendants demanded an apology from the man, he took things to the next level, according to cell phone footage posted online that purportedly shows the altercation.“So I can't even spend my money?"" the unidentified man can be seen shouting in one cell phone video included in the TV station's report. “If there are problems then they were caused by you! ... I’m going to blow up the plane!”An eyewitness surnamed Wu told Shenzhen Satellite TV that both the man and the airline staff demanded apologies from one another, but both sides refused. Wu said that when it became clear the plane was turning around, the man tried to de-escalate the situation, but his girlfriend was not prepared to cooperate.“He told his girlfriend [to apologize], but she just got even crazier,” said Wu. “She tried to directly climb over her seat to the row behind her, saying ‘If you apologize to them I’m going to kill myself in front of you.’ She started banging on the window and the door. At that point we were all terrified.”China's state  Xinhua News Agency said that when the plane landed back at Don Meung Airport in Bangkok, the couple and two other passengers were placed under arrest. They paid 50,000 Thai baht (about $1,500) in compensation to the flight attendant (who was treated for possible injures, Shenzhen Satellite TV reported), as well as fines equivalent to $3 and $6 for “disturbing public order.”  Xinhua also reported that AirAsia has said it will not pursue further legal action.Chinese officials have expressed their intent to deter disruptive behavior by Chinese air travelers, after national airports have been the scenes of numerous public disturbances and even brawls in recent years, with some passengers pursuing vigilante justice over perceived mistreatment by airline employees.Brouhahas involving Chinese tourists -- including one instance in which a Chinese teenager reportedly carved his name into an Egyptian monument -- have also received international attention, with both the Chinese public and the country's government expressing shame over each incident.There are plenty of well-documented instances of bad behavior from airline passengers of all nationalities, but the issue strikes at the heart of public insecurity in China over the nation's place in the world: Despite ballooning income levels, many Chinese feel they and their country don’t get respect abroad.Attempted remedies have included a controversial commercial on state television: Panda-suited actors were shown sleeping on park benches, urinating in public and forcing locals to take pictures with them. The ad, which saw the urinating scene cut before it was fully pulled from TV, concluding by imploring: “Don’t forget the whole world is watching us. Everybody be a good panda.”"

Here are 5 standout moments from the night: 1. Sam Smith's Acoustic Performance Of ""Latch"" From the moment Smith took the stage, the British singer captivated the entire arena with his soulful voice and heartfelt ballads. Though ""Stay With Me"" and ""I'm Not The Only One"" had everyone in the place a little teary-eyed, his acoustic performance of ""Latch"" is what really gave the crowd goosebumps. The stripped down rendition of the dance hit by Disclosure made the song even more amazing. 2. Ariana Grande Handled A Minor Trip-up Like A Boss Ariana Grande is one of the biggest names in music this year, and all eyes were on her as she belted out her latest radio smash, ""Love Me Harder."" Unfortunately, that meant that the whole audience saw her trip as she walked across the stage. But the way she handled the stumble only made the performance more memorable.""Woo, girl! I almost died up here,"" she laughed, before carrying on with the performance. The 21-year-old proved again that she could laugh at herself when she posted the video to her Instagram account the following day: 3. Lil Jon Showed Up in A Santa Suit Thanks to this guy, the most frequently asked question of the year was ""Turn down for what?"" At Jingle Ball, Lil Jon proved once again that he turns down for absolutely nothing and no one, as he hit the stage in a Santa Suit to introduce ""5 Seconds Of Summer."" 4. Nick Jonas Brought An Enviable Posse Okay Jonas, now we're the ones who are ""jealous."" His performance of the hit song was a standout moment of the night, thanks to the backing of a Gospel choir who sang along with him. That was the only song Jonas had on the set list for the evening, but it was a major takeaway from the event. 5. Taylor Swift Invited Us To Her Birthday Party Arguably the biggest star of the show, Swift was the last performer of the night, and the singer was ready to go out with a bang. After performing ""Welcome To New York,"" ""We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together"" and ""Blank Space,"" to an audience that was belting out every word along with her, Swift was sure to announce that her birthday was just a few minutes away as the clock neared midnight. She then finished up with ""I Knew You Were Trouble"" and ""Shake It Off,"" as the evening officially turned into her birthday bash. So yes, technically HuffPost Entertainment was at Taylor Swift's 25th birthday party. "

Twenty years after the death of former dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, the orphanages are still full of children and adults, because the regimeï¿½s policy which previously rendered abortion and contraception illegal, is still very strong in the minds of the population.

Journalists and foreign health care workers were appalled to discover the condition of babies and children in the many state-run institutions in the country. During the Ceausescu era, abortions were difficult to obtain, and many families were simply too poor to handle another mouth to feed. The 700 orphanages scattered around the country were filled to bursting with 170,000 children.Many of the children were healthy. Adoption agencies began to match children to eager parents abroad. In that first year, Romania sent 10,000 children abroad, and tens of thousands more before the Romanian government, citing corruption, imposed a moratorium in 2001.But there were also many children that didn't fit the profile that most adoptive parents wanted. These were the ""irrecuperables,"" the children with mental and physical disabilities who were warehoused in ""hospitals."" Romanian authorities, both during and immediately after the Ceausescu era, had deemed these children beyond recuperation.In 1990, I tracked down one of these ""hospitals"" in the tiny village of Gradinari, about 20 kilometers outside of Bucharest. It was a sobering experience. ""Since the weather was nice, the children were outside, in the backyard of a large institutional-looking building,"" I wrote at the time (the report is reproduced below). ""There were over 100. The supervisor explained: 120 children and only 2 nurses. There were two long picnic tables crowded with children. A group of pens were set up underneath a tent. Several older children stood off to one side. One child, with only one leg, ambled around using his arm as a second leg. All the children were filthy, some with cuts, some only half-clothed. The children in the pens, their heads shaved, rolled around in their soiled diapers, some malnourished to the point of apparent starvation. The mixture of disabilities was staggering: Downs syndrome, autism, amputees, physical birth defects and so on.""On returning to Romania in 2013, I planned to go back to Gradinari to see what happened to the irrecuperables. It turned out, however, that I needed to apply for permission beforehand, and I ran out of time to get the necessary paperwork.I did, however, have a chance to interview Bogdan Bobolea. He works with the Irish charity Comber which focuses on children and adults with disabilities in Giurgiu County, where Gradinari is located. A quarter century after the fall of Ceausescu, there are still many institutions and orphanages throughout Romania. Comber is working to close them down and build homes in the community for the residents. They've built two residential homes in Gradinari for 16 people. In the much larger Giurgiu city, they run two houses and four apartments, along with a day center that organizes activities.Several recent news accounts have reported on the persistence of dreadful conditions in the remaining orphanages and institutions. The BBC made a secret film of its visit to several places in Giurgiu County, and this had prompted the government to institute its new permitting procedure.Bobolea thought the BBC report one-sided. ""We have improved, not much perhaps, but compared with what was in 1990, I think we've progressed a lot,"" he told me in Bucharest in May 2013. In terms of the institutions that haven't yet been closed down, ""the buildings are better. The sanitary conditions are better. There are clothes. There are cleaning staff. The food is okay. What is missing is the specialized staff.""The institution that I visited in Gradinari, for instance, has been shut down. The children, now grown up, have been moved to other facilities. As Bobolea explained, children with disabilities have several options when they turn 18. ""As soon as they reach 18, they have four options,"" he told me. ""They can go to a big institution. They can go to an NGO if there are spots open in the residential facilities. They can go back to their families. Or they can go to a foster family.""The reality is a bit starker for most of these children, however. Foster families prefer children without disabilities. The original families are often reluctant to take on the challenge. And there are not many spots open in the residential facilities.""The only available spot is when someone is taken home,"" Bobolea said. ""But nobody is taken home. What we're doing now in Giurgiu is to put a couple beds in an office to house two persons. Or we're adding a fifth person to an apartment and that person will stay in the living room. It's better to use the available space if it's possible. But we cannot put more than five in an apartment.""The worst situation is when a child with disabilities has been living in a residential setting, turns 18, and there's no spot available in any of the houses or apartments for adults. They face the possibility of returning to one of the remaining large-scale institutions and losing the progress they'd made in the more supportive environment.The EU has declared it a priority to close the orphanages and large-scale institutions. But it has not made sufficient funds available to build the houses and apartments that can serve as replacements.I asked Bobolea how long it would take, if the EU funds were available, to close all the institutions.""If the money is here on the table, it would take 10 years, maybe less,"" he replied. ""We would have to build the houses. It takes one year of construction, and then you have to train the staff...maybe ten years. But without the money: indefinitely.""The InterviewYou were explaining what's happened since I was here last and why it requires a permission to visit Gradinari.  I spoke with the deputy manager, and she said in order to have access you have to send an official request. But it's possible. It means that you can visit, but you need to sign a document that say that you won't use hidden camera, that you have a translator/interpreter.Two or three years ago, a BBC crew, using a hidden camera, took some photos and actually recorded a video in Gradinari. It appeared in a movie broadcast on BBC. What they showed was true, but they didn't show the other side, the good things that have happened since 1990. They didn't speak with Comber or with the DGASPC [General Directorate for Social Assistance and Protection], because in that case it would have been a balanced documentary. We have improved, not much perhaps, but compared with what was in 1990, I think we've progressed a lot.  Why did they have to bring a hidden camera?  I don't know. You see now what's happening in the UK, with Bulgarians and Romanians there. Probably someone wanted a huge headline in the newspaper or on TV about what's happening here.  I'm interested how you became involved in this work.  Three or four years ago, when I was working in England, Comber had an advertisement in Romania for a project coordinator. One of my friends read that advert and sent it to me. I applied, and I had a phone interview with Fiona Dowling, who was the director at that time. Then we had a meeting in Dublin outside the airport. And then they hired me.I came here at that time with another colleague who started work for Comber two or three years before I started. He showed me around. I visited all the institutions, and that was the start. I was involved at the beginning in the supervising of the building of a house in Izvoarele. We're still trying to open it. Then with this project over the summer, we had professionals, students, fresh graduates, or people with a lot of experience in fields like social work, social care, and psychology. They came here for four or five weeks and stayed in Giurgiu. We had many interpreters, high school students, who worked with the Romanian staff in our homes and apartments. This project ran for three years. This year we don't have any candidates. With trainings for the staff we opened a center with another NGO from Bucharest, and I also was involved in that. So basically, I was supervising the building of various structures, recruiting volunteers, and involved in this center.  Before you took the job, did you know very much about the situation here for children with disabilities?  For children, yes, because before that I worked only with children. So I knew about SERA from France. They closed two or three huge institutes in Bacau. There were children with physical disabilities and mental health associated with this. But regarding the adults, I am ashamed to say but I didn't know much about it.  Tell me a little bit about what happened since 1990 in terms of for the facility for children at Gradinari as part of the larger change.  What I know is that it was closed. It was refurbished, enlarged, and then it was closed. They were moved to Tantava. Some of them were sent to Bolintin. When I came here it was all shut down, so I don't know much about that. I saw the empty building, I was there several times, and I tried to imagine how it was at that time.  It was a big, big building. A lot of kids. And my understanding at the time was that there were one or two of those facilities in each county in Romania.  Maybe two or three. Still now there are many. If you have access to the national database, you can see there are at least two in each county, more than 50, 60, maybe 100. But, again, it's better to check again to have real figures.  Some have been shut down, but -  Most are still open. There was pressure from the EU to close the orphanages. And we invested a lot of money doing that. But regarding adults, even the EU Structural Funds (ESF) allocated money only to refurbish the old buildings or renovate them. We're building something nearby. But they didn't allocate money to build small residential care homes. So because it wasn't eligible for an NGO to apply to build two or three houses, Comber couldn't apply.I was at a meeting in Bucharest two or three years ago. It was a huge table, and almost all the managers from religious charities were there, as well as someone from the financial ministry.We asked,""What can you do?""And this Romanian from the finance ministry, who also was the president of the body coordinating all the ESF funds in Romania, said, ""The code is not written, and we cannot give you the money to refurbish or to build new small houses.""  They knew that they couldn't get the money from the EU, and therefore they couldn't provide the money.  Yes, because it's not eligible. There are people putting pressure to change that, but I don't know what will happen. We'll see when they will launch a new line of finance.  Let's go back to the EU pressure to close the orphanages. They provided money...To read the rest of the interview, click here."

11,GREEN,At the Heart of COP20: Loss and Damage,"Bianca Jagger, ContributorFounder and Chair, Bianca Jagger Human Rights Foundation",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cop-20-lack-of-action-and_b_6321116.html,"Over the past thirteen days world leaders and representatives from 195 countries, members of the business community, academics, NGOs, indigenous and grassroots organisations, a total of over 12,000 international visitors have descended on Lima.",2014-12-14,2014-12-14-BJAndministryofdefencestatuescop20.jpeg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-14-BJAndministryofdefencestatuescop20-thumb.jpeg," Bianca Jagger at COP20, at the Ministry of Defence, Lima PeruI am writing from Lima, Peru, where the 20th Conference of Parties (COP) for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was supposed to be coming to a close... there has been wrangling all night, the closing plenary of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (ADP) has finished without a concrete result. The COP President Manuel Pulgar-Vidal was meeting with countries and country blocs to see if agreement can be reached before decision-makers return home.The name of the outcome document that will result at Lima has been discussed. In the past we have had the Kyoto Protocol, the Copenhagen Accord, the Cancun Agreement, the Durban Platform and the Warsaw Framework. The name 'Lima Action Platform is being suggested, or LAP.' 'LAP' may end up standing for 'Lack of Action and Progress.'Over the past thirteen days world leaders and representatives from 195 countries, members of the business community, academics, NGOs, indigenous and grassroots organisations, a total of over 12,000 international visitors have descended on Lima. The aim of COP20 was to establish what each country's 'contributions' in the fight against climate change should look like. These 'Intended nationally-determined contributions', (INDCs in UN parlance), should form the basis of the global climate agreement that is expected to be finalized at Paris in 2015 at COP21. I have not been optimistic about the outcome of COP20 from the start. I fear this UN climate conference will go down in history as the COP which failed to make provision for the poorest and most vulnerable, that failed to protect the rights of indigenous people and local communities; that postponed REDD+ negotiations, and failed to promote gender equality. Bianca Jagger speaking at COP20COPOddly, the COP takes place in the Ministry of Defence, referred to by Peruvians as the 'Pentagonito,' meaning 'little pentagon.' It's a sprawling military barracks, with old army training equipment scattered across the grounds. A labyrinthine village of vast temporary buildings and tents has been put up, comprising 30 conference rooms and two plenaries for 2,000 people. The enormous windowless concrete Ministry looms over the whole. As I remarked to a colleague, somehow the site reminds me of Bosnia in the 1990s...There is hardly any provision for disabled people at the COP and woeful provision for those who, like me, have an injury. There were no lifts that I could see, and getting from place to place involved long walks in the heat. I walk with a stick. I found negotiating the COP difficult, so I can only imagine the challenge it presents for those who are disabled.Most of the events relating to indigenous communities took place at the Maloca, the Indigenous Pavilion, which was in the 'Jockey Club,' a horse racing track about a mile from the main COP. The Maloca was the only area I visited that was deprived of wifi - a tool crucial for networking, negotiating and decision-making. Getting to and from the Pavilion for indigenous events was not easy. There were no buses from the Maloca to participants hotels - we had to return to the Pentagonito and take a bus from there. Indigenous people are present in force at COP20 but tragically their voices are not being heard.ADP DRAFT DECISION TEXTAt about 2 am this morning, Lima, Peru time, a new draft text of the ADP was issued that could form the basis of an agreement in Paris. The decision text is fatally weak, does not respect the principles of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, is vague on financing, unbalanced, and overly focused on mitigation. The concept of differentiated responsibility is being diluted by new terms. Language relating to 'loss and damage' which is critical for developing countries has been removed. In short it is a poor basis for an agreement in Paris.All these shortcomings will affect developing countries and poor communities in disastrous ways. At 10.40 am this morning, the closing Plenary began, where countries responded to the text. Some including Malaysia, Sudan, Tuvalu, China, Cuba, Oman, Pakistan, my native Nicaragua and South Africa among others objected to the text, and refuse to accept the agreement as it stands. These countries called for negotiations on the text of the agreement to continue directly under the Peruvian COP President Manuel Pulgar Vidal. Ian Fry of Tuvalu, speaking for the Least Developed Countries, stated: 'This text needs a little surgery. We'd like to put on gowns and scalpels and insert some vital organs.' He also stated, 'Loss and damage is a crucial issue for the poorest and most vulnerable.'I was very surprised that after eloquently lamenting the loss and damage language, the Philippines agreed to accept the draft ADP text as it stands.Singapore described a lack of trust: the draft text is deviating from the Convention, there's backsliding on finance and commitments from developed countries. The Malaysian representative Prof. Gurdial Singh Nijar said, 'If you look at who is clapping in this room, and when, you realise we come from different worlds. Many of you colonised us. We started out at different points... The ADP process in Lima has been exhausted... This process was not given a chance until it was too late. This is unlikely to produce an outcome. You must recognise that there is a world out there, a disenfranchised world that is different to your world.'Nicaragua's representative Jaime Hermida Castillo said, 'the divisions over the draft agreement are a reflection of our world... We feel climate change right now, although we didn't create it. But we don't have the same resources to deal with it.' India echoed these sentiments, stating, 'Let us not forget the billions of poor. Let's not make the poor pay for this, but the polluters.'The ADP draft text has now been passed to the COP for further revision, under the supervision of President Pulgar-Vidal. The aim is to achieve a consensus today. He meets all blocs for 10 minutes each. He stated this morning, 'This is not a moment for proposals but for solutions. Let's work together.' We'll see. Human rights are not mentioned in the ADP. It is both inexplicable and unconscionable that the concept of human rights has been omitted from the draft text. 'A safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment is integral to the full enjoyment of human rights, including the rights to life, health, food, water and sanitation.' Climate change, and the harms it will cause, are fundamentally issues of human rights. The Philippines had proposed that the following language be added to the ADP: 'fair, inclusive, respectful of human rights and particularly rights of indigenous people and women.' Ghana and Mexico supported the addition of human rights language. Unfortunately I fear, there is now very little chance they will prevail. I cannot fathom why more countries did not support the addition of this language to the ADP. On the 10th of December - International Human Rights Day - the Special Procedures Mandate Holders, the largest body of independent experts in the United Nations Human Rights system, issued a statement urging Member States to integrate human rights standards and principles in the climate negotiations. It's critical, their statement continues, since 'impacts of climate change interfere with the effective enjoyment of human rights. In particular, climate change has a disproportionate effect on many disadvantaged, marginalized, excluded and vulnerable individuals and groups, including those whose ways of life are inextricably linked to the environment.' (my italics). It seems they were not heeded. In the language of the Advanced Durban Platform decision text it appears that preambular language referencing ""human rights and the rights of indigenous peoples"" has been removed. COP PROCESS, HISTORYI have attended COP13 in Bali, COP14 in Poznań, COP15 in Copenhagen, COP17 in Durban, COP18 in Doha, COP19 in Warsaw and will hopefully attend COP21 next year in Paris. I truly hope that the UNFCCC will be able to achieve a global, legally binding climate deal next year but I have reservations.COP15 in Copenhagen should have been a turning point. It was a unique opportunity to set the world on the right path to avoid catastrophic climate change. For two days, most of the world's leaders congregated under one roof for a common purpose. Attended by 119 Heads of State, COP15 was the largest gathering of its kind held outside of the annual UN General Assembly in New York. The highlight was the attendance of US President Obama. The two weeks of meetings, extending late into the night, marked the culmination of two years of intensive negotiations. The conference was the focus of unprecedented public and media attention. And yet, the result - the Copenhagen Accord - was a shameful compromise.The words ""legally binding"" were conspicuously absent from the three-page text of the Copenhagen Accord. The Accord was merely ""politically binding"" for those countries that chose to sign up to it. Furthermore, it did not set emissions reduction targets for either 2020 or 2050, nor did it set a deadline by which the action points should become legally binding.The French newspaper Liberation lamented the speed and commitment to saving the planet compared with saving the global financial system: ""We must make the bitter observation: when it comes to rescuing the banking system, the dialogue has been far more effective and determined. It is clearly easier to save finance, than it is to save the planet."" Since COP15 expectations have been declining steadily with each conference. At COP20, they are at an all-time low. After having seen the discussions in the Plenary this morning, I wonder how much we've learned since Copenhagen. CLIMATE INJUSTICE2014 will probably end up being the hottest year since records began in 1880, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. We have already matched 1998's temperatures, previously the warmest year on record. Time is running out. Inaction will lead to severe and irreversible damage. Climate change will affect everyone, everywhere, in every nation and in every echelon of society in the developing and developed world. We will all suffer the catastrophic consequences of: rising sea levels, desertification, food and water scarcity and political unrest. But some of the most vulnerable communities in the world are bearing a disproportionate burden of the harm without having significantly contributed to the cause. This is a terrible injustice.Hearing delegates' responses to the ADP text this morning, reinforced my opinion that there is a bias and injustice inherent in these negotiations. Failure to acknowledge different countries' different responsibilities can only end in failure. A comprehensive, legally binding, global climate deal must make provision for the rights of all and acknowledge that some countries are more responsible for climate change than others. We must achieve Climate Justice, a recognition that climate change will disproportionately affect people who have less ability to prevent, adapt or otherwise respond to increasingly extreme weather events, rising sea levels and increasing resource scarcity. The COP has always drawn lines drawn between the 'haves' and the 'have nots', between so-called 'developing countries' and the developed world, between the 'global north' and 'global south.' The climate talks are often fraught with bias and discrimination towards the global south, women, indigenous people and the poor as well as protesters. Their voices and that of civil society are often ignored in negotiations. Sometimes even freedom of expression is curtailed at the COP, as we have seen here this week. COP rules require protesters to submit their banners and slogans for approval, and prohibit the mention of specific names, officials and projects. Alyssa Johnson Kurts, with the US youth delegation SustainUS told Democracy Now, ""We tried to submit a banner that would have an arrow with Keystone XL in one direction and a liveable future in the other direction, and they rejected that proposal,"" she says. In contrast, very few restrictions are placed on the fossil fuel companies that come to the COP. Corporations and fossil fuel companies have always had a presence at the negotiations. Yesterday, December 12th, 350.org delivered a petition with 53,000 signatures to the COP organisers, calling for fossil fuel corporations and their lobbyists to be banned from the negotiations.Hoda Baraka, Global Communications Manager for 350.org, said 'The fossil fuel industry is actively lobbying against climate action and standing in the way of progress. When you're trying to burn the table down, you don't deserve a seat at it.'REDD+ REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) was identified as a key area of focus for Lima. COP20 President, Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, announced forests as a critical theme and set the goal of realising ""progress made in regards to the role of forests (REDD+)."" REDD+ is our opportunity to make a global commitment to forest conservation and enhancement of forest carbon stocks.It is critical that these developments should respond to the concerns of indigenous people and guarantee full and effective participation of indigenous peoples in all processes, programmes and actions at all levels, including their access to funding mechanisms, financing and capacity building. This must include a robust and enforceable system of social, environmental and human rights safeguards.REDD+ is beset by a fundamental difference in thinking. Some see REDD+ as an important framework that will bring both forest preservation and will benefit indigenous tribes. Rainforest Foundation Norway for example has ""a rights-based approach to rainforest protection. We believe that the peoples who for generations have developed their cultures and societies in balanced interaction with the highly complex yet vulnerable ecosystems of the rainforest have fundamental rights to these areas. Legal recognition of the collective territorial and cultural rights of forest-based peoples and communities is crucial to the fulfilment of their human rights. It is also a major prerequisite for protecting the rainforest."" Unfortunately there is another school of thought, dangerous dissenters who see REDD+ only as a profit making new market that exists to be exploited.The negotiations and decision-making should have been easy - protecting and advancing the land rights of indigenous people will advance their human rights protections and will also reduce cumulative carbon emissions through healthy and flourishing forests. But the REDD+ negotiations at COP20 collapsed. Climate justice remains a long way off.I gave the keynote address at the REDD+ Implementation Working Group: Legal and Governance Foundations, Indigenous Peoples Rights and Safeguards on December 5th... Morale was low among the negotiators, and sure enough, negotiations reached a deadlock, or REDDLock, and came to a complete halt that Friday here in Lima. The REDD+ talks broke down in part because there has been no agreement on guidance for the safeguards. Countries like the United States and Norway were pushing for more clarity on how these safeguards are reported, but nations like Brazil and Panama among others claimed guidance would be burdensome, slowing implementation of forest protection measures.The REDD+ Safeguards Working Group stated as far back as Cop15, 'No rights, no REDD.'Shamefully, there will be no concrete outcome on forest protection at COP 20, despite this COP being held in Peru, one of the world's largest rainforest countries. Deliberations have concluded for this session. Once again, a critical decision regarding indigenous rights and environmental protection has been postponed until the next UNFCCC inter-sessional meeting in June 2015. Time is running out.FORESTSAs I said in all the five presentations I made at COP20, forests of all kinds are essential to our future. The Amazon in particular is home to about a third of our planet's terrestrial life forms, cycles nearly a quarter of the Earth's freshwater, absorbs around 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year and plays a vital role in moderating the climate. More than 1.6 billion people depend on forests for food, water, fuel, medicines, traditional cultures and livelihoods. Forests support up to 80% of biodiversity on earth and play a vital role in safeguarding the climate by naturally sequestering carbon. Globally, deforestation accounts for up to 18% of greenhouse gas emissions, or roughly 5.8 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent released into the atmosphere, each year. This is more than global transport and aviation combined. According to the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, reducing deforestation is the ""single largest opportunity for cost-effective and immediate reductions of carbon emissions.""The organisation I founded and Chair, the Bianca Jagger Human Rights Foundation (BJHRF) and I are committed to forest conservation. That is why, in 2012, I became IUCN Ambassador for the Bonn Challenge, the largest restoration initiative the world has ever seen. The objective of the Bonn Challenge is to restore 150 million hectares of degraded and deforested land across the world by 2020. There are 2 billion hectares of degraded and deforested land across the world with potential for restoration. Restoring 150 million hectares would capture 47 Gigatonnes of CO2, and reduce the emissions gap by 17%. Forest restoration is invaluable in the race to tackle climate change.Already more than 51 million hectares of land have been committed to the Bonn Challenge, from the following countries: United States, Rwanda, El Salvador, Costa Rica, the Brazilian Mata Atlantica Restoration Pact, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, Niger, Colombia, Ethiopia and Guatemala.INDIGENOUS PEOPLES AND THE FORESTSDuring my participation at COP20, I spoke at several events that addressed the issue of indigenous people's rights, their land and the forest. On December 8th I spoke at the Indigenous people's Hearing on Deforestation and Indigenous Peoples at the Museum of Art in Lima, and the Tri-Caucus and Human Rights & Climate Change Working Group celebration of the first ever Human Rights Day at the UNFCCC on December 10th. I heard many moving testimonies.  At both events, there weren't enough translators, or enough headphones to go around, and many of the audience didn't speak English - so I did my own translation and switched between English and Spanish throughout the speeches.For most of my life I have believed that in order to tackle climate change, we need the forests. In order to protect the forests, we need indigenous people: their wisdom and knowledge. Indigenous people should be at the centre of climate change negotiations. They have been proven the best custodians of ecosystems. A report released on the second of December, titled 'Forest Carbon in Amazonia: The Unrecognised Contribution of Indigenous Territories and Protected Natural Areas' proves what I have long known: that indigenous territories achieve nearly one third (32.8%) of the Amazon's carbon storage - equivalent to all of the forests in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  The Belo Monte dam in 2014. When I visited in 2012, this was still a river flowing through a rainforest.INDIGENOUS HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONSI was hoping that COP20 in Peru, the heartland of many indigenous tribes. would be the conference where we were finally going to address the issue of indigenous people's rights. Tragically indigenous rights are being violated all over the world. They are under siege from unscrupulous governments, mining, drilling, dams, logging and development. Rather than being empowered to use their ecological wisdom and understanding to protect and restore the rain forests, indigenous people face persecution in many corners of the world: murder, abuse and human rights violations: including here in Peru. In September this year, in the Ucayali province to the west of Lima, Edwin Chota Valera, Leoncio Quincima Meléndez, Jorge Ríos Pérez and Francisco Pinedo of the Ashéninka tribe were murdered. Valera was the chief of the Ashéninka. They were killed for defending the rainforest that their communities depend on. Perez's daughter told Newsweek, ""It feels like a knife in my heart. Nothing will cure it. It will last forever. My father fought, and we will go on until we get change or we die."" As natural resources become scarcer, and the pressure upon them increases with increasing population, disputes over land rights, particularly where oil exploration, hydroelectric, mining agribusiness and logging are concerned, are intensifying. Indigenous communities are particularly hard hit and their fundamental rights to life and land are violated in many countries throughout the world.I was shocked and grieved to learn on Sunday 7th December that the body of Jose Isidro Tendetza, former vice-president of the Shuar Federation of Zamora, Ecuador, had been found. He had been missing since November 28th, since he set off to a meeting of campaigners against the Mirador copper mine, which is threatening to decimate the Shuar's ancestral land. That same Sunday I met with Ecuadorian Minister of the Environment Lorena Tapia to urge her government to do everything in their power to investigate this terrible crime.Global Witness's Deadly Environment report, published in December 2013, named Peru as the fourth worst country in the world for such killings, with almost 60 murders since 2002. The Philippines is in third place with 67 murders, followed by Honduras in second place with 109. Brazil holds the dubious honour of first place, with 448 murders.BRAZIL - DAMS IN THE AMAZONBrazil's New Constitution of 1988 was pioneering, a significant step for indigenous peoples' rights. It called for the demarcation of all indigenous lands in Brazil by 1993. As a result thousands of forest peoples were granted the right to their ancestral land which they need for subsistence or spiritual heritage. In the past Brazil had an average of thirteen demarcations per year. Unfortunately under President Dilma Rousseff's administration, which favours development, large-scale agriculture projects, hydroelectric mega dams, plantations, drilling and mining operations, the number of demarcations has sunk to three a year.Even with demarcation, ancestral land is not safe. For many years I have been supporting the communities and indigenous people threatened by the Belo Monte, Madeira and the Tapajós Dam complexes in Brazil. I went on a fact-finding mission to Xingu and the Madeira Rivers in 2012. The dams will impact hundreds of tribes; tens of thousands of people. I published a report on the Huffington Post, titled, 'Belo Monte: An Environmental Crime.' I urge you to read it.  Bianca Jagger on the Xingu RiverThe Brazilian Government appears to have abandoned its people in the name of profit, energy and 'development.' In the Tapajós basin, in the heart of the Amazon, the government plans to construct up to 29 large dams, following the same destructive model as Belo Monte. One tribe in the region, the Mundukuru, a proud warrior tribe, are continuing to resist the planned Tapajós development. They have decided to auto-demarcate their territory in response to the Rousseff administration's refusal to recognise their land rights. Munduruku people protesting the Tapajos Dams, credit Aaron Vincent ElkaimDuring my 2012 fact finding mission, I met with Jose Carlos Arara, leader of the Arara tribe. He said to me: ""The government does not tell us the truth or listen to us. They are not complying with the laws of the land and they are not respecting our rights. Our survival is now in the hands of the government and Norte Energia. The Brazilian government is only thinking about profit and growth. The Belo Monte will take away our autonomy and our right to survive.""I also met with Dr Erwin Kraütler the Bishop of the Xingu. He said to me, ""Belo Monte will be an apocalypse for the Amazon. And the Amazon is important for the world climate. It will have consequences not only for Brazil but for the world. I cannot agree -- not only as a bishop, but as a man -- I cannot agree with this decision, which threatens the survival of future generations."" Bishop Erwin KrautlerThe Brazilian government has used the legal mechanism of Security Suspension"" or ""Suspensão de Segurança,"" to allow them to steamroll its own laws and constitution. Citing the dubious rationale of national security, threatening blackouts and energy crises, the government has been allowed to arbitrarily and repeatedly overturn legal rulings that would have paralyzed Belo Monte and several other dam projects which are currently under construction.In Brazil on the 9th December 2014 the Proposed Constitutional Amendment 215 (PEC 215) was debated in parliament. This Amendment If approved, would transfer authority to demarcate lands from the Executive to Legislative branch. The Amendment would prohibit ancestral land demarcations of indigenous territories. If this Amendment goes through, the Ruralista - a conservative bloc that represents the country's growing agribusiness sector would have the decision making power. The debate has been postponed until next week. If it passes, this is a deeply troubling development.DAMS IN THE AMAZON412 dams are planned across the Amazon rainforest. 256 of them are in Brazil, 77 in Peru, 55 in Ecuador, 14 in Bolivia, six in Venezuela, two in Guyana, and one each in Colombia, French Guyana and Surinam. Five of the six rivers which run through the world's largest tropical forest will be dammed - and damned. All over Brazil, even now, the Amazon's waterways are being blocked and diverted. The river system that provides almost a quarter of the world's fresh water is being dammed, polluted and fouled up. The dams being built throughout South America present a threat to millions of indigenous people. In Brazil alone, 80,000 people will be displaced.Those who are most affected by these dams are the communities and indigenous people, who live in the surrounding areas. These megadams are threatening their survival, way of life and culture.All countries must comply with Article 169 of the International Labour Organization's Convention. It is imperative that indigenous rights, including the right to 'free, prior and informed consent,' are respected. Indigenous peoples' land and territorial rights must be protected in accordance with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and with State obligations under related human rights instruments. I cannot understand why the Latin American countries where megadams are planned, do not opt for renewable energy instead of building these costly - both economically and in terms of human rights - dams. Everything these governments claim that these megadams will deliver could instead be achieved with renewable energy, which would not have the same devastating impact on this vast, fragile ecosystem. Renewable energy is not merely the solution to Latin America's mounting energy needs: it is the solution to all our needs. Promoting renewable energy must now become a global and universal priority. These technologies are the only viable solution to the imminent energy crisis. Nothing is macro-economically more necessary, more practical or cheaper than the conversion of our energy systems from conventional energies to renewable energy.ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER IN THE RAINFORESTIt's not just megadams which are threatening indigenous people and the Amazon. As COP20 drags on inside the military compound which the Guardian newspaper refers to as a 'climate fortress,' there are human rights and environmental disasters happening in Peru. The Peruvian government is pursuing expansion of oil and gas operations in the Amazon.Over the last few months, as the world was preparing for the COP, the North Peruvian Petroperú oil pipeline, which runs through the Amazon for 850 miles, has broken in five places. The spills have, to quote the Guardian: 'spewed thick black clots of crude across jungle and swamp and carpeted local fishing lagoons with dead fish.' Two of the spills are clearly visible from the air: dark scars across the green forest. Indigenous communities nearby report illness in their children; dead fish and the corpses of small animals are clogging up the river. Such activities by governments and corporations are egregious human rights violations. They cause irreparable and irreversible damage to the environment and accelerate climate change. Greg Asner of the Carnegie Institution for Science found, in a report published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, that ""nearly a billion metric tons of above-ground carbon stocks in Peru are at imminent risk for emission into the atmosphere due to land uses such as fossil fuel oil exploration, cattle ranching, oil palm plantations and gold mining."" Resistance to granting indigenous peoples rights to their ancestral land is motivated by profit. Many governments know that beneath indigenous lands lie great reserves of fossil fuels and minerals and they are willing to sacrifice lives and the environment to access them.The Peruvian government is not the only one exploring for oil in the Amazon. The Biosphere of Yasuni National Park in Ecuador is home to a record number of animal and plant species, not to mention the Tagaeri and Taromenane clans of the Waorani, whose ancestral lands sit atop Ecuador's largest undeveloped oil reserves. 90% of the Ecuadorian population opposes the move to drill, but President Correa insists he has 'no choice.' By 2016, a subsidiary of the national oil company, Petroamazonas will be drilling in Yasuni Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputinin (ITT) block, an untouched swathe of primary rainforest covering around 100,000 hectares. The Guardian newspaper alleges that Ecuador has negotiated a secret deal with Chinese bank over ITT's oil.The BJHRF and I also have been supporting the Mayangna people in their struggle to protect their ancestral land - the Biosphere Reserve of Bosawás in Nicaragua, the second largest rain forest in the western hemisphere, home to approximately 40,000 indigenous Mayangna. Bosawás is part of Nicaragua's national patrimony - a unique preserve of indigenous culture. The lives of the Mayangna and Bosawás's unique ecosystems are threatened by invasions of illegal loggers and settlers. The Mayangna leader Charley Taylor was killed on April 24th 2013, trying to defend his lands from loggers, who had cleared 35 acres of precious hardwoods. These invaders have deforested around 150,000 hectares since 2009, are polluting the rivers and threatening the Mayangna people. If these illegal activities are allowed to continue, in ten years Bosawás may no longer exist.I have appealed to President Daniel Ortega to declare a state of emergency in Bosawás.WOMEN AND CLIMATE CHANGEThe Government of Peru announced on December 8th, gender day here at the COP, that Peru will become the first country in South America to incorporate a Climate Change Gender Action Plan into its national climate policy and planning, and the 14th country in the world to do so. This is wonderful news. I met some extraordinary and courageous women indigenous leaders when I spoke at the WECAN event, Women on the Frontlines of Climate Change, on December 8th. Patricia Gualinga, the Kichwa leader from Sarayaku, Ecuador, Ruth Buendia, an Asháninka Leader from Peru, Alicia Cahuiya Iteca of the Huaroni, Ecuador, Tantoo Cardinal of the Tar Sands in Canada among many others. These are inspiring women, standing up to defend the rights of future generations, they are unflinching defenders of their people and their ancestral lands.  Bianca Jagger with Patricia Gualinga, and Alicia Cahuiya AtecaSome of them spoke about Pachamama, the goddess of nature and balance who is honoured here in Peru, and across South America You could translate Pachamama as Mother Earth but it's more than that. 'Pacha' means more than ""earth"" - the word also implies the cosmos, universe, time, space... We can't translate Pachamama literally into English, but perhaps a better attempt would be Mother World.I urge the COP to remember Pachamana and her rights. What's at stake is our future, and that of future generations.Unfortunately women are underrepresented in UNFCCC negotiations, at all the COPs. The UNFCCC has a terrible track record with gender equality. The term wasn't mentioned in documents until 2007. Gender equality isn't mentioned in the ADP text. The Philippines human rights language I mentioned earlier, pushed by Ghana and Mexico, would right this omission.'fair, inclusive, respectful of human rights and particularly rights of indigenous people and women.'This language has been ignored, and the only mention of gender is a stated intent to ask the COP to '(iv) Provide meaningful and regular opportunities for the effective engagement of experts from Parties, relevant international organizations, civil society, indigenous peoples, women, youth, academic institutions, the private sector, and subnational authorities nominated by their respective countries;'This is woefully inadequate. Climate change is an issue of gender equality. In addition there has been shameful compromise in the Subsidiary Body for Implementation SBI two year work programme to advance gender. The SBI work programme was decided in Warsaw, and was a welcome step forward. But this week, in a travesty of cowardly wording, the term 'gender equality' was replaced by 'gender balance' in the text of the SBI decision on the Work Progamme on Gender, at the behest of Saudi Arabia. Gender balance is a purely numerical term. It has nothing to do with equality. Gender equality is mentioned once in the Decision, in a context that negates it. I urge you to read Diego Ortiz's excellent analysis regarding this on the blog adoptanegotiator. Mexico remained the only country which continued to push for the term 'gender equality' to be used throughout the text. This is a fatal step back for gender equality. I am appalled. My only hope is that the COP reopens the topic in Paris. I am very concerned. What would this mean for gender equality at the UN, in the global climate agreement, and for future generations?MOVING FORWARDWe need to achieve a legally binding global climate treaty at COP21 in Paris next year. Failure is not an option. In order to do so we need to reach an equitable agreement on the INDCs now, and agree a draft text that paves the way. It is an example of the bizarre nature of the negotiations at COP20 that, at least this week, the Catholic Church seems to have expressed more progressive views on climate change than most representatives of government here at the UN Climate Conference.The Obispos Declaration, which was released by 9 Catholic bishops from Peru, Brazil, Dhaka, France and South Africa on December 10th called for new models of development and lifestyle, stating that ""central to this is to put an end to the fossil fuel era, phasing out fossil fuel emissions and phasing in 100% renewables with sustainable energy access for all"". I couldn't agree more. In fact, I feel vindicated... I have been calling for reform to our model of development and a phasing out of fossil fuels for many years. You can read what I wrote about the UN Conference on Sustainable Development Rio+20 here... As I write, we're still waiting for an outcome, here at COP20. Now and then, above the din of traffic and the chatter you can hear the squawks of parakeets. At past COPs pressure from the US and other developed countries to cut proceedings short, decision, or no decision, has resulted in a failure to reach an agreement. This tactic was being employed again at COP20. When US representative Todd Stern spoke this morning he warned of the 'hour glass running out,' that failure to accept the draft text could jeopardise the UNFCCC's status. I hope for once the countries can have the courage of their convictions and emerge from COP20 with a concrete outcome. I hope the delegates don't let schedules and timekeeping become the determining factor, once again. Unfortunately I have witnessed the failure of the COPs too often to hold out much hope. Let's hope that Paris brings the change we need."

Mexican federal forces arrived to the port of Acapulco to strengthen security.

The magazine published an abbreviated version of its story on Saturday, as well as a newswire version on Sunday. The full investigation was published Sunday in a print version of the magazine, only available in Mexico.Both the newswire and early version of the Proceso investigation sharply contradict the version of events put forth by Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto’s administration, at a time when a widespread protest movement has questioned the government’s handling of the investigation into the circumstances surrounding the missing students.“We have information that proves the federal government knew what was happening in the moment it was happening, and participated in it,” Anabel Hernández, the lead reporter for the Proceso piece, told HuffPost in a telephone interview. “The government has tried to hide this information.” Proceso's story was co-authored by journalist Steve Fisher and supported by the Investigative Reporting Program at the University of California, Berkeley. The Mexican attorney general's office and the president's office did not immediately respond to requests from HuffPost for comment on the story.On Sept. 26, a group of students from the Ayotzinapa rural teachers college in the southwestern state of Guerrero traveled to the nearby city of Iguala to take part in a protest. They were ambushed and shot at along the way by police forces, leading to three deaths and several injuries.Several students escaped, but 43 of them disappeared -- feeding a protest movement with international reach and months of speculation over the role of security forces in their presumed killings.The federal government has maintained that the students were first attacked by local police acting on the orders of the mayor of the town of Iguala, José Luis Abarca, and his wife, María de los Ángeles Pineda, both of whom were detained last month. Local police, according to the government, then handed 43 of the students off to members of the Guerreros Unidos drug cartel, who killed them and disposed of their remains.But the Guerrero state report says that federal police began watching the students from the moment they left Ayotzinapa at 5:59 p.m. on buses heading toward Iguala, Proceso said. According to the magazine's account of the state report, both federal and state police were monitoring the students as they traveled, and federal police joined in stopping and shooting the students.Proceso said that according to the state report, the first gunshots were reported at 9:40 p.m. to Mexico's Center of Control, Command, Communications and Computation, or C4, a communication structure used by federal and local security forces, as well as the military. Though the C4 unit in Iguala is run by state authorities, Proceso said that both federal police and the military have access to its communications -- making it impossible that the federal authorities would not have known about the attack as it was happening.Univision.com said Saturday that Proceso's revelations clearly contradict the federal government’s previous statements that the violent incident was carried out by local authorities, without its knowledge, in collusion with drug traffickers.“There’s no way the Peña Nieto government can say they didn’t know what was happening,” Univisión.com wrote in Spanish in an article published Saturday.The Proceso article also questions the federal government’s handling of key witnesses in the investigation into the students' disappearance, according to Hernández. Federal authorities have relied primarily on testimony from alleged drug traffickers, who have said they were involved in killing the students and incinerating their bodies.But Hernández told HuffPost that documents she obtained from the attorney general's office show that witnesses who testified had been tortured by federal authorities or the military during interrogations completed prior to their testimonies. The documents detail telltale signs of beatings on the witnesses' bodies, Hernández said -- black eyes, marks on the neck, bruising on the ribs and signs that authorities had electrocuted one witness's testicles. One witness had a series of red dots over his body that Hernández said also likely indicated electrocution.“The version given by the federal government, by the attorney general’s office, is based solely on testimony by presumed drug traffickers,” Hernández said. ""What we found is that, in at least five cases, these testimonies were obtained using torture.""Hernández said torture is prohibited in Mexico and would make the evidence inadmissible. The fact that the brutal tactics were apparently used to force confessions also casts doubt on the reliability of the information obtained, she said.The version of the Proceso report published on Saturday includes a short video of compiled footage Proceso says the students took on their cell phones the night of attacks. At one point, voices in the footage shout ""don't shoot"" and ""get down"" in Spanish, after crying out ""they already killed one"" and asking to call an ambulance. Toward the end of the video, the students quietly talk to each other, saying that “the police are leaving, the federal [police] are going to stay. They’re going to hassle us.”Watch the video below (in Spanish):Though the Proceso report offers seemingly damning evidence showing some level of federal involvement, Fusion reported Sunday that it could not corroborate the allegations in interviews with two survivors of the attack.In early November, the Peña Nieto administration announced that members of the Guerreros Unidos cartel had confessed to killing the students and burning their bodies, before discarding the remains in a nearby river. Authorities sent the remains to Austria for DNA testing, and last week, Mexican Attorney General Jesus Murillo said that those experts had identified at least one student from a bone fragment.During the search for the students, at least a dozen mass graves were found in the area near their abduction. However, the Mexican government has said the unmarked graves do not contain the students' remains.In the weeks that followed the students’ disappearance, thousands of people marched in Mexico City, demanding justice and transparency from the federal government, as well as the students' return. Similar protests cropped up around the world, including in the United States, Brazil, Holland and Germany, and several prominent Mexican figures voiced their support for the demonstrators.The public pressure prompted Peña Nieto to propose a series of measures to reform police forces and deter corruption between authorities, officials and criminal organizations.Mexico has faced a surge in violence since the country's previous president, Felipe Calderón, launched a frontal assault on the nation's drug cartels in December of 2006. Since the conflict began, more than 100,000 people have died in drug war-related violence, and another 22,000 have disappeared."
14,RELIGION,Why Were So Many Beloved Christmas Songs Written By Jewish Musicians?,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/christmas-hanukkah-songs_n_6311324.html,,2014-12-14,Songwriter Irving Berlin is shown at the keyboards of an upright piano in the 1920s. The portrait on the wall is of George M. Cohan. (AP Photo),https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7f3f9200000f901018900.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(RNS) Christians don’t seem to mind that so many beloved Christmas songs were written by Jews, and Jews tend to reel off the list with pride.White Christmas. Let It Snow. Santa Baby. I’ll Be Home for Christmas. Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire. Silver Bells. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.Those not mentioned here could fill an album.But why didn’t the Jews write any similarly iconic songs for their holiday that falls around Christmastime: Hanukkah, the Jewish Festival of Lights?“I Have a Little Dreidl”? Great song … if you’re 4.There are reasons that Jews are good at Christmas songs and why so many of these songs became so popular. And there are reasons why Jews didn’t write similarly catchy tunes for Hanukkah — or any other Jewish holiday.But first, a little music history.In the first half of the 20th century, Jews flocked to the music industry. It was one business where they didn’t face overwhelming anti-Semitism, said Michael Feinstein, the Emmy Award-winning interpreter of American musical standards.“White Christmas,” written by Jewish lyricist Irving Berlin, topped the charts in 1942 and launched popular Christmas music, encouraging many others — Jews and non-Jews — to write more odes to the holiday.And although celebrating the birth of Christ was not something these Jewish songwriters would want to do, they could feel comfortable composing more secular Christmas singles.“The Christmas songs that are popular are not about Jesus, but they’re about sleigh bells and Santa and the trappings of Christmas,” Feinstein said. “They’re not religious songs.”In their music and lyrics, Jews captured Christmas not only as a wonderful, wintry time for family gatherings, but also as an American holiday. What they drew on, said Rabbi Kenneth Kanter, an expert on Jews and popular culture at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in Cincinnati, was their background as the children of European-born Jews, or as immigrants themselves, in the case of Russian-born Berlin and others.Jewish songwriters’ own successful assimilation and gratitude to America pervades their midcentury Christmas and other songs, and appealed to a country that wanted to feel brave and united as it fought World War II.“These songs made Christmas a kind of national celebration, almost a patriotic celebration,” Kanter said.The irreligious nature of these Christmas songs may not sit well with pious Christians, said Feinstein, who is Jewish and who cut “A Michael Feinstein Christmas,” among many other albums. But they are now part of the fabric of our larger culture, he said, and “any singer who is a singer of the American songbook will sing Christmas songs,” said Feinstein. “We all sing them.”Feinstein is in good Jewish company. Barbra Streisand made “A Christmas Album.” Neil Diamond cut not only “A Christmas Album,” but also “A Christmas Album, Volume II,” and then a “Cherry, Cherry Christmas.” This year, Idina Menzel, who started out singing at bar mitzvahs and is best-known as the strong, melodic voice in the hit movie “Frozen,” just came out with the very Christmas-y “Holiday Wishes.” This list is far from exhaustive.And how about Hanukkah songs?First, singers want an audience, and with Jews making up less than 2 percent of the U.S. population, and Christians nearly 80 percent, the natural market for Hanukkah tunes is relatively tiny. Though the story of Hanukkah is about religious freedom, a theme Americans can relate to, few know the tale of the ancient Maccabees — how they threw off their Hellenistic oppressors, and the drop of oil which miraculously lit their lamp for eight days.Feinstein, who was raised in a Conservative synagogue in Columbus, Ohio, said many people have tried to get him to lend his voice to a Hanukkah song, but he’s just not that interested.“They usually are in a minor key,” he said. “And there isn’t as much imagery that one can put into a Hanukkah song compared to Christmas.”There are still plenty of tuneful and moving Hanukkah songs, some of them in major keys — the rousing “Al Hanisim,” for example. But many are written in languages other than English — Hebrew, Yiddish and Ladino — and aren’t going to get much airplay in the U.S.But a growing body of Hanukkah music aims to break through the subdued and somber stereotype.In 1982, for example, the folk trio Peter, Paul and Mary first performed “Light One Candle,” a social action song that invokes the Maccabees’ struggle.The Jewish reggae star Matisyahu came out with “Miracle” in 2011. And the Maccabeats, an a capella group based at Yeshiva University, remade the pop song “Dynamite” into a 2010 Hanukkah hit called “Candlelight.”And then there’s Kenny Ellis, the cantor at Temple Beth Ami in Santa Clarita, Calif., who is on a mission to convince Jews and non-Jews alike that Hanukkah songs can be a zippy part of the national songbook. Each Hanukkah, Ellis sings from his 2005 album, “Hanukkah Swings,” a big-band take on some of the most well-known Hanukkah songs, starting with “Swingin’ Dreidel.”To Ellis’ delight, Feinstein once sang “Swingin’ Dreidel” in his New York nightclub. It wouldn’t hurt if more Jewish singers tried a Hanukkah song or two, Ellis said. Maybe a whole album.“I love all the Jewish performers that do Christmas albums,” Ellis said. “But what’s the big deal about doing a Hanukkah album? Does anyone think that if Barbra Streisand did a Hanukkah album, that her career would be finished?”"

Military Humvees, still in camouflage and mounted with machine guns, in the hands of municipal police. SWAT teams of police in full riot gear, bristling with automatic weapons, pointed at a lone protestor with hands up. Have we become a police state?Americans now have yet another ""What have we become?"" question to ponder. In 2012, after a four-year study, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSIC) completed a classified, 6700-page report on the CIA's detention and ""enhanced"" interrogation techniques of enemy combatants post 9/11. In April of this year, the bipartisan SSIC voted 11-3 to release the report's executive summary. After months of delays to allow time for CIA redactions, Senator Dianne Feinstein, the committee's chair, released the report's 528-page summary to the public on December 9.Even after redactions, the details -- of renditions to secret detention sites in foreign countries and widespread use of torture during brutal interrogations -- are horrifying. Interrogation techniques included both psychological and physical torture: facial and abdominal slaps, beatings, ""walling"" (being slammed into a wall), ice-water baths, forced rectal rehydration and/or rectal ""feeding,"" sleep deprivation for up to 180 hours, shackling for extended periods while in stress positions, isolation, sensory deprivation, loud music, enforced nudity, hooding, mock executions, and for some detainees, ""water boarding,"" i.e, near-drowning to the point that some detainees turned blue and required resuscitation. In addition, some detainees were told that family members would be murdered or sexually assaulted. Others, given no waste buckets, were placed in diapers. One detainee, Gul Rahman, died from hyperthermia, after having been short-shackled to a wall, nude from the waste down, forcing him to sit on bare concrete for extended periods.  Torture of Ali Shallal al-Qaisi at Abu Ghraib prison, Iraq 2003 (Wikipedia, public domain)Thirty years ago, the United Nations General Assembly completed its Convention Against Torture (CAT). The CAT became the world's moral standard on June 26, 1987, following ratification by the 20th nation. By 2014, the CAT had 155 signatories, including the U.S., which ratified the Convention in 1994.The CAT defines torture in Article 1 Part I as ""any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person, information or a confession ..."" Article 4 makes torture a criminal offense, and Article 8 establishes torture as an extraditable offense. Plain and simple, torturers are war criminals under international convention.The U.S. has grossly violated international norms of civilized behavior. We have also broken our word. Why should American's care?William Penn, the Quaker founder of Pennsylvania, once offered sage advice for many situations in the quote at the beginning of this article. The end never justifies inhuman means. There are many reasons -- legal, moral, practical, and spiritual -- why torture is both reprehensible and indefensible.First, torture is illegal, as established by international consensus. Civilized societies do not torture. Period.Second, it is immoral. ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,"" states the Golden Rule, which is found in all major religions and specifically as Christianity's second great commandment. The commandment has no asterisks indicating which categories of ""others"" permit exceptions.Third, from purely practical considerations, torture is ineffective. According to Item No. 1 of the summary's conclusions: ""The CIA's use of its enhanced interrogation techniques was not an effective means of acquiring intelligence or gaining cooperation of detainees."" Specifically, it did not conclusively produce evidence that led to the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden, nor has it been shown to produce information that could not be obtained by other means. Fourth, setting the precedent of torture puts our own soldiers and intelligence officers at risk of torture should they be apprehended for interrogation. Fifth, by stooping to torture, the U.S. undermines its own credibility and moral authority in the world. Specifically, Item No. 20 of the conclusions states: ""The CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program damaged the United States' standing in the world, and resulted in other significant monetary and non-monetary costs.""Lastly but foremost, torture not only dehumanizes the one tortured, it also dehumanizes those enacting the torture. Put bluntly, torture degrades us as a species. For a first-hand account of a world in which such inhumanity is a daily norm, read Laura Hillenbrand's blockbuster Unbroken. This meticulously researched biography chronicles the hellacious experiences of Louis Zamperini, an American aviator held for two years in Japanese POW camps during World War II. (The film version of Unbroken will be released Christmas Day.)No one understands what's at stake better than Senator and former presidential candidate John McCain, who was severely tortured by the North Vietnamese during his nearly six years as a Vietnam-War POW, some of it at the infamous ""Hanoi Hilton.""I have often said, and will always maintain, that this question isn't about our enemies; it's about us. It's about who we were, who we are and who we aspire to be. It's about how we represent ourselves to the world.McCain continues, ""Our enemies act without conscience. We must not.""If Americans continue to permit -- by design, acquiescence, or inattention -- a perpetual state of warfare, the militarization of our police forces, and illegal and immoral uses of torture, we will soon become a nation of individuals who can no longer look into the mirror without averting our gaze.Is this the America we want?If not, then it is the duty of each of us to contact our legislators, demanding an end to all uses of and excuses for torture, and prosecution for all those who violate the consensus norms of civilized societies and nations.Ironically, the only current or former CIA operative in prison regarding torture is John Kiriakou, who blew the whistle on waterboarding."

As the Indian Express headlined an article, ""PM Narendra Modi tells Secretaries: Give innovative ideas for next Budget."" Bureaucracy tends to be status quo-ist so his attempt to infuse an innovation-oriented dynamism in the government is a welcome and necessary change.A critical challenge in unleashing children and young people's talents is to ensure that they attain genuine basic literacy, as opposed to nominal ""literacy,"" latest by the end of primary school. While India's official literacy rate is 74 percent (2011), it is not often acknowledged in official circles that the majority of ""literates"" in India cannot read simple texts in any language, such as a newspaper.In a population of a billion people over the age of 6, roughly 400 million can read functionally but 600 million cannot (Kothari & Bandyopadhyay, 2010). Many studies have shown that despite five years of primary education nearly 50 percent of children cannot read a second grade text. The ""attributes"" of youth, thus, cannot be unleashed unless they acquire functional literacy. If an ability to read and write is not in place at the core, it is practically impossible to overlay on it a decent quality primary or secondary education, let alone more grandiose plans of achieving universal digital literacy.Today, almost every child in India enters primary education but the majority exit this pipeline without basic literacy skills. It will take decades before quality improvements in primary schools can guarantee that most children become good readers. Disrupting this status quo will require the government to put some innovative ideas in play.An innovation we have researched and developed, leverages the letter knowledge acquired in school with parallel everyday reading practice at home. Same Language Subtitling (SLS) of Bollywood songs on mainstream TV, in every language, is simple but not simplistic. SBS Dateline (Australia) tells the story of how SLS might work among weak readers in Indian villages. Still from Jodhaa Akbar with Same Language Subtitling (SLS), Copyright Ashutosh Gowarikar Productions Pvt Ltd and UTV Software Communications LtdThe SLS innovation scales because it instantly, automatically and inescapably gets the already 750 million TV viewers in India to read. At least 15-30 minutes of reading, in Karaoke mode, is assured for every TV viewer, all through life. Several studies have found that daily exposure to SLS, in concert with school, results in functional reading ability for most children (Kothari & Bandyopadhyay, forthcoming 2014; Kothari et al., 2004; Kothari et al., 2002). A child in cannot but become a good reader.There are several lessons to be drawn from advocacy of SLS in broadcast policy in India, over the last decade. Ministries generally do not to have a budget for innovations. The entire budget is generally committed to heads that serve to maintain existing programs. An innovation, by definition, cannot have an a priori budget allocation.After years of policy engagement, backed by research studies, the SLS innovation succeeded in getting ""in-principle"" acceptance from all the concerned broadcast institutions. However, the institutions have not been able to come up, so far, with the financial resources required for a national scale up. And yes, SLS is inexpensive, very inexpensive!Assuming there were to be an innovation fund in every ministry, it would only be appropriate that people with innovation experience manage that fund. Decision-makers with innovation experience are generally in short supply within the government. Committees that decide on innovation funds would, therefore, have to include people who understand the innovation process, both from within and outside government.Policy-makers are right to demand evidence when an innovation knocks on their doors. But when that evidence is presented, it requires technical expertise to understand and evaluate it. Over the years, the SLS project has conducted and shared several research studies with policy-makers. While the studies have overcome the requirement for evidence, the evidence itself has never been weighed seriously. This is a pity because the power of SLS to impact literacy only becomes patently obvious if the evidence itself, which in this case is strong, is carefully examined.Modi's innovation infusion in the government has some ways to go, but to his credit, he's got the ball rolling."

(Photo By Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e0c32200005700dd7f2b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) is using his last days at the helm of Congress' upper chamber to push through some of President Barack Obama’s most contested nominees.The list includes several nominees that will have no chance of getting a vote once Republicans take control of the Senate in January, such as surgeon general nominee Dr. Vivek Murthy, deputy Secretary of State nominee Tony Blinken and Sarah Saldana, Obama's pick to head Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Several judicial and executive branch nominees are also on the list.Reid got an opening to hold votes on the nominations thanks to an eleventh-hour effort by Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Mike Lee (R-Utah), who took to the Senate floor on Friday night to demand a vote on an amendment that would defund Obama's executive order on immigration. The move by the two conservative allies forces the Senate to hold a rare weekend session which may not end until Monday.Due to Republican objections, Reid will be forced to hold a series of procedural votes on each nominee, rather than a simple yes-or-no vote. Speaking on the Senate floor Saturday, Reid criticized Republicans for feigning anger over the nominees despite having known for weeks that he intended to hold a vote on them before the end of the lame-duck session.“It’s clear that this impasse we're having here today is not about nominees. It's about preventing us from funding the government,” Reid said. “Senate Republicans are forcing completely unnecessary procedural votes just to waste time and slow us down from funding the government. It doesn't have to be this way.”“Regrettably, a small group of Republicans has determined it’s in their political interest to hold this legislation hostage,” he added.Reid's comments referred to a $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill that the House passed on Thursday, which will keep the government running through next September. The Senate was expected to vote on the measure on Friday, but those plans were soon thwarted by Cruz and Lee's immigration amendment.Cruz, a vocal opponent of Obama's executive order on immigration, questioned whether his party's leaders would follow through on their pledge to fight the president's action early next year.“We will learn soon enough if those statements are genuine and sincere,"" Cruz said. ""We will learn in just a few weeks if leadership intends to follow through on promises they have made over and over again.""But Cruz's stand will do little to prevent the omnibus from clearing final passage on Monday. If anything, the delay appears to have paved the way for Reid to start the process of squeezing the nominees through.Murthy's nomination, for example, has been stalled since March over fierce opposition from the National Rifle Association due to comments he made on gun control. A senior administration official told The Huffington Post last week that Murthy's confirmation is a ""top priority"" for the White House.UPDATE, 2:26 p.m. -- Murthy cleared the first procedural hurdle by a vote of 52-40. Votes on both cloture and confirmation could come as early as Monday. "
