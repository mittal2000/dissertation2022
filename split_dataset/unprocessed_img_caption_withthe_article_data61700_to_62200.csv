ABC News host George Stephanopoulos had to ask three times to get Trump to say he'd tell his supporters not to riot if he's denied the nomination at the Republican National Convention this summer. ""I would certainly tell them that, but, you know, look, these people are -- are fervent,"" Trump said. ""I don't want to see riots. I don't want to see problems,"" Trump continued. ""But, you know, you have -- you have millions of people who we're talking about, George, millions of additional people have gone. You know, I've gotten more than 2 million votes more than anybody else, 2 million votes, more than anybody else.""Trump first said there could be riots if someone else gets the nomination last week. ""I think you’d have riots,"" he said. ""I think you’d have riots. I’m representing a tremendous, many, many millions of people.”Other Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (Wis.), condemned Trump's riot comment, coming as it did on the heels of violent clashes between Trump supporters and protesters at his rallies. ""Nobody should say such things in my opinion because to even address or hint at violence is unacceptable,"" Ryan said.The criticism hasn't stopped Trump from hinting at violence. ""I don't know what's going to happen,"" Trump said Sunday. ""But I will say this, you're going to have a lot of very unhappy people.""Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

It has been established that he is a member of Daesh,"" Ala told a news conference broadcast live on television, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State.Israel has confirmed that three of its citizens died in the blast. Two of them held dual citizenship with the United States. An Iranian was also killed, Turkish officials have said.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel was trying to determine whether the attack had been aimed at Israelis.The bombing was the fourth such attack in Turkey this year, bringing the death toll to more than 80. Saturday's attack on Istiklal Street, Istanbul's most popular shopping district, appeared similar to a January suicide bombing blamed on Islamic State that killed at least 12 German tourists.In that attack, the suicide bomber blew himself up among tourists near the city's historic center.NATO member Turkey faces multiple security threats. As part of a U.S.-led coalition, it is fighting Islamic State in neighboring Syria and Iraq. It is also battling Kurdish militants in its southeast, where a 2-1/2-year ceasefire collapsed last July, triggering the worst violence since the 1990s.Police were on high alert across Turkey on Sunday after the previous day's attack and due to concerns about potential clashes between security forces and Kurdish militants during a spring festival this weekend that is widely celebrated by Kurds."

""The low oil price is a deterrence. It's not much of a worthwhile venture any longer.""The number of attacks -- which include theft, kidnapping and hijacking -- fell to 49 in 2015 from 69 the previous year, according to data from Dryad Maritime, a U.K.-based consultancy.“With oil at a low bottom price of below $30 per barrel, piracy is no longer such a profitable business as it was when prices hit $106 a barrel a few years ago,” Florentina Adenike Ukonga, executive secretary of the seven-nation group Gulf of Guinea Commission, told Bloomberg in February. “The price drop has contributed a great deal in reducing piracy and other maritime crimes in the Gulf of Guinea.”Akinola said Nigeria, the wellspring of the region's oil supply, lost as much as 500,000 barrels a day when oil hit $100 per barrel about two years ago. ""That is a quarter of what it is able to sell to the international community,"" Akinola said. To be sure, low prices aren't the only factor keeping pirates at bay. The Gulf of Guinea Commission -- a treaty signed in 2001 by Angola, Congo, Gabon, Nigeria and São Tomé and Principe and updated in 2008 to include Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of Congo -- set up a Maritime Trade Information Reporting Centre, a 24/7 communication service that monitors ships and alerts naval authorities to looters. The U.S. Navy began training with countries in the region in 2009. Improved coordination is yielding results. Last month, navies from the United States, Ghana, Togo and Nigeria pulled off “the first anti-piracy success in the region of this scale” when they freed the crew of the Dubai-owned MT Maximus nine days after it was seized by pirates off the coast of Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, according to a report in The Guardian. Nigerian forces stormed the ship, on lease to a South Korean company and carrying 4,700 tons of diesel fuel, after officials in São Tomé called on them for help. U.S. Navy Captain Heidi Agle called the coordinated effort ""the biggest piece in progress in the region"" since joint military operations began seven years ago.

Piracy, he said, is just an offshoot of other gang activity in the region, including stealing crude, siphoning oil from storage sites and scamming the government for fuel subsidies.In other words, the criminal organizations behind piracy have other illegal revenue streams to fall back on. If oil prices remain low in perpetuity, as some predict they will, scamming or stealing profits from Nigeria's oil industry may prove to just be bad business."

Area residents also complain of constant barking that goes into the night.The port's executive director, Jim Knight, told the Daily Astorian that they do have a backup plan underway thanks to a group of local high school students.Students at Knappa High School are busy creating steel railings to line the docks and hopefully prevent the sea lions from hopping on."

After all, goals are what turn dreams into actionable, achievable steps.Whether you set out to lose weight, renovate your house, or complete a triathlon, defining a goal can boost your motivation, at least initially. But you're likely to lose motivation fast--and that lack of motivation prevents you from achieving most goals.The Sad Reality About GoalsThe statistics on goal attainment are pretty grim. Studies show that one in three people give up on their New Year's resolutions by the end of January. And only 46 percent of people stick with their resolution past the six-month mark.Of course, it's not just New Year's resolutions that fail. Most weight-loss goals aren't successful, no matter what time of year you launch them. Depending on which study you read, somewhere between 65 and 95 percent of people who lose weight eventually gain it all back.The statistics on financial goals aren't much brighter: Almost 29 percent of Americans don't have any retirement savings nor a traditional pension plan. This, despite the fact that 59 percent of people report being very or moderately worried that they won't have enough money for retirement.Sadly, many goals of all types go unrealized every year. But the good news is, making one small change to the way you set your goals could improve your chances of success.Establish a Goal RangeMost goal-setting experts recommend establishing definitive goals. Rather than saying, ""I want to lose weight,"" they advise, you should set a measurable goal like, ""I want to lose 30 pounds."" And while quantitative goals can be helpful, a study in the Journal of Consumer Research reports, picking a specific number goal might backfire. If you set out to lose 30 pounds, you may run out of steam before you reach that goal. And once your motivation declines, your chance of success plummets.If, however, you create a goal range, you'll actually increase your chances of success: Declaring you want to lose 20 to 40 pounds could be more effective than setting out to lose 30. Researchers found that when participants reached the low end of their range, they became more likely to believe their ultimate goal was attainable and experienced a sense of accomplishment that fueled their motivation to keep going.Then, when participants looked at the high end of their goals, they felt challenged, which was an essential component to success. They knew their goal required hard work, but they felt confident in their ability to keep going. As a result, their chances of hitting their goals skyrocketed.Creating a Range for YourselfEstablishing a goal range for yourself could be one of the simplest, yet most effective, ways to change your behavior. Whether your goal is to exercise three-to-five times per week, or to save $100 to $200 per month, establish a reasonable range. When you hit its low end, challenge yourself to keep going. You'll likely find that a little taste of success can motivate you to get to the next level.Amy Morin is psychotherapist, mental strength trainer, and keynote speaker.

Study the Past."" In presidential aspirant Donald Trump, there are whiffs of the powerful Lousiana demagogue Huey Long, who called himself the ""Kingfish."" His shrewd, unscrupulous, political touch, his flamboyance, braggadocian talents and persona, overall they remind one, irresistibly, of Donald Trump. Huey Long's autobiography, Every Man A King, came out in 1933, bound in a resplendent gold jacket bearing five pictures of the Senator. He ordered 50,000 copies and sold 20,000 for a dollar each. And then ordered the remainder given away. Trump's books have a similar ring.Long's powers of persuasion were immense. In Arkansas, he lifted up Hattie Caraway, wife of a Senator who died, enabling her to serve out his unexpired term. She wanted to run for re-election, but would have to line up against seven or eight experienced male politicians. She was taunted and laughed at by most politicians -- all save the Kingfish, who campaigned for her throughout the state and gave her a victory shocking to all but him. One of FDR's most vociferous critics, the Kingfish wanted the presidency and, after playing an important role in getting FDR the nomination in 1932, was gathering strength sufficient to perhaps defeat FDR in 1936 or possibly cause his defeat to another by running on a third-party ticket. As Governor of Louisiana, he became a dictator, exercising absolute power against the big corporations and in favor of the masses. Had Long not been gunned down in Baton Rouge in 1935, who knows how the era of FDR would have changed? Studying Long's rise to power is highly instructive in trying to comprehend the gathering storm that is Donald Trump.There are also whiffs of Hitler in Trump's increasingly plausible march to the White House by perfectly democratic processes, as were exercised by Hitler in the Weimar Republic, becoming Chancellor of Germany on January 30, 1933, one month before FDR took the oath. Both men came to power in times of massive adversity. Elites in each country worried that voters, desperate for strong leadership, could accept a dictator. In fact, either FDR or Hitler probably could have seized dictatorial powers. Only one did, but the history of events in both countries deserve careful study, given the large and growing populist reaction so favorable to Trump and devastating to the Republican establishment.A book worth revisiting in light of the Trump phenomenon is Sinclair Lewis's It Can't Happen Here, published in October, 1935. It demonstrates the fragility of our nation's democracy by having a folksy New Englander, Buzz Windrip, gain the White House with vague blandishments, and then usher in a dictatorial regime of suppression, terror and totalitarianism to save the nation from welfare cheats, promiscuity, crime and a liberal press. The threat of fascism in America captured his readers' attention, making this deeply troubling story an overnight national bestseller. Lewis was married to Dorothy Thompson, the Herald Tribune correspondent reporting from Berlin on the rise of Hitler. His novel was inspired by her observations of what a demagogue can do to a democracy. The New Yorker declared it ""not only [Lewis's] most important book but one of the most important books ever produced in this country."" Hallie Flanagan was a student at Grinnell College with Harry Hopkins, the head of the Works Progress Administration. He picked her to head the WPA's Federal Theater Project. She proved a brilliant choice. One of her boldest ideas was to try to persuade Lewis to dramatize his book. She sent her top managers to Vermont to ask him. Lewis wanted more fame than might come from a single opening on Broadway. He turned her down. Undeterred, Hallie promised to open in 21 cities in seventeen states, all on the same night -- October 27, 1936. That will do, he said, and came to New York City to start writing. By mistake, that opening date was given to the press only eight weeks in advance of Lewis's agreement, before a single word had been written. Remarkably, the goal was achieved. Across the land, the play enjoyed a long run.Brooks Atkinson, writing for the New York Times, summed up audience reaction: Mr. Lewis has a story to tell that is calculated to make the blood of a liberal run cold ... It Can't Happen Here ought to scare the daylights out of the heedless American who believes as this column does that it can't happen here ...In their day, the play and the book carried an important message to every thinking American. Those thinking today should heed it anew. --Longstreth was a Commissioner of the SEC from 1981-1984. He just published Boats Against the Current, an historical novel set in the Great Depression. "

Like Nixon's trip, Obama's visit is a dramatic symbol of the fundamental shift away from a U.S. policy of hostility, isolation, and regime change to a policy of engagement aimed at achieving normal relations. Obama's decision to visit Cuba and his reception by President Raúl Castro demonstrates that the two presidents intend to make improving relations a priority in the coming year. If it goes well, the visit will accelerate progress on a range of issues that are currently under discussion, facilitate new agreements on issues of mutual interest, and reduce the obstacles on both sides that are limiting commercial relations.The biggest hurdle to fully normal relations is the continuing U.S. economic embargo. In the 15 months since December 17, 2014, President Obama has licensed significant exceptions to the embargo, opening the door for more U.S. residents to travel to Cuba and more U.S. businesses to trade with Cuban enterprises. But the core of the embargo remains in place: Cuban state enterprises cannot export to the United States and most U.S. businesses cannot invest in Cuba or become joint enterprise partners with Cuban firms. Since lifting the entire embargo requires that Congress repeal the 1996 Helms-Burton law (the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act), the embargo will not be lifted during Obama's remaining time in office. In the middle of a heated presidential election campaign, Republicans controlling both the House of Representatives and the Senate will not take any action that makes Obama's policy look like a success. The second biggest obstacle to fully normal relations is the U.S. base at Guantánamo. The United States recognizes Guantánamo as sovereign Cuban territory, but it nevertheless refuses to return the base to Cuban control. For the foreseeable future, the top issue on the U.S. agenda regarding Guantánamo will not be how to return it to Cuba, but rather how to close the detention center that Obama pledged to close when he was elected. That has to come first.In addition, there are a great many other issues on which the two governments still disagree, ranging from migration to property claims, fugitives, TV and Radio Martí, U.S. ""democracy promotion"" programs, and human rights. Negotiations are currently underway on a number of these issues, but resolving them will take time -- more time than President Obama has left in office.Therefore, Obama's goal is to make as much progress as possible in the months he has remaining so that the next president, whether Democrat or Republican, will recognize that the opening to Cuba has produced results that serve U.S. interests and should be continued. He is also trying to create stakeholders -- constituencies in U.S. society who have a stake in continuing his policy, so that it would be politically difficult for his successor to reverse it. But to succeed, he needs Cuba's cooperation, especially on the commercial front. The more contracts that major U.S. corporations sign with Cuba in the next ten months, the more momentum there will be to lift the embargo in 2017 and the harder it will be for opponents of the new relationship to roll back the progress that has been made. It is not a coincidence that a number of senior U.S. corporate executives are going to Cuba with Obama, as is Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker, who has been at the forefront of trying to remove obstacles to economic engagement. Obama will undoubtedly raise the sensitive issue of human rights in his meetings with President Raúl Castro, just as he has in their prior meetings. He will undoubtedly speak eloquently of the virtues of human rights and democracy in his address to the Cuban people. And he will meet with a broad cross-section of representatives from Cuban civil society, including prominent dissidents, just as Secretary of State John Kerry did when he celebrated the reopening of the U.S. Embassy last year. Normalization does not mean that disagreements between the United States and Cuba will disappear. It means that they can be discussed in an atmosphere of mutual respect and civility. Obama's critics have argued that the trip is coming too early in the normalization process, that not enough has been achieved to justify a presidential visit. But for Obama's purposes, the trip is well timed. By going now, he gives his administration ten months to work on turning the momentum of the presidential visit into concrete agreements. If Obama waited until the fall, the trip would be a nice photo-opportunity, but the administration would not have time to turn it into real progress. President Obama's trip to Cuba will not resolve the many disagreements that remain between Cuba and the United States, of course. No one should expect that the legacy of half a century of hostility can be erased so easily. Rather, the trip's success should be judged by whether it advances the broad process of normalization, especially in areas where U.S. and Cuban interest coincide -- in fields like commerce, global public health, environmental protection and the fight against narcotics trafficking. Each time the two president's meet and talk candidly with one another about not only points of disagreement but mutual interests, they bring us closer to the day when relations between Cuba and the United States will, for the first time in history, be truly normal.William M.

Trumps visit to Arizona is the second time in three months as he looks to gain the GOP nomination for President. (Photo by Ralph Freso/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb93756260000360083d658.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It was one for the books. The sight of an African-American viciously assaulting a Trump protester at his Tucson campaign rally. The sight drew gasps and lots of expressions of puzzlement and disbelief. The assault came a few weeks after Trump's photo-op meeting with some black ministers. He has also gotten some endorsements from an odd assortment of black names such as Mike Tyson. Before that, he bragged that he could get lots of black votes. It drew guffaws and snickers since it was just Trump being Trump. The overwhelming betting odds were that Trump could do something that's mathematically impossible, and that is to top the percentage of black voter support that one poll gave Mitt Romney during 2012's presidential election -- namely zero percent.Romney got his memorable zero percent from black voters by doing what few GOP presidential tickets in modern times had done, and that was to actively alienate black voters. He accomplished that feat with his plan to hack up Medicare and Medicaid, downsize Social Security and gut the threadbare corporate and financial regulations, environmental protections, along with his full-throated assault on abortion rights that would've wreaked untold misery among African-Americans.Even more than Romney, Trump's violent, race-baiting crusade that nakedly appeals to largely white lower income, less educated, rural and mostly male crowds drive the point home that blacks are not even an after-thought in his drive to snare the White House. But there's more to the picture about Trump and black voters than the punches that the black assailant delivered to the Trump protester. The black vote, in several ways, is still very much a part of the GOP's strategy to win the White House. GOP presidents Nixon, Reagan, Bush Sr., and especially George W. Bush, took great pains to give the appearance that they were not overt racists, and that blatant racism was not part of their appeal. This included highly orchestrated, stage-managed photo-ops with black celebrities and sports figures, a handful of key black pitch men and women on the campaign trail with them, and, in the case of Bush loading up the Republican convention with a pack of show piece, African-Americans to provide entertainment and perfunctory speeches. With Trump, it's is no different. Besides the handful of comic endorsements he's gotten from blacks, he's front-loaded his traveling campaign circus act from time to time with two black women -- the ""Stump for Trump Girls,"" a black minister or two, and panned to audience shots of black faces sprinkled through his rally crowds.   The next tact is not Trump's but the GOP's. That's to refine the ploy of voter suppression tactics that the GOP has traditionally employed, in times past, from felon bans to blatant intimidation of black and Hispanic voters at polling places. GOP governors and GOP-controlled state legislators will continue to drum up a maze of rules and regulations, from ending weekend voting to the rash of voter ID requirements. The aim is still the same: To damp down the black vote total all under the guise of combating voter fraud.Then there's Trump's subtle racial pander, which like the GOP's voter suppression arsenal of tricks, is hardly Trump's creation. This is the GOP's standard use of code words and attack points, such as tax and spend Democrats, out of control, wasteful government, and welfare freeloaders. This embeds the notion that minorities, and especially blacks, unfairly scam the system with the active connivance of Democrats, at the expense of hard-working, overtaxed blue-collar and middle-class whites. If Trump bags the GOP presidential nomination, the GOP establishment will be forced to throw in the towel on its low-intensity civil war with him, and resort to yet another favored ploy. That is to bankroll and promote a handful of visible and vocal black conservatives to recite all the stock criticisms of Obama, civil rights leaders and Democrats. It's already got failed presidential candidate Ben Carson and the National Black Republican Association on board. This creates the deliberate and false impression that a substantial number of blacks don't support the Democratic Party, despite the polls. Trump and his black surrogates will pound on the tired theme that the Democratic Party has betrayed blacks ,and that it practices a modern version of plantationism; that is, perennially taking the black vote for granted, while offering no tangible programs for the black poor. Trump will couple that line with his boast that he can create more jobs for blacks and more affordable health care, and that private sector growth, school choice and further shredding welfare, is the path to economic well-being and uplift for blacks.  Trump's aim is not to get any substantial support from blacks, since that's an impossibility, but to sow seeds of doubt, confusion and even a little hostility toward Clinton among just enough blacks to keep them from the polls in the must-win, battleground states. Judging from the punches thrown by a black at the Trump protester, it may have worked in at least once case.--Earl Ofari Hutchinson is an author and political analyst.

Please continue supporting him, because it helps to pressure the Democratic party to move to the left. If you want to hold out hope throughout the primary, that is totally understandable. My only wish is that you stop demonizing Secretary Clinton. The memes and hashtags and negative propaganda need to stop. This rhetoric is extremely counterproductive, because at this point it doesn't benefit Sanders as much as it hurts Clinton in the general election. No matter who wins the Republican nomination (and it's almost certain to be Donald Trump), they are worlds behind Hillary Clinton. Even Bernie has agreed with that assessment. The GOP candidates are anti-abortion, anti-LGBT rights, and practically anti-everything that progessives value. Maybe Hillary has been against certain things in the past, but much like President Obama, whose positions have also evolved, she has gotten on board with most liberal standpoints over the last 25 years.The questioning of the sincerity of her gay rights support is one of the things I take issue with the most, and also one of the best examples. I am gay, and even though Hillary previously was against gay marriage, she now supports it. Flip-flop, pandering or genuine evolution, it doesn't matter anymore as long as she supports us, so I don't think our allies should judge her for her previous statements. She has actually acted upon her evolved beliefs on numerous occasions, so they are genuine, and we need to accept that she has changed her views. My own family, my boyfriend's family and the loved ones of many LGBT people that I know have changed their views over the same time period, and I don't think they're disingenuous. It's is a common story for members of our community that grew up in the 90's, and anyone that doesn't fall into that category needs to understand the evolution that we've seen -- and greatly appreciated -- among most of society. Mrs. Clinton is one of those people that has moved forward with society. In the most basic sense, that is progressive, and she is no worse than anyone else that has changed their views. Her push for LGBT rights around the world as Secretary of State has more than made up for any prior lack of support. This one issue should elucidate the point that we can believe her when she changes her viewpoints. Is it really a bad thing to consider new viewpoints in order to side with the majority of those you represent?While Clinton has changed, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are outwardly against progressive causes. The same goes for most Republicans. The plethora of progressive beliefs with which they disagree or ignore are all issues for which Clinton has expressed support. The fact that Donald Trump wants to deport all undocumented immigrants and ban Muslims from our country should be more than enough reason to do whatever it takes to prevent him from taking office, even if that means voting for someone that you don't totally support. I'm not even being dramatic when I say that voting for Trump, or a third party, or a write-in, or abstaining from the general election, is essentially a vote against women, Muslims, immigrants and the LGBT community.It's not about choosing the lesser of two evils. The policies proposed by Trump are frightening, to say the least, and the worst you can allege about Hillary is that she is is a corporate puppet. But that's inconsistent with her actions. She actually fought for progressive interests when she was on the Wal-Mart board, for instance, and her vote for bankruptcy reform was mischaracterized  in that video we've all seen with Elizabeth Warren (who I actually happen to love). Before the vote, Clinton actually advocated for amendments that addressed Warren's concerns. The same pattern can be seen with President Obama. He took money from Wall Street, but as President, he criticized their actions, and signed into law the most restrictive policies against the financial sector in decades. Meanwhile, the Republicans outwardly side with these interests, which actually garners the donations for them.I get that it's not easy to vote for someone that competed against and defeated someone that you wholeheartedly supported. To be honest, I felt the same way about Obama in 2008. Since then, I have seen him support many of the values that I believe in during his time in office. We have made so much progress under Obama, and I firmly believe that you will see the same from Clinton. Don't reverse it with a Republican. Whether or not you believe that she is truly a progressive, you need to be there for her in November, because she will be there for us for the next 4 years. She may not be perfect, but she's absolutely going to give this country a better image and a better chance for progress than any Republican out there. So please, let's stop the divisive rhetoric before it's too late, because you're lying to yourself if you think that a Clinton loss will outweigh the negative effects of a Trump presidency.Yours Truly,Someone That Doesn't Want To Watch America Burn"

Putin said in an interview published Saturday that he expects the next U.S. administration to improve the two countries' strained relations. (AP Photo/RIA-Novosti, Alexei Nikolsky, Pool)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc16fce240000320022aa41.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Early in its existence, the Soviet Union turned Vladimir Lenin's dictum that ""religion is the opium of the people"" into official policy.Atheism was what Lenin wanted for the Soviet empire, and it's what it got.Assuring such an outcome were laws discouraging faith -- such as requirements that religions register with the state -- and denying Communist Party membership to anyone religious.Many people expected a flowering of faith when the Soviet Union disintegrated in 1991.But it hasn't happened, largely because the countries that emerged from the ashes of the USSR have repressed most religions, the main exceptions being Russian Orthodox Christianity and certain brands of Islam.The repressed have included denominations of Christianity that are widespread in other countries, such as Catholics, Baptists, Methodists, Lutherans and Presbyterians. As with other regrettable trends in the former Soviet Union, Russia has set the tone for the repression of religion.Countries as diverse as Belarus, Kazakhstan and Armenia have followed the Russian example.Russia's enactment of a law governing religion in 1997 has made it difficult for faiths besides Russian Orthodox Christianity to survive, let alone thrive.Religions were required to register in Russia before 1997. The new law required them to reregister by 2001, and made it more difficult for them to do so. About 2,000 were unable to comply with the new regulations, and were disbanded.The Russian Orthodox Church was required to reregister, too. But because the law gave it special status as Russia's traditional faith, and because most government officials viewed it as the country's only legitimate religion, it had no trouble reregistering.Vladimir Putin's lock on Russia's leadership since 2000 has given the Russian Orthodox Church an even more commanding position in the country's religious picture.Putin has publicly called the church, which he attends, a vital part of Russian life and tradition. Not surprisingly, Russian Orthodox Church leaders have hailed him as a great leader.Belarus is one of the former Soviet countries that has passed a religious law modeled after Russia's.The legislation bans faiths that are not registered with the government, requires government approval of all religious materials, prevents non-citizens from leading religious organizations, and prohibits most religious meetings in private homes. As in Russia, the law assures that the Russian Orthodox Church holds a commanding position in the country's religious life.Russia passed anti-terrorism legislation in 2002 and 2007 that critics say has been used to repress non-Orthodox faiths.It was billed as legislation to help law enforcement go after religious and nationalist extremists, but it has been used to prosecute members of such peaceful faiths as the Jehovah's Witnesses and Hare Krishnas.Kazakhstan passed sweeping anti-terrorist legislation after a series of radical-Islamist attacks unnerved the country in 2011.Although ostensibly designed to help law enforcement go after extremists, the law has been used to shut down religions that Kazakhstan deems ""non-traditional."" Only five faiths fall into its ""traditional"" category: Russian Orthodox Christianity, Roman Catholicism, Judaism, Islam and Buddhism.The law requires a faith to have 50 members to obtain official recognition at the local level, 500 members to obtain recognition at the regional level and 5,000 members to obtain recognition at the national level. If it fails to mount those numbers, it it considered to be operating illegally.The Kazakhstan legislation had the repressive effect critics had predicted. In the year after it was passed, the number of denominations the government sanctioned fell from 46 to 17.People of faith both inside and outside Kazakhstan couldn't help but note the irony that President Nursultan Nazarbayev had long trumpeted the country's ethnic and religious tolerance -- and part of the evidence he offered was that Kazakhstan recognized more than 40 faiths. Despite the post-2011 crackdown, Nazarbayev continues to paint Kazakhstan as a faith-tolerant society.Armenia's main brand of Christianity enjoys the same privileged position that Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan's do.At one time the government used to excuse Armenian Apostolic Church clergy and seminarians from the country's mandatory military service. But it jailed members of denominations who refused to serve because they were conscientious objectors -- in particular, Jehovah's Witnesses.Changes in the law have led to conscientious objectors being allowed to perform alternative public service under civilian -- rather than military -- leadership.Meanwhile, Armenian schools require students to take a course on the history of the Armenian Apostolic Church.The course is mandatory; students cannot opt out on religious grounds.Although the course is supposed to be about the role the church has played in Armenia's development, in practice it is often focuses on the church's precepts and beliefs, critics say.In other words, it is a proselytizing and faith-affirmation tool, according to the detractors.As the examples from Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Armenia show, the former Soviet Union has a long way to go in bestowing religious freedom on all its citizens.In fact, the trend in the past 10 to 15 years has been to shrink rather than expand such freedom.The only hope for those who embrace non-traditional faiths is that the repression will ease as time passes.Armine Sahakyan is a human rights activist based in Armenia.

It is impossible without the ongoing commitment of its participants. In a democracy that commitment mostly reflected in support for the rules of the game and confidence that government can fairly represent the interests of the governed. We can blame political elites for their infidelity to the public's interests or their willingness to ""run against Washington"" and ""politics as usual"" in their political campaigns but the trend lines are inescapable: Public confidence in government continues to erode taking with it public support for the rules of the game. Figure 1, which presents the ANES Trust in Government and External Efficacy Indices from 1958-2012, illustrates the broader trend of declining trust and the corresponding decline in external efficacy (the belief that individuals can influence government).Donald Trump's surprisingly successful presidential campaign accompanied by violence at campaign rallies and a general disregard for democratic norms are only the latest manifestation of this declining confidence. Trump would be impossible at a time or a place where democratic commitments were more robust and where the temptations of yielding to a strong leader who operates outside of the normal rules of the game were less pronounced. In a recent post on the Monkey Cage blog, Harvard political scientist Pippa Norris notes that in the World Values Survey 44% of non-college graduates in the United States think it would be very good or fairly good to have ""a strong leader who doesn't have to bother with congress or elections."" Other scholars have relatedly noted the centrality of authoritarian attitudes to Donald Trump's core support. What's going on? Well, there are a lot of people, mainly men, mainly uneducated, who lack opportunities, challenges, and the ability to provide. They're angry. And the corporate order isn't working for them. For them, the Trump appeal can be likened to the appeal of the fictional Tyler Durden in Fight Club:God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables; slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off. We can add some collaborative evidence from a set of questions recently included in a YouGov Survey for Huffington Post. The survey was conducted from February 26-29 and includes 1,000 respondents selected from YouGov's opt-in internet panel using sample matching. Questions wordings and results (displayed in Table 1) largely confirm what we already know about differences in electorates. Compared to Democrats and Independents, Republicans value obedience in children and businesspeople and manufactures in society (critical components to the Authoritarianism F index), are more likely to believe in the Bible as the literal word of God and the United States as chosen by God to lead the world (critical components to Christian Nationalism, which we wrote about back in December). Each of these attitudes helps to explain Donald Trump's favorability. Trump does better among respondents who believe God chose the U.S. to lead the world and the Bible is the inspired word of God, and who value the role of businesspeople in society and obedience in children. Taken in isolation, none of these appeals is particularly new or unique. Appeals to run government like a business, for example, are hardly unique. But those appeals are most often targeted at business community and rarely bridge the gap to include appeals to more base authoritarian instincts. The something new about Trump then is the combination of appeals to operate government like a business thus ignoring the constraints of checks and balances, separations of powers, and the protection of individual rights against impassioned majorities. Add in a dose of white ethnocentrism and economic frustration and you have a volatile mix that suggests a lack of commitment to democratic processes. Three generations of post-World War II politics were dedicated to advancing and affirming these very processes. These data indicate the strong prospect that democracy and inclusion are failing among this long-courted, long taken for granted demographic. "

The number of passengers and crew aboard the plane was not reported by authorities, nor was the flight's origin. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who has introduced legislation to require new safety features on drones, pointed to the close call as an example of the hazards posed to commercial aviation by unregulated drone activity.""This is one more incident that could have brought down an airliner, and it's completely unacceptable,"" she said in a statement.Federal regulations generally bar drone aircraft and model airplanes from flying higher than 400 feet or within 5 miles of an airport without first contacting air traffic control and airport authorities. Operators also must keep their drones away from other aircraft and groups of people.The FAA has received at least 42 reports of drones flying unsafely near LAX, the nation's second-busiest airport, since April 2014, according to a Los Angeles Times analysis last fall of federal data released by Feinstein.The data shows nearly 200 pilot reports of close encounters involving drones in California alone during the past two years, the most of any state, according to the Times.In a 2014 letter to the FAA, Feinstein cited three instances in which drones flew dangerously close to passenger planes near major airports -- two on the same day in May of that year at New York City's LaGuardia Airport and LAX, and another at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York in March 2013.Responding to heightened concerns about rogue drone flights near airports, the FAA issued a rule in December requiring hobbyists as young as 13 to register their unmanned aircraft online with the government.(Reporting by Steve Gorman; Editing by Sandra Maler and Michael Perry)CORRECTION: The airplane's altitude has been corrected from an earlier version of this article."

Jeb Bush (R) loaned his campaign more than $400,000 to keep it afloat.The revelation of Bush’s self-financing comes from the Federal Election Commission report covering the final month of his campaign. Bush dropped out of the Republican presidential primary on Feb. 20 after failing to finish better than fourth place in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina.Son and brother to two U.S. presidents, Bush began his campaign as the front-runner thanks to his high name recognition and his fundraising ability. In December 2014, he declared that he would “actively explore the possibility of running for President of the United States.” The carefully worded statement acted as a legal shield for him to tour the country’s mansions to personally raise $100 million for his own super PAC -- an act that is illegal for a declared candidate.The early focus on super PAC fundraising led Bush to begin fundraising for his actual campaign committee late in the game. Bush was left with more resources in a super PAC that he could not directly coordinate with and fewer in his own campaign. He raised a total of $33 million by the end of January for his campaign -- the fourth most among Republican candidates.Bush’s early super PAC fundraising prowess also became a routine line of attack leveled by his chief antagonist Donald Trump. At debates and on the stump, Trump consistently blasted Bush for being beholden to his donors. In one such debate, Trump told Bush to ""quiet"" and was booed by the audience. Trump’s response to the boos: “That's all of his donors and special interests.”One of Trump’s biggest applause lines has been his declaration that is not bought and paid for by donors like the other candidates. He claims his self-financing (which he is mostly doing) puts him above the corruption of politics by monied donors.In the end, Bush was forced to copy Trump and self-finance his final push in South Carolina."

Instead of becoming a Major League club, the Sugar Kings were forcibly relocated to New Jersey in 1960, thanks to intervention from the American government and baseball’s commissioner.Two years later, the United States enacted its trade embargo of Cuba, freezing the relationship that Obama is now trying to thaw. But while it remains the most politically contentious issue between the two countries, a series of moves from both sides led up to that final damning act. And the removal of the Sugar Kings, given the symbolic significance of baseball in each country, was among the most important moments in the destruction of their relationship.“The moment they took away the Sugar Kings from Havana, everything went to hell,” Manuel Barcia, a Cuban-born professor at the University of Leeds who is currently authoring a book about the Sugar Kings, told The Huffington Post. “Everything went south, because there was nothing else in common between the USA and Cuba.”Baseball is a shared cultural experience for Cuba and America, and it has often exemplified the relations between Washington and Havana. The Sugar Kings were no different when they were established in 1954, a year after Fidel Castro’s 26th of July movement launched its revolution against American-allied president Fulgencio Batista.American ambassador Arthur Gardner was in attendance when the team played its first game on April 23, 1954, at the Gran Estadio in the Cuban capital. “Cuban representation on the diamond is not only good for baseball, it is good for hemisphere relations,” The New York Times wrote in the next day’s paper.Over the next six years, the Sugar Kings -- a team with a distinctly local flavor -- developed into a steady supplier of Cuban Major League talent, sending players like slick-fielding shortstop Leonardo Cardenas and future MLB All-Stars Cookie Rojas and Mike Cuellar to the big leagues. Though the team often featured American and other Latin players alongside Cubans, it became one of the biggest symbols of national baseball pride, proof that the island's talent could compete with -- and beat -- that from its much larger neighbor.When the Dodgers and Giants left New York in 1957 for Los Angeles and San Francisco, it set the stage for rapid Major League expansion -- and in Havana, Sugar Kings owner Bobby Maduro and other baseball boosters saw an opportunity.“Havana, as a baseball hotbed, and at that time one of the largest cities in the western hemisphere outside the U.S., certainly considered itself ready” for a Major League franchise, said Peter Bjarkman, an author and Cuban baseball historian.Even in the Sugar Kings’ final days, with the U.S.-Cuba relationship falling apart for good, Maduro assured Cubans that top-tier professional baseball was coming to the island.But before MLB could start plotting a major league team in the heart of Havana, the Cuban revolution engulfed the Sugar Kings.Batista fled Castro’s rebels on the first day of 1959, months before the International League season was set to begin. By that March, political turmoil and violence had begun to cause rumblings that the Sugar Kings wouldn’t play that season.Maduro met with Castro for three-and-a-half hours in early April 1959, then greeted the media to put any speculation about the team’s future to rest.The Sugar Kings would stay in Havana permanently, Maduro said.But that July, pro-Castro troops preparing to celebrate the anniversary of Cuban independence unloaded their weapons into the air outside the Gran Estadio, unwittingly showering the stadium with falling bullets. The Sugar Kings were locked in an extra innings battle with the Rochester Red Wings that night, and the gunfire sent players scattering off the field. Bullets struck Sugar Kings shortstop Leo Cardenas and Red Wings third base coach Frank Verdi. The Red Wings refused to show up for the series finale and flew back to the U.S the next day.The Sugar Kings rebounded from the incident to finish the season third in the International League standings before winning a playoff series that earned them a berth in the Little World Series, a competition between the champions of the International League and American Association, another minor league.They defeated the Minneapolis Millers to win the series title -- another victory over American baseball for Cubans to celebrate -- and even resumed play in the International League the next April. But the shooting incident, along with the continued tension in relations between Washington and Havana, eventually overtook baseball. The Eisenhower administration, seeking to exert leverage over Castro, a devout fan of the Sugar Kings and baseball generally, turned the sport into its own political tool. The Americans pressured MLB commissioner Ford Frick to relocate the Sugar Kings from Havana. In July 1960, Frank Shaughnessy, the league's president, announced that the team was moving to New Jersey immediately.The Sugar Kings played their final game on July 14, 1960, in Miami. They arrived in Jersey City at 6.30 a.m. the next day, where a raucous celebration awaited the new baseball team. Thousands of New Jerseyites flocked to the streets to welcome the “Jerseys,” as the team would be known, but their interest soon waned. Before the 1962 season, the Jerseys were sold and relocated to Jacksonville, Florida.Castro was appalled. He told Frick and the Americans that he would pay the team’s debts to keep them in Havana, and when the team left anyway, the Cuban leader accused the U.S. of overstepping “all codes of sportsmanship,” according to author Steven Kinzer’s account in The Brothers, his book about the former secretary of state John Foster Dulles and his brother, ex-CIA director Alan Dulles. Frick also banned Major Leaguers from playing in Cuba's winter league, effectively gutting one of the best and most popular offseason leagues in the Caribbean. “This notion you hear... that Fidel Castro killed baseball with the revolution, maybe indirectly that's true. But Washington and Major League Baseball had a huge hand in pulling professional baseball out of there,” Bjarkman said. “Fidel did not do that himself.”“It was something of a last point of contact between Cuba and the United States before the embargo,” Barcia added. “It was one of the last ways of communicating. One of the things they both had in common, Cuba and the United States, was baseball.”As the U.S. government escalated its campaign to isolate and dispose of Castro -- culminating in the botched Bay of Pigs invasion and the 1962 embargo -- Castro insulated Cuban baseball further in response. He banned professional sports in the country and prohibited Cuban players from leaving for pro leagues in overseas. The Cubans who were already in Major League Baseball, as well as those who’d followed the Sugar Kings to New Jersey, weren’t allowed to return to the island to play for the national team.Cubans didn’t seem to mind. The wealth of the country's talent that had once spread to America now stayed home, and the red-clad national team turned into a regional powerhouse that won numerous international tournaments. Cuban league teams like Industriales -- whom Barcia described as “the New York Yankees of Cuban baseball” -- became incredibly popular.“That concept of baseball as being the face of the nation goes back before Fidel,” Bjarkman said. “He just exploited that further after the revolution.”But the Caribbean country's baseball, and the way that Cubans looked at their sport, began to change in the 1990s, when players like Livan and Orlando Hernandez, brothers who defected to the United States and then won World Series titles as pitchers with the Florida Marlins and New York Yankees, became American stars. Additional defections followed. It has had profound effects, both on the once-proud national team, which Bjarkman said is now roughly equivalent to a Double-A squad, and on attitudes among Cubans.“The Cuban fans are now shifting their attitude, and they're taking pride in Cubans in the Major Leagues,” Bjarkman said. “The Cuban government has not made that transition, and I don't know how quickly they'll make that transition.”Obama's swift moves to further open relations between the U.S. and Cuba will certainly continue to change those attitudes, especially if the Cuban government begins to transition in its approach to baseball as well.But the president will see few signs of the Sugar Kings in Havana next week, Bjarkman said. Cubans are far more invested in the national and local teams than in a short-lived minor league side that existed before most of them were born. And it’s unlikely that there will be another team like the Sugar Kings in Havana any time soon. Baseball’s landscape has shifted so dramatically, and Cuba is so far behind economically, that even a small minor league team in the Cuban capital is hard to envision.“You can't even finance a Double-A team without TV and major corporate sponsorships and corporations buying season boxes, while people in Havana go to baseball games for 13 cents,” Bjarkman said. ”I'm not saying it can't happen down the road, but... it's going to take 5, 10, 15 years to rebuild most of the [baseball] infrastructure in Havana.”Major League Baseball first returned to Cuba in 1999, when the Baltimore Orioles played the national team in Havana. But Obama's attendance, and the shifting relationship between the two countries, could spark major changes in the way they approach baseball.“Hopefully, it’s going to open the floodgates,” Barcia said of Obama's visit."

And the removal of the Sugar Kings, given the symbolic significance of baseball in each country, was among the most important moments in the destruction of their relationship.“The moment they took away the Sugar Kings from Havana, everything went to hell,” Manuel Barcia, a Cuban-born professor at the University of Leeds who is currently authoring a book about the Sugar Kings, told The Huffington Post. “Everything went south, because there was nothing else in common between the USA and Cuba.”Baseball is a shared cultural experience for Cuba and America, and it has often exemplified the relations between Washington and Havana. The Sugar Kings were no different when they were established in 1954, a year after Fidel Castro’s 26th of July movement launched its revolution against American-allied president Fulgencio Batista.American ambassador Arthur Gardner was in attendance when the team played its first game on April 23, 1954, at the Gran Estadio in the Cuban capital. “Cuban representation on the diamond is not only good for baseball, it is good for hemisphere relations,” The New York Times wrote in the next day’s paper.Over the next six years, the Sugar Kings -- a team with a distinctly local flavor -- developed into a steady supplier of Cuban Major League talent, sending players like slick-fielding shortstop Leonardo Cardenas and future MLB All-Stars Cookie Rojas and Mike Cuellar to the big leagues. Though the team often featured American and other Latin players alongside Cubans, it became one of the biggest symbols of national baseball pride, proof that the island's talent could compete with -- and beat -- that from its much larger neighbor.When the Dodgers and Giants left New York in 1957 for Los Angeles and San Francisco, it set the stage for rapid Major League expansion -- and in Havana, Sugar Kings owner Bobby Maduro and other baseball boosters saw an opportunity.“Havana, as a baseball hotbed, and at that time one of the largest cities in the western hemisphere outside the U.S., certainly considered itself ready” for a Major League franchise, said Peter Bjarkman, an author and Cuban baseball historian.Even in the Sugar Kings’ final days, with the U.S.-Cuba relationship falling apart for good, Maduro assured Cubans that top-tier professional baseball was coming to the island.But before MLB could start plotting a major league team in the heart of Havana, the Cuban revolution engulfed the Sugar Kings.Batista fled Castro’s rebels on the first day of 1959, months before the International League season was set to begin. By that March, political turmoil and violence had begun to cause rumblings that the Sugar Kings wouldn’t play that season.Maduro met with Castro for three-and-a-half hours in early April 1959, then greeted the media to put any speculation about the team’s future to rest.The Sugar Kings would stay in Havana permanently, Maduro said.But that July, pro-Castro troops preparing to celebrate the anniversary of Cuban independence unloaded their weapons into the air outside the Gran Estadio, unwittingly showering the stadium with falling bullets. The Sugar Kings were locked in an extra innings battle with the Rochester Red Wings that night, and the gunfire sent players scattering off the field. Bullets struck Sugar Kings shortstop Leo Cardenas and Red Wings third base coach Frank Verdi. The Red Wings refused to show up for the series finale and flew back to the U.S the next day.The Sugar Kings rebounded from the incident to finish the season third in the International League standings before winning a playoff series that earned them a berth in the Little World Series, a competition between the champions of the International League and American Association, another minor league.They defeated the Minneapolis Millers to win the series title -- another victory over American baseball for Cubans to celebrate -- and even resumed play in the International League the next April. But the shooting incident, along with the continued tension in relations between Washington and Havana, eventually overtook baseball. The Eisenhower administration, seeking to exert leverage over Castro, a devout fan of the Sugar Kings and baseball generally, turned the sport into its own political tool. The Americans pressured MLB commissioner Ford Frick to relocate the Sugar Kings from Havana. In July 1960, Frank Shaughnessy, the league's president, announced that the team was moving to New Jersey immediately.The Sugar Kings played their final game on July 14, 1960, in Miami. They arrived in Jersey City at 6.30 a.m. the next day, where a raucous celebration awaited the new baseball team. Thousands of New Jerseyites flocked to the streets to welcome the “Jerseys,” as the team would be known, but their interest soon waned. Before the 1962 season, the Jerseys were sold and relocated to Jacksonville, Florida.Castro was appalled. He told Frick and the Americans that he would pay the team’s debts to keep them in Havana, and when the team left anyway, the Cuban leader accused the U.S. of overstepping “all codes of sportsmanship,” according to author Steven Kinzer’s account in The Brothers, his book about the former secretary of state John Foster Dulles and his brother, ex-CIA director Alan Dulles. Frick also banned Major Leaguers from playing in Cuba's winter league, effectively gutting one of the best and most popular offseason leagues in the Caribbean. “This notion you hear... that Fidel Castro killed baseball with the revolution, maybe indirectly that's true. But Washington and Major League Baseball had a huge hand in pulling professional baseball out of there,” Bjarkman said. “Fidel did not do that himself.”“It was something of a last point of contact between Cuba and the United States before the embargo,” Barcia added. “It was one of the last ways of communicating. One of the things they both had in common, Cuba and the United States, was baseball.”As the U.S. government escalated its campaign to isolate and dispose of Castro -- culminating in the botched Bay of Pigs invasion and the 1962 embargo -- Castro insulated Cuban baseball further in response. He banned professional sports in the country and prohibited Cuban players from leaving for pro leagues in overseas. The Cubans who were already in Major League Baseball, as well as those who’d followed the Sugar Kings to New Jersey, weren’t allowed to return to the island to play for the national team.Cubans didn’t seem to mind. The wealth of the country's talent that had once spread to America now stayed home, and the red-clad national team turned into a regional powerhouse that won numerous international tournaments. Cuban league teams like Industriales -- whom Barcia described as “the New York Yankees of Cuban baseball” -- became incredibly popular.“That concept of baseball as being the face of the nation goes back before Fidel,” Bjarkman said. “He just exploited that further after the revolution.”But the Caribbean country's baseball, and the way that Cubans looked at their sport, began to change in the 1990s, when players like Livan and Orlando Hernandez, brothers who defected to the United States and then won World Series titles as pitchers with the Florida Marlins and New York Yankees, became American stars. Additional defections followed. It has had profound effects, both on the once-proud national team, which Bjarkman said is now roughly equivalent to a Double-A squad, and on attitudes among Cubans.“The Cuban fans are now shifting their attitude, and they're taking pride in Cubans in the Major Leagues,” Bjarkman said. “The Cuban government has not made that transition, and I don't know how quickly they'll make that transition.”Obama's swift moves to further open relations between the U.S. and Cuba will certainly continue to change those attitudes, especially if the Cuban government begins to transition in its approach to baseball as well.But the president will see few signs of the Sugar Kings in Havana next week, Bjarkman said. Cubans are far more invested in the national and local teams than in a short-lived minor league side that existed before most of them were born. And it’s unlikely that there will be another team like the Sugar Kings in Havana any time soon. Baseball’s landscape has shifted so dramatically, and Cuba is so far behind economically, that even a small minor league team in the Cuban capital is hard to envision.“You can't even finance a Double-A team without TV and major corporate sponsorships and corporations buying season boxes, while people in Havana go to baseball games for 13 cents,” Bjarkman said. ”I'm not saying it can't happen down the road, but... it's going to take 5, 10, 15 years to rebuild most of the [baseball] infrastructure in Havana.”Major League Baseball first returned to Cuba in 1999, when the Baltimore Orioles played the national team in Havana. But Obama's attendance, and the shifting relationship between the two countries, could spark major changes in the way they approach baseball.“Hopefully, it’s going to open the floodgates,” Barcia said of Obama's visit."

25,POLITICS,The Supreme Court Could Use A Good Public Defender,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jane-kelly-public-defenders_us_56e06adfe4b0b25c918072e5,"Judge Jane Kelly is still available, should the next president be listening.",2016-03-19,Kelly spent nearly two decades ensuring the poor's right to counsel.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_29_103_2943_1870%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Once a Supreme Court nominee is chosen, the public quickly forgets the people not picked. But now is actually a good time to focus on someone who almost got the nod: Judge Jane Kelly.It's a good time because Kelly represents a critically important, but often overlooked -- and always underfunded -- part of our criminal justice system.Friday is National Public Defense Day, which celebrates the anniversary of the Supreme Court's March 18, 1963, decision in Gideon v. Wainwright. That landmark ruling established the right to counsel for indigent persons accused of crimes in state courts.As the Supreme Court explained:""From the very beginning, our state and national constitutions and laws have laid great emphasis on procedural and substantive safeguards designed to assure fair trials before impartial tribunals in which every defendant stands equal before the law. This noble ideal cannot be realized if the poor man charged with crime has to face his accusers without a lawyer to assist him.""Because of her history, Kelly likely understands what it means to a poor person to have a lawyer better than most people.In 1991, she graduated in the same Harvard Law School class as President Barack Obama. She could've sought wealth and prestige at a big law firm or started up the ranks of government service by becoming a federal prosecutor -- two common paths for those graduating from top-flight law schools.Instead, Kelly decided to stand up for poor people. Following back-to-back clerkships with federal judges -- which also looks great on a young lawyer's résumé -- she went to work as a public defender in the Northern District of Iowa. She served there for nearly two decades, until her former classmate, Obama, nominated her to an appellate judgeship in 2013.Kelly didn't get the Supreme Court gig this time, but maybe next time she will. Voices like hers are needed at the high court -- not just because there's a dearth of real-life trial experience among the justices, but because the rights of the most powerless are perpetually under siege.There's a certain hard-won wisdom that comes with the daily grind of representing people -- meeting with them and their worried families, going to court or the jailhouse again and again, urging the judge to lower your client's bail, pleading for a lenient sentence, not winning and seeing what that means for a person already at the bottom of America's ladder. For many people, the public defender is the only line of defense against a system where the cards are stacked against them.Kelly's own commitment to defending others was tested in 2004, when she spent months recovering from a brutal attack that nearly killed her. The crime remains unsolved. ""It's easy to lose compassion,"" she told The Des Moines Register several months after the attack. ""But the problem is bigger than who committed the crime.""Then-Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), who recommended Kelly for the appellate judgeship, told the newspaper that the incident said a lot about Kelly's nature.""After having that happen to her, she went right back to work sticking up for the constitutional rights of people accused by the federal government,"" he said. ""To me, that was a mark of real character and sort of inner strength and resolve that something like that was not going to make her throw in the towel.""During her confirmation hearing in 2013 -- before the Senate confirmed her unanimously -- Kelly spoke more about what has driven her life's work.""As a criminal defense attorney, I am often representing someone who, shall I say, is not the most popular person in the room,"" she said. ""So I, as much as anyone, know how important it is to be fair and impartial and make decisions based on things other than bias, favor or prejudice."""

He also ticked off his list of generic conservative promises: repealing Obamacare, protecting gun rights and eliminating the Common Core framework for education.Trump hurled insults at the Republican establishment, Mitt Romney and his remaining rivals in the GOP presidential race, Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas) and Ohio Gov. John Kasich.But Trump did not once address the protest preceding the rally, nor did any protesters manage to disrupt the rally once it started.Trump’s silence on the matter was especially notable because the roadblock beforehand was one of the most dramatic anti-Trump demonstrations to date.Earlier in the day, demonstrators stopped their cars on Shea Boulevard, one of the main roads leading to the rally. Many of them tied themselves to the cars with cables, preventing their cars from being towed right away. The Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office arrested at least three people for blocking a public roadway in connection with the incident.The stoppage caused Trump to arrive some 45 minutes late for a rally scheduled for 2 p.m. Eastern Time. Aerial video footage provided by local TV station ABC15 Arizona showed Trump’s security motorcade speeding up the shoulder of the roads leading into Fountain Hills in order to minimize the delay.Former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer (R) and Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, whose harsh treatment of undocumented immigrants has elicited widespread criticism, introduced Trump onstage.Arpaio addressed the roadblock in his remarks, downplaying the challenge the demonstrators had posed to the rally. “We had a little problem. Some demonstrators were trying to disrupt and because of them you had to get a little more sunshine. But we made it,” he said. “Three of them are in jail,” Arpaio added, prompting loud cheers.Arpaio vowed that protesters would not be able to “intimidate” Trump and his supporters. “Not in this town, I’ll tell you right now,” he said.Trump was in the Phoenix area to mobilize supporters ahead of Tuesday’s Arizona Republican primary.“Go out on Tuesday and vote,” he told the crowd of supporters. “I will never let you down!Trump recalled the disturbance-free rally fondly at a more tumultuous event in Tucson later on Saturday.""They cut the chains, they arrested three people, and everybody else left, right?"" he told the crowd. ""We said, 'What happened?' And we had the most beautiful rally you’ve ever seen under the sun.""Trump is currently leading Cruz in Arizona by some 17 points, according to HuffPost Pollster’s polling average, which aggregates all publicly available polls.At the Phoenix-area rally, Trump expressed confidence that he would both prevail in Arizona and win the majority of Republican delegates nationwide, allowing him to secure the GOP nomination before the party’s July convention in Cleveland.“We have a silent majority that is no longer so silent,” he said. “It’s now the loud noisy majority and we’re going to be heard.”Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

Trump said on Saturday that they tell him to ""act presidential.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56edd8d6150000ad000b2930.jpeg?cache=6wYw1vguUO&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump said his wife Melania and daughter Ivanka have asked him to “act presidential,” but he is having trouble listening to them.“My wife and my daughter Ivanka said to me, ‘Act presidential! Act presidential!’” Trump told supporters at a rally outside Phoenix, Arizona on Saturday. “Like in the last debate, I acted presidential, OK? I didn’t hit little Marco and I didn’t hit lyin, lyin, lyin Ted.” “I didn’t wanna hit ‘em -- I wanted to really impress my daughter and my wife,” he added.Trump did indeed refrain from personal attacks against his rivals in the March 10 debate, though they also treated him with unusual civility.But the Republican establishment out to stop Trump increasingly sees his vulgar remarks and theatrical demeanor as his biggest weakness with voters. Earlier this month, veteran GOP strategist Karl Rove told power brokers at a reclusive Georgia retreat that turned into an anti-Trump planning session that voters have trouble viewing the real estate mogul as “presidential.”Trump appeared to concede on Saturday that he has trouble conforming to this traditional standard of presidential behavior, but implied that it was to voters’ advantage -- since it would make him more likely to stand up to companies that offshore American jobs.In a colorful, meandering bit, Trump described the “unpresidential” way he would threaten the air conditioner manufacturer Carrier with a 35 percent tariff if it did not return its production to the U.S. The company, which reported a $7.6 billion in profit in 2015, announced in February that it was moving the jobs of 1,400 workers at an Indianapolis plant to Monterrey, Mexico.“I wanna do it myself. I know it’s not presidential. It’s not presidential for the president of the United States to call up the head of Carrier, ‘Hullo this is the president,’” he intoned, speaking the imaginary dialogue in a goofy voice. “But I don’t care. It’s so much for fun for me. I love doing it. Please don’t take that away from me!”Trump continued: “Every single air conditioning unit that you make, as it crosses the border … we’re gonna put a 35 percent tax on that unit and I hope it works out well for you folks!” Trump added his usual assurances that after threatening Carrier with a tariff, he would be able to withstand the lobbying assault they would launch against him because he does not rely on their campaign donations.“I don’t give a damn for them, folks,"" he said. ""I care for you.""The discussion of trade was also notable for Trump's mockery of Republican critics who say his stance on trade is not conservative.“You know, Jeb Bush would say, ‘He is not a conservative,’” Trump said, imitating a robotic voice. “I’m conservative folks, but I’m also like, smart -- you know, smart.” Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Translators without Borders, a remote network of volunteer translators, is helping NGOs in the Western Balkans translate vital information to help newly arrived migrants on the island of Lesbos.Imagine for a moment you are a refugee fleeing conflict in Syria, Afghanistan or Iraq and picture your joy at finally landing on the famed Greek island of Lesbos after a perilous and harrowing sea journey. And then imagine your bewilderment when you realize you don’t understand Greek and don’t know how you’ll get by when it comes to urgent things like food, shelter and medical attention.On the other side, imagine for a moment you are one of the scores of local and foreign volunteers on Lesbos, such as Rose Foran, who works on the NGO Internews’ humanitarian response in Lesbos. Helping requires communication. But how do you communicate with so many refugees speaking so many different languages?That’s where one NGO – Translators without Borders (TWB) – has been quietly helping. It operates an online network of nearly 120 Arabic, Farsi, Urdu and Greek-speaking volunteers who provide a rapid-response translation service to help NGOs keep migrants informed. With a remotely based staff member coordinating its work via Skype, TWB can quickly turn around professional translations of news reports, health warnings, weather bulletins, information on applying for asylum or instructions on using cash machines.“What Translators without Borders is doing is relieving the pressure on aid workers who speak multiple languages but are used only for those skills rather than their actual work. That is a huge issue,” said Foran. Internews, she said, uses the service every single day to translate its weekly newsletter into Arabic, Farsi, Greek and English, which debunks rumors spreading among the refugees.TWB translators also work on News That Moves, a daily news service in the same four languages that aims to inform migrants on the West Balkans route about border closures, registration centers and asylum rights.“It’s because of Translators without Borders that we can have a website in multiple languages and keep refugees at the heart of our work,” said Foran.TWB is an American offshoot of Traducteurs sans Frontieres, which was founded in 1993 to link volunteer translators to NGOs focusing on health, nutrition and education. Today, TWB helps translate over 2 million words per year for NGOs including Action Against Hunger, Doctors without Borders and Oxfam.As the number of migrants arriving in Greece peaked in 2015, it soon became obvious that something similar was needed in the Balkans. Backed by funding from the British government’s development arm, DfID, a project was launched to translate documents from English into Arabic, Farsi and Urdu, with other languages added as necessary. Since November, volunteers have translated over 100,000 words. The service is a lifeline to the local, underfunded aid networks that sprang up to help as migrant arrivals surged.Even a translation of a ferry cancellation notice can make a huge difference, says Lali Foster, who coordinates TWB’s “Words of Relief” project on the ground in the Balkans.Words of Relief focuses on crisis situations. Following a pilot project in Kenya in 2014, it set up a rapid-response effort to help NGOs dealing with Ebola patients in West Africa. Its success was a model for a similar program during the aid effort that followed last year’s earthquake in Nepal.“It sounds so basic, but you could have thousands of people waiting in the cold, rain or snow,” Foster said. “To be able to tell people ‘don’t go to port, stay in the registration center,’ despite the fact travel agents are saying something different, seeing that is really impressive.”The model is simple. An agency with a document that needs translating sends it to Foster, who puts out a request via Skype to translators with the right language match. The first available translator picks it up, writes the translation on a Google Doc, then sends the link to an editor, who reviews it. Soon, it’s heading back to the relevant NGO. The whole process can take as little as 15 minutes.Volunteer translator Selima Ben Chagra says she’s highly motivated to help out, despite receiving no payment for her work. A recent master’s graduate in translation from the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, she’s now back home in Tunisia working as a freelance translator. When her former professor emailed her to say TWB was looking for translators, she immediately signed up. Selima stays logged in on Skype for six to eight hours a day in case there are urgent requests. She says she spends about 15 hours a week translating for TWB.Unlike volunteers working directly with the arriving refugees, Selima never meets the people she helps. Often, she does not know whom and how many lives her translation could have impacted. There is just no room for self-gratification. But, despite the distance, she loves what she does.“I wish I could do more,” she said. “Today I was doing laundry when I got a Skype message, so I just left my laundry, did the translation, then went back to the housework. I believe our work should be treated as a priority. What if I were in their shoes, waiting for that information?”The West Balkans team translates 2,000–3,000 words a day, including signs, short news articles, details of specific reception centers and up-to-date information on asylum laws.It’s an initiative that quickly gained interest from NGOs working in Lesbos. Its clients include the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR, Norwegian Refugee Council and Internews, which uses the service every day for projects that help keep migrants informed of developments and dangers on the West Balkans route.Given the demand on the ground, any volunteer who speaks Arabic and English could become a translator. While their skills are useful, the quality of the translation is vital.For example, there are several words in Arabic for “boat.” News of a ferry strike could easily be mistranslated to imply that the craft carrying migrants from Turkey to the Greek coast had stopped running. One word seems like a small issue, but in context, poor translation could create enormous confusion. Selima might not meet those she helps face-to-face, but timely translations by her and her fellow translators have aided as many as tens of thousands of stranded refugees at a time.“They have made it so there’s less panic among refugees: they know what’s going on and what’s the next step. That mitigates a lot of anxiety,” explained Foran.This article originally appeared on Refugees Deeply.

30,THE WORLDPOST,Online Translators Bridge The Communication Gap Between Refugees And Volunteers In Greece,"Paul Raymond, Refugees Deeply",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/online-translators-greece-refugees_us_56ec6c29e4b084c672205262,"How do you help someone if you can’t communicate with them? Translators without Borders, a remote network of volunteer translators",2016-03-19,Posts in different languages provide logistical information to refugees on the move. They also try to dispel rumors.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56ec6e8a1e00008700704adf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"How do you help someone if you can’t communicate with them? Translators without Borders, a remote network of volunteer translators, is helping NGOs in the Western Balkans translate vital information to help newly arrived migrants on the island of Lesbos.Imagine for a moment you are a refugee fleeing conflict in Syria, Afghanistan or Iraq and picture your joy at finally landing on the famed Greek island of Lesbos after a perilous and harrowing sea journey. And then imagine your bewilderment when you realize you don’t understand Greek and don’t know how you’ll get by when it comes to urgent things like food, shelter and medical attention.On the other side, imagine for a moment you are one of the scores of local and foreign volunteers on Lesbos, such as Rose Foran, who works on the NGO Internews’ humanitarian response in Lesbos. Helping requires communication. But how do you communicate with so many refugees speaking so many different languages?That’s where one NGO – Translators without Borders (TWB) – has been quietly helping. It operates an online network of nearly 120 Arabic, Farsi, Urdu and Greek-speaking volunteers who provide a rapid-response translation service to help NGOs keep migrants informed. With a remotely based staff member coordinating its work via Skype, TWB can quickly turn around professional translations of news reports, health warnings, weather bulletins, information on applying for asylum or instructions on using cash machines.“What Translators without Borders is doing is relieving the pressure on aid workers who speak multiple languages but are used only for those skills rather than their actual work. That is a huge issue,” said Foran. Internews, she said, uses the service every single day to translate its weekly newsletter into Arabic, Farsi, Greek and English, which debunks rumors spreading among the refugees.TWB translators also work on News That Moves, a daily news service in the same four languages that aims to inform migrants on the West Balkans route about border closures, registration centers and asylum rights.“It’s because of Translators without Borders that we can have a website in multiple languages and keep refugees at the heart of our work,” said Foran.TWB is an American offshoot of Traducteurs sans Frontieres, which was founded in 1993 to link volunteer translators to NGOs focusing on health, nutrition and education. Today, TWB helps translate over 2 million words per year for NGOs including Action Against Hunger, Doctors without Borders and Oxfam.As the number of migrants arriving in Greece peaked in 2015, it soon became obvious that something similar was needed in the Balkans. Backed by funding from the British government’s development arm, DfID, a project was launched to translate documents from English into Arabic, Farsi and Urdu, with other languages added as necessary. Since November, volunteers have translated over 100,000 words. The service is a lifeline to the local, underfunded aid networks that sprang up to help as migrant arrivals surged.Even a translation of a ferry cancellation notice can make a huge difference, says Lali Foster, who coordinates TWB’s “Words of Relief” project on the ground in the Balkans.Words of Relief focuses on crisis situations. Following a pilot project in Kenya in 2014, it set up a rapid-response effort to help NGOs dealing with Ebola patients in West Africa. Its success was a model for a similar program during the aid effort that followed last year’s earthquake in Nepal.“It sounds so basic, but you could have thousands of people waiting in the cold, rain or snow,” Foster said. “To be able to tell people ‘don’t go to port, stay in the registration center,’ despite the fact travel agents are saying something different, seeing that is really impressive.”The model is simple. An agency with a document that needs translating sends it to Foster, who puts out a request via Skype to translators with the right language match. The first available translator picks it up, writes the translation on a Google Doc, then sends the link to an editor, who reviews it. Soon, it’s heading back to the relevant NGO. The whole process can take as little as 15 minutes.Volunteer translator Selima Ben Chagra says she’s highly motivated to help out, despite receiving no payment for her work. A recent master’s graduate in translation from the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, she’s now back home in Tunisia working as a freelance translator. When her former professor emailed her to say TWB was looking for translators, she immediately signed up. Selima stays logged in on Skype for six to eight hours a day in case there are urgent requests. She says she spends about 15 hours a week translating for TWB.Unlike volunteers working directly with the arriving refugees, Selima never meets the people she helps. Often, she does not know whom and how many lives her translation could have impacted. There is just no room for self-gratification. But, despite the distance, she loves what she does.“I wish I could do more,” she said. “Today I was doing laundry when I got a Skype message, so I just left my laundry, did the translation, then went back to the housework. I believe our work should be treated as a priority. What if I were in their shoes, waiting for that information?”The West Balkans team translates 2,000–3,000 words a day, including signs, short news articles, details of specific reception centers and up-to-date information on asylum laws.It’s an initiative that quickly gained interest from NGOs working in Lesbos.

Instead, she just told her fans during a concert at London's O2 Arena on Friday night. The news then went viral on social media.""Who's going to Glastonbury this year?"" she reportedly asked the crowd. ""See you there. I'll be there. I'll be headlining on the Saturday night this year.""Glastonbury Festival, which this year runs from Jun. 22 to 26, confirmed the news on Twitter soon after:As did festival organizer Emily Eavis:According to the NME, Adele said she'd wanted to headline in 2015 but decided not to because her new album -- ""25"", released in November -- wasn't quite ready. She also had a message for people who think her ballad-heavy music isn't suited to the more hippy and rock ethos of the five-day event at Worthy Farm in Somerset. ""And to the people who say I am too boring to headline, you're more fucking boring for moaning about me headlining.""The ""Hello"" singer will headline the festival's iconic Pyramid Stage on the Saturday night, following on from Muse on the Friday and before Coldplay -- which closes the festival on the Sunday. Kanye West was the main attraction in 2015.Those hoping to see Adele in action will need to have bought tickets already. The event's 135,000 tickets sold out last October. So here are some other festivals that may appeal."

Reid Ribble (R-Wis.) told ""So That Happened,"" the HuffPost Politics podcast. Ribble will be one of as many as 20 members of Congress accompanying the president on the two-day jaunt. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) will also be going, his office has said. Ribble said he supports ending the economic embargo the U.S. has imposed on Cuba since 1960, noting that over the course of decades the policy hasn't made the island nation any less Communist. Ending the embargo would be good for American businesses, he said. ""When they see the freedom of mobility Americans have and their willingness to come and invest money, I think it's a natural thing that they're going to want not only our products and services -- and certainly Wisconsin cheese and milk -- they're going to want American-style freedom as well,"" Ribble said.

No group has yet claimed responsibility.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56ed861c1e0000c600710b17.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed four people on Saturday in a busy shopping district in the heart of Istanbul, pushing the death toll from four separate suicide attacks in Turkey this year to more than 80.Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said the blast was ""inhumane"" and would not stop Turkey, which has been targeted by Kurdish and Islamic State militants, from fighting ""centers of terrorism"".Israel said two of its citizens died in the attack, Washington said two Americans had been killed and a Turkish official said one victim was Iranian, suggesting that some of the dead may have had dual nationality.The blast, which also wounded at least 36 people, was a few hundred meters from an area where police buses are often stationed. It sent panicked shoppers scurrying into alleys off Istiklal Street, a long pedestrian avenue lined with international stores and foreign consulates.""There is information that it is an attack carried out by an ISIS member, but this is preliminary information, we are still checking it,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters, using another name for Islamic State.He said a third Israeli may have died. Israel also said 11 of its citizens had been wounded while Ireland said ""a number"" of Irish were hurt.The attack will raise further questions about the ability of NATO member Turkey to protect itself against a spillover of violence from the war in neighboring Syria.Turkey is battling a widening Kurdish insurgency in its southeast, which it sees as fueled by the territorial gains of Kurdish militia fighters in northern Syria, and has also blamed some of the recent bombings on Islamic State militants who crossed from its southern neighbor.""No center of terrorism will reach its aim with such monstrous attacks,"" Davutoglu said in a written statement. ""Our struggle will continue with the same resolution and determination until terrorism ends completely.""Warning: Graphic images belowTHREE SUSPECTSGermany had shut its diplomatic missions and schools on Thursday, citing a specific threat. U.S. and other European embassies had warned their citizens to be vigilant ahead of Newroz celebrations this weekend, a spring festival largely marked by Kurds that has turned violent in the past.There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Two senior officials said the attack could have been carried out by the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), fighting for Kurdish autonomy in the southeast, or by an Islamic State militant.A PKK offshoot claimed responsibility for two suicide bombings in the capital Ankara over the past month which killed 66 people. Islamic State was blamed for a suicide bombing in Istanbul in January which killed at least 12 German tourists.One of the officials said Saturday's bomber, who also died in the blast, had planned to hit a more crowded location but was deterred by the police presence.""The attacker detonated the bomb before reaching the target point because they were scared of the police,"" the official said, declining to be named as the investigation is ongoing.Another official said investigations were focusing on three possible suspects, all of them male and two of them from the southern city of Gaziantep near the Syrian border. There was no further confirmation of this.Armed police sealed off the shopping street where half a dozen ambulances gathered. Forensic teams in white suits searched for evidence as police helicopters buzzed overhead.""I saw a body on the street. No one was treating him but then I saw someone who appeared to be a regular citizen trying to do something to the body. That was enough for me and I turned and went back,"" one resident told Reuters.Istiklal Street, usually thronged with shoppers at weekends, was quieter than normal as more people are staying home after a series of deadly bombings.Health Minister Mehmet Muezzinoglu said 36 people had been wounded, seven of them in serious condition. At least 24 of the wounded were foreigners, according to Istanbul's governor.INTERNATIONAL CONDEMNATIONTurkey is still in shock from a suicide car bombing last Sunday at a crowded transport hub in the capital Ankara which killed 37 people and a similar bombing in Ankara last month in which 29 died. A PKK offshoot claimed responsibility for both.The latest attack brought widespread condemnation.Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, on an official visit to Istanbul, said it showed ""the ugly face of terrorism"". France condemned it as ""despicable and cowardly"".NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg described it as ""another terrorist outrage against innocent civilians"", while the U.S. State Department said it was the latest ""indefensible violence targeting innocent people throughout Turkey"".The Kurdish-rooted opposition Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) condemned the bombing. The PKK's umbrella group said it opposed targeting civilians and condemned attacks on them.A 2-1/2-year PKK ceasefire collapsed last July, triggering the worst violence in the southeast since the 1990s. Hundreds have since died.Separately, a police officer and a soldier died in clashes with militants in the southeastern city of Nusaybin, security sources said.In its armed campaign in Turkey, the PKK has historically struck directly at the security forces but recent bombings suggest it could be shifting tactics.At the height of the PKK insurgency in the 1990s, the Newroz festival often saw clashes between Kurdish protesters and security forces.More Coverage From The WorldPost:"

But is it newsworthy?That question was at the heart of the high-profile lawsuit filed by ex-professional wrestler Hulk Hogan (real name: Terry Bollea) after Gawker ran a lengthy story entitled ""Even for a Minute, Watching Hulk Hogan Have Sex in a Canopy Bed is Not Safe For Work but Watch it Anyway."" The post featured a clip of Hogan in the ring, so to speak, with his then-best friend's wife.A Florida jury found on Friday that Gawker had invaded Hogan's personal privacy by publishing the clip and awarded Hogan a massive $115 million in damages.It was a decision that Gawker had warned would have chilling implications for the media at large. ""We ask you to protect something that some of you may find unpleasant,"" Gawker attorney Michael Sullivan told the jury in closing arguments. ""To write, to speak, to think about all topics, to hold public figures accountable. It is right in the long run for our freedoms.""While Gawker intends to appeal, many are left wondering: What impact will the verdict have on freedom of the press and what precedent does it set? According to Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California, Irvine School of Law, Friday's decision simply means ""you can’t put up a tape of someone having sex without that person’s consent.""""I don’t think it goes any further than that,"" he told The Huffington Post, adding that publishing the video is ""inherently different"" from simply writing about the fact that a Hogan sex tape exists. In fact, gossip websites TMZ and TheDirty.com both published news of the video before Gawker posted a 101-second excerpt of the tape.Clay Calvert, a First Amendment expert and professor of law and mass communications at the University of Florida, told HuffPost prior to Friday's verdict that a ruling for Hogan would mean the jury is drawing ""an important line suggesting that the contents of a sex tape are not newsworthy."" But he added that, in reality, most media wouldn't publish a story with a sexually explicit video. ""It will affect those in the sphere of publications like Gawker,"" Calvert said, ""who push the envelope in terms of what they find newsworthy.""Mary-Rose Papandrea, a law professor at the University of North Carolina, agreed it likely won't have a larger effect, because ""most journalists and most publishers are careful, and err on the side of protecting privacy."" Even so, there is currently an ""anything goes"" mentality when it comes to publishing information about celebrities, Eric Goldman, co-director of Santa Clara University’s High Tech Law Institute, told Fusion. Indeed, Gawker had argued in court that by repeatedly discussing his own sex life in public, Hogan made the subject fair game. Their loss, Goldman said, might result in ""some rethinking of that mentality.""Since the verdict, Nick Denton, Gawker's founder, made clear Gawker plans to appeal. Until then, one can only assume the $115 million verdict will result in other outlets thinking long and hard before publishing the next sex tape that surfaces."
