It looked like something plucked out of the costume closet on the ""Sound of Music"" set -- white cotton with an empire waist and three-quarter-length sleeves. The bodice was heart-shaped and the material was marked with the faintest striping pattern in thin, satin lines. Three white, ornamental buttons trailing down the bodice's front gave the illusion of access. Dainty lace hung from the sleeves, which matched the lace running around the hem of the ankle-length skirt. It was the only dress I wanted to wear for my eighth grade graduation. It was too big. ""We'll just have it altered,"" said my mother. I was a pretty unremarkable 14-year-old with braces, a doughy body and weird, stubborn hair that looked nothing like the hairstyles of the girls in the teen fashion magazines I read -- it didn't matter how many styling products I glopped on. I was not athletic, unless you count consuming bags of chips with sour cream and onion dip while watching ""General Hospital"" a sport. If I was pretty or cute, I did not know it. The white dress appealed to my inner-Cinderella and I knew it would make me feel beautiful and more like the other girls in my class I secretly envied -- the ones with ""right"" hair who got to wear their boyfriends' football jackets. Weeks later, I found myself stripped down to my bra and panties and standing on a wooden block in the cramped trailer that belonged to Eugenia. My mother knew her through some other women who attended our church. For more than 40 years, Eugenia had worked as a seamstress in some of the most prestigious bridal salons in Boston. Eugenia knew her way around a ream of fabric and a pair of pinking shears. A squat, tank of a woman, Eugenia was loud, pushy and wheezed something terrible as she lumbered around the small space. I stood on my box while my mother and grandmother sat mashed together, knee-to-knee, on a short couch. I shimmied into the dress. Eugenia circled me the way shaman mark their ritual spaces. She pulled pins from the cushion strapped to her wrist, making small clucking noises with her tongue as she yanked the hem. I felt her large hands grab the excess material around my waist and tug it tight. She sighed. She clucked. She grunted softly in a way where I could practically hear her frowning. ""Hippy,"" she said. ""This one's got some hips on her."" She continued to pull and sigh and make small laboring noises as she worked. I sought out my mother's eyes, but she didn't seem to notice where Eugenia's remark had landed. The smile slipped from my face and I felt a hot flood of ugly wash through me. I was not good enough to wear this princess dress. I felt ashamed; I felt that having more meant I would always be less-than. ""You're making too much of it,"" my mother said when I told her how crappy Eugenia's comment made me feel. ""You're fine the way you are!"" I wasn't convinced. I wore the dress once for graduation and when I looked at the photos of me with my parents, with my teachers, I didn't see the princess I wanted to be. Instead, I saw a girl who, like the dress itself, needed altering.  Pictured: The author and her eighth grade Social Studies teacher, Mr. BarrettI feel really lucky that I didn't embark on a path of eating disorders or other risky behavior based on that first body-shaming experience. I might have skipped the onion dip for about a week, but before too long it seemed easier to accept my hips as my fate and tuck back into the salty drug of choice. Instead, I let the image of myself seen through someone else's eyes become tattooed on my interior, and I made it a part of my body apology: ""Oh, well I've got some hips on me you know,"" ""I'm kind of hippy, so these types of skirts just don't work for me,"" ""Sorry, it's just these hips!"" I am no longer an apologist for my body because I see with laser clarity that words matter as much as any Photoshopped image or bikini-ready Instagram post. Words can leave such massive amounts of collateral damage, it's worth bringing more awareness to the conversations we're having with ourselves and with others about our bodies. We could change so much if we took the time to think about saying less."

IS group has targeted Yazidis and other minorities in northern Iraq in a campaign that rights group Amnesty International said in a report amounted to ethnic cleansing, murdering civilians and enslaving others for a fate that some captives consider worse than death. IS militants have overrun swathes of Iraq since June 2014, declared a cross-border caliphate also encompassing parts of neighbouring Syria and carried out a litany of abuses in both countries.

Some were too exhausted and disoriented to speak.One elderly woman said she had been captured by the insurgents last August when they overpowered Kurdish forces in the Sinjar area and proceeded to purge its Yazidi population, killing hundreds and taking thousands captive.The woman, who asked not to be named, said she had told her son and two young daughters to run away as the militants closed in, but stayed behind herself because she was unwell and did not want to slow them down.""I had lost hope of seeing my children again, but today it has happened,"" she said as they embraced her and wept.It was not clear why the radical jihadists had decided to release the Yazidis, whom they consider devil-worshippers, but the group previously freed 200 more it was holding under similarly mysterious circumstances.Some of the Yazidis said they had been held in the Islamic State stronghold of Tel Afar most of the time, but in the days leading up to their release, they were moved from one town to another in Islamic State's self-proclaimed caliphate.The Yazidis thought they were being led to their execution, but instead, were piled onto a minibus that drove them to peshmerga positions in batches. Yazidi community leaders were there to receive them and an ambulance was on standby.Yazidi activists say many remain in the hands of Islamic State, which has often subjected women to rape or sexual slavery. The United Nations said last month Islamic State may have committed genocide against the minority.The Yazidis are an ancient, predominantly Kurdish people who follow their own religion derived from Islam, Christianity and Zoroastrianism.(Reporting by Mustafa Mahmoud; Editing by Angus MacSwan)"

3,IMPACT,Background Checks... Don't Be So Sure,"Fred Engh, ContributorFounder and president of the National and International Allian...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/background-checks-dont-be-_b_7024352.html,"Whatever we can do to prevent child abusers from abusing children in organized sports, I'm all for.

Throughout the last several years, the phrase ""background checks"" has been floating around as if it's a panacea for making sure youth sports leagues are doing the right thing when it comes to filtering out undesirables, such as child predators.But from day one it seemed to me that there was something missing. Sure it sounds good when leagues announce to all the parents, ""We do backgrounds on all our coaches,"" but did that mean that all the coaches were perfect, upstanding people in the community? That they could certainly be trusted around young impressionable children? Then it came to me. What about the guy or gal who has never been caught? They would have no record and could easily slip under the wire. They could do their ""thing"" until they got caught and then they might have a police record that would flag them. But by then it could be too late.For instance, a 57-year-old San Luis Obispo (Calif.) man was arrested last month after police allegedly found images and videos of child pornography on his computers. The man was an administrative volunteer with a local youth football league for more than 15 years. While his volunteer position -- which has been revoked -- didn't require him to have interaction with children, I think this situation cuts the safety of the children dangerously close. The league stated that all prospective volunteers must submit a Live Scan application to the California Department of Justice for a background check and they are also checked against California's Megan's Law sexual offender registry. A message on the league's website said a Department of Justice background check did not uncover any previous criminal charges -- but this man is not someone you would want involved in your child's youth sports program.Here's another example whereby a background check would have shown no reason for concern from the Chicago Tribune. A 22-year-old volunteer middle school basketball coach in Naperville (Ill.) was charged with one count of aggravated criminal sexual abuse earlier this year. The report says that the school district does a background screening check through the Raptor system, which is used by more than 12,000 schools nationwide and screens driver's license information for registered sex offenders. Again, a background check only tells you someone's past behavior -- and only if they were caught!All of this can be disconcerting to a parent or concerned person. So what can be done, beyond doing background checks? Youth sports leagues have to put more emphasis on the whole screening process and background checks are just one part of that process. Our non-profit organization, the National Alliance for Youth Sports has produced a document called ""Background Screening in Youth Sports"" with guidelines to help leagues develop their own screening process. It's a free tool that parents or youth leagues can use to help identify and rid organizations of those who prey on children.If a league stops vetting potential volunteers after they receive a clear background check then they are doing an incomplete job. To be forewarned is to be forearmed."

Now, with a comeback on the horizon as his ninth studio album, ""Man Against Machine"" just went platinum, the 53-year-old singer opened up to People magazine about why he walked away from fame. ""People said, 'How could you walk away from music?' But being a dad -- there's nothing that can touch that,"" he told the magazine, explaining that he left the limelight to spend time with his three daughters from his first marriage, to Sandy Mahl.Brooks went from playing his biggest hits at sold-out stadiums to playing stay-at-home single dad. In 1999, he separated from Mahl and moved with his daughters into a small bunkhouse on his ranch in Oklahoma. It was a change the singer says took some getting used to. At first Brooks said he'd ""just stare"" at his kids, explaining, ""I knew their sweet faces and their dispositions. But I didn't know who they were."" Over time, the family adjusted, and Brooks even became a regular soccer dad. ""You start being a part of the community,"" he told the magazine. ""The dads across the soccer field looked at me as a dad just like them. And I was very grateful."" But these days, now that all of his children have graduated high school, he's dealing with empty-nest syndrome. Unlike most parents, however, he's keeping himself busy with a world tour with wife Trisha Yearwood. Last July, the singer announced his triumphant return to music with a three-year global tour and a new record deal with Sony Music Nashville.Touring with Yearwood has also helped with that transition. ""Thank God I'm with the love of my life,"" he said. ""That's why I know I'm right where I'm supposed to be."" For more with Garth Brooks, pick up a copy of People magazine on sale April 10.  "
5,BUSINESS,Developing Emotional Intelligence to Grow Your Family Business,"Daphne Mallory, ContributorAspiring Television Producer/Foundation Founder - daphnemallor...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/developing-emotional-intelligence-to-grow-your-family-business_b_7024390.html,Emotional intelligence (EQ) is our ability and capacity to manage emotions well in ourselves and in our relationships. What does this have to do with running a family business? Everything.,2015-04-08,Emotional shot of young man and woman crying to each other,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb31ee81f0000250123c30b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Daniel Goleman popularized the term Emotional Intelligence in his book Developing Emotional Intelligence. Intelligence quotient (IQ) refers to our ability to reason. Emotional intelligence (EQ) is our ability and capacity to manage emotions well in ourselves and in our relationships. What does this have to do with running a family business? Everything.Produce More and Perform WellYour emotional intelligence determines the productivity and performance of you and your team. IQ only accounts for 20 percent to 25 percent of growing a business. The rest has to do with EQ. Here's a secret: If you want to make more money, learn how to get work done through others. The problem is that other people have emotions, and sometimes negative emotions stops us from attaining our goals. For example, a father who does not develop and practice EQ with his teen daughter will have difficulty inspiring her to get work done in the family business if she feels alienated or undervalued. She may suffer through his leadership to get a paycheck or pay for college. That father can make a different choice and win her heart and mind, and in the process get better results. That's the difference that developing EQ makes. Reduce StressBuilding a business is stressful. Building a business with family can be even more stressful. Not knowing how to recognize and reduce stress in yourself and in your relationships can lead to disaster. For example, many moms experience stress when the responsibilities of business and family clash. You may find yourself making the choice between meeting deadlines and delaying social activities that are meaningful to your family. In some cases, you may feel pressured to prioritize a business deal, a media appearance, traveling, and meeting with a client to sign a purchase agreement or close a product sale over spending time with your spouse or children. Learning how to manage multiple projects, meet deadlines and achieve objectives and in the process reduce stress, is key to developing emotional intelligence.Form Constructive BeliefsYour beliefs are driving your emotions. Some beliefs are destructive and the result is a struggling or bankrupt family business. What's one belief that's holding your family back from being more and doing more? For example, do you believe that only wealthy families can succeed in family business? If you believe that to be true, then that belief will drive emotions rooted in doubt and disbelief. The result will be second guessing yourself everyday when making decisions, or not taking risks that can take your family and business to the next level. Recognizing that belief as destructive, you should change it to a constructive belief. You can choose to believe that all families, no matter what the current circumstances, can and do build successful businesses that last for generations to come. Take note of your destructive beliefs and find examples of families who defy them.Increase MotivationYour family and non-family members will help you build a better business if you motivate them to do so. As a leader, it's your responsibility to do what's in your power to motivate your people. By doing so, you inspire a higher level of emotional intelligence. You are not responsible for making people take charge of their lives, but you should give them a reason to act. What's the motivation for your family and others to support you in your business? Some families thrive on knowing that they are uplifting others out of poverty. Some families rally behind the hope that a new business will advance their family from middle class to rich. Some families are motivated by the opportunities to create or innovate. What's your motivation? Who shares your motivation?You could decide to ignore emotional intelligence and overemphasize the technical skills required to run your business. Many leaders do this daily, and lose good people in the process. Don't think that you will garner loyalty simply because you're related by blood. You'll keep your family engaged in family business when you lead with emotional intelligence."

Taylor, Dr. William A. Jones, and Dr. H. Beecher Hicks, Jr.The sun comes up slowly on the banks of Louisiana's bayou's. Lazy mornings mark the arrival of day even as moss covered trees swing sweetly in the hot and steamy breeze. No one took note in the eighteenth year of the twentieth century that a Baptist preacher had come to birth. Such events are not noteworthy. What is noteworthy, however, is that in Baker, Louisiana, in a church college called Leland, Gardner Taylor learned lessons of communication and critical thought. As a result, that engagement of learning produced thousands of sermons that would not only bring generations to conversion but would set high the standard for thoughtful preachers to follow.What does it take to become a preacher? Is it enough to be absorbed in biblical studies or is it required to preach a word that is so tailored that it meets the expectations of various cultures? In order to be a preacher of whom the world would take note is it necessary to be a craftsman of words, one given to complex theological thought, or should one seek to be a highly marketable agent of the mega-church, able to dazzle audiences in a technological, multi-media society?You had only to meet him to know that authentic preaching requires none of that. A winsome smile and a halting gait would draw your attention. No matter his age, glasses were unnecessary. His Bible was small and worn. How could anyone read from a print so small? Somehow he lived with the romance of words and ideas. His home was as much seminary as sanctuary. He was as comfortable at Yale delivering the Lyman Beecher Lectures as he was in a local storefront profoundly proclaiming the Word of God he so dearly loved. His whole mind lived at the intersection of instinct and intelligence. His gift was in simplicity. His gift was to clearly peek within the pages of scriptural writ to see and to sense what the average mind would pass by. His gift was to hide himself behind the cross so that the glory of God could be seen. Typically no manuscript, no scribbled notes -- his sermonic offerings had been written on the tablet of his heart, left open and pure for all the world to see. His was a divine proclamation with a human accent that even the most severe of critics could not escape or deny.You had to hear him to be swept up by the magnificence of his gifts. I was seated one day in an upper balcony at the Convention Center in Kansas City, Missouri to hear him preach for the Progressive National Baptist Convention. Everyone around me was leaning forward so as not to miss a word. His sermon was modestly titled: ""The Divine Boast."" It was a simple yet profound analysis of the words of Christ: ""I am the way, the truth and the life"" (John 14:6). And my God, how he preached. He preached until it seemed angels bowed low to hear. And then we heard him say, in that God-kissed moment, with the slightest tremble in his voice, he said it was as though he could ""feel the mists of Jordan"" spraying in his face. Such words, such feeling, such faith. Is it any wonder that a shout shuddered up from that moment that could hardly be contained?He was called from the Bayou's to Brooklyn. There God placed him for generations of his ministry. The Concord Church was the beneficiary of a preaching grace that shall long be remembered. They called him the ""Dean of Preachers."" They called him the ""Prince of Preachers."" I suspect God just called him ""Gardner"" and then called him home on Resurrection Sunday Morning, there to be at home with his preaching friends that preceded him so many years ago. In his last days, Dr. Taylor questioned why God kept him here so long. Dr. Sandy Ray, Dr. Marshall Shepherd, Dr. William Augustus Jones, and so many others had left him behind. The strength of his body gone, his friends departed, no longer able to preach; to what purpose had God delayed his departure? I suspect that in the mind of God, Gardner Calvin Taylor deserved a Valedictory March; so God let him climb the stairway to heaven alone. He needed no traveling company. After all, ""None can walk up there, but the pure in heart."" I can only imagine the splendor of that reunion. ""Dr. Taylor, come take your seat. There's someOne over here just waiting to welcome you home. 'Well done thou God and faithful servant...enter thou into the joy of thy Lord (Matthew 25:21).'"""

And here I am trying to jot down some ideas about advice I'd give to other women in tech. I'm pretty sure my entire professional life (ok, personal life too) has been a series of imperfections and ambitions that have led me to where I am now. And aside from general exhaustion and sporadic meltdowns, I wouldn't have it any other way. Much of today's advice for professional women comes from the Sheryl Sandbergs of the world who've found success without missing a stride. But my journey, like many of ours, has not been as perfect. And that's OK too -- success and perfection don't have to be synonymous. My path has led me on all sorts of journeys, from college flunky to graduate degree, from barely taking care of myself to wife and mom of two, and from bartender to corporate executive. At Zillow we have a culture of not being afraid to fail, as long as we fail fast and learn from it. This is a perfect fit for me. While I feel a bit self-conscious claiming to have my act together enough to give advice to others, I have come up with a list of guiding principles. Some cliché, but I think all true. Be yourself. And don't take yourself too seriously. You have a long career ahead of you. Spending that time pretending to be different than you are is exhausting and rarely sustainable. I have no poker face and say pretty much everything I'm thinking. I am ""bossy"" and I show my emotions and laugh at inappropriate times. I've had babies (almost on the floor of my office) and I tell mundane stories about them. I often go against the grain and take the path less traveled, or maybe even the one less recommended. But I've still had a healthy career progression, and feel respected and appreciated by my peers, managers, and reports.I attribute that to doing good work, being at a great company, hiring amazing people, and also the fact that I don't take myself too seriously. If you're able to laugh at yourself and recognize your own imperfections, it makes the heated argument you've just had with half the room easier to stomach. We're all just humans trying to get stuff done - let's be who we are and try to laugh it off. Have an outlet It's so important to fill some of your time with something that inspires and recharges you (even if you're squeezing that time out of thin air). For me it's aerial acrobatics, which gives me both a physical and creative outlet. Do I have time to go spin in the air before work? Not really. But am I going to make it happen anyway? Absolutely. This is the one time of the day where I don't feel like an exhausted mom, productive employee, or any other roles or responsibilities that I've committed to - I feel strong, free-spirited and inspired. I completely recommend finding an outlet to escape to (bonus points if it involves wearing rad unitards).  Do it all... if you want to ""Doing it all"" is relative, and not everyone thrives off of juggling 87 balls in the air at once. It doesn't matter how much you do, what matters is that you are doing all of the things that are really important to you. Want to pour yourself into your career? Do it. Want to have babies? Great! Want to moonlight as a go-go dancer? Why not (just don't put it on LinkedIn). I'm more in the 87 things camp, and I won't pretend that I'm not quivering over a bottle of red wine at the end of some weeks, but I feel fulfilled. You decide how many or what roles you want to fill your life with. Make lists (how meta -- a list about making lists!) Due to the aforementioned too-many-things-on-my-plate lifestyle, along with the short-term memory loss that comes from baby-induced sleep deprivation, I survive off of lists. These are ""To Do"" lists and ""To Think About"" lists for everything that needs follow-up. I check them often, and organize my day around short-term goals. I also have long-term lists... not necessarily written down, but in my head (my long-term memory is still mostly intact). You've probably heard that you can do anything as long as you visualize it and believe that it's possible. Well, it's totally true. My husband once described me by saying, ""she doesn't know what's not possible,"" and I think that mentality is the reason I've accomplished what I have. I will give the disclaimer that I've lived a relatively easy life and haven't had a fraction of the real obstacles that many people face. But I do believe that setting your mind to something - making a long-term list of what you want to have happen - is the best step towards realizing it. Love. I definitely don't claim to have the meaning of life figured out, but I have a strong hunch that it's all about love. If you surround yourself with love, and feel grateful for it, I'm pretty sure you won't have too many regrets at the end of the day. So, find a job you love. Work at a company that you love. Go home to people that you love. Some of my dearest friends are coworkers, and that makes it 100 times more fun to get up and go into work every morning. And I deeply love my husband, children and friends... and they love me back, imperfections and all. Originally published on Seattle Girl Geek Dinners Blog"

(AP Photo ),https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb6730c240000510098478c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Of the many tributes to Billie Holiday's 100th birthday today (April 7), the most compelling I've heard is Cassandra Wilson's Sony Legacy album Coming Forth By Day, a strange, atmospheric brew produced by Nick Launay (whose credits include music by Nick Cave and Arcade Fire) with shimmering string arrangements by the incomparable Van Dyke Parks. The record manages to evoke Holiday's sad, beautiful spirit -- she died in 1959 -- without sounding remotely like her.Coming Forth features a profound take on ""Crazy He Calls Me,"" a song first recorded by Holiday in October 1949, shortly after my father, Carl Sigman, and his collaborator, Bob Russell, finished writing it. I was born just a couple of months before its release as a single, so I've always considered it the ""Crazy"" sister I never had. Wilson's interpretation, which clocks in at a leisurely 6.18, is a fine new outfit for my sister to wear to a centennial celebration.""Crazy"" had a longer gestation period than most offspring. Carl and Bob penned most of it before WWII. But they couldn't come up with the right lyric for the bridge -- the B in the standard AABA construction of so many pop songs. When the U.S. joined the war effort, the writers tabled their struggle in favor of a more important one.After the war, Carl met and married Eleanor ""Terry"" Berkowitz, Louis Prima's young Gal Friday. Neither had ever been farther west than New Jersey, so they hopped a train to L.A. for an extended honeymoon.During that sojourn, they spent many hours at Bob and his wife Hannah Russell's Burbank home, where they ate, drank and played Charades. But Bob was obsessed with finishing ""Crazy,"" and when the socializing ended, the lyrical agonistes began.Still bridge-less and at their wit's end after one grueling all-nighter, inspiration struck Carl in the form of a ghostly sign that suddenly hovered above him. This was no celestial command; Carl had nothing but disdain for the supernatural. It was a sign he'd seen for years on the wall of the Army mess hall. ""The difficult I'll do right now/The impossible will take a little while"" was supposed to inspire spud-peeling GIs; it happened also to go hand in glove with the melodic bridge of ""Crazy.""Billie Holiday's version of ""Crazy He Calls Me"" is definitive. As the song matured to what some used to call ""retirement age,"" it's been covered by hundreds if not thousands of artists including Linda Ronstadt, Dinah Washington, Aretha Franklin, Natalie Cole and -- as ""Crazy She Calls Me"" -- Rod Stewart, Sam Cooke, Nat King Cole and Tony Bennett. Audra MacDonald won a record sixth Tony Award when she sang ""Crazy"" and other Holiday songs in Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill, an uncanny channeling of Billie at Manhattan's Circle in the Square Theater last year.Billie's recording of ""Crazy"" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2010. Industry vet Bob Merlis, who submitted the nomination, says, ""I've been taken by this song for a long time, and Billie Holliday's reading of it is the very definition of 'singular'.... Nobody else comes close. What has long intrigued me is the grammatical construction of the title. It seems like a transliteration of something said in Yiddish. I mean, it's unusual to put it in the order it's in; it would be more standard to have said or written 'He calls me crazy' but the poetry of it lies in the very fact it's backwards. If not Yiddish, maybe Shakespearean and, most certainly, wonderfully poetic.""The crazy order of words in the title comes full circle in the lyric's final phrase. After the singer acknowledges her sublime craziness -- ""Sure I'm Crazy"" -- she closes with, ""Crazy in love am I.""I was barely three months old when ""Crazy"" came into the world. Call her crazy, but my mom says that the instant I heard the opening notes of Billie's recording, I did the impossible: leaping over the walls of my crib, I landed squarely on the piano bench and welcomed my new sister into the world by tickling the ivories like the Duke and singing along in perfect three-part harmony.(Portions of this blog appeared in a posting last June.)"

As Duke cut down the nets, Gray was mowing down Rangers left and right, accomplishing a feat that has not been done in 62 years, according to ESPN Stats & Info. His final line for the game: 8.0 innings pitched, 1 hit, 0 earned runs, 3 strikeouts, 1 walk, 0.25 WHIP. Not too bad, huh?This stellar outing had more significance than you may originally think, however. First, it snapped a 10-game Opening Day losing streak by the A's, which was impressively bad. Secondly, it was the longest no-hit bid of his career to date, and showed an immediate sharpness out of the gates -- which is a positive, since there were only a handful of starters who didn't show much rust in their first start of the year. To delve deeper into his numbers, it's important to realize exactly how efficient he was. According to ESPN Stats & Info, Gray threw 66 of 98 pitches for strikes, including 15 of 18 curveballs. It was noted that Gray only threw that many curveballs for strikes twice in 2014. The importance for locating pitches is paramount in the majors. The best hitters in the world (like Adrian Beltre and Prince Fielder, who were stifled by Gray on Monday) eat pitchers alive when they leave balls over the fat part of the plate or when they fall behind in counts. Oakland's ace made sure he hit the corners, stayed ahead in the count (as indicated by his 67.3 percent strike rate), and trusted his stuff from the first pitch all the way to his 98th at the end of the 8th inning of work. Gray looks to improve upon a solid 2014 campaign in which he went 14-10 with a 3.08 ERA, 1.19 WHIP, and 183 Ks in 219.0 innings pitched. If you're a fantasy owner or play daily fantasy sports, make sure to pencil Gray in against the Rangers. Dating back to last season, he hasn't allowed a single run against Texas in 18 consecutive innings.The 25-year old is slated to take the mound on Saturday at home against a revitalized Mariners squad that features Robinson Cano and Nelson Cruz in the middle of the order. Let's see if he can continue on his historic Opening Day outing! Where do you rank Gray among American League pitchers? Below are my current rankings (keep in mind, I included Chris Sale, who is currently on the DL): 1. Felix Hernandez (Mariners) 2. David Price (Tigers) 3. Chris Sale (White Sox) 4.

These formed the project that brought Diego Rivera, one of the three best known Mexican muralists, to Detroit in April 1932, accompanied by his much younger wife, Frida Kahlo, also an artist. Over the next 11 months, Rivera researched, designed and painted the frescoes that cover the four vaulting walls of the museum's courtyard, now known as the Rivera Court. It features heroic scenes of muscular workers and even more idealized earth mothers grasping sheaths of wheat or armloads of fruit. Frida Kahlo's time in Detroit was painful and, from a visual perspective, his work has nothing to do with the monumentality of his husband's masterpiece. When she arrived, she was well along in synthesizing the influences of Mexican folk art and surrealism into a mature vision. But in many ways, the miscarriage she suffered while in Detroit spurred the searing form of self-representation that is her contribution to art history. This miscarriage was the second physical trauma of her fraught, intensely creative life, the first being a near-fatal traffic accident in Mexico City in 1925, which caused her continual pain for the remainder of her life and severely reduced her chances of having children.

That is why Roberta Smith is right to point out in her New York Times piece that ""the 70 works included in the show form a kind of contest between a hefty hare and tiny tortoise. Rivera takes up most of the room -- as, tall and bulky, he did in real life -- but Kahlo emerges in the final galleries as the stronger, more personal and more original artist."" However, I wonder whether this is a fair assessment of the showing. Do we need a show to know that Frida Kahlo's works are more personal? Is it better art because is more personal? Is it relevant to show a political artist along an existential surrealist? It is as if contemporary taste privileged that inversion of the low over the high where the underdog or the ""small"" and ""flawed"" becomes ""art.""Something similar happens with Basquiat's show at the Brooklyn Museum, which is built around 160 pages from eight notebooks in the collection of Larry Warsh. The show holds no startling revelations -- the notebooks are ""unknown"" only in the most literal sense that they have never been exhibited before. But they confirm the centrality of language and hand lettering to Basquiat's art in new detail. Organised by Dieter Buchhart, an independent curator and Basquiat specialist working with Tricia Laughlin Bloom, a curator at the museum until December, this show displays the notebook drawings in long rows in low-slung vitrines or on the walls, are supplemented by about 30 other works: drawings of several kinds (including a fabulous one involving a triangle filled with words and symbols, 10 feet across) and a handful of works on canvas that demonstrate how language was carried over into painting. Basquiat began by collaging canvases with scores of drawings or color photocopies of them, and then adding larger images, like the black mask-skull on an untitled work from 1982-83, a griot surrounded by a swarm of words.The show considers that Basquiat's decision not to write or draw on the backs of the pages automatically transforms them into autonomous works of art. To make things even worse, in the exhibition's catalogue, Buchhart considers this ""notes-cum-drawings-cum-artworks"" as examples of ""concrete art."" I understand his scholarly excitement when working with the notebooks of his favorite artist.

Well, while it's a heart-sinking feeling, it's not a matter of life and death. Except for your cell phone battery, anyway. But when it comes to matters of life, death, and just general safety on vacation, some of the smallest investments can reap the greatest rewards.To help you spend and pack wisely, we've put together a list of 12 travel accessories under $10 that will absolutely save your bacon -- because no bacon should ever be squandered.More: 10 Travel Hacks That'll Make Any Trip Easier Credit: Sarah Anderson/ThrillistRubber door stop Price: $9.87 Yes, those little things you see propping doors open all the time. Consider this: something used to hold a door open might be just as good at holding it closed. Then consider that not all hotel rooms (particularly ones without electronic keycards) are as secure as your bedroom back home. Lastly, consider what might happen if an intruder -- say, some creep who saw you at the hotel bar -- picked their way into your room while you're asleep. Even if an ill-intentioned weirdo never actually tries to sneak into your room, the peace of mind these things offer is well worth the price.

A good multi-tool, like the Leatherman Wave can set you back upwards of $80, but there's no need to spend that much if all you're after is a portable solution. Keychain multi-tools come equipped with pliers, screwdrivers, scissors, and pretty much everything the full-sized versions have, except in a smaller package. If you'd rather have something you can keep in your carry-on, the TSA-compliant Gerber Shard (pictured above) gives you two screwdrivers, a pry bar, and a bottle opener -- all on a keychain that won't fill up your pocket.

They're also a great cheap option for keeping smaller items separate from the rest of the crap inside your carry-on, so you're not forced to root around in there for your ChapStick like a lady with a purse.

That's where QuikClot comes in: this military-grade, chemically treated gauze acts as a hemostatic agent, speeding up the clotting process and ensuring that you don't bleed out before you can get to a hospital. Are the odds SUPER remote that you'll need this level of emergency medical care? Yes. Should you absolutely drop $10 on it just in case? Also yes.

Doing so makes your wallet approximately 83 times harder to pull from your pocket, both for the prospective thieves and for you.Granted, a suitably skilled pickpocket can probably snatch your wallet regardless of how many rubber bands you've wrapped it in. There are some things you can't entirely prevent -- but taking proper precautions puts the bullseye on some other mark.

(AP Photo/Katy Winn)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5c66a1f00002501248062.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"REUTERS — A federal appeals court on Tuesday said Larry Flynt, the publisher of Hustler magazine, had a right to weigh in on two lawsuits challenging how Missouri conducts executions.The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis said a lower court judge applied the wrong legal standard in finding that Flynt's ""generalized interest"" in the litigation did not justify his being allowed to pursue sealed court records.Sixteen media outlets and interest groups, including the New York Times, the Washington Post, Politico and Public Citizen, supported the appeal of Flynt, who was paralyzed in a 1978 shooting.Eric Slusher, a spokesman for Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster, said that office was reviewing the decision.Flynt was seeking to intervene in two cases in which death row inmates are challenging the constitutionality of Missouri executions, including the protocol for administering drugs.Invoking the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, Flynt said he had a right to review various sealed records, in part to identify an anesthesiologist working for the state.Flynt claimed an interest as a publisher and death penalty opponent, and also because Joseph Franklin, who had confessed to shooting him in 1978, was a plaintiff in both cases.Missouri executed Franklin for another killing in November 2013.The 8th Circuit returned the case to the federal court in Jefferson City, Missouri, to decide whether to grant Flynt's bid to unseal the records, which is not the same as intervening.Tony Rothert, a lawyer for Flynt and legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri, said he was pleased with the decision.""The public and the media have a right to know what's happening in the courts,"" Rothert said in a phone interview. ""There has also been concern in Missouri about the lack of transparency concerning drugs used in executions, and the public has a right to know what's going on.""

Miller, who was jailed 85 days for refusing to reveal the source who disclosed the identity of undercover CIA agent Valerie Plame, received the First Amendment Award from the group before taking part in a panel discussion titled 'The Reporter's Privilege Under Siege.' (Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5c66a200000300000de58.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Judith Miller recently popped out of the Fox News bubble for a quick jaunt to the Wall Street Journal editorial page, the home base for John Bolton, Max Boot, and other neo-con hawks, to give her forthcoming book a little free advertising. In the process she attempts to whitewash her role as an influential pro-war voice in the lead-up to the Iraq War. Her April 3, 2015 statement predictably follows the same party line as Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Tony Blair, and George W. Bush. She strongly defends herself against those who claim her reportage in the run-up to the war consciously fanned the flames of pro-war sentiment prior to the start of ""shock and awe"" on March 19, 2003. She claims she was a victim of faulty intelligence and ""everybody"" got it wrong about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. So why single her out? Judith Miller wasn't alone of course. She had a lot of help from other stenographers like her co-author Michael Gordon (who continues to be a Pentagon spokesman posing as a ""journalist"" who has been recently pumping up the volume on Russia's ""aggression"" in Crimea). In 2002-03, running in the same ""public intellectual"" circles as Miller, was the late Christopher Hitchens who tirelessly traversed the country offering up every convincing-sounding argument in favor of toppling the government in Baghdad while willingly neutering his formidable intellect when it came to any possible downside to launching aggressive war in the heart of the Arab world. The Canadian scholar and politician Michael Ignatieff penned a highly influential article for The New York Times Magazine titled ""The Burden,"" where he eagerly demanded a renewed Pax Americana and called for an unapologetic and rejuvenated U.S. imperialism.But what sets Judith Miller apart was the timing of her report of September 8, 2002 based on anonymous sources, which gave the appearance of independently verifying what Bush, Rummy, and Cheney and the rest of the warmongers were saying every day: there was ""no doubt"" that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and they were a direct threat to U.S. ""national security."" Worse still, Cheney, Colin Powell, Condi Rice, and other Bush Administration conduits hit the Sunday talk show circuit where they all cited Miller (and Gordon's) reporting from The New York Times (the supposed bastion of ""liberal"" opinion and the paper of record) as corroborating their elaborate lies about the existence of WMD in Iraq.The timing of Miller's reporting, her generous and sloppy use of anonymous sources, her skewing of her ""facts"" toward the most alarming and scary conclusions, her prominent perch at the nation's preeminent ""liberal"" newspaper that reinforced the lies of a right-wing Republican government, and the multiple references to her work from Cheney, Powell, Rice and others, all came together to make Judith Miller's ""journalism"" absolutely pivotal in selling the Iraq War to a somewhat skeptical public. Miller's (and Gordon's) reportage from September 2002 all the way to the launch of the war in March 2003 relied on layers of bullshit that Ahmed Chalabi, ""curve ball,"" and other dubious ""CIA assets"" and Bush Administration tools had fed to them while hiding behind a veil of anonymity. So egregious was Miller's coverage of the WMD issue that the editors of The New York Times had to run a half-hearted retraction of her bogus (and in Iraq horrifically consequential) reportage. The late Tony Judt recalled the atmosphere in elite opinion circles for those who raised criticisms of Miller's certitude on the WMD issue. Miller had become a darling of polite society and the resident ""expert"" on all things Middle East and Arab.""The last time I saw Judy Miller was at a sort of dinner debate in the Hamptons in ... mid-2002 attended by George Soros, prominent journalists, and some other public figures. I spoke about Iraq, at what was then an early stage of the run-up to the Iraq War. Judy Miller put me down in the most contemptuous and categorical way. She was the expert, and I was a chattering academic. ... Then things became rather personal; I tried to respond and a number of people stood up and said in essence, 'how can you possibly disagree with Judith Miller?' She has the authority, she has the knowledge and she has the inside sources. ... What was really worrying was that this was a dinner gathering of powerful people: high in the directorate of The New York Times, senior producers from public television and others besides. Not one had the courage to support me. In those days Miller was untouchable."" (Tony Judt, Thinking the Twentieth Century, 2012, pp. 315-16)Judith Miller's self-promoting column inches in the Wall Street Journal raises a few questions: Why didn't she come out earlier with this full-throated defense of her bogus reportage from 2002-03? Why did she end up as a pro-war ""analyst"" for Fox News during the most violent period of the United States' eight-year war in Iraq only to emerge now whining about how she had been duped? Why did she voice support for the war throughout the long eight-year slog if she really felt burned by the WMD experience? Why at this late date is she trying to create a false historical narrative of her own well-known role as a journalistic shill for the Bush Administration?She never reported on the forces lining up in favor of destroying Iraq that might have had their own ulterior motives. She never raised any caveats or entertained in print any of the possible consequences that a U.S. war of aggression against Iraq might unleash in that country or in the wider Middle East. Over the course of the last eleven years she never once acknowledged her own importance in the run-up to the war as a ""liberal"" voice in furthering the neo-cons' global ambitions, or how she became such a palatable figure among war-mongering policy elites.It's predictable that Miller would present a whiny, yet full-throated defense of her ""journalism""; but it's a decade too late. Judith Miller has shown with this piece that she is as self-reflective as Cheney or Rumsfeld. She still seems oblivious to her role as a key propagandist for the most disastrous U.S. foreign policy action so far in 21st Century.More disturbingly, she hasn't written a word about what the United States did to the Iraqi people. She chooses to remain willfully ignorant of L. Paul Bremer's catastrophic ""Orders"" that sent packing the Sunni technocratic class and opened the door for the crazies of the Islamic State. She chooses not to reflect on the meaning of the Downing Street Memo of July 23, 2002 or Justice Robert Jackson's definition of ""aggressive war"" during the Nuremberg Trials as the ""supreme war crime"" because all of the attendant evils follow the initial act of aggression. She supported aggressive war in Iraq and she, like Ignatieff and others, must live with the results of that morally bankrupt stand. Like Cheney or Rumsfeld, Miller seems impervious to the mass murder her war unleashed in Iraq. All the car bombs, the suicide bombs, the IEDs, the sectarian killings, the massacres, the photos of torture at Abu Ghraib, the use of power drills in interrogations, the rise of ISIL and their depravity, the beheadings of foreigners on YouTube, and so on, I suppose just elude Miller's moral radar.Miller knows her audience. It's the same elderly white folks who snap up Bill O'Reilly's pulp nonfiction and are now denouncing President Barack Obama as Neville Chamberlain for negotiating with the Iranians instead of launching another illegal war. It's a shame. Someone of her stature offering a truly heart-felt apology might have moved the needle slightly in the direction of peace rather than war as the desired aim of American foreign policy.But we'll never know because like everything else from the George W. Bush years we learn no definitive historical lessons, just ""debates"" about whether Obama is ""appeasing"" Iran and how sweet it would be to bomb instead. Remarkably, despite getting wrong the most important story in the last thirty years above the fold in The New York Times, Miller apparently still thinks of herself as a kind of Edward R. Murrow figure. I wish we could bottle whatever essence gives her such an overpowering sense of self-esteem. In Miller's world she is the victim, the one who was wronged by something she calls ""the left."" Poor Judy, she's unaware that her self-serving bullshit last week only reconfirms (albeit in a backhanded way) that ""the left"" was correct all along about the Iraq War and that she got it dead wrong."

It certainly is time for a Latino candidate, especially a senator who understands the immigrant experience (considering that you are from Canada), to throw their hat into the ring. Our community needs a candidate who understands the challenges faced by Hispanic Americans, someone who will seriously address Latino concerns on the national level, someone who will highlight and fight for our priorities on the most prominent political stage there is. So we are anxious to see your Latino community platform evolve.That said, at least you understand just how high the stakes will be in the 2016 elections and the issues that are most important to us. ""The whole world is on fire,"" you told an audience recently. That's correct: The world is warming daily as climate change increases to unprecedented levels. 2014 was the warmest year since we started keeping records on that sort of thing; California is set to run out of water in three years; and a more chaotic climate impacts Latinos, who, surveys show, are more worried about climate change and support environmental regulation initiatives more than any other group in America. It's good to know that you have decided to be with the community when it comes to recognizing our world is warming -- unless you still shy away from confronting the threat of climate change and continue to deny it.You're also correct to highlight our still-troubled economy. Without a doubt, the current economy is not doing much to benefit Latino families. Even though the economy added 295,000 jobs this February, very few of those new jobs went to Latinos -- unless you count low-wage jobs in the food and service industries. Latino men make 77 cents for every dollar made by the average American, with Hispanic women having it even worse, at a mere 68 cents on that dollar. Latinos also face a higher unemployment rate than the national average. We look forward to your proposal to address the inequities faced by Latino workers, and your proposal to deal with continued unemployment and underemployment in the Hispanic community.We were somewhat confused when you proposed eliminating the Affordable Care Act, or ""Obamacare."" After all, as recently as 2013, around a quarter of the country's uninsured population were Latino. Since the law went into effect, 2.6 million Latinos have gained access to affordable health care. But you already know that, since you're now one of those millions of Latinos covered through Obamacare. Still, far too many Latinos lack healthcare coverage. We're interested in hearing your alternative solution to this top Hispanic priority. Perhaps you are thinking of a single-payer healthcare system, in which the government offers affordable health care to all its citizens? Senator, we may not always see eye-to-eye when it comes to policy, but we do know that your words always ring with a sense of urgency and passion. Now how about taking that same fiery fervor and championing causes that truly empower the Latino community? How about stepping back from your current priorities -- assaulting the social safety net, providing tax breaks for the rich, dismantling affordable health care, preventing immigrant children from receiving an education, denying climate change, and attacking LGBT equality -- and instead using your tireless zeal to seriously confront the plight of Latinos in America? That's not too much to ask from a Latino presidential contender.Joe Velasquez Executive Director, NCLR Action FundThis post was originally published on The Hill's Congress Blog."

Now for the first time in 11 years the Grammy Award-winning star is back with a new album called You Gotta Love the Life, which reflects how she feels about the turbulent industry she has survived in for over 40 years. ""This walk just takes a lot of courage because your artistic talent is just the point of focus that gets you to the starting gate,"" Manchester said. ""Then you have to embrace this insecure version of normal. It doesn't work for everybody.""Unlike her previous albums, You Gotta Love the Life was not recorded with a major record label, but independently with crowdfunding, something her students at the University of Southern California's Thornton College of Music introduced to her. Manchester took the plunge and launched an Indiegogo campaign that raised the finances to bring a mixture of original tunes -- some featuring guest stars like Dionne Warwick, Stevie Wonder and Al Jarreau -- and remakes of classics to life. A good portion of the money came from ""Fanchesters,"" a nickname Manchester's daughter came up with to describe her mother's loyal fans. Many of those Fanchesters will surely join Manchester when she travels around the country on a mini tour to perform new songs and old favorites like ""Don't Cry Out Loud.""Since she was a child growing up in New York, Manchester understood the level of perseverance it took to succeed as a creative being. Her father was a bassoonist for the New York Metropolitan Opera and her mother was a designer with her own clothing line. Manchester began as a jingle singer and at one session she met Barry Manilow who introduced her to Bette Midler. As Manchester recalled in People in 1980, Midler asked her if she'd like to sing in back of her. She responded, ""No, I'd like to sing instead of you!"" Needless to say she got the gig and became one of Midler's original Harlettes. Soon after her solo career took off. Manchester realizes how much she's grown and believes she's found ""the balance between emotion and strength."" ""Sometimes that's a woman's issue specifically because we are wives, mothers, daughters and we're always taking care of other people, and we forget to take care of ourselves,"" Manchester said. ""But, this is neither a woman's issue or man's issue. We have to take care of ourselves and check in with ourselves to see how we're doing.""There was never a plan B for Manchester. She always knew she wanted to be a singer and songwriter and continues to find ways to express herself. She's already planning her next album, working on a musical, touring, and trying to think of the first sentence to write to spark the inspiration for a memoir. ""I really want to know what my part is and what I was supposed to learn in this life,"" she said.

There probably are more religious believers than Communist Party members. The government is unsure how to respond.Beijing's sensitivities to religion are well-known. It sees religion as offering a competitive world view to the Party. The latter fears many Christians, especially Catholics, have loyalties beyond China's borders. Religion brings people together in ways that might eventually influence politics.In its early days the People's Republic of China responded harshly to religious activity, but official policy has moderated over time. There is an increasing amount of reluctant toleration of religious belief. However, there isn't one national approach. The treatment of religious believers varies regionally. For instance, of late the authorities in Wenzhou, sometimes called the Jerusalem of China, have enforced more restrictions than have many other cities and provinces.In contrast, Beijing appears to have a more relaxed policy. Last year I visited a church of around 800 in the capital. It operated openly, attracted many young people, and hosted dozens of baptisms on the Sunday I attended. I saw a car in traffic that sported the traditional Christian ""fish."" A friend of mine who lives in Beijing talked of hearing Christian Christmas music in malls and seeing people carry Bibles in public.Ironically, the lesson of the West's experience with religion is that the best way for a government to avoid conflict between religious believers and political authorities is to provide the greatest freedom possible. Left alone, Christians, in particular, are unlikely to challenge the political authorities.Obviously there have been many strains of Christianity throughout the centuries. However, the faith emphasizes a transcendent commitment to God while accommodating many different political perspectives. Jesus explicitly separated what is owed to God and to Caesar.The Apostle Paul, whose ministry benefited from the order imposed by the Roman Empire, urged submission to the ruling authorities. There were exceptions, however, most obviously when secular rulers sought to impede the exercise of faith.For instance, when the Jewish leadership in the Sanhedrin instructed the Apostles Peter and John to no longer preach about Jesus' death and resurrection, they responded that they had to obey God rather than men: ""we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard."" The original disciples and their followers persevered despite episodic persecution. Indeed, the violent response by the Jewish authorities encouraged Paul to take his ministry to the Gentiles in the Roman world beyond.Ironically, the Romans found Christians to be good citizens, with little interest in upsetting the settled order. Indeed, the latter's commitment to better living today and belief in heavenly rewards tomorrow caused Christians to ameliorate some of the social problems evident in the ancient world. Only when more abusive emperors demanded to be worshiped as gods did Christians resist, often at the cost of their lives.Contra the empire's expectations, persecution did not extinguish religious faith. Rather, Christianity grew under pressure. No one claimed allegiance to Jesus to get ahead. The willingness of believers to endure provided dramatic evidence of the strength of their beliefs.As Christianity became the majority faith in the West, the faithful began to play a much larger political role. But in general they sought to shape, not overturn, the political order. And their greatest concern always was the status of their faith, both individually and communally. The worst battles between religious and civil powers occurred when the latter sought to exercise spiritual authority. The PRC doesn't easily fit into the Western experience. However, one lesson clearly applies. The best way to minimize political confrontations between church and state is to reduce government restraints on religion. Christians have no unified view of politics, and that is as true in China as in America. But believers everywhere agree on the importance of being allowed to worship God. Interfering with the ability of people to live their faith guarantees -- indeed requires -- resistance. That certainly applies to closure of churches. It also results from lesser restrictions, such as tearing down crosses and steeples. Whatever the government's objectives, the impact will be social conflict. Believers will perceive the state to be challenging their core faith and will feel forced to demonstrate that their primary loyalty is to God rather than government. It is a battle which the Party cannot win. For years Christianity's growth was concentrated in rural areas, but recently has spread to the cities and reached a better-educated population. Based on existing growth rates there could be nearly 250 million Christians in China by 2030. Even if the government successfully suppressed public worship, it could not eliminate private belief. Merely attempting to do so would generate anger and resentment. And resistance.The Party hopes to make Christianity conform to China. Gu Mengfei of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, which represents legal Protestant churches, explained that Beijing desired to ""encourage more believers to make contributions to the country's harmonious social progress, cultural prosperity and economic development.""Such harmony is best achieved by eliminating the greatest source of potential conflict, barriers to religious practice. Chinese Christians with whom I have talked want to make their country a better place, not take political control. They are interested in social peace. In fact, last year Pope Francis visited East Asia and proposed a dialogue with Beijing. He said that the Catholic Church ""only asks to have freedom to do its work. No other conditions."" Apparently as in most Western countries. When its freedom to practice is protected, the Catholic Church is not a revolutionary force. To the contrary, in much of the world it is one of the most important advocates for social stability -- or ""harmonious social progress.""The CCP may be learning. Last month Bishop Paul Meng Qinglu of the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association reported that Beijing had ordered the end to Zhejiang Province's campaign against churches. He explained, ""Church leaders across China had complained about the demolitions over the past year.""China increasingly is influencing Asia and the world. But the PRC in turn will be influenced by developments within. One of those is the growth of religion. For its own sake the government would best respond in a way that does not force believers to resist politically.This post first appeared at China-US Focus."
