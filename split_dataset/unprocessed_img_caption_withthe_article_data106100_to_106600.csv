0,WORLDPOST,Jobs: What the Middle East Needs,"Rabea Ataya, ContributorFounding CEO of Bayt.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jobs-what-the-middle-east_b_6083126.html,"In a time of monumental change in the MENA region, people continue to seek hope through better opportunity.",2014-10-31,"CAIRO, EGYPT - JUNE 02: Islamic students study in the al Azhar mosque before heading into exams at the associated al Azhar University, the chief centre of Arabic literature and Sunni Islamic learning in the world, on June 2, 2009 in Cairo, Egypt. The Egyptian capital is preparing to receive US President Barack Obama, who is due to deliver his Middle East policy speech at Cairo University this Thursday.

While all these are serious threats, at their root is the massive unemployment problem of a growing youth population. The MENA region is a particularly young place, with youth constituting more than 40% of the total adult population. This young population is also characterized by the highest unemployment rate in the world.As the Arab Spring has shown, high levels of unemployment, especially among the youth, generate a predictable cycle of frustration, social unrest, and political instability. Add a little agitation and throw in some arms and you have a full-blown disaster on your hands.When we surveyed working people born between 1980 and 1996 about their priorities in life in the Bayt.com ""Millennials in the Middle East"" survey (February 2014), the overwhelming response was what you would expect from young people anywhere in the world. They want financial stability, good health, and successful careers. Unfortunately, the same survey also showed the gap between these hopes and reality: 59% rely on their family for supplementary income; and 28% say that they find it difficult to make ends meet. Furthermore, 79% say that the foremost challenge of their generation is finding a job (Bayt.com ""Fresh Graduates in the MENA,"" July 2014). The solution is neither surgical strikes, nor invasions, nor divisive propaganda. All these add fuel to fire. They deprive people of even more jobs, strip away hope, and push people to potentially non-rational and destructive paths. Job creation is the solution. With jobs come dignity, stability, choice, and typically moderation. Regretfully the MENA region is pursuing the path of accelerated job destruction. War, political uncertainty, and increasing governmental focus on financial control and centralized planning are destroying opportunity and maintaining economic power with the traditional elite.Job creation cannot come from traditional welfare state policies. Too many jobs are required with estimates of over 100 million new jobs in this decade being commonly cited as the requirement to maintain even current, unacceptable, unemployment rates. The governments in the region are already too burdened to carry this load with many government employees already under-employed in a bloated public sector.Even in mature economies (including the US) most jobs are created by young businesses in their high growth first 5 years. The formula is simple: To build jobs, encourage entrepreneurship! To encourage entrepreneurship, governments need to reform the regulatory framework and step out of the way. The cost and time to setting up a business must be brought down significantly; the barriers to operate including severe laws on local ownership, bankruptcy, labor relations, and the movement of goods and services must be relaxed; and importantly, protectionist policies need to be stripped away.The desire for entrepreneurship in the region is overwhelming. According to Bayt.com research, 73% of millennials say that they would prefer to have their own business than be employed. Our youth no longer want handouts. They want to build their own futures and to have a fair chance to compete.Where regional governments have allowed this to happen through noninterventionist, laissez faire policies, businesses have thrived and stability has reigned. In Dubai, for example, business friendly policies have meant that thousands of new companies have incorporated in the last year alone. Dubai has solidified its position as the regional business capital. The supportive steps the UAE took include free zones to allow international investments within commonly recognized corporate structures, relatively fast and efficient incorporation practices, more transparent regulations, and lower barriers to the movement of global talent and capital.In a time of monumental change in the MENA region, people continue to seek hope through better opportunity. That opportunity can no longer come through large governmental employment programs or welfare state policies. Entrepreneurship must fuel the next generation of jobs. To governments: Reduce the red tape, lower the barriers, and let the region get to work! We have a lot to do. To the rest of the world: If you want to lend us a hand send us more of your free market experts, your MBA professors, your venture capitalists, and your angel investors, and less of your arms. Your costs would be much lower and your returns far more favorable.This post is part of a series produced by The Huffington Post and Education For Employment (EFE), a non-profit focused on creating job opportunities for unemployed youth in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Conflict and upheaval have dominated the news on MENA in 2014, and some see a region spiraling into chaos. But beneath the alarm bells, some digital pioneers are doubling down on their bets that the region's next generation could have a brighter future tied to technology and skills.

No fanfare, just a statement of facts and a lot of hope that his coming out would help those who have struggled along that to know they're not alone if they're out and in business.   So many people are clamoring for prognostications on what this will do for the market -- as if one man's sexual orientation controls the fate of the economy. Tim's sexuality should only matter to Tim. His choice to come out was his, and his alone. Riding the wave of ever-growing acceptance in America, both in our homes and in our businesses, he realized the time was right to let the world know the real Tim Cook. Now he can get back to being the great CEO he's always been with one less weight on his shoulders. That's the real success of today's announcement, and of every time a business leader chooses to come out. That's why I joined StartOut, because I knew an empowered community of out business leaders can be a tremendous force for good in the world.While there have been substantial gains for the community in representation and visibility in politics, entertainment, journalism and now even sports, in too many places the corporate closet continues to flourish, and there are virtually no role models in the senior ranks of the business community. Today that changed, but Tim didn't. Tim's leadership of Apple has not been, and will not be, defined by his being out. It will only be enhanced because now he's empowered to lead without hiding. Mr. Cook echoes the sentiment of all out CEO's in the StartOut family when he says, ""It's been tough and uncomfortable at times, but it has given me the confidence to be myself, to follow my own path, and to rise above adversity and bigotry. It's also given me the skin of a rhinoceros, which comes in handy when you're the CEO..."" That thick skin doesn't come easily, but its what makes out executives such great leaders. ""Why do gay people need a business network?"" is probably the most common question I'm asked in my work. And the answers can be as wide-ranging and impassioned as our community itself is. Talk to anyone who has been an lgbt entrepreneur and you hear how the playing field is anything but even. The sheer number of affinity groups and diversity initiatives at major businesses are evidence of how much progress has been made and how much still needs to be done.Apple has an impressively large and well-organized segment of out employees -- most of the major tech companies do, in fact -- and I bet they are all walking a bit taller and prouder today.

5,RELIGION,Hekate: A Goddess for Halloween,"Laurie Lovekraft, ContributorPriestess, Performer, USC Religious Studies Lecturer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hekate-a-goddess-for-hall_b_6072780.html,"Let's take a closer look (if we dare) at the inspiration for the cackling Halloween hag, the patroness of witches: Hekate.",2014-10-30,2014-10-30-Hekate_copyright_Rob_KoopmanCreative_Commons.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-10-30-Hekate_copyright_Rob_KoopmanCreative_Commons-thumb.jpg,"This Halloween, take a look at the ghoulish décor at your local supermarket check-out line. You'll see a familiar character, green-faced and festooned with warts: the Halloween Witch. HuffPost's Antonia Blumberg wrote an excellent article about cultural appropriation during Halloween, but let's take a closer look (if we dare) at the inspiration for the cackling Halloween hag, the patroness of witches: Hekate.Charmed and Practical MagicMuch has been written about witches in film and television, but unlike Halloween's typical threatening depictions, Hollywood's witches are usually portrayed by glamorous actresses. Even with perfect hair and makeup, you'll see Hekate's influence in witch-centric films and television from recent decades: Witches of Eastwick, Practical Magic, Hocus Pocus, and Charmed. There's also the wonderful musical adaptation of Gregory Maguire's book Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West. Other current TV and films with witches and their craft as central themes include American Horror Story: Coven, Witches of East End, and... Maleficent.Hekate, Keeper of the CrossroadsBeyond Hollywood adaptations, who is Hekate? Hekate (or Hecate) most likely originated with the Carians of Asia Minor in Turkey and came to Greece in the 6th century BCE. Known as a triple goddess of earth, sky, and sea, in mythological art and religious iconography Hekate was sometimes portrayed as three separate figures. In Rome, the poet Ovid (C1st B.C. to C1st A.D. (trans.Boyle)) wrote that Hekate's three faces were turned outward so she could protect three-way crossroads.A goddess of magic, witchcraft, the moon, nighttime, ghosts and necromancy (communicating with the deceased), you will sometimes see Hekate holding keys to open the gates between the worlds. She also carried a torch to light the way, and a knife to separate the soul at the time of death, as well as for severing the umbilical cord at birth. Frequently attended by a dog or dogs, her customary offerings took place at a crossroad on the eve of a new or dark moon.According to the Covenant of Hekate (excerpted from the book Hekate Liminal Rites by Sorita d'Este and David Rankine), Hekate was:A liminal goddess who was present at all the boundaries and transitional moments in life. She was also an apotropaic ('evil-averting') protector and guide, as illustrated by some of the many titles she was given... over the thousands of years of her worship. Some of her well-known titles include:Cast Away Your BeliefsAs Queen of the Night and the crossroads greeter of souls after death, Hekate is a great fit for Halloween. But, Hekate's magic was not just about death and the underworld. As healer, she helped ease the transition of the dying, and she was also associated with sacred plants, wilderness, childbirth, protection, and growing and harvest -- through her connection to the phases of the moon.Sure, pop culture often makes Hekate look like the monstrous Wicked Witch of the West, an image most people have been raised to fear. But Hekate's guidance is needed most as we age or are going through a difficult transition. When we experience times of darkness and self-searching -- our own personal crossroads -- Hekate can be a much needed ally. Call on her during prayer or meditation, and try using this Hekate Trance Loop I recorded to get you in the mood.A Goddess for the AgesAlthough we've mostly discussed Hekate's visage of the crone, her modern priestesses sometimes take the form of fresh-faced college students, hip urban dwellers, and suburban moms toting trick-or-treaters. For a society that fears death and works hard to delay the aging process, regardless of the lines on your face, Hekate can help prepare all of us for the ultimate goodbye. Laurie Lovekraft will be talking about Hekate and Halloween on UBN TV's ""On Air with Tony Sweet: Truth Be Told""; Friday, October 31, 4:00-6:00 pm PST, archives available online after the show."

Our last four full two-term presidents, Eisenhower to Bush II, have concluded their final two years in office without the support of either house of Congress. Seemingly, the populous becomes weary of any president regardless of party, if he is too long on our television and computer screens. We vote in the midterms against them, no matter how unpopular the opposing party in congress may be. This begs the question, ""Is eight years too long for a presidency?"" Second-Term Midterm Results of Recent PresidentsTotal legislature loss is a recent phenomenon; although, Cleveland and Grant also lost both houses during their second term mid-term elections. This is the midterm results of every two-term president since Eisenhower: Dwight D. Eisenhower  Republican  1959 midterms Senators lost: 13 US Reps lost: 48  Result: Arguably, the worst second-term midterm election result for a recent president. The slim Democratic majority in both houses enlarged to an overwhelming majority. The Democrats would maintain this lead until the 1981 midterms, 22 years later. Ronald Reagan  Republican 1987 midterms Senators lost: 8 US Reps lost: 5 Result: Reagan lost the senate and increased his losses in the US House. Bill Clinton Democrat 1999 midterms Senators lost: 0 US Reps lost: 3 Result: Clinton lucked out with the best second-term midterm election result. He already had both houses against him going into the midterms. George W. Bush Republican 2007 midterms Senators lost: 6 US Reps lost: 33 Result: Bush lost both houses of Congresses. It should be noted that officially the Senate was 49-49 after the elections; however, the two independent senators in the new congress would vote with the Democrats. Barack Obama Democrat 2014 midterms Senator +/- range: 5 to 8 losses US Reps +/- range: 6 to 9 losses Possible result: Even with loses in the Senate, if Obama can manage to lose only five senators, then he will still maintain a lead in the Senate, as Joe Biden will be the tie-breaking vote in the event of a 50-50 vote. It should also be noted that these loses in the midterms were never undone in the elections two years later; although, Clinton was able to get a tie in the senate. If all trends continue, then the 2016 midterm elections will probably end with Republican leads in both houses. What Happens In Those Final Two Years?The past presidents that have faced an opposing Congress during their last two years have generally accomplished a lot less than they did at any other point in their careers. Despite having a wall of obstruction against these presidents, some accomplishments were made during their administrations. Here are the presidential highlights of those two years by president:  Eisenhower (1959-1961) • Endorsed the 23rd Amendment, allowing Washington DC to vote in presidential elections • Recognized Fidel Castro's government in Cuba • Signed the Civil Rights Act of 1960Reagan (1987-1989) • Iran-Contra Affair • Senate rejects Bork nomination to the Supreme Court • Homeless Assistance Act • Balanced Budget Act • Civil Rights Restoration Act, over his veto • INF TreatyClinton (1999-2001) • Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which repealed part of the Glass-Steagall Act • NATO bombing of Yugoslavia • Impeachment trial • Children's Health Act • CTBT Treaty rejected • 140 pardonsBush II (2007-2009) • Vetoed stem cell research • 4 vetoes overridden by congress • Continuation of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan • Economic Stimulus Act • Energy Independence ActIt should also be noted that candidates distanced themselves from Clinton or Bush as their terms were ending. Some argue that Al Gore's loss was due in part to distancing himself from Bill Clinton. What Might Happen in Obama's Last Two Years?Based off our historical examples, it seems like much of President Obama's domestic efforts will come to a halt or will be severely compromised when they are passed. So what can he do?For one, all four previous presidents in this study had a fair amount of power in foreign affairs. Therefore, it seems likely that Obama will try to make up for other weaknesses by focusing on and trying to earn greater success in Syria, Iraq and the surrounding area. Like Eisenhower, he may strive for moral victories. Like Reagan, he could have a judicial appointment rejected. Like Clinton, he could make a large number of pardons. Like Bush II, he could increase the times he vetoes legislation, even if the vetoes are overridden. However, he could break new ground, possibly winning congress back before leaving office. Is Eight Years Too Long?While the term of office is unlikely to change, it is interesting to ponder if a change would make any difference. The Confederacy had a six-year term with no reelection. Mexico has the same rule, but they are considering changing their term limit. The EU's president of the European Council has a two-and-a-half-year term that is renewable one time. In the past, the founding fathers had differing views on both the years of service and term limits. Some, including Thomas Jefferson, believed that more than one term was too much (Jefferson would later change his mind when he was reelected.) Since then, there have been many ideas passed along either by scholars or in the news, which have varied in practicality and originality."

Bring them on. As long as people can see the film and talk about these issues, I am ready to face it,"" the film-maker said in a telephone interview.India's Supreme Court has refused to decriminalize homosexuality. Last year, it overruled a decision by a lower court to declare sexual intercourse between same-sex partners as legal, saying it was up to parliament to repeal such a law.Many homosexuals remain in the closet and society's attitude towards the gay community is reflected in mainstream cinema, which hardly touches on these topics.""Margarita, With a Straw"" shows Laila, a teenager with cerebral palsy, falling in love with another woman. This, said Bose, represents an attempt to understand the situation from all sides.""In the film, Laila's mother has great difficulty coming to terms with her daughter's sexuality, and when the film screened in Toronto, I had so many Indians coming up to me and telling me they loved it, so I know I have struck a chord somewhere,"" said Bose, who worked on the script for two years.""We always look at the disabled with so much empathy, so hopefully when you are presented with a prickly topic like sexuality from their point of view, audiences might be more accepting than if it was told from the point of view of a normal person,"" she said.In spite of the accolades and a tentative release date set for India early next year, Bose knows her film is not for everyone. In the past, the few Indian films that have dared to depict homosexuality without caricaturing it have faced protests and boycotts. ""Margarita, With a Straw"" must first make it past the censors.""I don't know if depiction of bisexuality would be a problem. Hopefully, we are at a stage where we accept these things more. We are talking about them,"" said Kalki Koechlin, who plays the lead character of Laila in the film.Bose said it was not just the release of the film that presented a problem; there were obstacles in making it. Studio Viacom 18 Motion Pictures declined to fully fund the film over concerns about whether Bose would pick a bankable-enough star.""I was asked which star I would be casting, because that is what sells in India. I took a loan and paid for the film out of my own pocket,"" she said. ""But now that it is all behind me, I cannot wait for the Indian release.

12,POLITICS,U.S-Backed Syrian Rebels' Pleas For Help Likely To Go Unanswered,Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/syrian-rebels-aleppo-idlib_n_6070532.html,,2014-10-30,"ALEPPO, SYRIA - SEPTEMBER 25: Free Syrian Army rebel fighters deploy in fight against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) militants to retrieve the villages in Ayn al-Arab district of Aleppo Governorate in northern Syria on September 25, 2014. (Photo by Ensar Ozdemir/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8db64240000320057745b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- As Islamic State militants inched closer to seizing control of the Kurdish town of Kobani, the international community heaped shame upon neighboring Turkey, condemning it for standing aside and allowing the slaughter to take place for its own political interests. Turkey's government, which sees Syrian President Bashar Assad as its prime enemy in Syria, initially saw little reason  to attack Assad's most powerful foes. It was particularly unwilling to aid Syrian Kurds, whose leadership is aligned with Kurdish militants within Turkey. But under intense pressure from the U.S. and its coalition allies, Turkey recently allowed Iraqi Kurds to travel across its border into Syria to shore up Kobani's defenders.Less than a hundred miles away in Aleppo, non-extremist Syrian rebels say they may be wiped out by Assad's forces. This time, the ally withholding help for political reasons is the United States. U.S.-backed Syrian rebels, described by the White House as essential partners in the fight against the Islamic State, say they are in the fight of their lives in northwestern Syria -- and that without immediate assistance from the U.S.-led coalition, they will be weakened to the point where they will be of little use against the extremists. They warn that unless aid -- particularly in the form of weapons -- arrives, there could be a mass slaughter of civilians, along with a milestone recruitment moment for ISIS.But that assistance looks like it will never come through. Syrian opposition figures, U.S. officials and outside analysts have told The Huffington Post that because of the complex mix of forces involved in these battles -- particularly Iranian squads backing the Syrian regime -- and growing distrust between the U.S. and the rebels, there is little chance the coalition will aid the rebels in Aleppo and Idlib. Free Syrian Army rebels have told the U.S. their chief goal is toppling Assad, who is presently pushing to take over Aleppo. Over the weekend, they were outraged when White House envoy Gen. John Allen told an Arab newspaper the U.S. goal in Syria was not to help rebels end Assad's rule but to make them part of a negotiated political end to the civil war.Those sympathetic to the rebels believe U.S. policymakers, long wary of toppling Assad, are loath to aid rebels in regions targeted by Assad because of Assad's support from Iran. At a time when U.S. relations with Iran are better than ever before and a deal over Tehran's nuclear program seems within reach, they say, Washington does not want to be responsible for undermining Iran's chief client -- or empowering U.S. allies in Syria to do so. Two leading Syrian opposition figures -- Oubai Shahbandar of the Syrian Opposition Coaltion and Mohammad Al Abdallah, a Syrian activist in exile who runs the Syria Justice and Accountability Center -- told The Huffington Post they believe the United States' Syria policy is being influenced by its interests in a relationship with Iran. Scholar Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi, at the Interdisciplinary Centre in Herzliya, Israel, also said this is a likely U.S. rationale. ""It is imperative that the administration not value a deal on Iran's nuclear program above ensuring the safety of its partners in Syria,"" Shahbandar said. A White House spokesperson declined to comment on Iran's relevance to the United States' Syria strategy. Wendy Sherman, the top U.S. negotiator working on the administration's efforts to reach a deal with Iran over its nuclear program, said in a Washington address last week that broader regional concerns -- including the fact that Iran and the U.S. are both working to undermine the Islamic State in Iraq -- would not affect what she described as a ""single-track negotiation.""But the Wall Street Journal revealed Tuesday night that U.S. officials have explicitly told Iran that their strikes against the Islamic State in Syria will not target Assad's army or the Iranian fighters working alongside it. It is those Iranian forces, Shahbandar said, that are now moving to quash the U.S.-allied rebels.The rebels describe themselves as squeezed between forces loyal to Assad in the south, and fighters with al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat Al-Nusra (a temporary ISIS ally) in the north. They likely will have to defend themselves without direct help from their ostensible partners.Shahbandar told The Huffington Post at least two major U.S.-vetted groups in Idlib, the Syrian Revolutionary Front and Harakat Hazm, are at risk of losing ""a critical line of supply from the Turkish border.""""I spoke to the FSA commanders in the field, and they are extremely concerned, particularly since ISIS is moving aid and reinforcements to Nusra in this area,"" Shahbandar, whose group liaises regularly with the FSA, said in an email Tuesday. The question, he said, is whether coalition airstrikes will help the FSA fight al Qaeda's affiliate or allow it ""to overrun moderate forces.""Shahbandar told The Huffington Post in an earlier conversation that the U.S.-backed rebel groups also face a ""true existential threat"" from the combined forces of Assad, Iran and Hezbollah in Aleppo. His message echoed what Syrian rebels have expressed in recent days. The U.S. has repeatedly condemned Assad, but has said it will not directly attack him in its present fight against ISIS. The Syrian president has used this guarantee of his safety to hit the rebels especially hard since the U.S.-led airstrikes began. Analysts told The Huffington Post this is because he likely believes the international coalition will deal with the ISIS threat for him. Assad began his latest assault on Aleppo, long a stronghold of the U.S.-backed rebels, at the beginning of this month.A senior administration official told The Huffington Post the level of U.S. assistance to the rebels in the region is not likely to change immediately in response to Assad's moves.“We continue to closely monitor the Assad regime's actions against the moderate Syrian opposition, and are of course concerned about any attempt by the regime to seek to exploit the coalition campaign,"" the official said, speaking on background to discuss administration strategy. ""We have been clear that we are increasing our support to the moderate Syrian opposition as a way to not only fight [ISIS], but to defend against regime attacks, as well as to further the goal of a political solution,"" the official added. ""The train and equip program, which Turkey and Saudi Arabia have agreed to host, is one important part of this effort."" The official also noted that since the Islamic State is ""a threat to the moderate opposition,"" U.S. efforts to degrade the Islamic State ""will also benefit the moderate opposition.”Tony Blinken, the president's deputy national security adviser, addressed the non-extremist rebels' demands for greater assistance at a Wednesday event at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washintgon. Blinken repeated that the focus of the U.S.-led coalition's airstrikes was on areas strategically important to ISIS. He added that the U.S. had taken action when it identified significant potential humanitarian catastrophes, like the ISIS attempts to capture the Yezidis on Mount Sinjar in Iraq or Kobani earlier this month.But Shahbandar said the rebels need immediate assistance -- faced with battles on two fronts, he said, they cannot wait until next year when the training program begins to send fighters into Syria. He added that Aleppo has more civilians at present than Kobani did when the U.S. intervened.The administration's approach to the rebels' struggle reflects its increasingly difficult relationship with the groups it has said it needs to defeat the Islamic State, and the complexity of the three-year-long Syrian civil war in which the U.S. and its allies have inserted themselves. The non-extremist rebels have played their own role in making U.S. inaction unlikely, said Hassan Hassan, an analyst at the Delma Institute in Abu Dhabi. Hassan said that while the rebels are in ""a very tight position,"" they are unlikely to attract strikes or weapons assistance from the U.S.-led coalition because of their own approach to the fight against ISIS -- including their vocal criticism of the U.S.-led air campaign.""The rebels are appealing for help, but at the same time, they don't seem to make a pitch,"" Hassan said. ""They expect the world to help them without making any moves to provide anything in exchange. Just before the airstrikes, we saw a lot of gestures from some rebel groups saying, 'We will chase ISIS!' Now, we're not hearing that. There's a lot of cynicism towards the airstrikes, and there are no concrete promises to help.""He added, ""They're just expecting the coalition to help them, to strike here and there."""
13,POLITICS,Netanyahu Not The First To Be Called 'Chickensh*t',Sarah Harvard,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/benjamin-netanyahu-chickenshit_n_6071356.html,,2014-10-30,"President Barack Obama meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, Monday, Sept. 30, 2013. The White House said the two leaders would discuss negotiations with the Palestinians, developments in Syria and Iran. (AP Photo/Charles Dharapak)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8db682100004502c9670a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As the prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu is no stranger to harsh criticism and name-calling. But when the snipe comes from the White House -- ostensibly the Israeli government's closest ally -- it's news. On Tuesday, The Atlantic reported that a senior Obama administration official reportedly called the prime minister ""a chickenshit"" for his unwillingness to put long-term geopolitics ahead of short-term electoral interests. The leveling of such an insult underscores the deteriorating back-door relations between the U.S. and Israel. That said, people shouldn't be entirely surprised by the use of the term. The reference to poultry feces is a time-honored insult in American politics. It all started when President Lyndon Johnson was put off by a banal question asked by a journalist attending an informal press gathering at the Oval Office. According to Slate, Johnson glared at the reporter and did not mince words.""You're talking to the commander-in-chief of the most powerful military in the world,"" Johnson reportedly sneered, ""and you ask a chickenshit question like that?""Johnson was infamous for his snide remarks. But ""chickenshit"" appeared to be one of his go-to put-downs. For instance, when Johnson was a senator and was asked by a reporter how he could praise then-Vice President Richard Nixon, he used the term to refer to the Republican.""In politics,"" Johnson reportedly said, ""you've got to learn that chicken shit can turn overnight to chicken salad.""A couple of decades later, ""chickenshit"" returned to the spotlight at the height of the Gulf War during a clash between two politicians: Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.) and President George H.W. Bush.After Wellstone's big win in the 1990 Minnesota senate race made him a progressive hero, he emerged as one of the most vocal and astringent critics of the Gulf War. Bush, who had deployed U.S. forces to Saudi Arabia, had some disparaging remarks for his critic.""Who is this chickenshit?"" the elder Bush snarled after being lampooned by Wellstone at a reception for new congressional members, Mother Jones reported.And it's not just presidents and their anonymous aides using the epithet. In June 2007, then-Rep. Heath Shuler (D-N.C.) butted heads with Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) over a sign that illustrated the federal deficit and the typical American's individual share of it, according to Roll Call.Gohmert had taken the sign from outside Shuler's office and used it in a floor speech in which he railed against Democratic spending. Later, Shuler, a former NFL player, was seen towering over Gohmert, wagging his finger in the Republican's face and calling him a ""chickenshit"" among other names.One of the most heated confrontations among the political chickenshit revelations was between Gen. David Petraeus and his superior, Adm. William Fallon, chief of U.S. Central Command. According to the Inter Press Service news agency, Pentagon sources revealed Fallon approached Petraeus at their first meeting in Baghdad in March 2007 and did not hold back his personal thoughts when he said he believed Petraeus was ""an ass-kissing little chickenshit."" Adding more insult to injury, Fallon reportedly said, ""I hate people like that."" According to IPS' Pentagon sources, Fallon made the snide remarks after Petraeus began the meeting with words that Fallon ""interpreted as trying to ingratiate himself with a superior.""And then there is House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), who on Wednesday demanded that President Barack Obama fire whichever aide made the disparaging comment about Netanyahu. Back in 2008, when he was House minority leader, Boehner weighed in on Obama's time in the Illinois state Senate and had some choice words about Obama's penchant for voting present. ""Now, listen, I've voted 'present' two or three times in my entire 25-year political career, where there might have been a conflict of interest and I didn't feel like I should vote,"" Boehner said. ""In Congress, we have a red button, a green button and a yellow button, alright. Green means 'yes,' red means 'no,' and yellow means you're a chicken s***."""

Any attempt at division of Bosnia and Herzegovina would restart civil war and radicalize the heretofore secular Muslim community, raising the specter of an Islamist country in the heart of Europe.",2014-10-30,"SARAJEVO, BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA - OCTOBER 12: Bosnian people celebrate the victory of Candidate and Deputy Chairman of conservative Party of Democratic Action, Bakir Izetbegovic, in Bosnian presidential elections in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, on October 13, 2014. (Photo by Samir Yordamovic/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc1404a230000380093e18c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In mid-October, Bosnia and Herzegovina held national elections. The scant coverage in Western media tended to highlight the fact that ""nationalists"" had captured the Bosniak (Muslim), Serb, and Croat seats in the ceremonial tripartite presidency. Beyond the headlines, however, several larger developments are occurring that are more important to Europe and the U.S.The most recent national census, whose results are due for publication early next year, is likely to show that Bosnia has become, after Albania and Kosovo, the third country in Europe with a Muslim majority population. Moreover, after a bloody civil war with foreign intervention in the early 1990s, followed by two decades of tutelage from the international community, Bosnia is making fitful progress, but still needs help to become a ""normal"" country. The moment has come for energetic engagement by the U.S. and the European Union to help Bosnia achieve that normalcy and move definitively toward membership in NATO and the EU. An examination of the election results reveals a vibrant political scene. The Democratic Front, a reform effort founded last year by Željko Komšić, the Croat member of the presidency, won the second largest number of votes in the Federation, the Muslim-Croat entity, and fourth nationally. The reformer Komšić, limited to two terms, was succeeded in the Croat seat on the presidency by the nationalist party boss Dragan Čović, with 52 percent of the vote. In the Republika Srpska, the Serb half of the country, entity president Milorad Dodik, a vocal secessionist, came within a hair of being unseated. His chosen candidate for the Serb seat on the national presidency was edged out by Mladen Ivanić, a hard-line veteran politician who is nonetheless more inclined toward Europe.Until the prerogatives of the national government are strengthened, the direction of the country will be determined at the entity level, especially by the composition of the Federation government. The Bosniak Party of Democratic Action headed by Bakir Izetbegović, son of the revered war-time Bosniak leader, will command the greatest number of parliamentary seats, but a majority coalition of other parties is not out of the question. It took 17 months of horse-trading to form a government after the 2010 elections, an unseemly spectacle the country would do well not to repeat. Fortunately, there are a few high-profile technocrats already occupying senior positions in leading parties who could be tapped to run the Federation government.There is widespread disillusionment with a corrupt alliance of nationalist politicians, big money, coopted media, and organized crime. Last February, widespread rioting broke out, and in May the government's handling of relief efforts after massive flooding brought renewed criticism of ineptitude and lack of political accountability. In October only 54 percent of eligible Bosnian voters exercised their franchise.Moreover, the hopelessly complex governmental and electoral system, created by the Dayton Accords in 1995 and subsequently elaborated in an election law, cries out for reform. Such reform must occur within the geographical borders of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Dodik's periodic call for a referendum on secession of the Republika Srpska is anathema to Washington. Before Serbian aggression ignited the war in 1992, on the territory of what is now the Serb-dominated entity there was a Bosniak Muslim plurality. The only reason a referendum today might yield a majority in favor of secession is the murder during the war of 100,000 Muslims and the ""ethnic cleansing"" of a million more.The demands of nationalist Croats appear less extreme, but would also be fatal to the country. Supported by the government of neighboring Croatia, they call for a third Croatian entity within Bosnia and Herzegovina, despite their inability to document any systematic discrimination against ethnic Croats in the current set-up. Because of population distribution, a Croatian entity would be a ""Swiss cheese,"" non-contiguous patchwork, adding to the dysfunction of an already cumbersome political structure.A basic problem documented in many polls is that although the majority Bosniak Muslims, a few numerically small ethnic groups, and a large number of people who refuse to self-label ethnically or religiously all desire a multi-ethnic country, most Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats do not.Forging universal attachment to a multi-ethnic Bosnian state will not be easy, but the stakes for the West are high. Any attempt at division of Bosnia and Herzegovina would restart civil war and radicalize the heretofore secular Muslim community, raising the specter of an Islamist country in the heart of Europe. In addition, Moscow, increasingly involved in the Western Balkans, would love to make a secessionist Republika Srpska a Russian satellite. If Belgrade were persuaded to annex the splinter state, it would doom Serbia's prospects for EU accession, the cornerstone of Brussels' Balkan policy. Finally, radicals in Kosovo and Macedonia would agitate for a Greater Albania, further destabilizing the region.The international community, led by the U.S., which retains street credibility in the Federation, and the EU, membership in which is still the long-term goal of a sizable portion of the population, can help to foster reform and forestall these doomsday scenarios.First, the U.S., EU, and international financial institutions should condition future assistance on Bosnia's immediate fulfillment of a 2009 ""Sejdić-Finci"" ruling of the European Court of Human Rights against the most blatantly discriminatory feature of the election system.Second, with international pressure and guidance, a comprehensive reform of the electoral system, beginning with the Federation, must be undertaken to create meaningful accountability of politicians to the citizenry.Third, the International High Representative should invoke his so-called ""Bonn Powers"" to indict officials suspected of corruption and dismiss others who abuse their offices.Fourth, Bosnia must forthwith settle the nagging issue of the ownership of defense property. Once that is accomplished, NATO should give Bosnia a Membership Action Plan, the crucial step toward joining the alliance. These measures would require modest expenditures and effort, but not substantially detract from more pressing and costly operations in the Middle East, Central Asia, Africa, and the Far East. Investment in building a successful, multi-ethnic Bosnia and Herzegovina is urgently needed and well within our capacity._____________ Michael Haltzel is a Senior Fellow at the Center for Transatlantic Relations at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies.

15,BUSINESS,"If You Had A Verizon Family Plan In The 2000s, There's Some Cash Coming Your Way",Hunter Stuart,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/verizon-overcharging-64-million-settlement-family-plan_n_6070824.html,,2014-10-30,"A pedestrian looks at a mobile device as he walks past a Verizon Wireless retail store in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Friday, Oct. 24, 2014. Verizon Communications Inc., the largest U.S. wireless carrier, missed profit estimates on Oct. 21 as more new subscribers took advantage of discounts on devices.

Family SharePlan customers were allegedly billed for in-network calls that were supposed to be free, according to a class-action lawsuit filed in 2006 in a New Jersey federal court. Customers with that plan were also allegedly billed more than the advertised rate for additional minutes they used over their monthly allowance. The alleged overcharges happened between 2002 and 2006, at the height of so-called ""family share"" plans' popularity with customers. Under the terms of the settlement, which has yet to be approved by the court, Verizon would pay $36.7 million into a settlement fund, according to court filings obtained by Consumerist. Once lawyer fees and other expenses have been deducted -- $19.26 million alone will be paid to plaintiffs' attorneys, Law360 reports -- Verizon would pay the remaining amount in cash and bill credits to affected customers.Verizon would then pay out another $27.5 million in the form of credits for free phone calls, the court documents state. When asked whether Verizon had deliberately overcharged people with Family SharePlans, or whether it was merely a mistake, Peter Bezek, one of the attorneys who filed the class-action suit, said he believed it was “primarily an oversight.”“I assume they legitimately believed in the billing practices they had,” Bezek told The Huffington Post. “Ultimately, when they were shown there were, in fact, billing problems, they acted responsibly and settled the case.” Verizon declined to comment for this story. Of course, we don’t make phone calls today nearly as much as we used to, opting instead to send text messages and emails. As a result, cell phone providers now offer plans with unlimited talk time, meaning this problem is unlikely to happen on a large scale again.But just because charging for ""minutes"" isn't as common now doesn't mean that Verizon -- and companies like it -- won't overcharge you in other ways. Verizon and AT&T have both been accused of other types of improper billing, and have had to pay out substantial sums of money in order to make such cases go away. "
