1,FIFTY,Study Uncovers Surprising Increase In Falls Among Older People,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/increase-in-falls-among-older-people_n_6518924.html,,2015-01-21,"GERMANY - FEBRUARY 11: Spring walk,,, Old couple talking a walk in a park.

The researchers looked at surveys done from 1998 to 2010 and tallied participants' reports of having fallen at any time in the period between surveys.In the 1998 survey, 28.2 percent of seniors reported a fall in the past two years. That percentage steadily rose until 2010, when 36 percent reported a fall. But the increase was almost exclusively among seniors younger than 85, the authors note.Cigolle noted that the findings were not influenced by gender, income, specific diseases or disability. ""This increased self-reporting of falls was fairly pervasive across all categories, we didn't find an easy answer to explain why older adults are saying they're falling more,"" she said.""It could be that older adults are more aware of falling,"" Cigolle said. ""There have been different awareness campaigns and interventions to make older adults aware so it may be in part due to better self-reporting on the part of older adults.""It could also be that older adults are engaging in riskier behaviors than in the past and participating in activities that make it more likely for them to fall, she added.A third possibility is that aggressive medical management of conditions and diseases such as hypertension and heart disease may be contributing to fall risk, Cigolle said.""Physicians can be pretty aggressive with medications and certainly there are many medications that can affect different aspects of mobility and we know can lead to increased falling,"" she said. ""What it really was saying was that universally, patients that are 65 to 89 years old are really at a higher risk for falls,"" said Dr. Jessica Zwerling, a neurologist at Montefiore Medical Center in New York.""Most of us really have the idea that it's only the oldest old that will fall, but actually in this study it was the opposite, that it's universal to no age, no demographic and no disease correlates, so it's a very important study,"" said Zwerling, who is assistant director of the Einstein Center for the Aging Brain and was not involved in the new study.Zwerling said the study emphasizes the importance of identifying patients who may be at a risk for falling at an earlier age, in order to prevent falls.It's also important to get checked by a doctor after you've fallen, she said. ""As we get older the brain can get smaller, so the bridging veins can have small bleeds and patients may need to be screened cognitively with an examination as well as imaging to look for subtle chronic subdural hematomas that can interfere with walking and cognition and cause chronic complaints,"" she said.Zwerling noted that after falling, patients may develop a fear of falling again, and that fear actually becomes a risk factor for future falls.She added that it's important to think about safety, such as making sure areas are well lit, using higher toilet seats and identifying other risk factors around the home.Cigolle also encouraged older adults and their families to be aware of things about the environment that could lead to falls, slips and trips, such as throw rugs and furniture that might block walking pathways. She also suggests speaking with physicians about any medications that might increase the older person's risk of falling.SOURCE: http://bit.ly/1xtE66y JAMA Internal Medicine, online January 19, 2015.

3,WORLDPOST,Michel Houellebecq: Novelist,"Bernard-Henri Lévy, ContributorFrench philosopher and writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michel-houellebecq-noveli_b_6515152.html,"Strange indeed, the story of Michel Houellebecq's latest novel, Soumission, which appeared just before the attack on Charlie Hebdo that left 12 people dead, like an advance echo of the terrible events that have plunged France into mourning, and scaring stiff not only the author's friends but Houellebecq himself.",2015-01-21,"French writer Michel Houellebecq poses on November 5, 2014 during his photo exhibition 'Before Landing' at the Pavillon Carre de Baudouin in Paris. AFP PHOTO/MIGUEL MEDINA (Photo credit should read MIGUEL MEDINA/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc143f9240000320076f1ff.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Strange indeed, the story of Michel Houellebecq's latest novel, Soumission (Flammarion 2015), which appeared just before the attack on Charlie Hebdo that left 12 people dead, like an advance echo of the terrible events that have plunged France into mourning, and scaring stiff not only the author's friends but Houellebecq himself, who saw fit to issue, through his agent, a communiqué unique in the history of literature, in which he announced that, because of the events, he would ""suspend ... the promotion of his novel."" But what is the real nature of this ""collision""? Is it really a new episode of the long, Oscar Wilde-like story of reality catching up with fiction and imitating it? There are, I believe, two misunderstandings, two errors, two forms of nonsense that we must dispose of before trying to understand what has happened and, in the manner of Sainte-Beuve and Valéry, grasp ""the situation of Michel Houellebecq."" There is the nonsense from the left. Houellebecq is a bastard. A fascist. An enemy of the human race and human rights. An antimodernist. One who believes that the lights have gone out of the Enlightenment and is glad of it. An incurable Islamophobe who refuses to recognize in his phobia a form of racism. A chic Éric Zemmour. An Alain Finkielkraut of art. Even the way he refers in his novel to ""the Muslims"" is odious. Fearsome, the mishmash he makes of the good and the bad, the obscurantists and the enlightened, those who believe in heaven and those who believe in hell, those who believe, period, and those who no longer do. And criminal, the intrigue in which the followers of a Koran that turns out to be ""less dumb"" than the author proclaimed it to be 10 years ago are pawing at the doors of power, waiting only for a political crisis to pull ahead of their twins in the National Front. Not to mention women -- or, rather, Houellebecq's hate, his panicky fear of women as anything more than purveyors of brief, furtive, and dreary pleasures, ideally not shared. His novel is not a novel but a tract, goes the argument from the left. And that tract is an unexpected boon to France's worst nativists, who in it see validation of their themes, obsessions, and phobias. Is this an example of French suicide, to echo the title of Zemmour's book? No, it's the suicide of a French writer, literary enfant terrible, and professional provocateur, who now, with this novel, by taking Huysmans hostage and Robert Redeker as a witness to immorality, has finally gone too far. Goodbye, Houellebecq. You provoked the worst of the Islamists and played into the hands of the National Front.Then there is the nonsense from the right. Houellebecq is a hero, a herald. He calls things by their right names and grants those names their just measure of vengeance and venom. He says out loud what the French people have been thinking but have been cowed by political correctness from expressing. He is a valiant knight and a prophet, the first novelist to have dared create literature out of the much-ballyhooed grand remplacement -- the great replacement of Christianity by Islam -- the tragedy of which Houellebecq has finally described with surgical precision. He is the first to have the courage to confront what politically correct thinking has hidden from itself, stripping it of its progressive illusions and of the antiracist fairy tales that, as everyone knows, are no more than the other side of a barbarism that has refused to speak its name but that here, in this exercise of truthful fiction, finds it. To depict what he has, namely the fight to the death between the Republic and Islam, between those who are French by descent and those French only on paper, is that not a sacred task from which our lily-livered writers have too long shrunk? What a pleasure to finally see our pathetic human-rightists lampooned, say those on the right. What a refreshing portrait of the grotesque Bayrou, prepared to make any alliance, issue any retraction, make any conversion to obtain his presidential mantle. And how true to life is the author's depiction of the lightening progress, from Picsou magazine to the University of Paris Diderot, from the Super-U Passy shopping center to the headquarters of the French domestic intelligence service, of a ""Eurabia"" for which the useful idiots of radical Islam have quietly paved the way. In the eyes of the right, Soumission is the revenge of Renaud Camus, the triumphal return of Céline from his censure by conventional thinkers. It is the novel that Philippe Muray might have written had he been able to shake off his residual humanistic scruples. A symptom? No, a conclusion. The death, with pomp, of the received wisdom that has straitjacketed the French elite for half a century. Thank you, Houellebecq. If we had listened to you earlier, we would have chased out of France the awful Kouachi brothers, the monstrous Amedy Coulibaly, and the many others of their ilk. Well.Knowing the author somewhat and holding the slight but not negligible advantage over both sides of having written a book with him, Public Enemies (Random House, 2011), in which our visions of the world went head to head, I do not believe I am wrong in saying that the same error is being made on the left and right, a common one with regard to novelists: that of confusing the writer with his characters, attributing their views to him, transforming into positions the hypotheses, fictions, and situations that he creates. To put it plainly, does anyone really believe that the vaporous left that hopes, as a smooth talker with a socialist face was recently suggesting, to save its skin by sacrificing Israel in favor of a ""community"" that is electorally more profitable, was invented out of whole cloth by Michel Houellebecq? Is it so unthinkable that a center-right UMP, the party of Nicolas Sarkozy, might favor an alliance with the National Front by a margin of 85 percent? The idea of a spoiled, flabby, out-of-breath France populated by political zombies that sees in fascism of one stripe or another the elusive last hope of restoring life to a dead nation -- doesn't that ring a bell? And all this excitement today around the National Front, the way in which a segment of the political class (both left and right) wants to welcome Marine Le Pen into the emerging ""national union"" -- isn't that precisely what the novel was depicting, foreshadowing, heralding? A novel is an invention, not a reality. More precisely, reality is not the result of the novel but its context or matrix, the substance with which it works while deploying, concentrating, or accelerating its virtualities. Houellebecq's Soumission, in other words, is a fable, a cruel and gritty tale, a satire whose outrageousness and falsity are equaled and exceeded only by various items in today's news: Club Med bought by the Chinese, Qatar at every level, those phantom ships that ply our coastlines with their human cargo despite our earnest efforts to ignore them, and now a suddenly plague-ridden France in which we must deploy superhuman efforts to prevent a confrontation between the neopopulists and their Islamist twins. Not to understand that is to understand nothing of the economy of the strange land of the novel, where, as Kundera said, moral judgment is suspended. And to identify Houellebecq with his Des Esseintes in Chinatown, to attribute to him some dark influence over the unfolding of the current tragedy, is absurd and repellent, succeeding as it does only in transforming the commentators and critics concerned into characters from the novel. That Michel Houellebecq ""sensed"" some of what is happening in the country, that he sniffed out, before the rest of us, the chaos into which we are falling, that he identified, blindly but fairly accurately, the general tendencies of the actors -- all that is true, and it is that which makes him the very great novelist that he has once again proven himself to be.
