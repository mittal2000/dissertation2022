The candidates have touched on foreign policy, the Black Lives Matter movement and even Hillary Clinton's emails, but there hasn't been one mention of abortion rights. In advance of the Feb. 11 debate, voters are urging moderators to #AskAboutAbortion. The hashtag, created by NARAL Pro-Choice, is being used to push Democrats to finally talk about women's reproductive rights during tonight's sixth Democratic Debate. The debate, which will air at 9pm tonight on PBS, will be the first-ever debate moderated solely by women. Journalist Gwen Ifill and news anchor Judy Woodruff will moderate the debate.Many Twitter users are hoping that this means Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will publicly address voters' concerns about abortion access and reproductive health during the debate. (Both candidates have commented on reproductive rights throughout their campaigns, just not during a Democratic Debate.) NARAL created a petition for voters and activists to sign, imploring PBS to ask these hard questions. ""In the first few weeks of 2016 alone, state legislatures have introduced 147 anti-choice bills. That’s an average of five per day,"" the NARAL petition reads. ""...Reproductive freedom is at serious risk in this country. But still, not a single question about abortion rights has been asked at ANY of the five Democratic debates. Not one.""In an essay on Medium, NARAL wrote about why it's so important to ask about abortion during the Democratic Debate:"

John Kasich may have bought himself some more time in the race for the Republican presidential nomination.He has secured the support of billionaire megadonor and Home Depot co-founder Ken Langone, who previously backed New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's presidential bid, Politico reported Thursday.Langone's support is welcome news for Kasich, whose fundraising pace has trailed that of his rivals. Kasich's campaign raised over $7.5 million through Dec. 31, while his two super PACs raised a combined $18 million through the same period. In comparison, the presidential campaign of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz raised nearly $20 million through Dec. 31.The Ohio governor's surprising second-place finish in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday will likely appeal to other establishment-minded GOP donors, adding to the wind in his sails. However, Kasich faces some immediate challenges that could threaten to sink his campaign during what is shaping up to be a drawn-out battle for the GOP nomination. The governor currently polls at barely 2 percent in South Carolina, whose primary is just days away. Even more worrying for Kasich: As soon as the Palmetto State's primary is over, he'll have to face others across the South -- where he is less popular with conservatives than Cruz or real estate mogul Donald Trump, the current front-runner in the race.Kasich's campaign has already signaled it is turning its attention to more favorable ground. The presidential hopeful is scheduled to speak at a town hall in Michigan next week -- two days before the South Carolina primary.Paul Blumenthal contributed to this report. Also on HuffPost:"
2,POLITICS,Democratic Lawmakers Want Kids In Immigration Proceedings To Get a Fair Shot,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/immigration-legal-counsel_us_56bca5e3e4b0c3c550503082,Having a lawyer can make the difference between asylum and deportation.,2016-02-11,"Families and children, most of them from Central America, are continuing to seek asylum in the U.S. in large numbers. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56bcd4331f00000d01217d58.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- It's not what most people would picture when they think about courts: toddlers, children and teenagers arguing against government lawyers for deportation reprieve that could, according to advocates, save their lives. But it happens all the time in immigration courts, where there's no guarantee of legal counsel. And it has a huge effect. Minors without representation are more likely to lose and more likely to get deported. Democratic senators -- led by Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, Bob Menendez of New Jersey, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Patty Murray of Washington and Dick Durbin of Illinois -- launched another effort on Thursday to change that. Senators introduced a bill, the Fair Day in Court for Kids Act, aimed at ensuring kids have access to lawyers, along with legal orientation programs and post-release services. It also applies to ""vulnerable individuals,"" defined as people with a disability or victims of abuse, torture or violence.""Immigration law is one of the most complex areas of law out there,"" Reid said Thursday on the Senate floor, after talking about children who went up against immigration judges alone. ""Toddlers should not be placed in this situation."" There will be a companion bill in the House from Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez of Illinois and Reps. Zoe Lofgren and Lucille Roybal-Allard of California. The bills come as the number of unaccompanied minors apprehended at the border is up this fiscal year from the previous one, although it dipped in January, and the administration is conducting raids to pick up families ordered for deportation. Meanwhile, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala remain dangerous, and families and children there are continuing to flee for the U.S. and elsewhere.Advocates argue that many -- if not most -- of the mothers and children seeking asylum have a good case for it. But having an attorney may make the difference between receiving relief and being sent back to potentially perilous situations. Children were allowed to remain in the U.S. in 73 percent of cases in which they had representation, according to data from fiscal years 2012 to 2014 analyzed by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. Children without representation were only allowed to stay in 15 percent of cases.""Trying to win asylum without a lawyer is like playing Russian roulette,"" Greg Chen, an advocate with the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said on a call with reporters. There are groups, including Kids In Need of Defense, that help provide attorneys, and cities and states have tried to do the same. The Justice Department provided grants in 2014 for lawyers and paralegals to help. But there's only so much they can do. About half of minors and about 70 percent of families go through the process without legal counsel. The legislation will likely face opposition in Congress, despite its supporters' arguments that it should be a no-brainer. Republicans thus far have been more focused on speeding up the legal process and deporting more families and minors than they have on things like counsel -- although it's worth noting that attorneys say having representation can help the process move more efficiently. Menendez told reporters on the same call that he does not think of it as only a messaging bill, and will do everything he can to get it through, including trying to attach it to must-pass legislation.""We will have strong resistance from Republicans that have shown themselves in every iteration to be anti-immigrant, but I would hope the administration will also join us at the end of the day,"" he said. ""The possibility of including this in some must-pass legislation is something I'm going to work very hard with.""Both Democratic presidential candidates have expressed support for legal counsel for children. The immigration platform of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) says he ""will ensure that all children at our borders will be provided procedural protections by providing counsel."" Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called last month for government-funded lawyers to ensure representation for all unaccompanied minors in deportation proceedings. Also on HuffPost:"

5,POLITICS,Here Comes Another Superdelegate Crisis,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/return-of-the-superdelegates-2016-election_us_56bcea6ee4b0c3c550508660,Your least favorite thing about the 2008 Democratic primary is back!,2016-02-11,Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders will face superdelegates in their fight for the nomination.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56bceade1f00007f00217d9c.jpeg?cache=vshMd5giwi&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Shortly after the New Hampshire primaries concluded, a great confusion arose among those who don't have several hundred hours of free time to study the Byzantine way we decide presidential nominees. That confusion coalesced into a single question: Why, if Bernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton decisively in the Granite State's primary, was the delegate count coming out of the state so close? Well, prepare to be reminded of an electoral bugaboo from yesteryear, with this concise explanation from Ben Kamisar at The Hill:Sanders won 15 delegates with his 20-point victory Tuesday while Clinton won nine.  But Clinton came into the contest with the support of six superdelegates, who are state party insiders given the freedom to support any candidate they choose.Ah, yes, welcome back, Democratic superdelegates! Time to make some space for you and all your bad memories.So, here's basically the back-of-the-cereal-box story of how the Democratic primary works. To be the nominee in 2016, you have to amass a total of 2,382 delegates during the primary season. Most of this haul will come from successfully competing in the states' various primaries and caucuses. Some states -- like these early ones we've seen -- apportion the delegates according to the vote. In these instances, the losers take home some consolation delegates to add to their pile. In many of the later states, however, the delegates are awarded on a winner-take-all basis. So as the primary process proceeds, the stakes tend to accelerate.(I'm really underplaying the complexity of the process here. If you want to get deeper into the weeds, head out to The Green Papers and start undertaking your graduate-level study of this process.)Now set all of the primary process aside and focus on another source from which the candidates can add to their delegate totals: the superdelegates. Democratic Party superdelegates are basically elected officials, Democratic National Committee members and a posse of party swells that are now considered distinguished Democratic Party pooh-bahs, and they all get a vote in this process.There are, right now, 712 of them. Many are, as of this moment, tentatively committed to a candidate. The Associated Press' reporting calculates that Clinton currently has 361 superdelegates committed to her as of Jan. 30, and Sanders has ... eight. So, Clinton has a massive advantage here.But this advantage comes with problems. Many superdelegates prefer to fly under the radar, properly recognizing that it would be a really bad look if a bunch of affluent party elites became the means by which a primary was decided. Some of these superdelegates, of course, are influential Democratic legislators whose endorsements are sought by the candidates. When Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), for example, backed Sanders, this was an important moment of the so-called ""invisible primary,"" in which an influential liberal congressman signalled his choice to other liberals. Grijalva is a superdelegate as well, though, so count him among Sanders' eight in the tally.But the ideal situation for many superdelegates is for them to merely use their vote as a ceremonial affirmation of the voters' consensus. That's why hundreds of them are currently biding their time, not picking anyone. Many superdelegates are in it for the perks -- a hotel room at the convention, a place amid the pageantry on the floor -- and would rather not see their potentially decisive power being used to decide a nominee.This sentiment was well expressed by Missouri Democratic Sen. (and superdelegate) Claire McCaskill back in April of 2008:""The majority of superdelegates I’ve talked to are committed, but it is a matter of timing,” said Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.). “They’re just preferring to make their decision public after the primaries are over. ... They would like someone else to act for them before they talk about it in the cold light of day.”And back in the spring of 2008, the way the race had shaped up had placed a lot of undue attention on the superdelegates and their role in the process. There came a moment in the race between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama when Clinton's mathematical path to notching the nomination didn't make sense unless a lot of superdelegates started breaking her way.And it wasn't just the raw arithmetic that mattered. She needed momentum as well, because she was locked in a situation where she had to start winning primaries by decisive margins that hadn't yet manifested themselves. Getting party elites to come out for her -- against the run of play -- was necessary to add a dose of energy to facilitate this outcome.So Clinton got to the point where she had to start publicly and flamboyantly courting the superdelegates. (Obama, rest assured, was doing the same in a more publicly restrained way.) And many of those superdelegates properly recognized that their lives might get dicey if, after the voters demonstrated a clear desire to nominate their party's first black candidate, some affluent Beltway toff threw the election in a different direction. (Around the same time, the Clinton campaign was also seeking to have the full delegate slate from a pair of states fully credentialed after the party punished them for various primary calendar shenanigans, a much better case for a nominal leader of the ""party of the little guy"" to be making.)In short, there was a time where the word ""superdelegate"" connoted a deep, deep dysfunction within the Democratic Party and an intergalactic electoral controversy. Given the fact that the 2008 cycle exposed that the superdelegates could, in the wrong situation, prove to be an undemocratic passel of votes that could supersede the will of primary voters, it shouldn't be a surprise that the Democratic Party pondered doing away with them altogether. So in August of 2010, the DNC's Rules and Bylaws Committee met to ponder the matter.As Newsweek's Colin Woodard reported at the time, here's how that went:But the rules committee took a dim view of this proposal. While endorsing recommendations to dilute the superdelegates’ influence (mostly by increasing the number of ordinary delegates), it quietly nixed the redefinition of their voting powers at it July 10 meeting. How quietly? Enough that even some members of the change commission hadn’t yet heard about it when NEWSWEEK spoke to them last week.The end result of all of this was that the influence of superdelegates in the process was slightly reduced, by limiting their overall proportion in the total number of delegates available to all candidates to 15 percent (down from 20 percent).Why not more? Let's have a beneficiary of nepotism explain it to Newsweek, because that's almost too perfect:“People ask: isn’t it enough for folks to have floor privileges and a hotel room and not have an actual vote?” says rules-committee co-chair James Roosevelt Jr., a grandson of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. “The answer is: what you’re doing is creating two classes of delegates, people with the vote and people without the vote. Clearly, the people at the grassroots level should be the predominant voice. But if you don’t give elected officials a real voice, they are basically second-class citizens.”Sure. Wouldn't want a group of privileged elites to feel like they're second class to primary voters. That almost makes too much sense.Now it's 2016, and the situation has changed considerably. This time, Clinton enjoys a substantial lead over Sanders in the race to win superdelegates. This is, on one important level, very understandable: Sanders is not a Democrat. He's an independent senator who caucuses with the Democrats, but he doesn't play a huge role in building the party and, in fact, his whole campaign is predicated on tearing out the existing party apparatus and replacing it with something new.So, all things being equal, his claim on the superdelegates is very tenuous. But when you start blowing out Clinton in primaries, guess what? All things cease being equal in a hurry. NBC News' First Read Team does a fine job distilling the situation at hand:Overall, according to the AP's count, Clinton has endorsements from more than 360 Democratic superdelegates, versus eight for Sanders. According to our back-of-envelope math, that means that Sanders must win 54% of the remaining delegates to get to the magic number of 2,382 delegates to clinch the Democratic nomination, while Clinton needs to win just 46%. That is a HUGE advantage, especially when you consider that the 2008 Democratic delegate race between Barack Obama and Clinton was essentially a 52%-48% affair.It is a ""huge advantage"" ... on paper. But if we think this through to the end, what happens if Sanders wins a majority of the remaining delegates that are at stake in contests where Democrats actually vote, and misses the nomination because Clinton closed and surmounted the gap through the votes wrangled from party elites? It probably leaves everyone involved in a crisis, with a sizable portion of the electorate left feeling disaffected by the primary process. In this hypothetical circumstance, how does Clinton win those voters back to her side for the general election?It may not happen that way, of course. As previously mentioned, many superdelegates are happy to simply affirm the consensus and move on with their lives. As the First Read Team notes, ""If Sanders does win a majority of the bound delegates, there will be ENORMOUS pressure on the supers to back him. And that pressure could likely lead to many elected supers -- perhaps worried about a future Dem primary -- to suddenly get cold feet on Clinton and simply promise to support the Dem who wins their district or state.""That is, indeed, the likely outcome. Still, this is a sleeping dog that Clinton ought to leave snoozing for the foreseeable future. But that's not what's happening. As ABC News' Rick Klein reports, ""Clinton campaign aides are touting"" her currently substantial superdelegate lead ""at least implicitly, in arguing to supporters and donors that the delegate math is overwhelmingly in her favor.""Klein continues:That, though, makes a few dangerous assumptions. First, it presumes that if superdelegates matter, they would openly deny the nomination to someone who won more delegates via actual voting. (Remember 2008, anyone?) Second, and more urgently, it presumes that Sanders supporters won’t wake up to this possibility and use it as motivation. A line about how the establishment is trying to subvert the judgment of the people could slip rather easily into a Sanders stump speech.But the bigger problem for Clinton is simply the fact that this isn't how this primary was supposed to go! It was never, ever supposed to come down to knotty delegate math and enumerating the vote splits on a state-by-state spreadsheet -- let alone give rise to a situation where she'd be dependent on a superdelegate bailout. And yet, after two contests -- both of which offered Sanders some bank-shot advantages that don't exist elsewhere -- Clinton's team is revealing a deep concern for the road ahead.Nevertheless, pointing to the way those Democratic Party elites who enjoy voting privileges favor her over Sanders is not a move her campaign advisers should even be countenancing at this point. The basic argument of her candidacy is that the institutions that govern our lives do not need to be torn down, root and branch. Clinton's case is that competent management of existing institutions will help level the playing field. For this reason, she shouldn't be telling voters that the system isn't really rigged against them while simultaneously telling her donors, ""Don't worry, the Democratic primary is rigged in my favor.""But for whatever reason, that's where we are right now, and once again, superdelegates are stuck in the spotlight. The Democrats should have just scuttled the superdelegates when they had the opportunity.

G.K. Butterfield (D-N.C.), the CBC Chair, Thursday.Clinton's primary opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), was an organizer with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, and he attended the March on Washington in 1963. The Vermont senator has said his involvement was ""a question for me of just basic justice.""Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), the preeminent voice on civil rights in Congress, downplayed Sanders' involvement with the SNCC and the movement during the CBC PAC's press conference Thursday.""I never saw him, I never met him. I was chair of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee for three years -- 1963 to 1966,"" he said. ""I was involved in the sit-ins, the freedom rides, the March on Washington, the march from Selma to Montgomery. I directed the board of education project for six years. I met Hillary Clinton.

But she eventually became a Democrat, driven by the anti-war and civil rights movements, according to The New York Times.A handful of CBC members will travel to South Carolina this weekend to campaign for Clinton, in advance of the Feb. 27 primary. Lewis said he will be there Sunday and Monday.Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) is the only CBC member who has so far endorsed Sanders. On Thursday, posted on Twitter his displeasure at the PAC's endorsement. Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), another CBC member, has also said she is not yet throwing her endorsement behind either candidate.Sanders' campaign did not immediately return a request for comment.Both campaigns are stepping up their outreach to voters of color, now that the heavily white contests in Iowa and New Hampshire are over. Clinton's first ad in South Carolina featured Eric Holder, President Barack Obama's former attorney general who was the first African-American person to hold that position. Sanders met with activist Al Sharpton on Wednesday and rolled out an endorsement from civil rights icon and entertainer Harry Belafonte on Thursday.The CBC has faced some criticism from younger activists, who question whether the caucus is as effective as it could be.Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.) tried to speak to younger voters who are drawn to Sanders Thursday. ""You can't just listen to what someone's telling you, because most of the time, if it's too good to be true, it's too good to be true,"" he said. ""And when you start saying 'free college,' 'free health care' -- the only thing you're leaving out is a free car and a free home. Who's going to pay for it, and how are you going to pay for it? Those things, I think, that is our responsibility to make sure that young people know that.

But I respond quickly by text.You’re the most generous …I always have wine in my refrigerator. Just in case. [Laughs]But yeah, back to your question, I was thinking about it in a way I hadn’t thought of before over the years. I have played the best friend a bunch of times, but I feel like my characters are very different. Like, I played different kinds of best friends, so it’s been fun to explore all the versions of the best friend role of the genre, you know? It’s fun to be bitchy, it’s fun to be silly, it’s fun to be daffy, it’s fun to be cranky, and I’ve gotten to do all that.And now, you’re kind of in this action realm with “Jurassic World,” “Planet of the Apes” and “Ant-Man.”Yeah, I’d love to be a part of the action in one of them! [Laughs] I’m mostly near the action … or before or after the action. So my next goal might be to be in the action sequence at some point. I did ask my agent and manager a few years ago, ""Can I maybe try to get some smaller roles in big-budget movies? I haven’t done a lot of that."" And they were like, ""Sure!"" And so we went after and got a couple of these really amazing roles, but now I’m like, OK, maybe I want to be an action part. Even if it’s just like one scene. It would be cool to have to be in a driving scene or jumping out of a helicopter or running with a chainsaw. You know, the basics.Are you a stunt kind of girl? I’d be terrified to do my own stunts.One time, I had to run over a mailbox and it was so scary. In the scene, my character jumps in the car and drives away, but she’s pulling out so fast that she drives over the mailbox. So we practiced it without the mailbox for a million times and then they put the mailbox in for the take and the stunt person said, “What everyone always wants to do is keep going in the direction that you’re driving. So the only thing you need to think about is as soon as you hit that mailbox, crank the wheel to the left. That’s it!” And I was like, “OK, OK, that’s so easy! I only have to do two things and one of them I’m going to do anyway, so I only really have to think of one thing.” But as soon as I hit the mailbox, I was like, “Ohhhhhhh!” You’re brain just freezes and I was like, “Go to the left! Go to the left!” At that point I realized -- not that I didn’t already realize, but -- there’s a lot of mental stuff involved with doing stunts that is weird and hard and that should probably be left to the professionals. Because I am not cool.Is there any role in particular you look back on and go, “Wow, that was amazing.” I’m sure all of them are special ...They’re all really special in their own way. I remember one time -- and I’m totally going to compare myself to Dolly Parton right now -- I saw Dolly Parton live, which was a bucket list thing for me, and she said, “I think of all my songs as children.” And I was like, I kind of feel that way about my characters. She’s written thousands of songs, and I’ve only played like 90 characters, but they’re all special kids in their own way. There’s been some that were just so fun, like “13 Going on 30” was just such a fun overall experience. Then some that were so funny and crazy, like “Arrested Development."" And then ones that I feel like were a turning point in my career, like “The Descendants.” And there's others where I felt like I worked really hard on my acting to give a good performance and that’s special in that way. So, there’s always a reason why I love them all.How do you go about choosing roles or auditioning?I like to keep a variety going, definitely, so that I don’t get bored. But at this point, I look for the people who are involved in the project first because, especially in television, if a show is successful, you’re spending a lot of hours with these people so it’s very important you like who you’re with every day. In film, it’s like variety, obviously a little bit of paycheck -- I have to work and eat food for a living, so ... and I have a shoe habit to support!Do you find that there’s a difference in roles on TV versus in film?You know, the line is getting so blurry now. Television is changing so fast. When I first started, I guess maybe 15 or 16 years ago, when I first moved to LA, you kind of had to choose: do you want to do movies or do you want to do TV? That’s just how it happened. And I’m sure that the line was getting blurry before this, but I remember the cast of “Friends,” for my generation of actors, really erased the lines because this was the first time we saw almost the whole cast doing movies on their hiatus over the summer and some of them, obviously like Jennifer Aniston, becoming big movie stars. So that was a time when it was like, “Oh! Maybe you can do a television show and maybe you can do a movie.” I came in right when that was happening, so I never had to choose. I feel like the content at the time was movies had grittier, interesting roles for women and TV, unless you were Sydney Bristow on “Alias,” you were kind of like “the girlfriend” or “the wife” or “the friend.” And now, I think that it’s all kind of in a snow globe because with all the different shows, the demand for television is getting more sophisticated and more intelligent and so we’re seeing the great roles now. We’re all so excited about the shows on Amazon and Netflix and Hulu, but I think that the big networks are competing with that and I think that they’re doing a good job at making great shows that are competing with cable shows and Internet or steaming shows.What’s your take on streaming sites like Netflix? Do you think the content is solid?Yeah, I mean, the roles are definitely better. I think it’s good to be challenging what has had success in the past and it forces people to keep the stakes higher. When you look at a show like “Orange Is the New Black,” for example, and clearly it’s mostly women in that cast and created by a woman and a woman’s story and made by women, that’s such a success story. It really started people demanding better content from their cable and network channels. And they’re having to rise to the occasion. It’s also nice to create more jobs for people, women and men, within the crew. When you think about a TV show, it’s not just the actors you see on screen, there’s hundreds of people that are employed by all of these shows. So anytime there’s more content, that’s better for jobs and our industry.Judy Greer deemed herself dairy sensitive a few years back and has been using Lactaid over milk products ever since.

(Photo by Damon Dahlen, Huffington Post)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56bccf751800002d0080bc74.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What do you know her from? Maybe it's ""The Wedding Planner"" or ""Jawbreaker,"" or perhaps it's ""13 Going on 30,"" ""The Descendants"" or ""27 Dresses."" But no matter what the movie is, you're definitely aware of Judy Greer, and if you're not, well, get out from under that rock.The I Don't Know What You Know Me From author is currently gearing up for ""Archer"" Season 7 and is ready to make her directorial debut with ""A Happening of Monumental Proportions,"" which follows several different people throughout one day in Los Angeles, and stars Common and Allison Janney. ""I feel like I don’t want to jinx it, but it's really exciting. We’re in pre-production now so there’s a lot of decisions to make on a minute-to-minute basis,"" Greer told The Huffington Post of her film while promoting her partnership with Lactaid and Milk Bar on the ""No More Dairy Envy"" campaign. Directing is a new role for Greer, who previously helmed a documentary short for AOL Originals titled ""Transcendental Meditation."" The 40-year-old actress is looking forward to hopefully opening more doors for women in filmmaking. She discussed the project, her take on Hollywood and her beloved on-screen BFF roles with us, and well, it was a blast. Congrats on your directorial debut! Does it make you nervous to direct and take on that role?Yeah. It makes me excited and really nervous. I think it would be foolish if I wasn’t nervous. I’m really looking forward to the challenge and I’ve surrounded myself with the most amazing people. I’m really lucky to be able to tap into the resources that I have and I feel like I have great people in my corner and they’re really guiding me. Having great producers and a great director of photography and a great production designer, I feel like I don’t have to do as much. [Laughs]Yeah, they can handle it all, right?!The secret of delegation, really!But that’s what it’s all about as a director, hiring those you know will bring something to the table.Yes, who are going to take care of me and steer me through it. Exactly.With all this Oscar chatter about no women being nominated in the directing category, why do you think it’s important to see more women behind the camera?There’s been a lot of talk in the last year or two about more roles for women, but I think that it really starts at getting more women in positions to hire women and make movies about women and to cast women in movies. So yes, having more women behind the camera is just as, if not more, important than still continuing to try and make more roles for women in Hollywood, in television and in film. And I’m excited to be a part of that.Tell me about those roles you’re so well-known for -- “The Wedding Planner,” “13 Going on 30” -- you played the quintessential on-screen best friend, and you’re so good at it.Thank you!

K. Butterfield said. “The CBC was among the first to demand a thorough federal investigation of the Flint water crisis and we will be among those visiting with Flint families to further amplify the urgency of this situation.”Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.), a native of Flint, helped organize the event with Butterfield, Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.) and Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), the co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.Kildee helped mobilize support, briefing CBC members on the Flint crisis in a series of meetings.“What is happening in my hometown breaks my heart. Resources are needed right now for Flint and the families, particularly children, who are the victims of this terrible tragedy,” Kildee said in a release. “Governor Snyder, whose administration’s policies created this public health emergency, has a moral obligation to help the victims of this crisis.”And getting members to Flint and putting boots on the ground is important, since congressmen didn’t fully understand until a few weeks ago how dire the situation is.“Frankly, members of Congress were not aware of the problem until the last six or eight weeks. People knew there was a problem but it really didn’t come up to a national recognition,” Rep. Robert “Bobby” Scott (D-Va.) told The Huffington Post. “Obviously there needs to be an immediate response. There are short term and long term responses that have to be made. The health effects are permanent and long term.”The CBC has been busy this week. On Thursday, it formally announced that the caucus’ political action committee would endorse Hillary Clinton for president. Clinton has courted the black vote, earning strong support from African-Americans and even holding campaign events in Flint last weekend.Additional details about the upcoming event in Flint haven’t been released, but will be in the coming weeks.Other members of the caucus believe what happened in Flint wouldn’t have happened in a more affluent community.“You can not have, in 2016, 100,000 people unable to get clean drinking water out of their [pipes]. That’s unconscionable,” Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) told HuffPost. “I am convinced that, you know, we have a lot of people who are very poor and who are minorities and we have people who many of them are underprivileged. If this were in a different type of neighborhood, if it were a predominately white community, this wouldn’t happen. I think we would all be upset.”Also on HuffPost:"

Mayor Frank Johnson said the bill was a ""routine"" claim whose special circumstances had simply been overlooked. The city has said it never billed the family for the full medical services and that the claim for a past-due balance would be withdrawn.""It was a mistake of us not flagging it, but it was not a mistake in terms of the legal process,"" Johnson said during a press conference.Rice's family didn't appear to be satisfied with the apology, calling the incident and the mayor's response ""deeply disturbing"" in a statement provided to NBC.""The Rice family is disturbed by the city's behavior,"" the statement read. ""The callousness, insensitivity, and poor judgment required for the city to send a bill after its own police officers killed 12-year-old Tamir is breathtaking. This adds insult to homicide.""Rice's death launched protests and demonstrations after he was killed by a rookie police officer who'd heard on a broadcast that the boy had a gun. The officer, Timothy Loehmann, said he had yelled ""show me your hands"" to Rice, but surveillance video indicated that the officer fired shots within two seconds of leaving his vehicle. The gun Rice had been playing with was, in fact, a toy.In December, a grand jury declined to indict Loehmann and a senior officer, Frank Garmback, in the shooting of Rice. At the time, the boy's family accused prosecutor Timothy McGinty of ""abusing and manipulating the grand jury process to orchestrate a vote against indictment.""His mother, Samaria Rice, condemned the decision earlier this year, saying she was ""mad as hell.""""Due to the corrupt system, I have a dead child.

14,SPORTS,5 Bold Predictions For The Second Half Of The NBA Season,Jordan Schultz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nba-predictions-2016-second-half_us_56bb3c16e4b0c3c5504f763c,Should the Cavs give up on Kevin Love and will the Warriors and Spurs make history together?,2016-02-11,"San Antonio's Kawhi Leonard, Cleveland's LeBron James and Golden State's Stephen Curry will all have something to say regarding the NBA's second half.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56bbb2e01f00000d01217c6c.jpeg?cache=IPOkgzI4vB&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Alas, the 2016 All-Star Weekend is almost here, and for the first time ever, the league has taken its All-Star Game outside of the United States, into Toronto.With the defending champion Golden State Warriors rolling, whether or not the Spurs can knock them off their perch remains to be seen. But for the first time ever, the NBA has two teams with 42 wins through 50 games. How can we forget about the Jekyll and Hyde Cavs in the East? Will they be dethroned? Oh, and there's that little Blake Griffin drama as well.With that in mind, here are five bold predictions for what promises to be a lively, if not unconventional, second half of the NBA season. The Cavs Won't Make The FinalsThis is more obvious than everyone wants to admit. Despite LeBron James' herculean efforts -- his 26.87 PER ranks fourth in the league -- this remains an unbalanced basketball team with an immensely dysfunctional offense that has yet to figure out how to thrive with both Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love. The Tyronn Lue experiment has yielded mixed results thus far, but don't forget that Cleveland ranks just 10th in field goal percentage and 9th in 3-point percentage.Perhaps the biggest question mark moving forward is how much Lue actually wants to run and if Love accepts his role playing with the second unit. But just as importantly is the fact that the East features an upstart Raptors team on the verge of its first 50-win season in franchise history. What makes Toronto -- winners of 14 of 16 games -- so tough is a steadfast commitment to quality defense, a trait that head coach Dwane Casey has demanded. His young team has responded and ranks better in overall defensive efficiency than the Cavs. Plus, the two-headed monster of All-Stars Kyle Lowry (21 points per game on 39 percent 3-point shooting) and DeMar DeRozan (23 points, 4 assists) is a formidable opponent on the perimeter. The Cavs, undoubtedly, are in trouble.Clippers Won't Make It Out Of First RoundLast year's epic 3-1 collapse in the conference semis at the hands of Houston reaffirmed what I and many others have said during the Chris Paul era: The Clippers, despite elite talent, are not a championship basketball team. The 2015-16 season has involved plenty of wins to be sure, but we are once again left to speculate just what exactly is wrong with this team. The Griffin drama is significant because he remains an enigma: A great player, yes, but is he a guy you can legitimately build around? That seems debatable at best, but what isn't debatable is that Paul has never himself even reached the conference finals. A basketball Houdini with every trick in the book, Paul is approaching his 31st birthday on a team that features championship-level talent and coaching, but not championship-level execution.The Western Conference, meanwhile, is full of land mines every which way you look. Assuming the Clips don't finish higher than the fourth seed -- they will enter the break 4.5 games behind red-hot Oklahoma City in the third spot -- that means potential dates with feisty Memphis, crafty veteran-laden Dallas or even upstart Utah loom in the opening round of the postseason. Two Teams Will Win 70 Games!The league's lone 70-game winner was Michael Jordan's 1996 Bulls, which won a record 72 en route to the title. But conventional wisdom simply doesn't make sense with the Warriors and Spurs -- not this year at least.Neither team has yet to lose a home game, and while we can't help but think of the Splash Brothers and the stellar duo of Kawhi Leonard and LaMarcus Aldridge -- who is averaging nearly 26 points in six straight February victories -- the unsung anchor of both teams is defense. Golden State, for the second straight year, ranks first in defensive efficiency. San Antonio -- as I recently chronicled -- ranks third in field goal percentage allowed and is tied for first in opponent points per shot.The hard thing to understand about the NBA is just how grueling an 82-game schedule becomes. Back-to-backs, though less frequent than years past, take their toll, and lockdown defense is about the only thing you can control. Both the Warriors and Spurs employ extremely deep lineups that only enhance the defense-minded approach of Steve Kerr and Gregg Popovich.This Is It For Durant And WestbrookMaybe OKC's window has passed, maybe it hasn't. But the megastar Kevin Durant-Russell Westbrook tandem is down to its final act for the Thunder. Durant, 27, will become a free agent after this season and several teams -- including his hometown Washington Wizards -- will have enough cap space to sign him. Meanwhile, 27-year-old Westbrook, a Southern California native who starred for UCLA, hasn't been thrilled with newly minted head coach Billy Donovan, according to a source. He himself enters the free agency market following the 2017 season.During their eight seasons together, KD and Westbrook have been one of the game's most explosive and exciting duos, but have also fallen short when it matters most. Their one finals appearance came in 2012, when LeBron's Big Three ousted them in five games -- and don't forget either that the prodigious scorer James Harden was on their squad as well.The Thunder, for all of their athletic prowess and talent, have never been tough enough, mature enough or disciplined enough to capture a championship. One has to wonder if they aren't dissimilar to the really good but not great teams of the '90s -- think Seattle, Utah, New York -- that could never overcome MJ's Bulls or Hakeem Olajuwon's Rockets. After OKC fails to get it done this year, we can expect a monumental change: Either Durant will jump ship or Westbrook will be dealt in fear of him not resigning the following summer.Love Will Be TradedFor a double-double machine -- as Love has been throughout his tenure in Cleveland -- he certainly draws ire for more than he probably deserves. In fact, the 27-year-old power forward has rebounded at a more efficient clip this year. Then again, GM David Griffin didn't deal potential superstar Andrew Wiggins for a far less efficient Love than his All-NBA days in Minnesota. The recent firing of coach David Blatt was strange because no coach with that record had ever been fired. Lue's responsibility in large part will be to incorporate Love into the half-court offense: Get him block touches and mid-post looks, and even use him as a playmaker, not merely a pick-and-pop 3-point shooter. Surely Lue knows that the window to win is rapidly closing.Love -- who signed a five-year, $110 million extension last July -- still commands a hefty trade price. It might behoove Griffin to trade him before the deadline. The Cavs have a plethora of capable bigs and there would be plenty of suitors for Love that have enough cap to absorb his max salary.Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com or ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram at @Schultz_Report.

But for the first time ever, the NBA has two teams with 42 wins through 50 games. How can we forget about the Jekyll and Hyde Cavs in the East? Will they be dethroned? Oh, and there's that little Blake Griffin drama as well.With that in mind, here are five bold predictions for what promises to be a lively, if not unconventional, second half of the NBA season. The Cavs Won't Make The FinalsThis is more obvious than everyone wants to admit. Despite LeBron James' herculean efforts -- his 26.87 PER ranks fourth in the league -- this remains an unbalanced basketball team with an immensely dysfunctional offense that has yet to figure out how to thrive with both Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love. The Tyronn Lue experiment has yielded mixed results thus far, but don't forget that Cleveland ranks just 10th in field goal percentage and 9th in 3-point percentage.Perhaps the biggest question mark moving forward is how much Lue actually wants to run and if Love accepts his role playing with the second unit. But just as importantly is the fact that the East features an upstart Raptors team on the verge of its first 50-win season in franchise history. What makes Toronto -- winners of 14 of 16 games -- so tough is a steadfast commitment to quality defense, a trait that head coach Dwane Casey has demanded. His young team has responded and ranks better in overall defensive efficiency than the Cavs. Plus, the two-headed monster of All-Stars Kyle Lowry (21 points per game on 39 percent 3-point shooting) and DeMar DeRozan (23 points, 4 assists) is a formidable opponent on the perimeter.

16,POLITICS,Non-Tenure-Track Professors At Duke Move To Hold A Union Election,Samantha Lachman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/duke-university-professors-union_us_56bcda88e4b0b40245c5b5db,The nationwide movement for better pay and benefits expands to the South.,2016-02-11,Non-tenure track faculty at Duke moved to hold a union election at the university Thursday. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56bcded31800006f0080bc9a.jpeg?ops=crop_8_218_4248_2614%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Duke University’s non-tenure-track faculty filed a petition with the National Labor Relations Board Thursday to hold a union election, as they attempt to join the thousands of non-tenured professors across the country who have unionized in the last few years to bargain for higher pay, benefits and job security. U.S. colleges and universities have increasingly relied on cheap non-tenure-track professors to keep their costs down, even as tuition prices rise. This category of professors now makes up between half and three-quarters of all university faculty nationwide; in the 1970s, roughly 70 percent of college instructors were tenured professors or on the tenure track. Unlike tenured professors, adjuncts often sign year-to-year or semester-to-semester contracts. Their pay can be paltry, and few receive health benefits. In response, more than 20,000 adjuncts, tenure-track professors and graduate student employees have unionized at more than 70 private and public schools since the beginning of 2012.Duke’s non-tenure-track faculty, who have joined together in a campaign called Duke Teaching First, hope to be represented by the 2-million-member Service Employees International Union, which has launched a new Faculty Forward effort on campuses across the country. The SEIU has successfully unionized adjuncts and other faculty at over 35 schools in the last three years.Organizing efforts at universities have often happened regionally, with multiple schools in cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston and D.C. unionizing around the same time. Duke’s union push is unprecedented in that it’s happening in North Carolina, a right-to-work state with the nation’s second lowest union membership rate. Matteo Gilebbi, a lecturing fellow in Romance Studies who has taught at the university since 2009, told The Huffington Post that he got involved with the effort nearly a year ago after colleagues began to informally meet to discuss shared concerns about their working conditions.“One reason I am motivated to take part in this is that this is part of a larger movement for the democratization of higher education that is fighting against the dangerous transformation of universities into corporations,” he wrote in an email.Filing union authorization cards with the local NLRB office in Winston-Salem is the first legal step to forming a union. The Duke non-tenure-track faculty will now decide who is eligible to vote in the election, which will likely happen before the end of the semester. Those who are eligible to vote will vote by mail; the union will go forward if a majority of those who vote opt to be represented by the SEIU for collective bargaining.“We are assessing the petition now and will abide by the federal guidelines outlined by the National Labor Relations Board for responding to it,” said Michael Schoenfeld, the university’s vice president for public affairs and government relations. “We also respect the rights of our faculty members to seek information, review the implications and decide whether to seek union representation or not.""Duke’s administration raised the community’s ire last year when it launched a website called “One-to-One,” with the tagline “You are your own best representative,” to discourage the union campaign.The website noted that “Signing a union authorization card is a serious step that has legal consequences.” In a frequently asked questions section, the university suggested that employees could end up with fewer benefits after collective bargaining occurs and warned that Duke doesn’t have to agree to any of the union’s demands.Duke Teaching First responded by cheekily correcting the administration’s language regarding the organizing effort with a red pen. The campaign has highlighted how unions at other universities have resulted in guaranteed wage increases and compensation if classes adjuncts are hired to teach are canceled.“It was pretty ineffectual as far as scaring people goes,” said Jaybird O’Berski, an assistant professor of the practice in the Theater Studies department who has taught at the university for eight years. Ashlyn Nuckols, a sophomore and member of Duke United Students Against Sweatshops, which has advocated for the union campaign, said that she had seen student support for the effort grow as students recognize “how security and representation for faculty affects our own academic experience.”“The condescending and frankly unprofessional attitude that the Duke Administration has taken towards the prospect of unionization has actually galvanized student support for faculty,” she wrote in an email. “The language used on the administration-sponsored, anti-union website 'One-to-One' is not only blatantly condescending but also demonstrates a complete disconnect from the difficulty many faculty members face while trying to navigate the university bureaucracy. From a moral standpoint, I want to go to a school where I know that all employees feel respected and secure in their jobs.”Multiple non-tenure-track professors told HuffPost they wanted to “have a seat at the table” regarding decisions made by their departments and the university as a whole, and to have more of a voice in the school’s direction. The professors argue that having more job stability would make them better teachers, since those on short-term contracts aren’t able to adequately prepare for their classes if they don’t know whether they’re actually going to be teaching until a few weeks before the semester begins.“It’s exciting to enter the next phase of the conversation because it’s sort of been a hypothetical until this point,” said Jim Haverkamp, an instructor in the Arts of the Moving Image department who started teaching at Duke five years ago. “This adds some nice urgency to the message, since we can now ask colleagues if they’re interested in joining this conversation. In some ways the work starts now because we now have to focus on reaching out to as many folks as we can.”"
17,POLITICS,House Conservatives Claim Democrats Have Failed Black Communities,Tyler Tynes,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-democrats-black-communities_us_56bcefc5e4b08ffac1246b85,None of them said they had plans for celebrating Black History Month.,2016-02-11,Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho) wondered on Thursday whether the Republican Party had done enough to attract black voters.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5874123f1b00008d016e67b6.jpeg?cache=PJCJKneSDw&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- During a monthly Conversations with Conservatives panel with reporters on Thursday, some Republican congressmen chastised their party for not doing enough to court black voters. Though the panel of conservatives avoided a specific question about whether they'd planned any events to commemorate Black History Month -- which seems to suggest they hadn't -- they did attempt to answer a larger question: Why do people of color seem to prefer the Democratic Party?Rep. Raúl Labrador (R-Idaho) claimed that both parties had failed America’s black communities, though Labrador, a conservative born in Puerto Rico, said Republicans didn't get enough recognition for the diversity in their ranks.“For the top four finishers in Iowa, there were two Hispanics, an African-American and an orange man,"" Labrador said of Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Dr. Ben Carson, and racist, sexist demagogue Donald Trump.He added that the districts Democrats represent include some of the poorest and most urban areas of the country, and asserted that Democrats hadn't done enough to improve their constituents' lives.“What the Democratic politicians do is pander to them and tell them that they care, but they don’t show them the policies that bring back prosperity and economic growth to their communities. That’s a really big problem, because what you see is generations and generations of young people moving forward in a way they cannot succeed,” Labrador said.“We need to do a better job of reaching out to the African-American community, and we need to do a better job of showing the African-American community how the policies of the Democratic party are failing them,” he added.Republicans say they want to reach out to black communities. They think their party has to do a better job of attracting minorities. They just don't seem to be doing that much of it yet.“What’s been missing on the Republican side is reaching out to the black community. I find that in a lot of districts, people aren’t even reaching out to their constituents,” Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) said. “I’ve made an effort to my district to reach out to the black community and hold events and understand concerns ... I do my part to reach out, and I think it’s important that we do more of that as a party. We have a lot to offer to everyone.”Other panelists also made statements about the lack of communication between Republican politicians and black communities. A top-down, government-centered model isn’t going to assist black communities, the conservatives said. They argued that there needs to be a nuanced approach to relationship-building in individual congressional districts to make the Republican party more appealing to black voters.Don’t tell that to Rep. Louis Gohmert (R-Texas), however. He said it’s the media’s fault there hasn’t been enough exposure of the Republican party's positive relations with black Americans.Before being elected, Gohmert said, he didn’t understand the need for predominantly black colleges, though his stance has changed since visiting the institutions.“Some of us do reach out; it just never makes the media,” Gohmert said. “We see the middle class getting fewer while the gap between the poor and rich is getting wider, and it’s these policies. I know a lot of us reach out and try to have a good relationship with every aspect. Skin color doesn’t matter. Gender doesn’t matter. Religion doesn’t matter.”Most of Gohmert’s colleagues on the panel agreed. Some also proposed a change in strategy: The way to get more black voters? Convince them that the Democratic Party stands for corporate America.“Republicans are more and more the party that opposes corporate welfare,"" Amash said. ""I don’t know if that was the case 10 or 20 years ago, but it’s moved significantly in that direction.""""That’s one area where we can show people throughout the country, whatever community they belong to, that we are the party of all Americans,"" he added. ""We are the party of economic opportunity.”Also on HuffPost:"

The event labels the ""Formation"" singer's halftime performance a ""race-baiting stunt"" and a ""slap in the face to law enforcement.""""Come and let's stand together. Let's tell the NFL we don't want hate speech & racism at the Superbowl ever again!"" the event description reads.Beyonce dropped her latest track and video one day before she joined Coldplay and Bruno Mars on stage at Super Bowl 50. The video, which unflinchingly tackles issues like the post-Hurricane Katrina response in New Orleans, police brutality and black womanhood, was a highly praised instant sensation.But the song and video's message -- coupled with Beyonce's halftime show that featured dancers fashioned after Black Panther members -- also drew sharp rebuke from critics in the ""All Lives Matter"" and ""Blue Lives Matter"" camps, the latter referring to police officers. Hashtags of both slogans were used to promote the protest, in addition to #BoycottBeyonce. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani was among the most prominent critics of the show.“I thought it was really outrageous that she used it as a platform to attack police officers, who are the people who protect her and protect us, and keep us alive,” the Republican former mayor said on Fox News the morning after the performance. “What we should be doing in the African-American community, and all communities, is build up respect for police officers."" Kevin Allred, an adjunct lecturer at Rutgers University who teaches a class on the politics of Beyonce, said the criticism of her was unsurprising but still woefully misguided.""I do think it’s a hateful action and a very privileged one,"" Allred said of the anti-Beyonce protest. He also noted her Super Bowl performance did not mention police. ""It’s people who aren’t thinking critically. They’re getting mad at her calling out an injustice rather than being mad at the injustice itself.""""She’s getting a pushback black women have been getting for years and years,"" Allred added. In response to the protest event planned for Tuesday, a protest against the protest has cropped up -- at the same time and place. Organizers of neither event immediately responded to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for Eventbrite, the event planning platform used by both groups, said the company is aware of both events. Spokeswoman Terrah Carmichael said the company was a ""neutral self-service platform"" for making events. ""That said, we recognize some of the content on Eventbrite might be controversial. But like many social platforms, we respect and honor free speech,"" Carmichael said, noting events are removed if they violate the terms of service agreement. While Beyonce has always been political, Allred said her songs have typically had other elements for listeners to grab on to if they don't want to engage with her commentary on topics like female empowerment or sexuality. ""'Formation,' however, leaves no wiggle room,"" Allred said. ""It explicitly brings to life issues around Black Lives Matter, police brutality, the aftermath of Katrina, the issues facing black LGBT communities. [Listeners] don’t have an out.""

19,THE WORLDPOST,Photographer Captures Remnants Of Shanghai's Past As It Moves To The Future,Alexandra Ma,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/graham-fink-china-shanghai-graffiti_us_56bba9cee4b0c3c5504fee26,"""I've never seen progress happen so fast anywhere else. There's a real can-do attitude in China.""",2016-02-11,"British photographer Graham Fink talks to The WorldPost about why he chose to photograph Shanghai's demolition sites that capture the country's latent creativity. This photograph is named ""Big Dreams.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56bb68ff1f00007f00217b8d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"Shanghai-based British photographer Graham Fink considers demolition sites to be places where magic happens. He believes the rubble is where the past meets the future, and where China's graffiti artists can let their creativity bloom.Fink has traveled around Shanghai since July 2011 to photograph buildings that were torn down to make way for modern, functional structures like office buildings and skyscrapers. His ""Ballads of Shanghai"" photo project is currently on display at the Riflemaker Gallery in London, in an exhibit that will run until Saturday.Shanghai is one of the world's largest financial hubs and home to over 24 million residents, but it started with humble beginnings. Located on China's east coast, it was once a small fishing village. The words ""shanghai"" literally mean ""on the water"" in Chinese.The city became an international port to foreign traders as part of the 1842 Treaty of Nanjing between China and Britain. Foreign powers, including France, Britain and America, began flooding into Shanghai. They took control over ""concessions,"" or various parts of the city, to which they brought Western laws, art, architecture and culture. This transformed Shanghai into an international city with the nickname ""Paris of the East.""But after Mao Zedong's Communist Party took over China in 1949, the government turned Shanghai into a chiefly industrial zone, and many of the city's foreigners left. What used to be an exciting international metropolis became culturally insular to the outside world.Life under Mao's communism stifled Chinese creativity, Fink said. Only with the country's gradual reopening to the West through social media and travel have Chinese people begun reawakening their artistic natures, as can be demonstrated by the various graffiti sprinkled around the city, the photographer added. Why did you feel it was important to document Shanghai's urbanization?There's a lot of building going on in Shanghai. They're knocking down houses and building office blocks, super structures, skyscrapers, etc. I see these demolition sites as ""exchange sites,"" where they're exchanging the past for the future.To a lot of Chinese people, the rubble and destruction may come off as a negative thing, but I see a lot of beauty in it. Ever since I was a kid, I feel very happy when I'm amongst rubble, things that have been torn down and derelict buildings and rubbish dumps. The sites are constantly changing, constantly evolving. I call Shanghai a Darwinian metropolis. It just keeps evolving, keeps evolving, keeps evolving. Sometimes, when I go back to a site I visited weeks before, graffiti artists have moved in. A week later, the government has painted over the graffiti with a gray roller. Then a few weeks later, more graffiti will appear; then a few weeks later, they've started pulling down the building and constructing a new one. What has the photo project taught you about China's changing attitudes toward art, architecture and space?I've lived in Shanghai for four and a half years, and I've never seen progress happen so fast anywhere else. There's a real can-do attitude in China. After the Cultural Revolution, a lot of the creativity was buried, and today, many Chinese artists are now looking into their roots to find their real DNA, find out what they really stand for.There's a big desire to learn and a lot of Chinese want to do great work. They look and they listen. There is a tremendous willingness. I find Chinese people very humble.What drew you to photographing abandoned places, where people mostly appear as the subjects of the graffiti art painted on demolished walls?It's kind of like discovering things. A lot of the buildings being constructed in Shanghai now are great structures with glass and steel, and they're all very functional. But to me, they're not particularly interesting. I've always liked stuff that is a bit more rough around the edges, that has a sort of grit behind behind the glamor. There's this picture of Mao Zedong in the wall that's flaking off. When someone painted that image, it would have been all perfect, but I like the idea that it's a little destroyed, it's a bit more decayed. The sun came out right while I was shooting that picture, so you've got three parts to that picture. On the right-hand side, you have a cage, which could represent the Cultural Revolution and creativity being caged. On the left-hand side, you've got a ray of sunshine, which is like the future. Is there a photo that is particularly poignant to you?There's one where there's a knocked-through window, and behind you see all of the rubble and destruction of what has been knocked down. (The photograph, above, is named ""You've Been Framed."") On the left-hand side, through the window frame, you can see, if you look really carefully, a woman in a pink jacket putting up her washing.It's almost as if she's clinging on. Everything around her is being knocked down, people have moved out, but she is a fighter. She's determined, she's got to stay there, she's getting on with her life. She must be affected by this kind of stuff, but she's a fighter. There's something I find very beautiful about that.It's like seeing a plant that grows through a piece of concrete. A plant is a very delicate thing, but strong enough to grow through concrete, and I think it's real determination with these people -- they're going to fight.

The organization detailed Mustafa al Hawsawi’s extensive untreated medical conditions in a letter released Wednesday written by Amnesty's interim executive director, Margaret Huang, to the Pentagon’s assistant secretary for health affairs, Dr. Jonathan Woodson. Huang urged the government to fulfill its responsibility under international law to rehabilitate victims of U.S. torture. The Amnesty letter is the latest in a series of appeals on behalf of al Hawsawi, one of five alleged conspirators of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Before being transferred to Guantanamo Bay in 2006, al Hawsawi was detained for three years at CIA black sites. The Senate intelligence committee’s investigation into torture at these black sites revealed that after being exposed to “rectal exams [that] were conducted with 'excessive force,'” al Hawsawi was diagnosed with chronic hemorrhoids, an anal fissure and rectal prolapse, according to a December 2014 summary.The executive summary of the Senate torture report says that the CIA tried unsuccessfully at one point to admit al Hawsawi to a local hospital for “acute ailments,"" but does not detail why the agency wanted to hospitalize him. Now, al Hawsawi’s condition forces him to physically reinsert tissue back into his rectal cavity every time he defecates. To minimize this painful process, he limits the amount of food and water he consumes, Huang wrote in the letter to the Pentagon. Since mid-2014, there has been blood present in al Hawsawi’s urine and his lawyers say he has not yet had the necessary tests to rule out cancer. He suffers from degenerative disc disease, kidney stones, chronic migraines and is diagnosed with Hepatitis C -- a condition he did not have before entering CIA custody, according to his lawyers. Further complicating al Hawsawi’s medical treatment is the classification of much of his medical records. Navy Cmdr. Walter Ruiz, who represents al Hawsawi, says that the records his team does get access to are incomplete, provided on a sixth-month delay and are partially redacted.“We do not know the full scope of Mustafa al-Hawsawi’s continuing trauma and injury arising from torture, ill-treatment and other human rights violations by U.S. government,” Huang wrote in the letter, noting that the full, 6,700-page Senate report, which could shed more light on al Hawsawi’s treatment in CIA black sites, is still under seal. The United Nations Convention Against Torture, which the U.S. is party to, requires signatory states to provide victims of torture with redress, “including the means for as full rehabilitation as possible” -- which is widely interpreted to mean medical and psychological treatment and, in some cases, financial compensation. Right now, al Hawsawi’s defense counsel is focused on addressing his immediate health concerns -- specifically, treating the rectal prolapse and determining whether or not he has cancer. Rectal prolapse can be repaired through surgery, but Ruiz says that option hasn’t been made available -- and he isn’t even sure the detainee’s medical center at Guantanamo has the medical specialists and the equipment needed to safely do the surgery. “Like anyone facing a complicated medical procedure, he wants to understand it,” Ruiz said of al Hawsawi. But, he continued, no doctor on the island has a comprehensive understanding of his client's medical history or existing conditions. “The medical professionals here... they tend to be on six-month tours. That makes it very difficult to have continuity,” he said.The Amnesty International letter requests that the government provide al-Hawsawi with a medical assessment and treatment from an independent doctor -- in part because it is hard to envision al-Hawsawi trusting medical advice from physicians employed by the same government that tortured him.“We know now that the U.S. involved medical personnel in conducting torture and monitoring its impact,” said Naureen Shah, the director of Amnesty's security and human rights program. “That makes a request for an independent physician's care all the more understandable and reasonable.” Last year, a report revealed that psychologists were complicit in the CIA’s torture program. A Pentagon spokesman declined to answer questions about al Hawsawi’s health or broader questions about how the prison treats injuries resulting from torture in CIA black sites. “We do not comment on medical treatment for specific detainees. All detainees are provided medical and dental care equivalent to that received by U.S. service members serving there,” Cmdr. Gary Ross wrote in an email, noting that detainees are treated in accordance wiht international law.He added, ""Detainees are treated at a dedicated facility with state-of-the-art equipment and an expert medical staff. More serious medical conditions can be treated at the naval base hospital operating room and intensive-care unit. Specialists are available to provide care at GTMO for any medical needs that exceed the capabilities of the naval base hospital.""Ruiz has heard the comparison to soldiers' medical care before and referenced it without prompting. ""I’ve heard that 100 times,"" he said. ""Well, if they get the same degree of care as our armed forces, then I’m really alarmed about the degree of care our armed forces are getting.”The public guide on medical treatment for Guantanamo detainees, which was drafted in 2006, does say that treatment of detainees should be held to the same standards applied to the U.S. Armed Forces “to the extent practicable.” It requires medical records be maintained, but does not indicate whether prisoners should have access to their records.Some hoped that the public release of the Senate torture report summary would prompt changes at the prison. It was the first time the U.S. government was forced to publicly acknowledge it tortured several detainees still held at Guantanamo Bay. If the government admitted to torturing some prisoners, logic followed, it would accept responsibility for rehabilitating them.That didn’t happen.Just after the public release of the Senate torture report, al Hawsawi’s legal team filed an emergency motion with the military commissions -- the war court where the accused Sept. 11 co-conspirators are being tried at Guantanamo Bay. In the motion, his legal team asked the judge to order the government to give al Hawsawi immediate medical attention for his outstanding health problems and provide him with his medical records. Judge James L. Pohl denied the request, ruling that the medical care provided to detainees at Guantanamo was out of his jurisdiction.Having exhausted options within Guantanamo Bay’s court system, al Hawsawi’s legal team turned to the federal court for help. The attorneys filed a habeas petition to a federal court in Washington, requesting a hold on al Hawsawi's war court proceedings, an independent medical assessment and access to all of his medical records since his capture in 2003. (They cited a 2014 case that ruled that detainees could challenge their conditions of confinement). The federal court denied the petition, writing that the lawyers could request that information in the discovery phase of the trial at Guantanamo Bay.The defense team has also sought intervention from the Organization of American States’ human rights commission. In July, the commission warned the U.S. that al Hawsawi’s conditions of confinement “threaten [his] life and personal integrity” and asked the government for a written explanation of how it would address his deteriorating health. It did not receive a response. Meanwhile, al Hawsawi faces the death penalty for his alleged involvement in the Sept. 11 attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people. The military commissions system has proven increasingly ill-suited to trying accused war criminals. The latest delay in the 9/11 case was linked to an attempt by the FBI to infiltrate one of the defense teams. The case is still in the pre-trial phase -- nearly four years since the five accused co-conspirators were arraigned. “What’s unsaid, what really is the reason why this hasn’t happened is because Mr. Hawsawi and these other men are seen as unworthy of rehabilitation,” Ruiz said. “They’re here for one purpose, and one purpose alone: to kill them under the guise of a fair and just system.”Also on HuffPost:"

Previous Netexplo winners include Twitter and Slack.Iko, a prosthetic arm, can be customized with Lego pieces of different colors and shapes, giving the children who wear them a chance for self-expression. Lego bricks are attached to a battery-powered prosthetic arm and a 3D-printed socket. The arm is designed for children between ages 3 and 12, and aims to reduce the stigma around having a prosthetic limb.Carlos Arturo Torres, who started developing Iko while doing an internship at Lego’s experimental research department, Future Lab, is continuing to work on the project, and hopes to launch the product in mid-2017. ""Legos around the prosthetic allow the child to adapt the object,"" Torres told HuffPost France. ""He can choose when he wants to use the object and when he doesn’t. He's in control.""""If children could set up their own prosthesis, that would be ideal. For them to have fun, create; quite simply, be children,"" the Colombian inventor said.As he accepted the award, Torres also explained the importance of using objects children were already familiar with.""The magic of this project is finding tools that already work in the real world: Legos,"" Torres said. ""They allow children to try out the object, the prosthetic, without being afraid of it.""While the concept is appealing, fundraising is proving to be challenging. To nudge investors, children have penned letters to large companies informing them of the invention.The technology is another obstacle to the project's progress. ""Connecting the prosthesis to Legos via electricity hasn't been an easy task. Today, we prefer going the Bluetooth route, which would be able to communicate with cell phones,” Torres explained. ""We are very close to completing this second prototype, and we're appealing to investors so that research and development can continue,"" he said.Iko was in competition with nine other finalists, which were chosen from over 200 inventions from 2015.Among them was a project dubbed Wonolo, an employment agency that allows employers, companies or private individuals to find the ideal candidate and set pay according to the person's ratings and the job difficulty. Another notable innovation are ""microswimmer robots"" created by researchers from Drexel University in Philadelphia. The miniaturized robots could be used in complicated surgery by unblocking arteries or delivering medication to a precise location in a patient's body.This post first appeared on HuffPost France.

""Turkey is becoming a version of Syria.""It's unclear how the U.S. can stop that from happening as each day brings more bad news for two of its partners: an ethnic group on the front lines against the so-called Islamic State, and a country that has long been an essential American ally in the Muslim world.(The State Department did not immediately respond to a Huffington Post request for more information on the meeting, but spokesman Mark Toner did not deny that it occurred when asked about it in Wednesday's press briefing.)Human rights advocates say hundreds of civilians have been killed since the decades-long conflict between the Turkish government and the Kurdish insurgency reignited in July of last year. The United Nations this month asked Turkey to investigate a claim that security forces wounded 10 unarmed civilians in a January incident.""This is not a war between the government and the PKK,"" Baydemir said, referring to the chief Kurdish militant group, which is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey and its allies in the West. ""The current war is a war that has been declared on civilians by the state.""Turkey's government said this week that its operations had killed 749 militants in the Kurd-dominated towns of Diyarbakir and Cizre since December. Kurdish resistance fighters have killed more than 200 Turkish soldiers and policemen since July.The fighting began in July after an Islamic State-linked attack killed 30 youth activists planning to travel to help the Kurdish town of Kobani in Syria. The incident sparked anger among Kurds in Turkey, who make up 18-20 percent of the population. Some Kurds in both Turkey and Syria had long argued that the Turkish government was allowing the Islamic State and other armed extremists license to travel across the Turkey-Syria border to weaken Syria's government. Kurdish militants responded with an attack on Turkish policemen, and Turkey promptly began bombing PKK bases in Iraq and imposing restrictions on civil liberties in the southeast.The growing power of the the Kurds in Syria -- most of whom are loyal to a PKK-tied political organization called the PYD -- is one reason the current conflict between Turkey and Kurdish dissidents is more volatile than it's ever been.Turkey sees their success at holding and capturing territory in Syria (recently with support from the U.S.) as a threat because it might inspire calls for more autonomy among Turkey's Kurds, many of whom have joined the PYD-aligned militia. That has left Turkey, the U.S. and the Kurds on both sides of the Syria-Turkey border in a delicate dance -- as U.S. planes fly to help the Kurds battle ISIS from a base in Turkey, Turkish planes are bombing allied Kurds in Iraq's Kurd-controlled northeast.Kurds in Turkey believe that despite the complications in its strategy, the Obama administration is the best possible advocate they can have, Baydemir argued.""It's the country that has the most potential to get results,"" he said. The Kurds believe Europe is unwilling to anger Turkey for fear it will renege on promises to keep more Syrian refugees from crossing into the continent.It's possible for Washington to change Ankara's thinking, Baydemir argued, pointing to its success in winning Turkish approval for the creation of a quasi-autonomous Kurdish region in Iraq.Though that region has since become a Kurdish power player that enjoys good relations with Turkey, Baydemir said it's unable to play a decisive role beyond encouraging diplomacy and showing Turks they can work with Kurds who have gained greater independence.He added that Syria's Kurds, effective as they are on the ground, are unlikely to go into Turkey because that would feed into Turkish president Recep Teyyep Erdogan claims that Turkey's Kurds are foreign-backed and overtly militant.A wrinkle Baydemir didn't mention: Now that the Syrian Kurds have received U.S. arms and air support, it would be incredibly controversial for them to actively move against a NATO ally of the United States. The politician claimed the Kurds are not asking for radical steps. Those in Turkey simply want relative autonomy, Baydemir said, while those in Syria share Erdogan's goal of removing the regime of President Bashar Assad and simply disagree on how that should happen.""The Syrian regime has no redeeming qualities,"" Baydemir added. ""If the regime destroys all opposition forces, it will certainly turn its guns on the Kurds next. We know this.""Yet it's unclear whether talk about Kurdish reasonableness, by the Kurds themselves or the U.S., will have any impact on Erdogan.Max Hoffman, a Turkey analyst at the Center for American Progress, told The Huffington Post that Washington believes it can do little more than privately recommend restraint to the Turks.""The Kurds want the US to make a public stand or even use coercive pressure on other fronts to force the Turks to ease the campaign, but the US calculates that either of those steps will cause Erdogan to further demonize the US with divisive, populist rhetoric,"" Hoffman said in an email. He noted that many hardline Turks, long used to talk of Kurdish terrorism because of the 30-year insurgency, approve of harsh measures in the southeast.Erdogan's government this week berated the U.S. ambassador to Turkey over a State Department comment identifying the Syrian Kurds' militia, the YPG, as distinct from the PKK. It's a sign of how bitter the environment has become that it would do so now -- the U.S. has spoken of a line between the two groups for over a year, since it first began supporting the YPG's stand against ISIS in Kobani. (Kurds themselves say the two militant groups are often interchangeable, sharing many of the same fighters. They certainly share ideological roots, but analysts believe their command structures are separate.)Toner, the State Department spokesman, repeated yesterday that the U.S. and Turkey disagree on the status of the YPG. Still, he added, Washington was keen to support Turkish actions against the PKK.""It is in the US interest to use what leverage it has on both sides to bring them to the table,"" Hoffman wrote. ""There is no military solution for either side in the conflict, and a stable and democratic Turkey is a key US interest.""That kind of Turkey looks unattainable to skeptics of the ground like Baydemir.""Now Turkey is experiencing the most autocratic and the most totalitarian period that is has in its history,"" the lawmaker and human rights activists said Wednesday.Erdogan's government has targeted journalists working for pro-Kurdish outlets or who simply trying to offer reporting that disputes the official line. Officials have also employed striking rhetoric that Baydemir said may incite fighting between civilians, as more Turks become suspicious of Kurds living alongside them across the country.The potential for an escalated civil war is especially great, analysts say, because the Kurdish side appears to have fractured. Young angry Kurds, radicalized in rundown towns of the southeast, are now more active than the old PKK stalwarts the government is used to or the moderate pro-Kurdish HDP party. They are less likely to accept concessions or negotiations, as previous leaders of the Kurdish community did.The more the government responds to those young militants by targeting the PKK and the HDP, the fewer moderate or experienced voices remain to shepherd peace talks.Such voices are what's needed, Baydemir said.""The Kurdish issue can't be solved through violence and warfare,"" the politician argued. ""We need a return to negotiations."""

The Kurds believe Europe is unwilling to anger Turkey for fear it will renege on promises to keep more Syrian refugees from crossing into the continent.It's possible for Washington to change Ankara's thinking, Baydemir argued, pointing to its success in winning Turkish approval for the creation of a quasi-autonomous Kurdish region in Iraq.Though that region has since become a Kurdish power player that enjoys good relations with Turkey, Baydemir said it's unable to play a decisive role beyond encouraging diplomacy and showing Turks they can work with Kurds who have gained greater independence.He added that Syria's Kurds, effective as they are on the ground, are unlikely to go into Turkey because that would feed into Turkish president Recep Teyyep Erdogan claims that Turkey's Kurds are foreign-backed and overtly militant.A wrinkle Baydemir didn't mention: Now that the Syrian Kurds have received U.S. arms and air support, it would be incredibly controversial for them to actively move against a NATO ally of the United States. The politician claimed the Kurds are not asking for radical steps. Those in Turkey simply want relative autonomy, Baydemir said, while those in Syria share Erdogan's goal of removing the regime of President Bashar Assad and simply disagree on how that should happen.""The Syrian regime has no redeeming qualities,"" Baydemir added. ""If the regime destroys all opposition forces, it will certainly turn its guns on the Kurds next. We know this.""Yet it's unclear whether talk about Kurdish reasonableness, by the Kurds themselves or the U.S., will have any impact on Erdogan.Max Hoffman, a Turkey analyst at the Center for American Progress, told The Huffington Post that Washington believes it can do little more than privately recommend restraint to the Turks.""The Kurds want the US to make a public stand or even use coercive pressure on other fronts to force the Turks to ease the campaign, but the US calculates that either of those steps will cause Erdogan to further demonize the US with divisive, populist rhetoric,"" Hoffman said in an email. He noted that many hardline Turks, long used to talk of Kurdish terrorism because of the 30-year insurgency, approve of harsh measures in the southeast.Erdogan's government this week berated the U.S. ambassador to Turkey over a State Department comment identifying the Syrian Kurds' militia, the YPG, as distinct from the PKK. It's a sign of how bitter the environment has become that it would do so now -- the U.S. has spoken of a line between the two groups for over a year, since it first began supporting the YPG's stand against ISIS in Kobani. (Kurds themselves say the two militant groups are often interchangeable, sharing many of the same fighters. They certainly share ideological roots, but analysts believe their command structures are separate.)Toner, the State Department spokesman, repeated yesterday that the U.S. and Turkey disagree on the status of the YPG. Still, he added, Washington was keen to support Turkish actions against the PKK.""It is in the US interest to use what leverage it has on both sides to bring them to the table,"" Hoffman wrote. ""There is no military solution for either side in the conflict, and a stable and democratic Turkey is a key US interest.""That kind of Turkey looks unattainable to skeptics of the ground like Baydemir.""Now Turkey is experiencing the most autocratic and the most totalitarian period that is has in its history,"" the lawmaker and human rights activists said Wednesday.Erdogan's government has targeted journalists working for pro-Kurdish outlets or who simply trying to offer reporting that disputes the official line. Officials have also employed striking rhetoric that Baydemir said may incite fighting between civilians, as more Turks become suspicious of Kurds living alongside them across the country.The potential for an escalated civil war is especially great, analysts say, because the Kurdish side appears to have fractured. Young angry Kurds, radicalized in rundown towns of the southeast, are now more active than the old PKK stalwarts the government is used to or the moderate pro-Kurdish HDP party. They are less likely to accept concessions or negotiations, as previous leaders of the Kurdish community did.The more the government responds to those young militants by targeting the PKK and the HDP, the fewer moderate or experienced voices remain to shepherd peace talks.Such voices are what's needed, Baydemir said.""The Kurdish issue can't be solved through violence and warfare,"" the politician argued. ""We need a return to negotiations."""

Not that it was even close -- New Hampshire's late-breaking voters went with the herd this year, giving Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump blowout victories.And yet, it's once again time to look to the media for ""takeaways."" How much variance can these takes exhibit, given the early finishes and the decisive wins? Let's find out who made the most incisive observations and who made the same point the most emphatically with Eat The Press' authoritative ranking of the day after's New Hampshire takeaways.1. In the Granite State, Republicans wanted an ""outsider"" and Democrats wanted ""honesty."" But voters probably won't think like this in the primaries to come, right? (See also: ""Clinton Has A Trust Problem"" and ""Hillary Clinton (Still) Has A Trust Problem."")2. So much for Madeleine Albright and Gloria Steinem as surrogates. Hillary Clinton's proxies sent women straight to Sanders' camp. (See also: ""Democratic Women Aren't Rallying Behind Clinton."")3. In the end, it was hard to track the late-breakers. Voters who made up their minds in the days shortly before the vote edged toward John Kasich and Sanders. Voters who waited till the day of the primary ""broke narrowly for Clinton and Trump.""4. Does Ted Cruz have anywhere to go? Last week's winner finished third in New Hampshire, but unlike Iowa bronze medalist Marco Rubio, nobody's talking about Ted the morning after. Perhaps the Granite State is a sign that Cruz lacks the means to ""expand beyond his regional or ideological base.""5. Bad night for the aristocrats. The two winners oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. Sanders' win will have Clinton upping the rhetoric against banks and influence peddlers.6. It was an even worse night for Muslims and immigrants. New Hampshire voters really hate those guys.7. Clinton's coalition has the potential to fray. With Sanders picking up the youth vote by the bushel -- and keeping young women in his camp to boot -- there's a chance that other Democratic voters will ""give Sanders a second look.""8. Is Clinton going to panic? Given the fact that her campaign team really hates campaigning, it's anyone's guess.9. Will Clinton stop alienating voters? By contrast, alienating voters seems to be her campaign's strength at this point. Perhaps that's why a ""shake-up"" is in the offing?10. GOP is losing low-education voters to Trump. And also the well-educated.11. Kasich kept political norms on life support ... at least for a night. ""Trump won despite ignoring the traditional rules of primary politics, but John Kasich finished second -- injecting new life into his campaign -- because he followed them.""12. But Kasich is skint. Second place was sweet for the Ohio governor, but will he need to pawn his silver medal to keep his campaign going? A senior adviser says that he ""expects an infusion of donations,"" though.13. Sanders is likely to reap another wave of donations. He doesn't have Kasich's problem -- his supporters will keep him in the race to the bitter end. (See also: ""Bernie Sanders is going national."")14. Bush spent $35 million on ... whatever that was. Maybe give Kasich all that money?15. Clinton ""was smart to concede quickly."" Now she has more time to figure out what went wrong.16. Clinton will enjoy more diverse electorates pretty soon. Things get a lot less Caucasian in South Carolina and Nevada. What if they like Sanders, too, though?17. It's Bloomberg o'clock again! ""He may wait to see if South Carolina changes the race's momentum, but he can't/won't wait long."" 18. Hillary to veer left. ""A different Hillary will emerge from this primary race -- one who is far less moderate and far more committed to economic and social justice than before."" We saw this in her concession speech.19. ""'Not-Trump' Coalition In Disarray."" How long does the GOP establishment have left to keep this from becoming a Trump-Cruz contest?20. The GOP has until mid-March to figure out how to stop Trump. This is because eventually, these primaries stop dishing out consolation delegates to the losers and become winner-take-all affairs.21. Trump won broadly, with almost every slice of the GOP base. But mid-March! They'll figure it out by mid-March for sure! (See also: ""Trump voters are real"" and ""Donald Trump is for real."")22. Clinton lost broadly, with almost every slice of the Democratic base. She kept old, rich people -- you know, the sort of folks who probably got to attend her Goldman Sachs speeches.23. Rubio will have to ""over-perform in South Carolina and/or Nevada"" to have any shot. MID-MARCH, GUYS, IT'S GONNA BE FINE, YOU'LL SEE.24. Clinton ""can't afford to lose 80%"" of the youth vote going forward. She probably can't afford to lose 50 percent of them, but baby steps.25. ""A Consistent Message Helps."" But not too consistent, right, Marco?26. Experience didn't matter. ""Hillary carried voters who prioritize experience and electability,"" to no avail. (Also, Trump won.)27. Alternatively, experience does matter. ""While Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders positioned themselves as political outsiders and won big, the establishment was not entirely demolished."" Cool, cool, guess the ""establishment"" had another really great ""experience.""28. Sanders' policies will ""get a lot more scrutiny"" from the media. This could be a bad thing? Or maybe ""scrutiny"" will reveal that he's a fairly conventional American liberal, as opposed to an anthropomorphic Billy Bragg songbook. (See also: ""Brace yourself, Bernie."")29. This was a pretty bad primary for Rubio. You think? (See also: ""Marco Rubio's Bad Night."")30. Voters are mad. Establishment: smash!31. Debates are so important, man. Well, if one guy gets completely destroyed, it matters. But you'll notice that Chris Christie got no reward from voters for revealing Rubio's programming. (See also: ""Debates mattered a lot"" and ""Debates can be game-changers."")32. ""Working white class voters are up for grabs."" I don't know, man. If two-thirds of them went for Sanders and Trump, they look pretty grabbed to me.33. Jeb Bush is ""meh."" THIS JUST IN. Still have to say that he was a beneficiary of Rubio's implosion, and Christie wasn't.34. Kasich got 16 percent OMG! And it just took practically living in New Hampshire, spending all his money, and doing 100 town hall meetings to get drubbed.35. Trump and Sanders could win. File under ""Duh"": ""Trump and Sanders are the front runners, and could well win their parties' nominations.""36. You know, if you add up the votes that Kasich, Bush, Rubio, Christie and Carly Fiorina got, there's enough to beat Trump. Hey, cool, but you know that's not how voting works, right?37. ""Hillary Clinton's concession speech showed no adjustments."" Uhm, were you watching the same speech as the rest of us? There was a huge shift to issues of social justice, economic populism, human rights and equality that hadn't been articulated nearly as forcefully in previous Clinton orations.38. Hey, Kasich proved that nice guys don't finish last. Sure, I guess! They finish second and lose to ""venal"" by a 2-to-1 margin. All hail the New Niceness!39. If a Republican wins, he should make Christie the attorney general. ""Christie's takedown of Marco Rubio in Saturday's debate, which destroyed the Rubio candidacy, was worthy of Perry Mason."" Sure, man. That's what legal genius is, pointing out a guy saying the same thing over and over again.40. ""Marco Rubio Isn't The Droid You're Looking For.""

SanFrancisco nuns who serve the homeless are in danger of getting kicked out of their home after a rent hike of more than 50 percent",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586179641500002f00e9d256.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SAN FRANCISCO ― Two nuns who run a soup kitchen for the city’s needy may soon lose their home because of a steep rent increase.The storefront in the grimy Tenderloin neighborhood isn’t just a home for Sister Mary Benedicte and Sister Mary of the Angels. It’s also their base for serving 300 hot lunches three days a week to the homeless. The French-speaking nuns also provide dinner to roughly 300 destitute people each week, according to the nuns’ website.But their ability to deliver those meals was jeopardized last month, when their landlord raised the rent by 58 percent, said the nuns’ pro-bono attorney, Daniel Fitzpatrick. The rent went from $3,465 to $5,500 a month.Landlord Nick Patel reportedly told the nuns on Jan. 29 that they must pay up or vacate the premises. However, Patel’s attorney, Michael Heath, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that “no eviction is going forward” and said the landlord will meet with the sisters when he returns from traveling this week. Heath did not immediately reply to calls from The Huffington Post.The Tenderloin has historically been a lower-income neighborhood with many transients. But surging rents throughout the city have brought the real estate crunch to this hardscrabble pocket sandwiched between downtown offices and upscale Hayes Valley.Even when they were paying the lower rent, the sisters have said, they barely made ends meet by selling pastries at farmers markets.“They’re inspiring people. They keep their heads down and make their pastries. Night and day, they just cook,” Fitzpatrick said. “They’re looking for people in need. That’s their calling. “Fitzpatrick said he believes the landlord’s attempt to increase the nuns’ rent violates city housing regulations. Even though they had a commercial, month-to-month lease, the hike should have been capped at 2 percent as it is for residential properties, he said, because Patel knows the sisters live there. The nuns are from the Fraternite Notre Dame order and have operated their mission in San Francisco since 2008. They use donated foods to prepare their meals, which also get delivered to senior citizens and homebound AIDS patients. Fraternite Notre Dame was founded in France in 1977 and has missions in the United States, Niger and Haiti, according to its website.This story has been updated with comment from the nuns’ lawyer, Daniel Fitzpatrick.Also on HuffPost:"

Donald Trump embodies the dangers of both.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56baad711f00007f00217b27.jpeg?cache=I02gXRTFhz&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Is this the dawn of the age of tyranny by celebrity?That’s what the dyspeptic but very smart former New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu Sr. thinks after watching fear-mongering billionaire Donald Trump win Tuesday's primary here.“So the joke about Kanye West running in the future isn’t a joke,” he said. “We are now in a time when all you have to do is be a celebrity. You don’t have to have real positions. You don’t have to have details. You don’t have to have experience. All you have to do is be famous.”“Frankly, I’m frightened for the country,” said Sununu, who also served as chief of staff to President George H.W. Bush.Sweeping in and out of TV studios here in the last day or two before the primary, Trump conveyed the aura of the TV star he is and was, glad-handing staffers and anyone he may have recognized from other television shows.He is surrounded by an ever-growing security detail, primarily of his own men, who hover just out of camera range with a look that is adoring of the boss and menacing to anyone else.Secure (at least for now) in the knowledge of his own popularity, Trump blithely bats away detailed questions about his vague policy proposals. And when he's done, he just as blithely praises the hosts for asking questions he hasn’t answered.He represents something new, but arguably inevitable, in American democracy.There have been famous people before who have run for the highest office, but they have always been military heroes. An exception was Wendell Willkie, a well-known businessman who became the GOP nominee in 1940. But he did not run in the primaries and was chosen in convention.Trump is closer to P.T. Barnum or Walt Disney than he is to Willkie: a businessman, yes, but far better known by most American voters as the longtime host of a TV show called “The Apprentice.” An entire generation grew up watching him “fire” fake business contestants.Trump has traded on his fame from the start of his utterly unorthodox campaign: hurling personal insults through his Twitter account (which has 5 million followers); making outrageous proposals to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants and “temporarily” bar all non-American Muslims from entering the country; delighting in the use of foul and inappropriate language at his rallies.It’s a show -- a dangerous show -- that has caught the attention and even the support of a considerable slice of America.And it is one that the country's founders feared. As they drafted the U.S. Constitution and then argued for its adoption, they stressed that they were looking for -- and thought they had found -- a middle way between monarchy and the mob.But they perhaps could not have envisioned an entertainer/businessman who would try to combine the power and the danger of both the monarch and the mob together.That is what Trump is trying to do, and what he did in New Hampshire.If Trump can do it this way -- with no ground organization, with no real background in politics -- with tweets and fame and social media and manipulation of the media, well then, he has changed the nature of our system for good.“Ben Franklin famously said that the founders had created a Republic, if we could keep it,” Sununu said. “I hope we still can.”Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

""To state the obvious, these documents have a lot of public interest and the timing is important for the reasons stated by the plaintiff,"" Contreras said, according to NPR.After it blew a Jan. 29 deadline due to a mix-up over the ""interagency consultation"" process, the government had asked the court for an extension until Feb. 29 to bring forth the next batch of emails. But Vice News had urged a timelier release, noting the potential interest of primary season voters.Contreras' public frustration with the State Department drove Zoe Tillman, a National Law Journal reporter who attended Tuesday's hearing, to compile a listicle of the telltale signs when a judge is upset with you. Among other items, she noted that Contreras ordered the State Department to provide ""a detailed explanation"" for why it couldn't abide by his timeline.Since last year, tens of thousands of unclassified emails from Clinton's private server have been released in monthly bundles, all by judicial order. The Democratic presidential candidate has maintained that she did not personally send classified emails while at the State Department.Tuesday's hearing isn't the only development in the ongoing saga.In a separate freedom-of-information lawsuit over the emails, brought by the conservative group Judicial Watch, a top FBI lawyer acknowledged in a letter that the bureau is ""working on matters"" regarding Clinton's use of a private email server.The letter, which was entered in the court file on Monday, was mostly a formality. The FBI declined to reveal ""the specific focus, scope or potential targets of any such proceedings."" The bureau added that it couldn't say anything more ""without adversely affecting on-going law enforcement efforts.""In other words, it's still a mystery what, if anything, will come of the investigation, let alone whether anything that is learned will warrant a full-blown federal prosecution. Stay tuned."
33,POLITICS,Compassionate Conservatism Roars Back: John Kasich Surprises In New Hampshire,Ryan Grim,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-kasich-new-hampshire-primary_us_56ba9c27e4b0b40245c4a1aa,Will it matter going forward?,2016-02-10,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) -- Announced March 23, 2015",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55b7e4ec1d00003000143032.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Compassionate conservatism is back. Running on a message of civility, empathy and moral purpose in a race dominated by fear and race-baiting, Ohio Gov. John Kasich surged to a second-place finish Tuesday night in New Hampshire, becoming the latest in a long line of long-shot presidential candidates to use the Granite State’s famously unpredictable and independent-minded electorate to stake out a place in the primary contest.Kasich’s strong finish -- combined with the collapse of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) -- once again upends the media narrative that came out of Iowa and complicates a race that refuses to become any simpler as the pages of the calendar turn. No candidate spent more time in New Hampshire leading up to the primary than Kasich, who held over 100 town hall meetings and made himself especially accessible to voters and journalists alike.His freewheeling and conversational style made him a strong fit for the famously discerning electorate here, and his second-place showing validates -- in part, at least -- the theory that there is no replacement for retail campaigning in New Hampshire, unless you happen to be a billionaire celebrity candidate in the vein of Trump. And despite his harsh record on reproductive freedom and controversial attempts to restrict the bargaining rights of public workers in Ohio -- efforts that the state's voters overwhelmingly rejected in 2011 -- Kasich has staked out a position as a relative moderate in an extremely conservative GOP field. In a brief interview with The Huffington Post on Monday, Kasich projected the calm demeanor of a candidate comfortable in his own skin and sanguine about his chances, offering a ""take it or leave it"" approach to campaigning that ultimately served him well. ""When you cut through with a positive message, I’d love to think it’ll pay off,"" he said. ""And I guess the reason I’m relaxed is I know what this ground game’s all about. And look, I feel good about everything. It’s been a great experience. I have no regrets. None."" Kasich will face a much steeper test in remaining viable in South Carolina and other states where he has registered in the low single digits in polling and has a far weaker campaign infrastructure than the one he enjoyed in New Hampshire. His strategists hope that the Republican race will remain muddied over the next couple of weeks, with no candidate emerging as the clear favorite to challenge Trump’s frontrunner status. That would give the Midwestern Kasich space to capture a trove of delegates in the March 8 Michigan primary and the March 15 winner-take-all contest in his home state of Ohio.Conventional wisdom insisted that Kasich had written off his chances at the Republican nomination the minute he agreed to accept federal money to expand Medicaid in Ohio, and he buried them further when he put the decision in moral terms. Talking to reporters as the Ohio legislature debated whether to go along with his expansion in 2013, he made an argument for compassion. “The most important thing for this legislature to think about: Put yourself in somebody else’s shoes,"" he said. ""Put yourself in the shoes of a mother and a father of an adult child that is struggling. Walk in somebody else’s moccasins. Understand that poverty is real.""“I had a conversation with one of the members of the legislature the other day. I said, ‘I respect the fact that you believe in small government. I do, too. I also know that you’re a person of faith,'"" Kasich said. ""'Now, when you die and get to the meeting with St. Peter, he’s probably not going to ask you much about what you did about keeping government small. But he is going to ask you what you did for the poor. You better have a good answer.’ ”Kasich, who was raised Catholic and attends an Anglican church, often frames his policy decisions as moral imperatives. More than once he has suggested that he only takes political positions that he feels he could defend before the Almighty. His views on dealing with undocumented immigrants, while nowhere near the Democratic platform, are also gentler. On immigration, Kasich insists that it's not just impractical to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, but also undesirable. ""I think that a lot of these people who are here are some of the hardest-working, God-fearing, family-oriented people you can ever meet,"" Kasich told a New Hampshire audience last August.That Kasich could maintain these positions and still run a viable presidential campaign is a major shift from the last Republican primary. In 2012, when Texas Gov. Rick Perry said that conservatives who refused to allow the children of undocumented immigrants go to school had ""no heart,"" he was effectively driven out of the race. Kasich offers a stark contrast to the alternatives presented by reality TV star Donald Trump, who bested Kasich in New Hampshire, and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Both, in their own ways, are running their campaigns on fear and anger. Kasich, challenged on Fox News last summer for moralizing the role of government, would not back down. ""My sense is that it is important that we do not ignore the poor, the widowed, the disabled,"" he said. ""I just think that's the way America is. And I think there's a moral aspect to it. In my state, there's not only a moral aspect where some people's lives have been saved because of what we've done, but it also saves us money in the long run.""In another interview, Kasich positively referenced a New Deal government program that put people to work during the Great Depression, and called out his conservative critics for hypocrisy. ""I'm concerned about the fact there seems to be a war on the poor. That if you're poor, somehow you're shiftless and lazy. You know what?"" he told The New York Times. ""The very people who complain ought to ask their grandparents if they worked at the W.P.A.""This is not new stuff for Kasich. Back in the '90s, after the Gingrich Revolution gave Republicans control of the House, he became chairman of the Budget Committee and was an early advocate of what became known as ""compassionate conservatism."" ""We are a society founded on a Judeo-Christian ethic that says you are judged on the basis of what you do to the least of them,"" he said in a 1996 interview with Arianna Huffington, nine years before she founded HuffPost, in which she called on Bob Dole to name Kasich as his running mate. But both major parties have changed quite a bit in the last two decades, and Kasich has acquired new liabilities -- including more than half a decade as a managing director at the now-defunct investment bank Lehman Brothers that Democrats are eager to exploit. Can a man who seemed like a plausible Republican vice-presidential candidate in 1996 win a spot at the top of the ticket in the age of Trump and Cruz? We can hope.Scott Conroy contributed reporting."
