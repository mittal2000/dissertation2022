1,POLITICS,House Votes To Overturn D.C. Reproductive Health Discrimination Law,Samantha Lachman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dc-reproductive-health-_n_7185902.html,,2015-05-01,"Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn. speaks to reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, March 25, 2014, after the Supreme Court heard arguments on a case involving family-owned companies that provide health insurance to their employees, but object to covering certain methods of birth control that they say can work after conception, in violation of their religious beliefs. Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C. is at right. (AP Photo/Lauren Victoria Burke)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f518240000510098ff25.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The House of Representatives approved a measure Thursday night that would reverse a Washington law preventing employers from retaliating against workers who have abortions or premarital sex.The House vote targeted the Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Amendment Act passed by the District's council last year. The city legislation aimed to prohibit employers from discriminating against employees accessing in-vitro fertilization, using birth control, having premarital sex or seeking an abortion. The measure would have added reproductive health to the city's other employment discrimination protections. Congress has the power to stop laws passed by the D.C. council, but the House hadn't voted to do so in 23 years. Rep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.) introduced the House version of the resolution, with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) offering the Senate's measure. Black's bill on Thursday passed 228 to 192, with 13 Republicans voting against it and three Democrats in favor.Conservatives have argued the city law would violate religious employers' religious liberty, suggesting they could be forced to hire applicants whose beliefs conflicted with their own or be compelled to cover contraception and abortion. “While the law’s supporters in the big-abortion lobby claim that this act protects against discrimination, the truth is this oppressive measure directly targets the First Amendment freedoms of pro-life and faith-based employers in our nation’s capital,” Black said in a statement before the vote. On the House floor, Black rejected accusations from Democrats that her bill would allow employers to discriminate. ""These attacks are offensive and patently false,"" Black said. ""This resolution would in no way threaten anyone’s access to care or freedom from discrimination based on the use of contraceptives. Rather, it simply maintains the status quo in Washington, D.C., before this misguided law was passed."" Citing the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the Supreme Court's Hobby Lobby decision, Black said the bill was written vaguely enough to ""affect the hiring practices of organizations that work to advance certain beliefs."" Democratic Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District's non-voting representative in Congress, noted that she was unable to cast a vote to protect the city's measure. ""This resolution is wildly undemocratic, it is a naked violation of the nation’s founding principle of local control and it is profoundly offensive to D.C. residents,"" Norton said. ""This resolution uniquely targets my district, but every member will get to vote on it except for me.""Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, called the vote ""another extreme and deeply troubling attack on women by Republican leaders in Congress."" ""This bill would make it open season for bosses to dig into their employees’ reproductive health practices and fire women for taking birth control or having an abortion,” Richards said in a statement. “This is just the latest in a slew of bills to give employers and businesses the right to discriminate against LGBT people, women, and others. This is dangerous, misguided, and deeply unpopular, and it’s outrageous that Congress is spending its time trying to pass this kind of legislation.” President Barack Obama's administration had issued a veto threat earlier Thursday, saying the resolution would have ""the unacceptable effect of undermining the will of District of Columbia citizens."" An administration statement said the House resolution ""would undermine the reproductive freedom and private health care decisions of the citizens of the District of Columbia."" Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton believes House Republicans were trying to ""overrule the Democratic process"" with the vote, a spokeswoman said Thursday. ""Hillary Clinton has fought for women and families and their right to access the full range of reproductive health care without interference from politicians or employers,"" Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton's campaign communications director, told CNN. ""Hillary will fight to make it easier, not more difficult, for women and families to get ahead and ensure that women are not discriminated against for personal medical decisions.""Congressional Republicans have previously taken issue with D.C. laws concerning Medicaid funding of abortion, needle exchanges, and marijuana legalization. The GOP attacked those issues by curbing city spending, not by reversing local laws."
2,POLITICS,Obama Administration Considers New 'Roadblocks' For Ex-Corinthian Colleges Students Seeking Debt Relief,Shahien Nasiripour,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/education-department-corinthian-debt-relief_n_7185668.html,,2015-05-01,"US Secretary of Education Arne Duncan speaks at the ConnectED conference in the East Room of the White House November 19, 2014 in Washington, DC. US President Barack Obama hosted school leaders and educators from across the country at the White House for ConnectED to the Future, a day-long convening to explore the potential of education technology and the innovations needed to bring Americas schools into the digital age. At the event, the President will launch his Administrations effort to assist school leaders in their transition to digital learning, following his plan to connect 99 percent of Americas students high-speed broadband internet in their schools and librariesAFP PHOTO/Brendan SMIALOWSKI (Photo credit should read BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f517260000300183c43c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The U.S. Department of Education is considering new hurdles for student loan borrowers seeking to get out of their debts by claiming their schools swindled them. Days after the abrupt shutdown of for-profit chain Corinthian Colleges Inc., the department is discussing additional requirements for debt-forgiveness applications and hiring an outside party to rule on claims made by aggrieved borrowers, according to people briefed on the plans. Doing so would effectively ignore demands by more than a dozen Senate Democrats, nine state attorneys general and borrower advocates, who have urged widespread debt relief to defrauded student borrowers.The result may be a lifetime of crippling debt for thousands of Americans who obtained questionable credentials at schools that misled them into enrolling. The department, which plans to announce its move next week, hasn’t finalized a decision and may ultimately adopt more borrower-friendly measures.Outstanding federal student debt has nearly doubled to $1.1 trillion since President Barack Obama and Education Secretary Arne Duncan took office in January 2009, federal data show. A greater share of Americans are late on their student loan payments than on their credit cards, home mortgages or auto loans, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Debt forgiveness applications are based on an obscure provision in federal law dating to the mid-1990s, and in borrowers’ loan contracts, that give them the right to seek loan discharges when they believe they’ve been defrauded by their schools.The issue has recently commanded attention in Washington amid state and federal allegations that Corinthian Colleges Inc., the faltering for-profit chain, systematically duped people into enrolling and taking out federal student loans with false job prospects and fake graduation rates.Corinthian's shutdown this week leaves 16,000 students scrambling for options. The company once had more than 110,000 students spread across more than 120 campuses under the Everest, Wyotech and Heald brands, but it collapsed under the weight of state and federal lawsuits and investigations alleging the company defrauded its students. Corinthian denies wrongdoing.Hundreds of former Corinthian students have filed applications in recent weeks with the Education Department to get their debts discharged under the “defense against repayment” provision. The applicants have cited pending state and federal lawsuits against the company that allege Corinthian misled students into enrolling with false job placement and graduation rates.Separately, more than 100 former Corinthian students have declared a “debt strike” and are publicly refusing to repay their student loans until the Education Department wipes out all federal debts owed by all former Corinthian students.Federal law allows the department to recoup from colleges whatever losses it sustains as a result of forgiving former students’ debts. But because of Corinthian’s troubled finances, the Education Department likely would sustain losses if it were to heed the calls of borrower advocates, such as Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.).The Obama administration has presided over what many for-profit college advocates view as a crackdown on their industry, with rhetoric that disparages the schools and new rules meant to rein in institutions that grant credentials of questionable value yet leave students mired in debt.Several major for-profit college chains also are under investigation for potentially misleading students by advertising false job placement or graduation rates. The Education Department has funneled billions of dollars in federal financial aid in recent years to for-profit schools under state or federal investigation. If borrowers saddled with those loans win debt forgiveness, the department could face billions of dollars in losses.It is against this backdrop that the Education Department plans to announce next week what borrowers need to demonstrate in order for their debts to be wiped. Department officials have told student advocates they plan to announce new details about the application process for forgiveness. Dorie Nolt, an Education Department spokeswoman, declined to answer questions.People familiar with the department’s plans said the Education Department will require aggrieved borrowers to submit applications that effectively force them to prove that they were misled by their school and to demonstrate their losses.Robyn Smith, a former California deputy attorney general who now works on student loan issues for the National Consumer Law Center, said the individual application process would be burdensome for former students, since there are so few legal aid attorneys to help them. “It would be a disappointment,” she said.Borrower advocates, including Durbin, the National Consumer Law Center and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, have recommended that the Education Department rely on evidence compiled by state prosecutors and the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to cancel former Corinthian students' debts.The federal consumer bureau and state attorneys general in California, Massachusetts, and Wisconsin have filed separate lawsuits, alleging Corinthian fraudulently induced students to take out loans to attend its schools by misleading them about future job prospects.The Education Department itself alleges it has uncovered evidence that Heald College, once the jewel of the Corinthian chain, misled students and accreditation agencies about graduates’ employment rates and showed a “blatant disregard” for the federal student loan program. The department said on April 14 that it had found 947 false job placement rates dating back to at least 2010.Smith, of the consumer law center, said Duncan has the authority to grant mass loan discharges of former Corinthian students’ debts. Laura Hanna, an organizer who works with the so-called “Corinthian 100” debt strikers, said it “absolutely makes no sense” for the Education Department to impose new forgiveness requirements, given the evidence dug up by state prosecutors, the federal consumer bureau and the department itself.The department also is considering outsourcing review of debt-forgiveness applications to a third party that would rule on the claims.Such a move, said Barmak Nassirian, an expert on higher education policy, would make sense in cases where the Education Department had to investigate whether a school had misled its students. There is additional merit in the idea, he said, because the Education Department would have a conflict of interest in deciding whether to cancel borrowers’ debts. For every loan it cancels, the department would lose money and effectively acknowledge it failed to properly supervise the college and protect students and taxpayers from fraud.But when it comes to applications from former Corinthian students, Nassirian said, “what would be a fair process is actually being used as a delaying tactic and as a roadblock.”“The entire educational experience apparently was subpar and questionable and fraught with misrepresentations and lies,” Nassirian said of Corinthian. “So if you know that, what is the need for individual adjudication? I just don’t get it.”"

As California enters its fourth year of severe drought, farmers in the Central Valley are struggling to keep crops watered as wells run dry and government water allocations have been reduced or terminated. Many have opted to leave acres of their fields fallow. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb169763c000066000bcfd6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"California's drought has parched farmland, left some rural residents reliant on bottled water and demanded households reduce water use by 25 percent. And now, a new report says the drought may be worsening air quality. The American Lung Association's annual State of the Air study, evaluating ozone and particle pollution across the U.S. from 2011 to 2013, found that the region's prolonged dry period, which began at the end of 2011, may be contributing to increased contaminants in the air. ""Many cities had a record number of days with high short-term particle pollution, particularly in the West, where continuing drought and heat may have increased the dust, grass fires and wildfires,"" the Lung Association report says. ""The impact of climate change is particularly apparent in the West where the heat and drought create situations ripe for episodes of high particle days."" Particle pollution is a ""mixture of acids, chemicals, metals, soil and dust that is formed when emissions from power plants, factories and vehicles react with the air,"" the International Business Times explained. Most particle pollution isn't the drought's fault. It's from burning fossil fuels in industry and cars, and from fires.Still, dry soil as a result of the drought -- its California's worst in 1,200 years -- allows particle pollution to thrive, while wildfires and dust storms send more particles into the air. The five most polluted U.S. cities in both particulate matter categories are all in California. Of the seven U.S. metro areas that had more annual particle pollution than in last year's report, four were in California: Bakersfield, Modesto-Merced, El Centro and San Jose-San Francisco. Each area also failed the national air quality standard.California's Fresno-Madera area's particle pollution improved since last year's report, but it maintained its title as the most polluted metropolitan area for annual particle pollution with an average 47 days per year.Alexander Sherriffs, a physician in the Central Valley and board member on the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District, told the Fresno Bee that the health consequences of air pollution are very apparent in the region.“I see lung disease in adults who have never smoked,” he said.

Pakistan has struggled to provide opportunities to its people for decades. But the country is turning the tide. People in Pakistan are determined to define their destiny. They are using all of the resources at their disposal to tackle their challenges..When Madeeha Hassan, a young entrepreneur from a small town found herself in Lahore, one of the largest Pakistani cities, she was a bit scared. She thought everyone was smarter than her. At times, she wanted to run back to her home town. After completing her studies, she started to work as a user interface designer. Her office was far from where she lived. It was hard to find a reliable mode of transportation. So she and few of her friends, created Savaree, Pakistan's first ridesharing app. The app resolved her carpooling problems and those of many others too. It's just not young people who are innovating. Public administrators are doing it too. In 2011, dengue fever engulfed Pakistan and killing hundreds of people. By 2012, Pakistanis had created an app to ensure people were treated rapidly and resources to combat dengue were mobilized efficiently. In 2012, there were 80 times fewer cases of dengue fever in Lahore than in 2011. In Pakistan, there has been remarkable progress in rebuilding trust between citizens and public administrators. Pakistan's Punjab Citizen Feedback Model is leveraging the power of mobile phones, SMS and personal phone calls. Let's say, for example, you went to a government office in Punjab to register your property. An official ""records your mobile number, along with other details of the transaction."" This information is sent to ""local call officers"" and to a call center. Later, a local officer will call you asking about your experience registering your property. And there are call centers that call thousands of people who use public services. As of April 2014, ""more than 4 million citizens of Pakistan had been contacted"" and asked about their experiences with ""the departments of revenue, health, and education."" These responses are entered into the system to make public services better. This progress comes in contrast with how Pakistan is viewed as a place of conflict. But as evidence shows, we are witnessing how public administrators and youth are taking steps towards realizing Pakistan 2.0: where people can fulfil their dreams and have the opportunity to reach their potential. Technology is not only serving as a tool for the government to leapfrog the way it conducts its business, but, as you might have guessed, it's also helping youth become job creators and problem solvers. In 2013, more than 70% of the population had mobile phones, most of them costing under $60.​Today more than 60% of Pakistanis are under the age of 30. Unemployment, especially, among youth remains high. With no jobs, and lack of opportunities youth are taking it upon themselves to create opportunities, as Hassan did. As administrators, and public, especially youth, commit to innovating and improving Pakistan, we are bound to see Pakistan 2.0 in the near future.The digital youth summit happening in May in Peshawar, a diverse and dynamic city of Pakistan, is just one more step towards the quest to make Pakistan more prosperous and stable. At the summit, participants will focus on technology entrepreneurship, on-line work and 'tech for social' innovation.Join them, show your support and share your ideas with them by commenting below or tweeting with #dys15."
7,POLITICS,Republican Rivals Imply -- But Never Say -- That Hillary Clinton Is Too Old,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-age-_n_7186868.html,,2015-05-01,"Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton attends the Hillary Rodham Clinton Award for Advancing Women in Peace and Security at Georgetown University in Washington, DC, April 22, 2015. AFP PHOTO / SAUL LOEB (Photo credit should read SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f51b240000300098ff29.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON, May 1 (Reuters) - Her campaign barely three weeks old, Hillary Clinton already has been attacked by Republicans on everything from donations to her family's charitable foundation, to her tenure as secretary of state and her ties to Wall Street. But her rivals, and the political action committees that support them, are treading more carefully on one incendiary subject: her age.If elected in November 2016, Clinton would be, at 69, the second-oldest person to take the presidential oath for the first time, behind only Ronald Reagan, who turned 70 weeks after being sworn into office in 1981.Questions of health and fitness for the presidency dogged two former candidates of a similar age, Bob Dole in the 1996 election and John McCain in 2008, each of whom was 71 at this point in the race. Time magazine featured Dole on the cover asking whether he was ""too old"" for the job. McCain was so determined to show that he was healthy that he often put in back-breaking campaign days.""I do think age is an issue in a presidential campaign,"" said Steve Schmidt, who was McCain's campaign manager. ""There is a thin line between seasoned and decrepit.""But several Republican campaigns that seem best positioned to exploit it don't want to touch the issue - at least directly. That's a shift from just a few months ago, when presidential hopefuls Senator Rand Paul, 52, and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, 47, explicitly referenced Clinton's age as a possible disqualifier, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell likened her to a cast member of the hit TV show ""The Golden Girls,"" which featured four older women living together.""It's a rigorous physical ordeal, I think, to be able to campaign for the presidency,"" Paul said in November, referring to Clinton's age. Now, however, Paul's presidential campaign doesn't want to talk about the issue. It declined further comment. As did Walker's political action committee, even though last fall, he, too, noted that he could run for president ""20 years from now"" and be the same age Clinton is today.Campaign aides to Paul, Walker and Senator Marco Rubio, 43, as well as Republican strategists, told Reuters there was little appetite in the party at the moment for a direct assault on Clinton on the issues of her age and fitness for office, even after a 2012 fall that gave her a concussion and caused a potentially life-threatening blood clot.Similarly, anti-Clinton political action committees such as American Crossroads, America Rising, and Citizens United said they had no plans to launch ads centered on her age. POLL SHOWS DEMOCRATS UNFAZED""It's unwise to attack a political opponent based on her immutable characteristics, like race, gender and age,"" said Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway. She said she has met with at least five Republican presidential campaigns seeking her services and none of them has indicated they want to go after Clinton on issues involving her age.With Clinton swamped by questions about foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation and criticism of her use of a private email server while at the State Department, there is also simply no reason at the moment to engage in an attack that could be more divisive than beneficial, Republican strategists said.They fear that highlighting Clinton's age could alienate women voters whom Republicans need to be competitive in next year's general election.Democratic pollster Anna Greenberg said women older than 50 would likely comprise the largest bloc of voters in 2016.There is little evidence that Democrats and independent voters are concerned about having another president in their 70s. A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted this month showed that Clinton's age would not influence how 67 percent of Democrats and 72 percent of independents voted in November 2016.And rather than downplay her age, Clinton in recent campaign events in Iowa and New Hampshire embraced her role as a grandmother, striking sympathetic notes with other older women in the room about the responsibility of raising a grandchild.Supporters have also sought to dismiss any concerns about her age as sexist, noting that she's the same age as Mitt Romney when he ran four years ago. Romney largely avoided any protracted discussion about his health. IT'S A GENERATIONAL THINGWhile eschewing direct attacks, some of the Republican presidential hopefuls have found other ways to strongly hint that Clinton's age should be an issue for voters. They have repackaged the issue as ""generational"" and suggested she is a product of the politics of the 20th Century. That argument will grow more vivid should Clinton face a candidate who could be a generation younger than her in the general election.""When you look at Hilary Clinton's age, it becomes an issue in a general election if she's running against a 40-something new face as opposed to Governor Bush,"" said Schmidt. Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, is 62.Rubio, a quarter century younger than Clinton, referred to her as a ""leader from yesterday"" when he announced his candidacy last month.""We welcome the contrast (with Clinton),"" said a top adviser to Rubio. ""This election is going to be about the future.""Clinton's campaign declined to comment on the various statements by the Republican hopefuls, referring questions to Correct the Record, a rapid-response operation run by the pro-Clinton group American Bridge. A spokeswoman, Adrienne Watson, said it was Clinton's rivals, not her, who were behind the times.""Republican politicians are stuck in the 90s - the 1890s,"" Watson said. ""I'm sure all Americans, Republicans included, would appreciate it if Republican leaders would join (Clinton) in talking about our future.""She saw Rubio's comments as a coded attack on Clinton's age.""Marco Rubio basically disqualifies himself to be president when he diminishes any American for being too young or old or anything else,"" Watson said. BILL CLINTON'S PLAYBOOKYet Rubio's approach is similar to the one employed by Clinton's husband, Bill, in his reelection campaign against Dole in 1996.""I don't think Senator Dole is too old to be president,"" Clinton said at one debate. ""It's the age of his ideas that I question.""Dick Morris, who served as Bill Clinton's campaign manager, said it was a subtle enough way to remind voters of the age difference between the two candidates.""We obviously couldn't attack age directly because of older voters,"" Morris told Reuters. ""What we did is adopt a whole strategy based on issues that would summon the memories and ideas of age without articulating it.""Dole released his medical records in 1995 to assuage concerns about his age. But the damage control was not entirely successful: he mistakenly called the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team ""Brooklyn,"" and he tumbled off a stage during a rally.Hillary Clinton, too, had what her husband seemed to term a ""senior"" moment in 2008 when she erroneously claimed she had come under sniper fire while on a trip to Bosnia as first lady.Bill Clinton blamed the episode on his wife being exhausted, adding that her critics, ""when they're 60, they'll forget something when they're tired at 11 at night, too.""

While this is a serious issue, we also need to ensure that the hundreds of thousands of people who have the necessary documents and qualifications, but don't have the money to finish the process, are able to become citizens.One in five immigrants points to the costs associated with the process as the main reason they cannot finish becoming a citizen. For millions of legal immigrants, the financial costs to finish the citizenship process are just too prohibitive. A report published in January by the Center for American Progress and Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration shows that in 2013, the most recent year where there is complete data, less than 10 percent of eligible immigrants applied for citizenship nationwide. The report points out that a significant increase in citizenship application fees passed in 2007 was associated with a corresponding drop in applicants. And, it's no coincidence that the legal immigrants least likely to apply for citizenship are the working poor, who live at or below the federal poverty level. Helping folks finish the citizenship application process is not just the right thing to -- it is also smart economic policy. Immigrants contribute more than $47 billion to the New Jersey economy alone every year. Nearly one in three businesses in New Jersey is owned by immigrants. According to one study commissioned by the MIDJersey Chamber of Commerce, allowing these individuals to gain citizenship would help create more than 7,000 jobs a year in New Jersey and add more than $50 billion to the gross state product by 2025. And, once a person becomes a citizen it becomes much easier for them to get an education, take out loans, build their own business and contribute to the broader economy.Instead of waiting for our representatives in Washington to find the answers to address this growing problem, Amalgamated Bank, the largest majority union-owned bank in the United States, and We Are One New Jersey, a nonprofit agency that provides advocacy services in immigrant communities, are teaming up. Together, we will make citizenship financially possible for thousands of working New Jerseyans through a new, first-of-its-kind loan program.This unique, labor-initiated program will offer short-term, low-interest loans to residents who are living in the United States legally but are unable to afford the $680 U.S. citizenship application fees. We Are One New Jersey will also offer citizenship, education and advocacy services to the hundreds of thousands of legal permanent residents who make New Jersey home. Amalgamated and We Are One New Jersey hope this program will serve as a model that can be replicated around the country.America is and will always be a nation of immigrants. We have a moral duty and an economic imperative to ensure those who want to become Americans and are qualified to do so can pursue their dreams. Through the We Are One centers, we hope that more immigrants seeking citizenship will be able to realize their dreams."

Wouldn't we end up in an even greater education civil war? Or maybe we should...",2015-04-30,"Education Secretary Arne Duncan speaks about education, Monday, July 7, 2014, during the daily briefing at the White House in Washington. The nation's largest teachers' union wants Duncan to quit. Delegates of the National Education Association adopted a business item July 4 at its annual convention in Denver that called for his resignation. The vote underscores the long standing tension between the Obama administration and teachers' unions _ historically a steadfast Democratic ally. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5babe59325000036003752a9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"U.S. Department of Education Secretary Arne Duncan has long refused to face reality. Duncan still ramps up his incredible spin for test, sort, and punish by claiming that it is a civil rights issue. He continues to support the stress of high-stakes testing as the means of overcoming the damage done by the stress of poverty. Duncan is a perfect example of the truism that to a man with a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. Rather than address the complex problems facing schools that serve intense concentrations of students from generational poverty, who have endured unconscionable trauma, he repeats the simple mantra: Accountability, accountability, accountability. But, curiously, accountability hawks don't hold themselves responsible for a dozen years of failure with the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) bubble-in accountability regime.In his latest public relations campaign, Duncan argues that consequences must be attached to tests for every student so that no child will slip through the cracks. But, at a minimum, his claim that high-stakes testing protects ""every child"" is sloppy thinking. Seeking to protect every child is a job for a diagnostic metric, not an accountability metric. The proper use of an accountability metric would be holding individuals and systems accountable for the proper use of diagnostic metrics.To try to protect every patient, doctors order screening tests. Accountability systems exist to ensure the quality of those systems and their proper usage. It would make no sense to punish doctors and technicians for the results that their tests produce (although some healthcare reformers sound like they want to do so). Accountability systems also monitor the professionalism and practice of the healthcare providers who use them. Doctors, however, would not submit to the type of output-driven accountability regimes that are being imposed on teachers. If reformers want a data system and a set of procedures that covers every child, and to hold educators accountable for using them in a professional manner to protect every child from education errors, then that's doable. In that case, let's agree to scrap high-stakes testing and build better accountability systems, as well as better data-informed systems for diagnostic purposes and better decision making.Education should pattern its accountability systems after medical care, while acknowledging that we don't have a fraction of that sector's resources. The first rule of school improvement should be ""First, do no harm."" Then we should institutionalize procedures to reduce harm, ranging from the school version of a doctor washing his hands to properly following best-practice protocols. A new era of accountability should begin with reformers taking the log from their eyes before trying to remove the mote from educators' eyes. It should start by holding accountability systems accountable. We could then proclaim to policy makers, school patrons, and other stakeholders that we have met the challenge, reinvented accountability and shown that education is worthy of increased investments.By the way, too many reformers escalate the political battles, claiming that we need smarter accountability systems where everybody holds everybody else accountable. But I wouldn't even contemplate systems where both sides hold each other accountable and risk the blame game spinning out of control. If reformers want to hold us accountable for each child, wouldn't we have to hold them accountable for every child damaged by their policies? Wouldn't we end up in an even greater education civil war?Or maybe we should... A superintendent from the Broad Academy told me that he wanted a computer and video system so he could sit in his office and monitor every individual class in his district. If such a system existed, though, we should demand another feature. Every time a young child breaks down crying during a standardized test, the teacher could push a button and send a video of that incident to a network that includes every prominent supporter of high-stakes testing. Every time a gangbanger who seems tough as nails on the outside tears up when explaining how his entire education was stolen as a steady diet of teach-to-the-test worksheets drove the joy of learning out of class, Duncan and every other reformer would be required to watch. When teens explain that they know they are just pawns in adult games, and that they are so disrespected that they are left behind and ""treated like this,"" every accountability hawk should have to deal with it. When a teen explodes, saying she is dropping out of school because she can't pass these tough new graduation tests (EOIs), every reformer should listen to the pained expression that teachers have to face: ""They were going to send me to 'EOI boot camp'! I didn't commit any crime!"""

How do you feel when another week goes by and you still haven't done what you promised yourself you would do -- maybe a month or even six months ago?In my experience, a lack of motivation can be caused by thinking too much about a task in its totality. We look at the pile of ironing or the mountain of filing and we groan under the weight of it and we think ""Oh there's so much to do -- I'll never get through it all. It's going to take ages."" We feel drained just thinking about it. We make a promise to ourselves, ""I'll do it tomorrow, definitely tomorrow -- when I feel more like doing it."" I'm talking here about filing or ironing, but it could just as easily be writing up a report or thesis, doing maths homework or redecorating a room.The Cost of Avoidance A college friend, back in the day, summed up very well, the feeling that we get when we don't do what we know we should be doing. Instead of going to the library to research her essay, she had taken the afternoon off and had gone into town to meet a friend. She said ""Taking the afternoon off was a total waste of time, because I couldn't stop thinking about the essay and all that I had to do. I couldn't relax -- it was on my mind all of the time. It would have been easier to go to the library and make a start on it -- putting it off just wasn't worth it.""End Procrastination Now To put and end to procrastination, you need to focus on doing just three things. When we apply the three items' rule, we immediately reduce the task to a more manageable level. ""Three -- ah yeah, I can manage that -- no bother -- three -- sure I'll have those done in no time."" We discover that doing just three things, gets us over our initial foot dragging, lack of enthusiasm.Quite often, when we make a three item start, we realize that it's not that difficult to keep going and we decide to do a few more and maybe a few more after that. Sometimes we feel so much in the 'groove' that we decide to do the whole darn lot in one go. But even if this doesn't happen, even if we stick to doing just three things, we still get to feel proud of ourselves, we still get to feel a sense of achievement -- we set ourselves a challenge and we stepped up -- we delivered -- we did the three things that we said we'd do and because we achieved our goal, we feel better about ourselves -- our self esteem goes up. The other thing is, if we manage to apply the three a day rule over a seven day period, that's usually enough to create a sizable hole in even the biggest mountain or pile.What about you? Would the three item rule work for you? Please leave a comment, I'd love to hear your views. For further tips and resources, you might like to check out my website."

The Altoona Mirror reports that police maintained a presence at the McDonald's on Tuesday, where two local teens stood outside the restaurant holding signs protesting the ban. Few other teens apparently showed up at the restaurant that day, perhaps because there are four other McDonald's locations within Altoona city limits. "

There have been at least thirty trade and investment cases brought on behalf of big tobacco. The TPP will spur more.,2015-04-30,"A Malaysian walks by a store selling cigrettes in Penang, Malaysia, Monday, Aug. 23, 2004. The WHO's Western Pacific director, Shigeru Omi, told a conference that national leaders must prevent the spread of death and disease and plug tariff cuts that would benefit tobacco under the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement. (AP Photo/Andy Wong)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f4d52200005700dd84de.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Co-authored by Sergio Puig and Gregory Shaffer.The Obama administration is poised to finalize the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement. If Congress passes the current trade promotion authority bill, the TPP will become subject to a simple up or down vote, without possibility for any amendment. The Obama administration refuses to tell the public what's in the agreement and Congress seems pressed to accept provisions that many Americans might deplore. This is a problem. Consider the TPP's secretive advocacy for big tobacco.The U.S. government is supporting big tobacco companies by negotiating dozens of international trade and investment agreements, but largely without the public's knowledge. Historically, the U.S. has supported big tobacco to expand their profitability abroad, despite known health risks. For example, dating back to the 1990s the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that US tobacco trade surpluses doubled after ""the U.S. government provided assistance in removing [trade] barriers."" The GAO report also notes how the prevalence of smoking in ""Taiwan and South Korea had increased since the removal of U.S. cigarette export barriers,"" which resulted in ""the opening of Asian cigarette markets, [and increased] cigarette advertising..."" These agreements reduce tariffs on tobacco products around the world and grant big tobacco companies the right to sue governments that post aggressive warning labels on cigarettes. For example, Australia enacted a ""plain packaging law"" that depicts disquieting, smoking-related images on cigarette packages sold in its country above the brand of the cigarette. Tobacco companies sued. But it's not just the big nations these companies go after -- it's also the poorest.Big tobacco companies claim developing countries like Uruguay, Uganda, Togo, Namibia, Gabon, and others are interfering with their brand names and violating intellectual property rights. To defend themselves against the little guys, tobacco companies have instigated or threatened litigation that could cost poor nations millions of dollars to fight. If the Obama administration caves to big tobacco, it would give the impression that Americans support not only these tactics, but also the general principle that smoking is safe and it doesn't kill. They argue cigarettes should be treated like any other product.In the U.S. alone, tobacco annually costs over $170 billion in direct medical expenses and $150 billion in lost productivity. Globally, that figure rises to $300 billion per year. And the costs are not financial alone. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), ""more than 16 million Americans are living with a disease caused by smoking,"" and what's more ""for every person who dies because of smoking, at least 30 people live with a serious smoking-related illness."" Yet, unless revised, the TTP will reduce tobacco tariff rates to zero and provide new rights to tobacco companies, pitting global public health in developing countries against the deep pockets of an industry that sells products known to cause serious health risks, including cancer and death.Some might suggest that this really isn't our problem. After all, U.S. smoking has plummeted from 42 percent in 1961 to roughly 19 percent today. However, tobacco companies' profits are at a record high. Why? Because big tobacco's cigarette sales soar in developing countries after the U.S. government presses them to reduce tariffs. Statistics show the close link. On average, as developing country tariffs decrease by 1 percent, tobacco consumption rises by 2 percent, handsomely profiting U.S. tobacco companies.Further, tobacco companies bombard poor nations with advertisements that would be unacceptable in the U.S. In 2012, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reported that the tobacco industry's ""advertising and promotional expenditures increased [from 2011-2012], rising from $8.366 billion to $9.168 billion."" Tobacco companies strategically deployed their advertizing, decreasing advertizing in some capacities, to add to others. For example, the FTC also reported that tobacco companies spent $239.6 million on ""coupons to reduce the retail costs of cigarettes,"" increasing their expenditures by over $65 million from the year before.The Obama administration knows big tobacco's newest target is developing countries, such as Vietnam, a party to the TPP. Vietnam now has a 135 percent tariff rate on cigarettes (for a list of other countries, see here), arguably in part to protect local state-owned producers, but also because cigarette imports serve no useful purpose for its economy. According to one Vietnamese news agency, ""smoking-related diseases kill over 40,000 people in Vietnam each year."" Government officials fear that ""10 percent of the Vietnamese population will have died from smoking-related diseases by 2030.""Tariffs, in contrast, provide the government with revenue that can be used to implement public policies, including health policies. The rate of smoking is high for men in Vietnam, at 47.4 percent, but low for women at just 1.4 percent. After tariff rates decline to zero, Philip Morris and other multinationals will aim to change women's habits. They have already done so in other Asian countries with the U.S. government's help.More importantly, there is no justifiable reason for including tobacco in the TPP, whatever one thinks of free trade or global economic integration. Mainstream economists contend that free trade makes more goods available at cheaper prices and thus increases a country's welfare and its consumers' standard of living. However, this core argument does not apply to tobacco. Predictably, consumer welfare will decline with increased tobacco consumption; we have seen this in the U.S. With tariff rates at zero, big tobacco companies will not only increase exports, but also bombard poor countries with advertising. Based on their record, how appealing do you think their ads will be?Of course, after Vietnam reduces its tariff rates to zero, it could increase its domestic sales tax to 135 percent. But anyone who has visited a developing country and seen their outdoor markets knows that collecting sales taxes is much more difficult And Philip Morris certainly knows that, which is why it wants the tariff rate at zero.Finally, this all raises important moral and ethical concerns about the Obama administration's promotion of tobacco company interests through free trade agreements. Tobacco has a sorry history linked with international trade and investment agreements. It is a dark secret that tobacco companies make more use of these agreements than perhaps any other industry. There have been at least thirty trade and investment cases brought on behalf of big tobacco. The TPP will spur more.It is not too late to end U.S. government complicity. Congress can make clear that it will refuse to ratify a TPP that does not exempt tobacco products. It can exempt them under the current trade promotion bill. The lobbyists have benefitted from the secret negotiations that the Obama administration enforces on its trading partners through strong confidentiality agreements. It is time for the Obama administration to come clean on tobacco. The U.S. has a troubled history with Vietnam. The number of deaths it might now inflict through helping to promote cigarette use, an industry that accounts for one in ten adult deaths worldwide, especially among young Vietnamese women, will not make for a proud Obama legacy.Sergio Puig is Associate Professor and Co-Director of the International Trade and Business Law Program at James E.

The streets were largely calm in the morning and into the afternoon, but authorities remained on edge against the possibility of another outbreak of looting, vandalism and arson. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae0b16200000e500ff30f4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I watched CNN almost exclusively for the news about the first day of the Baltimore uprisings, knowing that the other channels would probably be worse. And on it came: the condemnation of the Mayor (who incidentally was black and female), suggesting how weak she was for holding back the police; the labeling of the young people in rebellion as ""thugs""; the slightly veiled damnation of the black community for burning down its own neighborhood, with particular sympathy for the CVS store that was burned and looted.I write not in defense of riots. They're awful, destructive, acts of hopeless people who don't think very much of their future. But I am writing to note that there were a lot more people out on the street at the height of the violence who were literally fighting with their neighbors and family members, telling them to ""Go home"" and ""Stop burning down your own neighborhood!""Slowly, by the second day, the cameras focused on some of these people: the mother who beat her child all the way home, and gave a brilliant interview of why she did it but also, what it's like to live in Baltimore. CNN focused on the young men who were trying to calm the streets, including breaking up a fight between two boys who were apparently from different gangs. ""There are longstanding beefs amongst the people, before the riot occurred"", the newsman sympathetically explained. They interviewed a preacher who held his head up; a state senator who called for justice. They let us see some of parents, community workers and others who confronted the police and the rioters to control the crowds that day, and will do so tomorrow just as eagerly.So despite the violence, which the Baltimore Police Department alone would not have been able to stop the first day because they were overwhelmed by the numbers of people on the rampage, and the widespread nature of the destruction, maybe it was a good idea that the mayor didn't turn loose the cops to beat heads as was done in so many cities recently, and in days of yore?When CNN and other media outlets tells the narrative in a way that ignores these acts of redemptive non-violence, (including the action by the mayor) it justifies more violence by the police forces, who always have the preponderance of force on their side, and the authority to use it. When the narrative unfolds that way, it blocks the ugly truth about the American dream: it just doesn't apply to the residents in West Baltimore, and neighborhoods like it across the country.On the Amy Goodman Pacifica news broadcast the morning after the riot, Rev. Jesse Jackson pointed out Baltimore has 18000 vacant homes, caused by the mortgage get-rich schemes that caused the Great Depression of 2008 and the loss of homes for thousands of residents. The unemployment rate is 30 percent amongst young blacks. There were 111 cases of police violence that led to court judgments or settlements between 2011 and 2014, alone. You just don't get this picture when you allow pundits and leaders to get on television and call the rioters ""thugs""... which simply justifies more violence, more oppression and more responses based on rage.Lost in that kind of single-minded blame analysis is the evidence of privilege and power that are held by some, and the abject poverty and powerlessness of others, which is the story that must be told if America is to ever back away from the precipice of death and destruction. Lost is the lesson of the historic role that black people have always played in times like these, when ordinary people do extraordinary things to keep the peace, thus backing off the agents of terror and destruction just by their sheer will to get the job done. The little people of Baltimore -- the mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers -- are the people who stopped a second night of terror from being unleashed on their neighborhoods, this time by the overwhelming superiority of force amassed by the police, locked and loaded for offense.It is this homegrown leadership that was finally given the audience and appreciation it deserves by some news outlets on the second day. It was a message of hope that was beyond comprehension of some the young rioters, but that people made stick up on the wall just by their will power. These leaders now have a right to say, ""We're doing our share, America. What about you?""It is from this positioning on the moral high ground that longstanding Movements for social justice have been born and perpetuated in America, with particular reference to the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 60s. Let us hope that the majority of the country will listen, and begins first to insist on curbing the indiscriminant power of the combined police forces in the country; and that racism and poverty begin to be alleviated by government created jobs, real school reform, and social services for the people like those in Baltimore.--Junius Williams is the author of the book, Unfinished Agenda, Urban Politics in the Era of Black Power (www.randomhouse.com) and the Director of the Abbott Leadership Institute, Rutgers University Newark"

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1d8e0240000310096e5e6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"While some Baltimore students were met with consequences for their participation in the city’s fiery riots, punishing kids wasn’t on Nikkia Rowe’s agenda when classes resumed on Wednesday. Rowe, the principal of Renaissance Academy, is more interested in making sure that the students at her low-income school, which abuts the city’s recent tensions, have the resources they need at this moment to become well-informed contributing members of society. “Our strategy for reentry was to establish a sense of normalcy,” Rowe told The Huffington Post. “I’m deeply connected to the children -- to making sure they have information, that they are in a place of understanding, in terms of what is actually happening and in terms of what they’re seeing that may not necessarily be true.”Rowe didn’t expect to see her city devolve into the worst outbreak of rioting in decades after Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man, died of injuries he sustained while in police custody. But she was already preparing her students to better understand the law and to improve strained relationships with local police officials long before the first grenade was thrown, she told The Huffington Post. As students poured into their West Baltimore school on their first day back after protests paralyzed the city, Rowe said she felt heartened by the systems that are equipping her students to respond effectively to abuses of power. This year marked the first that Renaissance Academy, a school where 90 percent of students can’t afford lunch, offered courses on law and homeland security. Rowe sees these classes as critical components to helping her high-schoolers develop into civilly minded advocates. ""If I'm empowered to understand the law, I'm less likely to break the law,"" Rowe explained. ""If I understand the law, I'm not going to become one of the 1.5 million that's missing from society. I'm able to advocate on behalf of myself and my community.""She couldn’t deny the courses’ effectiveness on Wednesday when the entire student body and staff partook in “restorative circles” to discuss their feelings on the death of Freddie Gray and the ensuing riots. “This is not the best way to do it,” Rowe heard one student say about the violence and looting. “Is this really about the cause or have we lost the cause in the process?” another student questioned. While students used such emotions as disappointment, anger, sadness and frustration to describe their feelings about the fractious situation, they were also able to point to facts about the justice system, breeches of law and what they can expect to see at Friday’s indictment. To help arm students with legal facts, which gives them applicable knowledge to respond to this very situation, Renaissance Academy partnered with local group Community Law in Action to write the curriculum for the school’s inaugural introduction to law course, which every student is required to take. Students learn about landmark Supreme Court cases and how advocates have pushed for social justice. The school’s course on homeland security has also opened up the students to pertinent criminal justice cases and has helped ease tensions among law enforcement. Professionals in the field have visited the school to speak and the Academy also secured a partnership with the Baltimore Police Department (BPD). Ten students tour the training facility once a month in an effort to “tear down these barriers we see,” Rowe noted.Students attended the cadets' graduation, and those officers will attend the students’ graduation when they finish high school in two years. The program has enabled students to find common ground with law enforcement officials.“Their stories are like mine,” is a common response Rowe hears when kids return from the BPD training facility. In addition to teaching students how to act when accosted by cops, and inspiring students to get involved in community activism, Rowe impressed the need for her teens to get effective mentorship.The ratio of African-American males to females at Renaissance Academy is two-to-one and Rowe is eager to expose her male students to mentors who will galvanize them to improve their community.Rowe said she was particularly dismayed by the media coverage of the riots, which disproportionately featured the “bad stuff” and neglected to focus more attention on the peaceful protests and the positive leaders in the community.She noted that such images inadvertently become “self-fulfilling prophecies,” as students see on loop images of masked African-American men setting fire to local stores. “They’re not seeing themselves as Thurgood Marshall who became the first African-American Supreme Court justice,” Rowe said. “They see themselves through the negative images they encounter daily … our responsibility is to bring them back.” Like Us On Facebook   Follow Us On Twitter  "
