0,SPORTS,Rape Survivor's Son Petitions The NCAA To Ban Violent Athletes,Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ncaa-ban-violent-athletes_us_575b0288e4b0ced23ca7f72e,"""The truth is that some rapists and criminals just happen to possess outstanding athletic ability.""",2016-06-11,Baylor football coach Art Briles was fired over the university's coverup of sexual assault claims against athletes.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A sexual assault survivor and her son are petitioning the NCAA to ban athletes who commit violent offenses like rape and domestic abuse. Since going live on Change.org Tuesday, the petition has collected more than 41,000 signatures. The petition, launched by Darius Adams, repeats an open letter he published on The Huffington Post a week earlier. ""This rule change would show people that the NCAA cares because right now it looks like they don't,"" 23-year-old Adams told HuffPost. ""They have the power to do something. So why aren't they?""Adams' mother, Brenda Tracy, said she was gang-raped by four football players in 1998 while attending a party hosted by Oregon State University students. Two of the men did not play for Oregon State. But the two who did were only punished with 25 hours of community service and a one-game suspension.Tracy came forward with her story in 2014 and has since worked with Oregon State to improve how it handles sexual assault. She and OSU President Ed Ray lobbied the Pac-12, a conference within the NCAA, to bar student athletes from transferring schools to play on athletic teams if they would be unable to re-enroll at their original college due to misconduct issues like assault, harassment or academic fraud. The rule prevents an athlete who violates a school's sexual misconduct policy from simply transferring to avoid punishment and continuing their athletic career.NCAA Board of Governors Chair L. Jay Lemons and President Mark Emmert responded to Adams and Tracy on Friday with a letter outlining policies for sexual assaults committed by athletes. It did not say whether they would adopt a policy like the one the petition asks for, but did say that sexual violence policies would be discussed at the board's meeting in August. The petition launched this week as anger swirled around the lenient sentence for Brock Turner, who, as a former Stanford University swimmer with hopes to qualify for the Olympics, was given six months in jail for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman. USA Swimming banned Turner for life, and Adams is seeking to have the NCAA institute a similar policy.""Society has come to this conclusion that somehow if you are an athlete then you must be a hero -- not true, and we have to stop buying into that,"" Tracy said. ""The truth is that some rapists and criminals just happen to possess outstanding athletic ability. Being good at a sport doesn't make you a good human being.""The petition was spurred in part by recent revelations that Baylor University failed for years to properly address reports that football players committed sexual and physical assaults. ""In some instances, the football program dismissed [accused] players for unspecified team violations and assisted them in transferring to other schools,"" an independent report concluded. ""It was my mom that made me want to get involved,"" Adams said. ""When she saw the news about Baylor she was really, really upset. She was pacing around the house trying to figure out what she could do to help. That's when the idea of the letter came up.""""You hear from survivors, but you don't usually hear from their families,"" he continued. ""And I'm her son. I want to support and help her in any way I can. I don't want her to be in this fight alone.""It's not hard to find recent allegations of universities prioritizing athletes over sexual assault victims. The University of Oregon recruited Brandon Austin after he was suspended from Providence College for sexual assault, then had to suspend Austin after he was accused of participating in the gang rape of a woman. A lawsuit against the University of Tennessee alleges the school gave special assistance to athletes accused of sexual assault. At Florida State University, athletic staff learned that star quarterback Jameis Winston was accused of sexual assault in January 2013, but decided the encounter was consensual and failed to report it to other university officials for months. If the NCAA adopted a policy like the kind Adams' petition requests, it wouldn't bar athletic officials from helping their players defend themselves. But Tracy said she thinks it would ""deter coaches and administrators from enabling"" athletes who commit sexual violence. ""The NCAA banning violent athletes sends a clear message to all athletic departments, athletes and universities that violence will no longer be tolerated,"" Tracy said. ""It puts everyone on notice that they better get their departments in order. It also sends the message that the NCAA cares about its student athletes that are not violent and are just simply pursuing their collegiate athletic dreams. These students should no longer have to endure the scandals brought about by their coaches, administrators and peers.""_______ Tyler Kingkade is a national reporter, focusing on higher education and sexual violence, and is based in New York.

But Tapper balked when Bob Garfield, co-host of the weekly public radio show “On the Media,” described such dogged questioning as ""hammering"" Trump.""The persistence has to come with a certain low-key respect,"" Tapper said of interviewing candidates like Trump or presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. ""It has to come in a controlled way. It’s not a hammering. It’s a sweet hammering, a respectful hammering.”Garfield, however, said he believes Tapper, at times, has been too respectful of Trump this election cycle. In a discussion about journalistic norms at a moment in U.S. politics that's anything but conventional, Garfield argued the press is normalizing Trump by treating him like every other major candidate, thereby legitimizing a candidacy fueled by bigotry, misogyny, and lies. Tapper, who has fact-checked Trump's conspiracy theories, emphasized to ""On the Media"" that he doesn't see his role as offering personal opinions in interviews and doesn't intend to grandstand. The questions and answers should star, he said.Some journalists, media watchers, and news outlets -- including The Huffington Post -- contend the press shouldn't take a neutral tone or adopt the “view from nowhere” when covering Trump, as IBTimes’ Brendan James wrote Thursday. Garfield clearly falls into this camp. “This guy, by every definition, is a demagogue,” Garfield said. “He has been caught in a thousand lies. He’s said all sorts of things that are fundamentally un-American. Is this a moment when it’s proper to put the sweet hammer back in the toolbox and say, ‘Mr. Trump, what is the matter with you?’”“You know, Bob, you can do that, and you can say all the things you just said about Mr. Trump -- things that I have not said on my show,” Tapper responded. “And at the end of the election cycle, we can decide which one of us had had more of an impact on the election.”Garfield asked what happens if Trump wins. “Then the majority of the American people have voted for him,” Tapper responded. “My job is not to defeat a candidate. My job is to make sure voters have facts and have as much information as I can give them. At the end of the day, if the voters of this country pick Donald Trump to be their president, that’s their decision. I’m not rooting for him or against him.”Listen to the full “On the Media” interview here:Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

But the official Vote Leave campaign reacted cautiously, tweeting: ""We don't believe the ORB online poll, our data suggests it's closer to 50-50.""The mixed picture has heightened market jitters about the outcome, with sterling repeatedly reacting to poll results.Separately on Saturday, a group of Britain's most eminent scientists endorsed the ""Remain"" campaign for the UK to remain in the EU, saying that leaving could damage research.(Additional reporting by Guy Faulconbridge and Bill Schomberg; Editing by Kevin Liffey)"

A brother will wake up without a sister, and he will feel like he has failed her, but he hasn't. As a nation, we have failed Christina Grimmie and thousands more each year. According to the Gun Violence Archive, there have been 23,058 gun-related incidents this year alone. 5,837 of those were deaths. Some might say that this number is a small price to pay for our right to bear arms, but I think that its 5,837 too many. Last year, Politifact researchers looked at worldwide mass shooting incidents over the past ten and a half years. These researchers found 23 mass shooting incidents in 10 other countries, resulting in 200 deaths. In the United States during the same time period, there were 133 mass shooting incidents and 487 deaths. We should feel safe when we go to the movies, when we're in school, when we're at concerts. We all want the right to feel safe, and for some that comes in the form of owning a gun. I understand and I sympathize, but criminals steal guns. In St. Louis last year, gun thefts were up 70%, according to police officers. And the Chicago police take one illegal gun off the street every 74 minutes. Even when guns are obtained legally, background checks aren't foolproof. Sometimes, they aren't even completed by the time the buyer goes home with a gun.Christina Grimmie's killer was reported to have two different guns on him when he shot her backstage at her concert in Orlando. Christina was shot as her fans, many of them children, looked on as they were waiting in line to meet her. If the perpetrator was not tackled by Christina's brother, who knows how many of them would have spent their nights in hospitals. How many mothers would wake up without children.Our government has a duty to protect its people from harm. This year, 23,058 people were unprotected. They are not just statistics. Each of them have names, each of them have stories. Each of them have families who were forever changed because of the split-second pull of the trigger of a gun. An object that is designed to kill. This isn't a Republican vs Democrat issue, it's a human rights issue. We have the right to live. We have the right to be safe when going about our daily activities. As a nation, we have to do better. We deserve better.Early this morning, the world lost a bright light. Thousands have been affected, regardless of whether or not they were a fan of Christina's. Thousands are appalled and devastated by this tragedy. And ones like it happen every single day. Get angry about it, and let that anger fuel your fire to demand change. It starts with us. "

Earlier this week, David Bowie's former producer, Tony Visconti, reportedly told The Daily Star that Adele, among others, represent a disturbing trend in the music industry. “You turn the radio on and it's fluff, you are listening to 90 percent computerized voices,” he said. “We know Adele has a great voice, but it's even questionable if that is actually her voice or how much has been manipulated.”Adele seemed to address his comments in a video shared by Consequence of Sound in the manner we've come to expect from the singer: filthy and to the point. “Some dickhead ... tried to say that my voice isn't me on record,"" she says over the cries of screaming fans. ""Dude, suck my dick.”Watch the full clip below: "

Oh, and a chastity belt around his private parts ― though they didn’t notice that until later. Police said Eidam smelled of alcohol and had bloodshot watery eyes. Eidam allegedly admitted drinking four or five shots in the preceding four hours, according to news station WATE.The breathalyzer supported that, police said. Eidam’s blood-alcohol level was allegedly .117. During the stop, officers say they also noticed a handgun in the center console.But it wasn’t until they took him into custody that they say they found out about that aforementioned chastity belt.Eidam said that he needed a key that was in his vehicle because it unlocked the chastity device he was wearing, according to an affidavit obtained by The Smoking Gun.Eidam said one key was in his car and the other was around the neck of his companion, who officials noted was visibly intoxicated but was not arrested.They did manage to retrieve the key, thankfully.For those not in the know, a chastity belt is a garment or device worn around the pelvic area that designed to prevent a person from having sex. Death and Taxes explains the rationale behind the devices:“In modern times, there are typically two reasons chastity belts are purchased. The first is by fanatical Christian parents, looking to literally lock down their children’s masturbation habits, and the second is for pleasure (denying) purposes in a BDSM relationship.”Eidam was charged with driving under the influence and possession of a handgun under the influence.He was taken to the Anderson County Jail and is scheduled to appear in court July 12."

""As humans, it's just about a connection with someone.""Lovato, who recently canceled the North Carolina stop on her joint tour with Nick Jonas to show support for the queer community in the state fighting against the anti-LGBT House Bill 2, cites her upbringing as central to understanding and supporting the community.""Being different in Texas or in the South in general, you can be judged,"" she said. ""I grew up in a home where there was absolutely nothing wrong with somebody identifying as another sex or liking the same sex. People will say, 'Thank you so much for all that you do.' And my response is: 'It's just something that people should already be doing.'""Like Lovato, more and more young people appear to be moving away from identifying as exclusively heterosexual. In August 2015, a YouGov poll conducted in the UK revealed that nearly 1 in 2 young people identify as not being exclusively heterosexual. Another study, this one conducted by the trend forecasting agency J. Walter Thompson Innovation Group and released in March, reported that 52 percent of Gen Zs don't identify as exclusively heterosexual."

Waterford Township, Michigan, where Tillery lives, has a ban on pit bulls. Apparently, some folks who saw the photo thought Diggy looked sufficiently pit bull-like to call the cops.The officer who responded to the call agreed Diggy seemed like a pit bull, and Dan, fearing that authorities would confiscate his pet, agreed to have Diggy out of his home in three days.But here’s the thing. Diggy is not a pit bull and has the papers to prove it, said Kristina Millman-Rinaldi, executive director of Detroit Dog Rescue, where Tillery adopted the pup.Waterford Township defines pit bulls as dogs that “substantially conform to the breed standards established by the American Kennel Club” for American pit bull terriers, Staffordshire bull terriers, or American Staffordshire terriers.But Diggy has papers from a veterinarian identifying him as an American bulldog, Millman-Rinaldi said. And since the rescue obviously didn’t want to send a dog to a place where he’d be banned, they even called township officials ahead of time to ask if Diggy would be allowed.She said officials told them that if a veterinarian determined he was not a pit bull, he’d be fine. And when Tillery collected Diggy, he even got the dog licensed with the township as an American bulldog. So then what’s the problem? A loophole in the town allows police officers to essentially ban any dog they believe to be a pit bull at their personal discretion.“This is the craziest ordinance you’ll ever hear in your life,” Millman-Rinaldi said, explaining that it allows a police officer or animal control officer to make a “visual determination” about whether or not a dog is a pit bull.And the law says that determination can be based on criteria as vague and unscientific as the “personal and professional experience of the officer in having observed pit bull terriers in the past"" — though research has shown that visual identifications of dog breeds, even by people experienced with dogs, are often wildly off base.An online petition to lift the “dangerous dog” ban in Waterford has garnered more than 24,000 signatures as of Saturday afternoon.The Huffington Post was unable to reach anyone at the Waterford Township Police Department who could comment. But Police Chief Scott Underwood told The Oakland Press, “From our standpoint, it’s a pretty clear case of an ordinance that makes it clear what’s permissible and what’s not, and our job is to enforce the ordinance.”Of course, even if Diggy were a pit bull, banning a dog solely for that reason just doesn’t make sense.“Great dogs like Diggy are the ones that are set up to fail,” Millman-Rinaldi said, noting that he passed a temperament test from a certified dog trainer with ""flying colors.""If the town goes through with kicking Diggy out, the rescue group will take him back. But neither Tillery nor Detroit Dog Rescue wants to see the pair split up.“Right now we’re waiting to hear back from the township,” Millman-Rinaldi said. “I don’t want to bash Waterford. I think Waterford is a great place … We can come to an agreement.”"

Families take walks together each evening along the promenade, and in summer, in the squares, you see old ladies dancing with 5-year-old children. Family is everything, and all generations are included.""If I had to sum up why I love living in the Algarve as much as I do, I'd do it in four words: people, pace, peche, property.""I've told you about the people, the pace of life, and the food. Not only the fish, but everything you eat here is fresh and natural and just so good.""The final benefit I want to highlight for you is to do with real estate markets in this country, in the Algarve, in Lisbon, and elsewhere.

I love this new healthy eating visual because it not only colorfully depicts the five basic food groups: fruits, veggies, grains, dairy and protein. But it also emphasizes other important foods and nutrients that we need as we age. The latest science suggests that we should consume healthy oils, gulp more healthy beverages, consume less salty foods, and keep moving throughout the day. Let's see what's in this new MyPlate.Starting at the left side of the plate, the visual prominently reminds us that half of our plate should be chock-full of fruits and veggies. Produce is rich in nutrients and compounds that not only fight heart disease, but also certain cancers, stroke, diabetes and obesity.Tip: You don't have to eat fresh fruits and veggies to stay fresh. Unseasoned frozen produce, low sodium canned veggies and fruit canned in juice are all nutrient-rich sources. The best produce for your dollar is to buy what is on sale. The more produce you can get for your buck, the more you will consume.Moving clockwise on the plate, make sure that your grain choices are more often whole grains to get more fiber in your diet. Most older Americans are skimping daily on fiber. Tip: Choose whole grains over refined grains by buying 100 percent whole grain cereals for breakfast, whole wheat bread at lunch, and brown rice rather than white rice for dinner. Next on the plate, remember to consume three servings of dairy foods daily in order to boost your calcium and vitamin D intake. Both are nutrients that your bones crave but most older Americans are falling short of in their diets. Tip: Use reduced-fat milk rather than a coffee creamer in your morning java. The creamers may lighten up your coffee but pale in comparison to milk for providing vitamin D and calcium. Choose yogurts with added vitamin D. While milk is automatically fortified with vitamin D, not so for many yogurts. The last spot on your plate should be devoted to muscle-building protein. Meat and poultry will serve up the protein you need with less heart-unhealthy, saturated fat. Swap in fish for at least two meals weekly to reap the benefits of heart-protective, omega-3 fatty acids. Tip: Choose lean cuts of protein, such as roast beef, and skinless poultry. Substitute canned salmon or tuna for cold cuts at lunch to help you meet your weekly fish quota.Outside the MyPlate is a fluid visual to remind us to drink throughout the day. As we age, our thirst mechanism isn't as sharp as it was in our younger years meaning our body could be in need of hydration although we are not feeling thirsty. Tip: Skip the sugary beverages such as soda and use lower calorie beverages, such as water, to stay hydrated. Coffee, teas, and soups will all add fluids to your diet. Spice up your life with herbs and other spices as substitutes for salt. Blood pressure not only naturally rises with age but also with a high sodium diet. Chronic high blood pressure increases your risk for stroke and heart disease.Tip: Dump the salt out of your shaker and fill it with a no-sodium herb blend such as Mrs. Dash. Don't buy pre-seasoned meats, poultry and grains. Instead, use your new seasoning shaker to add some zip to your meals.Lastly, remember to move. Adults need at least two and a half hours of moderate-intensity activity such as brisk walking weekly. Even better, remember to move daily. Tip: Do your errands by foot rather than in your car. Running low on milk? Lace up your sneakers and walk to the corner store to get a quart.

This is an event that ""honors the courage, strength and determination of women, men and children who are forced to flee their homeland under threat of persecution, conflict and violence."" As I reflect upon this year's focus day, I remember my recent visit to Gaziantep, a Turkish city close to the Syrian border. Gaziantep is approximately 61 miles from Aleppo, Syria, part of a UNESCO World Heritage site decimated by conflict fueled by Syrian President Bashar al Assad's government loyalists, backed by Russian airstrikes, and between various rebels fighting for freedom and vying for shifting frontlines. Gaziantep hosts more than 350 000 Syrian refugees in various urban centers, disturbingly trending upwards from the 280 000 documented in a Human Rights Watch report of 2015. As a humanitarian and artist, part of my job is to take overwhelming statistics of tragedy and horror, and bring the numbers into focus. Each statistic represents a child, a woman, or man, with a compelling story and life. Each statistic represents a family, a journey, a life. Local NGOs working at the grassroots level such as Basmeh and Zeitooneh, a civil society organization started in 2012 run mostly by volunteers, are exemplary in this process. I was fortunate to spend a day at their community center in Gaziantep, interacting with the children enrolled there and the aforementioned volunteers who are also primarily refugees. They are making a quantifiable difference in the worst migrant crisis since World War II. The center provides early education opportunities and psychosocial support for approximately 90 children and youth ranging from ages 6-18 (although most of the children that I met that day were approximately 6-10 years old). They are supported with activities related to theater, photography, visual arts, choral singing and literacy. The center provides a critical service, considering nearly two-thirds of Syrian refugee children are not enrolled in any formal education institutions. Most of the children and their families are also essentially stateless, forced into the underground economy as child laborers in order to sustain a living. I was informed about one particular youth who would bring a knife to the center as he regularly used it as protection at his afternoon job as a shoe shiner.The children I met on that particular day were joyful, tightly bound to one other and exuberant in their play, seemingly unaffected by the horrors they came from. This is a testament to the effectiveness of the programming provided to them by Basmeh and Zeitooneh and its adjacent 6-month rehabilitation process. The manager told me that when some of children were first admitted they would only draw pictures with black crayons of headless bodies as that was their predominant experience in the ISIS controlled neighborhoods in Syria before fleeing. I subsequently snapped photos of what they were now producing. Their creations had transformed into beautiful and colorful paintings that stated their rights as a child, along with festive finger puppets to interact with each other and other pieces of art that typified the love they had for this safe space. The brave women and men who work and volunteer at the center additionally have their own harrowing tales of escape, forced migration and resettlement in Gaziantep. Their pragmatic resignation to history resonated deeply within me. They were are all fully aware of the images that we have seen throughout this now five year conflict and understood that there is little hope for effective outside intervention. Despite this, they all continue to selflessly commit their energy into the next generation, embodied in the many children at this community center. If we are going to give the appropriate gravitas and relevance to this year's World Refugee Day, then we must reaffirm each individual story, family and child that lives behind the overwhelming statistics. I can attest that the courage, strength and determination stated in the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees that we will celebrate on June 20th lives deeply resides in the Syrians I met in Gaziantep."
21,IMPACT,Women Feed the World,"Birikit Terefe, ContributorFeminist, Social worker, Social Entrepreneur",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/women-feed-the-world_b_10366718.html,"Women have inferior social status to men, occupying the lowest paid and most insecure positions requiring the least skill. Women are given less educational opportunities than men in the same society, reflected in lower literacy rates for adult female populations compared to male. But still they are feeding the world.",2016-06-11,"A woman breastfeeds her malnourished child at the Halo health post in Halo village, a drought-stricken area in Oromia region in Ethiopia, January 31, 2016. Picture taken January 31, 2016. REUTERS/Edmund Blair",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb18996200000e500ffadc0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When I was preparing to write this blog, I searched ""women and nutrition"" on the internet. I got more than 300,000 results -- most of them talking about women wellness or fitness, less about women and their active role in feeding the world. Very few articles were about pregnancy and nutrition. Unlike my search results, I want to paint a broader picture about the key role women play in their family and community and I want to argue that the key to change the nutrition of the world is by empowering women. A mother starts feeding a baby before it joins the world, in the womb. After birth women become the sole source of food for the first six months, which is a very significant time for all children. Women are undoubtedly the prime source of food for infants and children and this implies their unbeatable role in creating a healthy future generation. The nutrition of a pregnant and lactating mother will not only affect the current nutrition status of the baby but also yields a profound impact on the mental and intellectual capacity development of the next generation.This is an obvious fact and I started my article with this because this pattern frames the ongoing role of women in feeding their family and the society. Women -- in addition to their biological role -- produce, process, purchase and cook food for their family and relatives in many households.In Ethiopia, women take an active role in the farm and are responsible to feed the male farmer (their husband) and the rest of their family. The man gets to sell the grain and the women will take the small money given to her and purchase the food items for the family... the mother decides what the family eats with the meager resources she has. The mother also cooks the food and even decides portions and which part of the food is to be eaten by which family member. For instance, in the case of Ethiopia, there are certain parts of chicken bones reserved only for the male head of the family.So producing, shopping for food items, cooking, presenting... Women have a lion's share in all the above.With all this reality on the surface, I struggle with the thought of this significant part of society being illiterate (meaning a person that has no knowledge about balanced diets), economically dependent, disempowered, and discriminated against, an abused part of the society. Women, the main source of nutrition in the world, are underpaid, overburdened, and deprived from every aspect of life, socially, economically and politically. They feed the world with limited resources, knowledge and impact. Socially, I know in most counties in Ethiopia women eat last -- first the husband, then the children, then her. Generally, there is a higher risk of food deprivation among women.Women have inferior social status to men, occupying the lowest paid and most insecure positions requiring the least skill. Women are given less educational opportunities than men in the same society, reflected in lower literacy rates for adult female populations compared to male. But still they are feeding the world.So my question is how can we discuss nutrition and feeding the world without addressing this basic issue at hand? One of the main agenda for transforming the world nutrition is to treat this part of the society with respect, dignity and equality. Empowering women and making them resourceful, knowledgeable and given the choice about what they want to feed their family will transform the world. No doubt.But does empowering women by providing better access to resources work?Yes, it does.I have had the opportunity to eyewitness the result of women empowerment on their family and society in my work in Women's Health Association of Ethiopia. Working with 750 grassroots women in 14 groups in Ethiopia, WHAE starts its work by training women on health, nutrition and hygiene. We believe that knowledge is one of the pathways to a healthy life and healthy nutrition and hygiene. We then devise a way for the women to access resource so that they can have the money and network to implement their knowledge by investing in businesses and providing business education to assist the knowledge with tangible resource and income. In five years, more than 350 women are now running their own business (half of them involved in food production and processing). The result of this work is all the children going to school, children and family being well-nourished, and neighbors empowered to join more women groups to do exactly the same to their children. The women invested back to their family's food, education, and hygiene. This was consistent among all women who got access to information and resource. In my experience, whenever I ask women what their dream is or why they are running their business they always say, ""I am doing this for my children... for their education and nutrition.""I have witnessed women's access to productive resources affecting food availability at the household level and have seen their empowerment transforming the family and then the society.We at WHAE believe that knowledge plus access to resource leads to empowerment of women which will directly feed the family and reduce child and maternal death and malnutrition of the family. And I have witnessed it first hand with all our members sending their children to school and no child being malnourished in their family after five years of work. Now working with more than 750 women, I learn that women indeed are the key to feeding the nation and creating access to resource and knowledge will transform the way the world eats. Empowering women will contribute to greater sustainability, healthy nutrition, improved food security and equity both locally and globally.Women's economic importance in terms of their contribution to global food production has been officially recognized since 1974. Women are responsible for a large proportion of the world's food production, are central in determining levels of living -− and nutrition -− for the child, the adult, the household, and the community. Changing the status of women in societies will directly improve the nutrition status of the whole family. According to WHO, giving women farmers more resources could bring the number of hungry people in the world down by 100-150 million people.So why the little attention to women empowerment when we talk about nutrition? What are we waiting for? Let us empower women and feed the world.Birikit is the Director of Women's Health Association of Ethiopia, which is the sister organization of Norwegian Women Public Health Association (NKS); the oldest and largest women's organization in Norway.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) speaks at the Credit Union National Association Governmental Affairs Conference in Washington on March 11. Warren endorsed Clinton for president on Thursday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5759c90f1500002b00739bf1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for president.Warren gave her endorsement in an interview with the Boston Globe on Thursday.“I’m ready,” Warren said, according to the Globe. “I’m ready to jump in this fight and make sure that Hillary Clinton is the next president of the United States and be sure that Donald Trump gets nowhere near the White House.”In an interview with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Thursday night, Warren explained her endorsement and why she held off on endorsing during the Democratic primary, calling the work of Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-Vt.) presidential campaign ""powerfully important.""""He brought millions of people into the political process, he brought millions of people into the Democratic Party and for me that's what this is all about,"" she added.Warren emphasized why it's important for Sanders' supporters to now get behind Clinton.""I think about what's at stake in this election and I think about what happens if Republicans have the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives,"" Warren said. ""Say goodbye to the Affordable Care Act ... say goodbye to Dodd Frank ... say goodbye to a Supreme Court that is truly open and balanced and looking out for the American people.""Warren also stressed how much of a ""threat"" presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is to the American people. Her backing of Clinton followed President Barack Obama's endorsement, which he announced in a video earlier that day.Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who competed in the Democratic presidential primary, also backed Clinton on Thursday. Clinton clinched the nomination Monday after surpassing the 2,383 delegates needed for the Democratic nomination, according to a tally by the Associated Press.While Warren refrained from choosing sides between Clinton and Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) till now, she hasn't shied away from sharing her thoughts on the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump.Throughout the month of May, Warren took to Twitter to rant against Trump's misogynistic, racist, sexist, xenophobic rhetoric, and used public appearances and commencement speeches to address Trump as a ""small, insecure money-grubber who doesn’t care who gets hurt.""Her actions caught the eye of Clinton's campaign, as HuffPost's Sam Stein and Ryan Grim reported in mid-May:Dripping with disdain, the 140-character [Twitter] asides got under Trump’s skin (admittedly, not the hardest of feats). He accused her of “tweeting violently” and bestowed on the senator one of his trademark churlish nicknames. “Goofy Elizabeth Warren,” he replied in tweets of his own.Reuters reported Thursday that Warren has considered the idea of serving as Clinton's running mate, but has concerns. But several prominent Democrats think Warren would be an ideal VP candidate, including Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who hasn't publicly called for Warren to run with Clinton but said Tuesday the country is ready for an all-female presidential ticket.“I believe we should make up for lost time,” Reid said. “We’ve had all men.”"
27,POLITICS,What Black And Latina Women Want You To Know About Hillary Clinton,Julia Craven,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-latina-women-hillary-clinton_us_575ad4d9e4b00f97fba8100b,“It's difficult to connect with and trust her.”,2016-06-10,"A Black Lives Matter protester throws a fist up as Clinton speaks at an ""African Americans For Hillary'' rally in October.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/575ad68d1500002a00739dd5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- On Tuesday, Hillary Clinton became the first woman to be named the presumptive nominee of a major political party. Let that sink in: Ninety-six years after American women won the right to vote, the U.S. may finally be on the verge of electing its first female president. On social media and in regular media alike, women around the world rejoiced.But I was conflicted. And I wasn't alone.There's no doubt that Clinton’s achievement is breathtaking and historic, as the former secretary of state herself noted in a speech Tuesday night.“Tonight’s victory is not about one person,” Clinton said. “It belongs to generations of women and men who struggled and sacrificed and made this moment possible. In our country, it started right here in New York, a place called Seneca Falls, in 1848. When a small but determined group of women, and men, came together with the idea that women deserved equal rights.”But the specific racial context of the suffrage movement certainly doesn't do Clinton any favors with black women and other women of color. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who read ""The Declaration of Sentiments"" at that gathering in Seneca Falls, was a well-known racist who didn’t believe that all women were created equally.""The fact that even with all the discussion around racial equality and [Clinton] being challenged repeatedly by Black Lives Matter on race that she missed an opportunity to acknowledge [that] black women could not vote is telling of where we stand on the feminist agenda,” Tiffani Cordova, a 41-year old black woman from Illinois, told The Huffington Post via Twitter.It’s tempting to invoke feminism and say that non-white women should be happy for Clinton because she is a woman. And certainly, many of women of color are happy for her. But for some of us, identity politics just aren’t that simple. Many non-white women have taken issue with Clinton's choice to put her achievement in the context of women’s suffrage, with the implication that it's a victory that should resonate with all women equally. It's a move that for many women only confirms their feelings that Clinton has a blind spot when it comes to race.“It was a glaring omission. Hell, my grandmomma wasn't part of the group Hillary was referring to and I don't feel a part of that group today,” Cordova said. “A lot of times you'll hear the suffragette struggle being compared to the black civil rights struggle. It’s not the same. They don't want to acknowledge that their movement was steeped in a lot of racism and even today with ‘new’ racism.” My great-great-granny wasn't included either (I’m black, in case you haven’t noticed). In 1920, Vinnie Click couldn’t walk into a North Carolina voting booth and cast a ballot. Though the 19th Amendment had that year legally extended the right to vote to all women, black women still faced opposition -- mainly in the South -- and weren’t effectively enfranchised until the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965.And for some women of color, the wait for enfranchisement was even longer. Not until 1975, 55 years after the first white women cast their ballots, was the Voting Rights Act officially expanded to end discrimination against non-English speakers.“My thoughts on Hillary being the nominee are simple. It is extremely historic for white women,” Kara, a 21-year-old black University of North Carolina student who did not want to provide her last name, told HuffPost via Twitter. “However, her win does not pave the way for black women. It does not open doors and shatter glass ceiling for women of color. The only people who will truly benefit from this are other white women.”“Clinton is not paving the way for black women,"" she went on. ""Period.""While Clinton attracted far more black voters during the Democratic primary than her principal rival Bernie Sanders, she's also come under scrutiny for her attempts to woo voters of color, which have struck some people as clumsy and tone-deaf, if not outright cynical. It began in December with a Rosa Parks tribute that turned many people off, followed by Clinton's campaign bizarrely declaring that the candidate is ""like your abuela."" Clinton later told a crowd at Harlem's Apollo Theater to “raise the roof,” and a held a rally on Cinco de Mayo to discuss immigration -- complete with a mariachi band.Because Clinton has so often fumbled while trying to connect with black and Latino voters, many people have stopped giving her the benefit of the doubt. In April, Clinton claimed on Power 105’s “The Breakfast Club,” a hip-hop-focused radio show with a solid black listening base, that she always carries hot sauce with her -- a remark that many listeners took as a nod toward the Beyonce lyric “I got hot sauce in my bag / Swag,” from the insanely divisive song ""Formation.""Was this Clinton just trying to prove her street cred again? Actually, it's more complicated than that: Clinton really does have a history of loving hot sauce, going back to long before Beyonce bestowed the condiment's name on the baseball bat she uses to smash patriarchy. But the fact that people were so quick to accuse the former first lady of pandering is evidence of the mistrust many voters of color feel.Keyonda Proctor, a 24-year-old black woman from North Carolina, said instances like that are part of the reason she's skeptical of Clinton’s dedication to the black community.“As a feminist, I'm completely here for Hillary ‘invading’ a space that is historically male dominated. I will give her a standing ovation for that feat,” Proctor said. “On the other hand, Hillary Clinton in my eyes is just a white woman with a white woman's perspective pushing a white woman's agenda fueled by white feminism.” “She's unable to fully grasp the experiences of those that are not white,"" Proctor continued, ""[which is] evident in her continuous pandering for the black vote but support of policies that negatively affect the black community and her inability to provide real solutions for issues facing the black community.” Many black women who spoke to HuffPost echoed Proctor’s feelings. They are well aware of Clinton’s policy platform -- mainly her stated intentions to end mass incarceration, improve community relationships with police and disassemble the school-to-prison pipeline. These and other policy proposals -- such as building on the Affordable Care Act and protecting voting rights -- are one reason why Shannon McKinley, a 36-year-old black woman from California, is ecstatic about Clinton’s win. “These issues are important to me as an African American woman because I remember sitting in county clinics and emergency rooms for hours as a child because we didn’t have health insurance,” McKinley said in an email. “I am a product of public school. I know the value of quality public education and support Clinton’s policy to make sure every child has the opportunity to learn and thrive regardless of his or her socioeconomic status or neighborhood.” McKinley argued that Clinton has even accepted her past mistake of lobbying for and defending the 1994 Violent Crime and Law Enforcement Act. The bill has been heavily criticized for its role in swelling the American prison population by adding the “three strikes” provision, which incarcerates anyone convicted of a violent crime for life if they have two or more priors.“More importantly for me, however, is that Clinton listens and she has engaged with those who have protested her,” McKinley said. “She has demonstrated that she will work with people to make change happen, so I believe that things will improve under her administration.”Some women in the Latinx community have questions about Clinton's commitment to people of color, both in and outside of the U.S.“Her foreign policy, since her days as a Senator, has been to push for coups, militarism and more war,"" Raquel Saldierna, a 30-year-old Latina from Texas, said in an email. ""We risk more war and death under a Hillary presidency.”Saldierna went on to list a slew of decisions Clinton has made at various points in her career, including her support for the Iraq War and her dreadfully slow trudge toward supporting marriage equality when she was a U.S. senator for New York. Saldierna also pointed to the removal of Muammar Gaddafi in Libya while Clinton was secretary of state, a move that created a “power vacuum that wreaked havoc on civilians.”“I simply cannot trust her judgement,"" Saldierna said. Ana Maria Hernandez, a 20-year-old Afro-Colombian, doesn’t find Clinton relatable, and said she's not sure where Clinton stands on immigration. Hernandez noted that Clinton has claimed she won’t deport undocumented children -- but in 2014 she was on board with sending unaccompanied minors back to their native lands. ""Although she is proposing a promising immigration reform that leads to a path to citizenship, she hasn't been consistent,"" Hernandez said. ""And for me, that matters because we aren't here to just get her into the White House.""""She is proposing life changing policies that matter to millions of people,"" she went on. ""Whether or not she will follow through is crucial to how people will live their lives, and it must be taken seriously.""Hernandez also isn’t fond of how Clinton handled youth activist Ashley Williams. In February, Williams interrupted a fundraising event to bring Clinton to task for her 1996 comments on “super predators,” a racist term referring to black youth who are supposedly incapable of feeling empathy. As Clinton delivered a speech on racial justice, Williams held a sign referencing Clinton’s prior comments. When Clinton paused to look at the sign, Williams asked her to apologize for mass incarceration and informed the candidate that she was not a “super predator.” Clinton asked Williams if she could talk following the event. When Williams continued making her case, Clinton dismissed her.“When she dismisses a young black woman who is trying to ask her about her offensive and insulting past remarks about black youth in cities, when she doesn't seem to understand the Black Lives Matter movement, and when she think she's 'like my abuela,' it makes it incredibly difficult to stand with her,"" Hernandez said.Clinton later apologized for using the term ""super predators,"" telling The Washington Post that she “shouldn’t have used those words” and wouldn’t say them today. But to Hernandez, the fact that Clinton said them in the first place is a sign of a disconnect.“She most definitely doesn't understand me or my experiences,” Hernandez said. “These are issues that are closest to my identity and as a woman. So, as a woman of color, it's difficult to connect with and trust her.” "

29,ENTERTAINMENT,"Bassnectar Debuts Two New Hard-Hitting Tracks, Talks New Album 'Unlimited'",Ethan Fedida,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bassnectar-new-album-unlimited_us_575acd5ce4b0e39a28ad542d,"Bassheads, get ready. Your summer is about to be made.",2016-06-10,"Bassnectar performs on stage at the Okeechobee Music & Arts Festival on March 4, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/575aea351500002a00739e59.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the electronic music world, few artists elicit the intense passion and frenzied loyalty of their fans quite like Bassnectar, aka Lorin Ashton. His fans, known affectionately as bassheads, have supported the world-famous producer's impressive career by snatching up his music and following him around the world to a bevy of music festivals. Today, bassheads are teased with two tracks off of his album ""Unlimited"" -- due out June 17th -- to continue to whet their palate following the four tracks that were released last week. ""Unlimited Combinations,"" the title track for the new LP, has all the makings of a ""classic"" Bassnectar track. It will no doubt be heard at festivals and shows throughout the summer. ""Level Up"" is a track that promises to hit, and hit hard, delivering on its promise that ""we came to get down."" In addition to the new album, Bassnectar is headlining Mysteryland USA this weekend, held at the hallowed Woodstock grounds in Bethel Woods, NY. The Huffington Post had a chance to connect with Bassnectar to discuss the new tracks, the upcoming album, Mysteryland USA and the upcoming mega-event Bass Center 2016 at the end of July. Take us into your mind for a moment here. With these two tracks - “Unlimited Combinations” and “Level Up” - what is the story behind each for you? What's the experience are you trying to create for the listener with each?The title track “Unlimited Combinations” encapsulates the theme of the album: it's about the ""unlimited combinations"" of ideas in the creative process. At every step of the way, there are a million different paths to take, or doors to open -- and the combinations are endless. It's like being lost in a maze within the mind. There were so many versions of this song -- some with no drums, some with vocals, some with a totally different sequence -- and the interwoven melodies were like a symphony on their own, so it was just bursting with possibility. I found it exhausting because I wanted to explore every path and possibility, and then as the theme for the album emerged, I noticed this with everything: the art for the album cover, the order for songs, all the songs I had to leave off in the end due to lack of time. And the whole process gets even more complex when you factor in all the collaborators. With “Level Up,” working with Levitate and the vocalist Macntaj, it lead to further layers of bewildering complexity -- in this case, the song is about constantly pushing yourself further and further creatively, like the high of drive and ambition within art.The whole album is about art, and the magic and mystery of the artistic process. I've been collaborating with so many folks on this, not just musically. So many visual artists, app makers, collage artists, stylists and lighting designers, even directors. We have been working on special films and creative pieces for each song and the winter and spring were full of dedicated projects, working 24/7 with artists all over the country, as well as in Asia, Australia, Europe, Malaysia, Bali, etc ... It's been so interactive, and working with all the different artists makes me feel like we are a part of this huge team. The album art, too: a super in-depth process working with a new app called FREEMIX, a collage art program. Their team compiled various collages and then we worked with other artists to mutate it for the cover as well to animate it for future shows. And with all the musical collaborators in the mix, the creative possibilities have been endless. Hence the title of the album.How does the sound of both “Unlimited Combinations” and “Level Up” reflect on the sound of the upcoming album? How do they tie into what we'll hear on the 17th?Well, the four songs we released last week were pretty well-rounded. “Reaching Out” is sparkling melodic downtempo, “TKO” is a banger, ""Music Is the Drug"" is, to me, a very powerful song which has a lot of dynamic, and “Paracosm” is a deep chillout song. Overall, the album is very downtempo and a lot of deep, melodic exploration, so when I chose the two tracks for this week, I wanted to release “Level Up” because it hits so hard, like a slow-motion freefall and “Unlimited Combinations,” because it felt to me like a classic Bassnectar track. I used sounds/samples/parts from almost a dozen older songs to create this one.What will the set at Mysteryland USA be like? Should fans expect classic Bassnectar, or should we get ready to get wild to a lot of new music from the upcoming album due out next week? A bit of both ... I'll be playing a lot of the album for the first time, but also there are some old classics I haven't played in over a year or more, which I'm really excited to play. I've also been nonstop in the studio working on new remixes and ideas, and I play totally different sets each night. So there is a lot of careful planning ahead to preserve that originality, yet also a lot of freestyle improv because that's fun. :)Back to ""Unlimited."" When you begin creating an album, is there a certain direction or particular theme in mind or that you're trying to capture? Sometimes there is, but this time, I was just working on music during my break, really enjoying life and finding myself compulsively heading to the studio each day, even though I was set out to be ""on vacation."" Eventually, enough tracks emerged that I started conceptualizing a release, and after the song “Unlimited Combinations,” I decided i wanted to dive head first into that theme. You've made so many albums, EPs, and many have seen great success. What's your creative process like at the outset of each project, and have you noticed a difference in your approach to ""Unlimited""?Well, usually I am creating music for the live shows, and only rarely have I ""set out"" to write a concept album. In my mind, I imagine the personality of the song as a puzzle piece within future sets ... I feel so lucky to have this career -- It's truly a ""unicorn career"" -- because its full creative freedom, with an unbelievably supportive and interactive fan base, and I don't need to mess with any of the noise or lunacy of the pop/mainstream world ... I like to be reclusive and have my own life, and then when it's music time -- the shows & crowds are so intense and magical. It makes music writing a constant part of my life.Zion I, Levitate and Luzcid were all on your last album and are now present on this one. From album to album, do you look to build on an idea/momentum, or are they treated as their own entities on a new album?Each song is like a child I am raising, or like a close friend I am hanging out with ... it has a unique personality, and the interactions are very meaningful and intuitive.Do you have any other notable collaborations fans should be looking forward to that you could tease for us?I never think in terms of ""noteworthiness"" -- to me, it's music, not marketing. So if you enjoy the music, I'll be thrilled for you. If not, I hope you find whatever you enjoy, and really enjoy the process of enjoying it. The collaborators I work with are people whose musical talent I love, and whose personalities I enjoy working with. Collaboration is such an important part of my life as an artist, so everyone I work with is someone who is a joy to work with, and whose personality allows our synergy to flourish.That said, I am excited about each and every collaboration on here. The first two that popped into my mind were The Glitch Mob, with whom I've been close friends for eons, yet ""Paracosm"" is our first official song we have made together. Also Crywolf, because I simply heard his original song and fell in love with it: I reached out just to say thanks, and also to try and get interactive with the song. He sent over parts, and then I got to strip it all down and build it back up exactly as I wanted to hear it ... that kind of musical intimacy and respect is sacred to me.You, of course, have a fanatical group of incredibly intense and enthusiastic fans -- bassheads. To them, you are their bass god. How has their loyalty and passion for you and your music helped to shape your identity? Does consideration of them ever influence your music and creative process, for better or worse? Haha, no! I am a bass nerd. I don't want to be mistaken for anything other than a normal human, who is friendly and empathic, and makes as many mistakes as anyone else. The more attention and adulation I get, the more uneasy I feel ... I just want to make art and share it. If people like it, then that's magical! I make art for myself, but I 100 percent make it to delight, stimulate or reflect back to other people. I think I am doing this because I have been so inspired by life, and I feel so grateful for everything, that I just want to reflect that inspiration back to the world. So there isn't a need for approval, but if/when it makes a positive impact on someone else, I am happy. Bass Center is set to be held on July 29-30. What is it like basically hosting your own festival? Well, to be clear, I don't really think of this as a festival. To me, it's the largest Bassnectar event we have ever put together. But for over a decade my team and I have worked tirelessly on tours and events, and each one of them is overflowing with intention and creative ideas, and they all feel like ""the most important show ever"" -- so this one is different because it's so ridiculously massive. I didn't expect this many people to come, and so I'm just pretty humbled and amazed, and inspired to throw down that much harder.The lineup we have is fucking stunning to me -- each of the artists are amazing and gifted, and I'm super excited for everyone's set. We have two camping villages outside the stadium on lush fields, and are planning crazy special effects. It's basically just like the biggest, craziest gathering we could dream up in a central location -- viva Colorado! -- and it's also gonna be the biggest party we've ever thrown. But it's not just a party or a gathering to me or my team. It's really an authentic chance to cast a magical spell. We see this event like the ultimate playground of interactive live performance art for everyone in attendance to be a part of.How do you decide who will comprise the lineup for an event so near and dear to you? Beyond that, you have Flux Pavillion and Porter Robinson playing in addition to the likes of Lupe Fiasco and Wu-Tang -- how did this marriage of genres come to be for Bass Center? Over a year ago, we started working on the lineup and I was writing wish lists of bands and artists. I am a fan of each artist on the lineup, and extremely delighted with the musical journey that will ensue. There were other artists on the list who were not available (some had stopped touring, or had scheduling conflicts) and we are actually working right now on putting together next year's lineup. It's all part of the process. Community is just as meaningful to me as music, and crafting events is a special chance to transform a venue into a spaceship and blast off.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/575add411500002b00739df0.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Word to the wise: If you have to say ""I'm not trying to be racist,"" you're probably being racist.Fox Sports Florida sideline reporter Emily Austen appeared on Barstool Sports’s ""The Rundown"" Thursday evening with Barstool's personalities ""Big Cat,"" ""El Presidente,"" and ""KFC,"" making a plethora of racist and anti-semitic remarks. ""The Rundown"" is usually recorded and uploaded on Barstool, but this week's iteration was broadcast on Facebook Live. It didn't take long before Austen decided to give her unfiltered opinion during the 35-minute broadcast on a variety of topics from Mexican immigrants to Chinese students. At one point, she calls basketball player Kevin Love of the Cleveland Cavaliers ""a little bitch"" and ""a diva.""She went on to say, ""I didn't even know Mexicans were that smart,"" in reference to the undocumented Mexican student who received a full ride to the University of Texas. Then, a fellow broadcaster, Big Cat, goads Austen into talking about the Jewish culture which is when she makes an anti-Semitic joke about Jewish people being stingy and tells an inappropriate anecdote.She goes on to say, ""I'm not trying to be racist, but it's true.""But after the video was broadcast on Facebook, it was mysteriously deleted. In a post on Barstool's site by El Presidente (another broadcaster in the video) he says: ""We (Hank probably) somehow deleted the video which was supposed to be edited for the actual show today.” Silly Barstool. Deleted or not, this is the internet and what is dead may never die. The video was uploaded to Vimeo and there's an entire Reddit thread dedicated to the whole ordeal.Social media has been up in arms since Austen's commentary. Some have even remarked that her couch cohorts' support of her statements shouldn't be excused, either.As for the state of Austen's career, Steve Tello, senior vice-president of Fox Sports Florida, told Deadspin:We were made aware that Emily Austen appeared in a social media video unaffiliated with Fox Sports in which she made insensitive and derogatory comments. She was not speaking on behalf of Fox Sports, nor do we condone any of the statements she made in the video. Emily has been advised that her comments were unacceptable, and she is not scheduled to appear on any upcoming Fox Sports Florida or Fox Sports Sun broadcasts.The Huffington Post reached out to Austen for comment and will update this post when we receive a response.
