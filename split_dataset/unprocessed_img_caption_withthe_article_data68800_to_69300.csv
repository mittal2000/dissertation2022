0,SPORTS,Kobe Bryant Became Giddy When He Heard A Former NBA Coach's Praise,Juliet Spies-Gans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kobe-bryant-red-auerbach-praise_us_568448aae4b06fa68881ded5,"""That's like the coolest thing I've ever heard, dude.""",2015-12-30,"Bryant gets interviewed prior to a game against the Boston Celtics on Feb. 10, 2011, in Boston, Massachusetts.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56844dc8190000380178ad83.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On his farewell tour this season, Kobe Bryant will receive countless tokens of appreciation and respect from the 29 cities that make up the NBA solar system. But the gift that Bryant has been perhaps the most moved by thus far was one from an unlikely source -- former Boston Celtics coach Red Auerbach, whose decades-old, beyond-the-grave praise deeply touched Bryant in recent weeks.According to an ESPN feature published Wednesday, Auerbach was highly impressed with Bryant when the 17-year-old soon-to-be-superstar came to Boston for a pre-draft workout in the spring of 1996. ""I think this kid is going to be a hell of a player,"" Auerbach said of Bryant at the time, a burst of praise all the more meaningful as it came from the famously brusque, punctilious coach.Bryant was apparently thrilled to hear that he made such an impression on Auerbach, deeming the anecdote “‘the coolest f--king story ever"" when he first heard it earlier this month.""That's like the coolest thing I've ever heard, dude, because I grew up watching Red!” Bryant said. “… I read books about Red. I've never even known that he knew of my existence!""The Celtics had the No. 6 pick in that 1996 draft, and could’ve easily scooped up Bryant if they had been willing to take a chance on the headstrong teenager out of Pennsylvania. And now, with just hours to go before Kobe plays his last game within the city limits of Boston, Massachusetts, it’s fascinating to realize just how different NBA history could have been if the Celtics had followed Auerbach’s instinct and drafted Bryant with that early slot. Who knows how many victory parades in the last two decades would have been smattered in green rather than in purple and gold? Who knows if 81 would’ve ever happened, if Bryant's five titles would’ve ever happened, if the nickname Black Mamba would’ve ever happened?Fortunately for Lakers fans, then LA general manager Jerry West finally got the better of Auerbach when it came to appraising the young Bryant. And the rest, as they say, is history.Also on HuffPost:"
1,CRIME,Prison's Opening Delayed For Year Because Cell Doors Wouldn't Lock,Nina Golgowski,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/prison-cells-wouldnt-lock_us_5684370be4b014efe0d9e4c0,They had one job.,2015-12-30,"A Canadian prison's opening after a $40-million expansion was delayed for an additional year because the cell doors wouldn't lock, officials said.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/568438a31600000001eb9c50.jpeg?cache=qOnt7EOXKN&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A $40-million expansion at a Canadian prison failed to get one thing right: locks.For a year after the Springhill Institution’s revamp, the medium-security facility in Nova Scotia sat empty because its cell doors wouldn’t lock, a prison spokeswoman confirmed.Computerized locks securing the facility’s two new units were malfunctioning and some lights didn't work, among other deficiencies. The units had already been delayed by a year due to construction, and the glitches resulted in another yearlong delay before the first unit opened in September, Cathy Theriault, a spokeswoman for Correctional Service Canada, told The Huffington Post.“In our business, you kind of have to make sure that everything is perfect,” she said.The first unit opened about two years after the facility’s scheduled 2012-2013 completion, and the first inmates arrived this fall. The second and final unit opened this month.Locals anticipating around 100 government jobs at the new facility were reportedly questioning its status.“They were trying to find out why [the units] weren’t open, when they’d be open and when the jobs were coming. It was very disappointing,” Maryanne Jackson, a councillor for the municipality of Cumberland, told the National Post.The facility’s expansion was reportedly part of a $2.1-billion plan to add 2,700 beds to correctional facilities across Canada. The Springhill Institution's expansion specifically added two 96-bunk units.But according to the National Post, Springhill’s inmate population when the expansion was first announced in 2010 was 397.That's nearly two dozen more than the 375 inmates living at the facility as of Tuesday. It's designed to hold about 568, Theriault said.“Our population is a bit lower than it normally is right now,” she told HuffPost. “I think it's just trends in the region. We're not the only institution.”Scott Armstrong, a former Conservative member of Parliament who announced the prison's expansion in 2010, suggested a positive reason behind the empty units in September.“Maybe there’s been some success with the anti-crime legislation where people aren’t committing as many crimes,” he told the Chronicle Herald.Also on HuffPost:"
2,SPORTS,3 Big Stories From Al Jazeera's Doping Documentary That Don't Involve Peyton Manning,Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/al-jazeera-documentary-peyton-manning_us_56815a7be4b0b958f659e1dc,"""The Dark Side"" highlights serious questions about sports leagues' testing policies.",2015-12-30,"Beyond Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning, Al Jazeera's recent documentary raises questions about how sports leagues approach performance enhancing drugs.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56831296190000190178ac69.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The fallout of ""The Dark Side,"" Al Jazeera's new documentary about drug use in sports, has thus far focused on Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning, after Texas pharmacist Charlie Sly asserted in the film that an Indiana clinic sent human growth hormone to Manning's wife. Listen to Huffington Post sports reporter Travis Waldron and NFL veteran Dontè Stallworth discuss the documentary with Al Jazeera senior producer Jeremy Young on this week's episode of ""The Second Half"" podcast.Manning has denied the allegations, and Sly, Al Jazeera's main source, has since recanted his story. But beyond the unclear picture surrounding Manning, ""The Dark Side"" points to at least three broader problems with the way professional sports leagues approach performance-enhancing drugs.1. The ease with which Al Jazeera's undercover operative obtained PEDs.In the documentary, former British hurdler Liam Collins goes undercover as an athlete seeking drugs to help him qualify for the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.Collins is able to connect with doctors and pharmacists willing to provide PEDs, first in the Bahamas and then in Canada. Eventually, he ends up working with Chad Robertson, a pharmacist, and Brandon Spletzer, a naturopathic physician, who design a drug regimen that requires up to 10 injections per day, and includes some drugs labeled ""not for human consumption.""Later, Collins connects with Sly, who preaches the value of drugs like Delta-2, a steroid-like drug that he claims he has given a litany of NFL and MLB players to improve their performance. According to Al Jazeera, Sly offered Collins an instant injection, and the three men worked together to provide him with assorted drugs that the network now says it has stored away for evidence. It's no surprise that players have access to PEDs, but the fact that Collins obtains so many so easily shows that athletes looking to obtain these drugs won't have much trouble. 2. The doctors' boasts that tests can't detect their drugs.Sly claims in the documentary that he helped boost the performance of former NFL tight end Dustin Keller during the athlete's time at Purdue University, using a mix of testosterone and other PEDs. But the NFL's drug tests were more stringent than the NCAA's, Sly says, so Keller needed to change his regimen before the NFL Scouting Combine and NFL Draft. That's where Delta-2 comes in.""We just used Delta-2 because it wasn't detectable,"" says Sly, who also told Al Jazeera he coached athletes on how to avoid testing positive.Sly isn't the only one who brags about outsmarting drug tests. Robertson, the Vancouver-based pharmacist, says it's ""sad"" how easy it is for athletes to beat the tests their leagues administer.“No one’s got caught, because the system’s so easy to beat,” Robertson boasts to Collins. “And it still is, that’s the sad fact. I can take a guy with average genetics and make him a world champion.”The documentary even shows MLB player Taylor Teagarden saying he beat urine tests while using Delta-2 and other PEDs.There have long been questions about the effectiveness of drug testing, especially in pro sports, where more innovation and investment goes into producing new drugs than into developing testing for them. Researchers, meanwhile, have questioned the effectiveness of testing for PEDs at all levels of sports.“It’s unproven at just about every level. It rarely reduces drug use,"" Dr. Linn Goldberg, who has researched the effects of steroid testing, told The Huffington Post earlier this year for a story about testing in high school sports.""The Dark Side"" doesn't necessarily uncover new information about the effectiveness of tests, but it illustrates suppliers' dismissive attitude toward the testing systems they're trying to help athletes beat. And the film raises additional questions about how leagues like the NFL and MLB -- which often tout the strength and scope of their testing programs -- should approach PEDs given that their tests aren't catching a substantial number of users.3. Do owners and leagues truly care about PED use in sports?Those questions, of course, depend on whether the leagues actually want to prevent PED use. In the eyes of Eddie Dominguez, a former member of MLB's investigative unit, they don't. ""Nobody in baseball wants you,"" Dominguez recalls an MLB vice president telling him on his first day with the investigation team.""Having spent six years there, I think it's basically the bottom line,"" Dominguez says in the documentary. ""Like any corporation, it's there to make money. All we were doing was adding bad press to baseball.""Dominguez, a former narcotics investigator, generally agrees with the criticisms of drug testing.""As long as [athletes] know what the testing procedure is,"" he says, ""they'll always be able to beat it.""MLB disputed Dominguez's claims in a statement to Al Jazeera, saying it has been ""a leader in the fight against performance enhancing drugs."" The league instead blamed players for holding up the testing process (Players, indeed, fought testing for years).The number of positives that MLB's tests have yielded, however, remains low, according to its recently released numbers (its most recent PED-related controversy, the Biogenesis scandal, was uncovered through a newspaper report, not through players failing tests). And while the NFL has suspended numerous players for PED use, it has yet to catch any player using human growth hormone since it began testing for the drug last year.The mechanics of drug-testing programs are complex, particularly because they involve collective bargaining with players and concerns about privacy and due process. But with few positives coming out of the tests and few ways of re-evaluating the effectiveness of testing, it's legitimate to ask whether whether leagues are truly committed to preventing drug use or simply want to look like they are taking the issue seriously.Also on HuffPost:"

Now it's emerged that a chunk of that money has been earmarked to help bolster the agency’s plans for a Martian mission. As Popular Science noted, Congress directed NASA to use $55 million of its $19.3 billion budget to begin building a deep space habitat that will house astronauts during future exploratory missions to the red planet.Congress gave the agency until 2018 to develop a decent prototype model of the “habitation module.” NASA must also produce a report on the status of the program in 180 days.NASA said it hopes to launch a crewed mission to Mars by the 2030s, and to begin cislunar (between Earth and the moon) testing of a workable habitat by the 2020s.As SpaceNews noted, the agency has already started working with companies like Bigelow Aerospace, Boeing and Orbital ATK to study habitat designs. The new funding and directive from Congress, however, “could force NASA to speed up” these plans.NASA's habitation module may “shape deep space travel for dozens of decades,” wrote Yahoo! Tech. For now, though, very little is known about the habitat, including its requirements and how it will be built.“It’s much too early for that,” Sam Scimemi, International Space Station director at NASA Headquarters, told SpaceNews. “As soon as I put a picture up there, somebody is going to assume what the configuration is.”  Earlier on HuffPost:"

5,POLITICS,Puerto Rico Is Up In Arms Because The Obama Administration Basically Just Called It A Colony,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-sovereignty-supreme-court_us_56816a76e4b0b958f659eee5,Commonwealth officials are not happy about a legal brief the U.S. filed in a little-noticed Supreme Court case.,2015-12-30,Puerto Rico Gov. Alejandro García Padilla is in sharp disagreement with the Obama administration over the commonwealth's sovereign status.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As the federal government's lead lawyer before the Supreme Court, U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli has an important but relatively narrow role: By design, his views are intended to sway the justices and the justices alone.But a brief Verrilli filed last week with the court -- for an under-the-radar case in which the U.S. isn't even a party -- made waves far beyond, eliciting a media maelstrom in Puerto Rico, impassioned responses from officials and even an appeal to the U.N. The controversy brings to the fore a longstanding debate about the island's political future, which is already at a tipping point thanks to Puerto Rico's ongoing debt crisis.The reason for the uproar: Verrilli's brief stressed that Puerto Rico is still only a U.S. territory -- a non-sovereign with limited authority over its affairs.In a telling passage, the solicitor general told the Supreme Court that Puerto Rico ""could become"" a sovereign, but ""only if it were to attain statehood or become an independent nation.""After Verrilli filed the brief, Puerto Rico Gov. Alejandro García Padilla issued a forceful statement that essentially accused the federal government of doing an about-face. García Padilla, who supports neither statehood nor independence for Puerto Rico, called Verilli's stance ""contrary to all Supreme Court jurisprudence"" on the commonwealth's historic self-governance.The solicitor general ""has decided to adopt a position that's at odds with prior postures by his office with regards to the sovereignty of the Commonwealth,"" García Padilla said on Thursday, according to El Nuevo Día, a leading Puerto Rican newspaper.Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi, Puerto Rico's non-voting representative in Congress and a supporter of statehood, weighed in that same day, pointing to Verrilli's arguments as evidence that it was time for Puerto Ricans to stop accepting their status quo as ""second-class citizens."" The brief, Pierluisi said, was ""without a doubt the most complete document ever published by the United States government on the issue of Puerto Rico's political status.""Quite a fallout from a case that, strictly speaking, isn't even about Puerto Rican sovereignty.Rather, Puerto Rico v. Sánchez Valle is a criminal case involving two men who were convicted of gun crimes by the federal government. Puerto Rico wanted to prosecute them, too, but the defendants claimed that a second prosecution for roughly the same conduct violated the Constitution's double jeopardy clause.All 50 states, which the Constitution treats as ""dual sovereigns,"" can launch their own criminal prosecutions after the federal government has done so, provided some basic tests are met.But Puerto Rico is different, since it's a U.S. territory, not a state. The island's own high court ruled against the local government in the Sánchez Valle case earlier this year, saying the commonwealth has, essentially, no constitutional power of its own.""Puerto Rico's authority to prosecute individuals is derived from its delegation by [the] United States Congress and not by virtue of its own sovereignty,"" the Puerto Rico Supreme Court said in March.The court then took it up a notch: Puerto Rico never had any ""original or prior sovereignty"" to begin with. Rather, it explained, ""the United States has managed Puerto Rico through legislation passed pursuant to the territorial clause of the federal Constitution.""Those fighting words were arguably the reason that Puerto Rico's government appealed Sánchez Valle to the U.S. Supreme Court, which will hear the case on Jan. 13. (Earlier this month, the justices agreed to hear a second case dealing with the island's debt crisis.)So why did the solicitor general's office get involved? The answer is that it often files briefs in cases when there's a substantial federal interest meriting the government's views -- whether the matter is same-sex marriage, affirmative action or anything with implications for the country as a whole. What seems to have provoked outrage among some in Puerto Rico's political class was Verrilli's assertion that ""Puerto Rico is not a separate sovereign."" In line with the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, he argued that just because the island adopted its own constitution and a form of self-government in the 1950s -- all with Congress' blessing -- that doesn't mean it can claim a right to something it never had.""The Obama administration is essentially taking the position that Puerto Rico is a colony, which betrays the commitments the United States made to the world in the aftermath of World War II, when the self-governing Commonwealth of Puerto Rico was created,"" said Richard Pildes, a law professor at NYU who has been following the case and has worked on other cases dealing with Puerto Rico's legal interests.Indeed, ""colony"" is exactly the word the Puerto Rican governor used in a follow-up letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon -- to alert the international community that the U.S. had ""abruptly reversed course"" in how it views the island's status.""The U.S. Government has effectively taken the position that the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is unconstitutional insofar as it is based on an exercise of popular sovereignty by the People of Puerto Rico,"" García Padilla said in the letter, which was made public on Sunday.It is anyone's guess whether this political back-and-forth will come up at the January hearing in the Sánchez Valle case. But whatever the justices say over the course of deciding the case will reverberate in upcoming discussions over the commonwealth's standing.""Even small statements related to this issue potentially will have great significance for debates and executive-branch and congressional-branch policy going forward on Puerto Rico’s status,"" Pildes wrote in October, when the Supreme Court first took up the case.As for Verrilli, he'll likely get to make eye contact with Puerto Rico's lawyers very soon: When he filed the brief, he also asked the court to give him a few minutes to argue on behalf of the United States."

""Animal rights activists appeared at the Coastal Commission hearing and vilified SeaWorld in their 'testimony,'"" the lawsuit contends.Officials at the commission did not immediately return calls for comment about the lawsuit.Eight of SeaWorld's 11 orcas are the result of captive breeding, the lawsuit said.""SeaWorld has not collected an orca from the wild in more than 35 years and has committed to not doing so in the future,"" attorneys said.The complaint asks the Superior Court judge to either order the the restrictions be removed or order a new hearing of the development proposal, called ""Blue World,"" without the restrictions on breeding and transfer, and for the cost of SeaWorld's attorney fees.Earlier On HuffPost:"

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) put forward a lengthy list of Fed policy reforms on Dec. 23, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56841b6e1f0000c000e9cb69.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Federal Reserve is becoming the focal point of a longstanding divide between more business-friendly Democrats and the party’s populist branch over how the next president should promote full employment and police Wall Street.Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) put forward a lengthy list of proposals for reforming the Federal Reserve in a Dec. 23 op-ed in the New York Times.Lawrence Summers, a former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, who nearly became Fed chairman in 2013, penned a response on Tuesday agreeing with Sanders on some grounds, but forcefully pushing back against the notion that Wall Street influence at the Fed is too pervasive. The disagreement between Sanders and Summers embodies a larger rift within liberal ranks about the need to lessen the influence of Wall Street at all levels of government. But it also reflects broad agreement on the centrality of the Fed as an enabler of economic growth and the need for greater financial reforms.The Fed has a dual mandate to maximize employment and maintain stable prices, which it does primarily by adjusting a benchmark interest rate. Sanders argues that the proverbial revolving door between Wall Street and the Federal Reserve has led the central bank to neglect the public in both of these duties.Like many other progressive lawmakers, advocates and economists, Sanders believes that the Fed should not have raised the key interest rate -- as it did earlier this month -- until unemployment was lower and wage growth was higher. Prices, these critics note, have been rising at a rate well below 2 percent, the inflation target the Fed currently uses as a sign it must raise rates to prevent the economy from overheating dangerously.“Raising rates must be done only as a last resort -- not to fight phantom inflation,” Sanders wrote in his op-ed.Sanders also contends the Fed should have done more to impose conditions on its emergency lending to the big banks during the financial crisis and that it should be doing more to regulate them now.To address both of these problems, Sanders calls for a series of reforms of Fed governance aimed at rooting out conflicts of interest that make the Fed more beholden to financial elites and less sensitive to the needs of ordinary people.“If I were elected president, the foxes would no longer guard the henhouse,” Sanders wrote.Perhaps his most sweeping change would be requiring the heads of the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks to be appointed by the president, which would require Senate confirmation. He would also ban sitting financial executives from being board members of the regional Fed banks.Five of the seats on the interest rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee are reserved for regional Fed presidents, ensuring them a prominent voice in monetary policy. The committee officially consists of 12 seats, including seven presidentially appointed Fed governors. But due to the Senate’s unwillingness to confirm Obama governor nominees, it has lately consisted of just 10 members, giving the regional heads greater sway than they had in previous eras.Sanders notes that, at present, four of the 12 regional Federal Reserve bank presidents previously worked for Goldman Sachs. That is disconcerting to Sanders and others who argue that financial industry veterans are predisposed to prioritize inflation concerns over full employment.These Fed officials’ backgrounds, according to Sanders’ logic, also make them less likely to regulate the financial institutions they supervise with adequate vigor.Summers’ disagreement with Sanders at first seems to be tactical rather than strategic. He agrees, for example, that the Fed should not have raised the benchmark interest rate earlier this month and says that Fed officials have given too much weight to concerns about inflation.Instead, Summers points out that having the president appoint regional Fed presidents is unlikely to accomplish Sanders’ goal of increasing Fed accountability “given the dysfunctionalities of the Senate process.” Instead, Summers claims, it might “strengthen the New York Fed with its close ties to Wall Street and hawkish regional presidents in ways that Sanders would not like.” But it becomes clear that Summers rejects Sanders’ essential premise that Wall Street influence at the Fed is inherently corrupting. He argues that regulators’ professional experience in the industries they oversee is not necessarily a good indicator of their willingness and ability to police those industries effectively.“There is a tension between acquiring expertise and avoiding co-optation or cognitive capture,” Summers writes. Summers even implies that former industry professionals’ “expertise” may make them more capable of policing the fields they supervise.Some of the financial regulators most “respected” for their toughness, Summers notes, were Wall Street veterans, like Arthur Levitt, whereas many regulators with no professional finance experience, have presided over periods of lax oversight.Mike Konczal, a senior fellow at the progressive Roosevelt Institute and former financial engineer himself, said Summers’ critique speaks to a “divide” between business-friendly Democrats and more populist progressives as to whether the people running the Fed, and the process for selecting them, is a major concern.Konczal is decidedly more in the camp of Wall Street skeptics.“Just because Summers disagrees with Sanders’ specifics about governance and the revolving door, doesn’t mean there are not better solutions,” he added. “If they are bad ideas, it is imperative to come up with his own ideas.”Konczal points to a report by Carola Binder, his colleague at the Roosevelt Institute, as a template for such alternatives.Binder recommends requiring regional Fed bank board members to disclose potential conflicts of interest, as officials at central banks in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and the European Union already must do.Binder also calls for the boards of regional Fed banks to publicize the criteria they use to select bank presidents and invite input from the communities they serve.“The selection process is almost criminally non-transparent,” Konczal said. “It is not at all clear how the people they are choosing end up in positions that have profound consequences for millions of people.""The preponderance of Wall Street veterans among top Fed officials is not surprising given the lack of diversity among the people who appoint them. A 2011 Government Accountability Office report found that from 2006 to 2010 the ethnic diversity of the boards of directors of regional Fed banks, which are responsible for electing the bank presidents, was “limited,” as was the representation of people with backgrounds in labor and consumer advocacy. Fifty-six of 91 Fed bank directors who responded to the GAO's survey in 2010 had worked in finance.Sanders' plan is a broader version of what fellow Democratic presidential candidate Martin O’Malley proposed in July when he rolled out his comprehensive financial reform agenda. The former Maryland governor would require the head of the New York Fed, the most powerful of the regional Federal Reserve banks, and the Fed’s general counsel, to be appointed by the president.Hillary Clinton’s campaign did not immediately respond to request for comment on Sanders’ proposals.But Konczal is heartened “there is a lot more agreement” between Sanders and Summers, and their respective camps, than he would have expected.“They broadly agree that there are problems with the regulatory structure, that the Fed is too biased in favor of low inflation and away from full employment, and they both think the financial sector is not accountable enough -- particularly with the taxes they pay,” he noted. “This is a much better debate to be having than we were having a few years ago.”Also on HuffPost:"

13,POLITICS,Kentucky's New GOP Governor Kicks Off Obamacare Shake-Up,Jeffrey Young,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kentucky-governor-obamacare_us_5683e42be4b0b958f65ad4cc,But Gov. Matt Bevin gave few details on how he plans to reshape the state's expanded Medicaid program.,2015-12-30,Kentucky saw the second-largest reduction in its uninsured rate among all states under the Affordable Care Act.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5638fb2a1400002b003c9ce0.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin (R) formally launched his effort to remake Obamacare in the Bluegrass State Wednesday, vowing to negotiate with President Barack Obama's administration to devise a new way to provide health coverage to low-income residents of the state.At a press conference in Frankfort, Bevin said he would present a proposal by the middle of 2016 to reshape Kentucky's health care programs. ""We are going to transform the way in which Medicaid is delivered in Kentucky, and this transformation, I think, will be a model for the nation,"" Bevin said.The new governor offered little detail about what the change would actually look like, however. Under former Gov. Steve Beshear (D), Kentucky endeavored to make the Affordable Care Act work, expanding Medicaid to adults near or below poverty and creating Kynect, a state-run health insurance exchange. The newly minted governor now wants to overhaul Medicaid and scrap Kynect.Bevin is proposing to reshape Obamacare in Kentucky despite the success of the state's health insurance exchange and the Medicaid expansion. The Medicaid expansion has provided health coverage to about 400,000 low-income Kentuckians and about 100,000 have obtained private insurance policies via the exchange. These enrollments made Kentucky one of the Affordable Care Act's biggest winners, as the state saw a nearly 11 percentage point drop in its uninsured rate since sign-ups began in 2013, a decline second only to Arkansas.Although Bevin won office with a wide margin -- defying predictions of a narrow victory by state Attorney General Jack Conway (D) -- polls show Kentucky residents strongly favor the Medicaid expansion in its current form. Some 72 percent of Kentuckians, including 54 percent of Republicans and 43 percent of Bevin voters, want to keep the expansion as is, show survey results published this month by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. A slim majority also supports retaining Kynect, according to the poll. Most Kentuckians do not favor the Affordable Care Act itself, however, the survey shows.Kentuckians' views on Medicaid perhaps explain Bevin's evolution on the topic. He initially vowed to undo the expansion completely, but as his campaign neared the finish line and after he took office early this month, Bevin instead began to talk about modifying the program. He aims to emulate what Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) did in his state, where those who qualify under the Affordable Care Act must pay more for their health care than Medicaid enrollees in other states. Pence was a guest at Bevin's inauguration ceremony, when the new Kentucky governor cited Indiana's Medicaid program as a model. ""Indiana's is the model that frankly is most likely that we will look to replicate,"" Bevin said Wednesday.Beyond citing Indiana's initiative and Medicaid privatization efforts in states like Arkansas and suggesting his proposal would require beneficiaries to have ""skin in the game"" -- meaning they would be responsible for more of their medical expenses -- Bevin provided no information about his vision for Medicaid or Kentucky's health care system at large. The Obama administration would have to approve Bevin's plans to change how Medicaid works in Kentucky because the program is jointly run by federal authorities and agencies in the states. The White House has accommodated state officials looking to expand Medicaid while undertaking reforms, such as enrolling new beneficiaries into private health insurance plans rather than traditional Medicaid. But the administration has rejected other demands from states, such as requirements that Medicaid enrollees have jobs to qualify for coverage, which federal officials say would violate existing law.Kentucky will take a different approach, Bevin said at the press conference. Starting in 2017, the Affordable Care Act permits states to submit so-called innovation waivers to the federal government enabling them to reshape their health coverage programs while still receiving federal funding tied to the law.Bevin had a ""very extensive and substantive conversation"" with Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell earlier this month in preparation for formal discussions with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, he said. ""She is somebody who is very committed to this,"" he said. ""She and I had a good conversation about what solutions look like for Kentucky.""The bar for approving these waivers is set high under the law. Most importantly, states must demonstrate that their reforms will cover the same number of people at equal or lower cost than through Medicaid expansion and the health insurance exchanges. No state has yet attempted to use this mechanism, but Colorado voters will consider a ballot measure next year seeking to replace the state's current programs with a single-payer system that would cover all residents, which would require federal approval of the same type of waiver.""I'm absolutely confident that we can make this work. I'm confident that CMS will meet us in good faith, and I look forward to that dialogue and continued discussion, which has come out of the gate well,"" Bevin said. ""By the middle of next year, we will have an opportunity to know whether this is going to work or not.""While Kentucky reconsiders its Medicaid expansion, other states are moving in the opposite direction. South Dakota Gov. Dennis Daugaard (R) came out in support of the expansion this month, joining Republican governors like Gary Herbert in Utah and Matt Mead in Wyoming who are trying to persuade state legislators to adopt the policy. And in Louisiana, Democratic governor-elect John Bel Edwards is poised to revive the issue when he succeeds Gov. Bobby Jindal (R), a steadfast opponent of Medicaid expansion. To date, 30 states and the District of Columbia have broadened Medicaid eligibility under Obamacare.The Medicaid announcement is Bevin's latest action to carry out his campaign agenda just weeks after he became governor on Dec. 8. Bevin has reversed his predecessor's moves to restore voting rights to some nonviolent ex-convicts and to increase the minimum wage. Most notably, Bevin changed the rules for officials approving marriage licenses in response to the furor over Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis refusing to sign the documents for same-sex couples after the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the unions. The new governor also touted his plan to expand charter schools Tuesday.Also on HuffPost:"

""If you deport the refugee community, they are going to be killed,"" Gustavo Torres, executive director of CASA, said at a press conference outside the White House. CASA is the immigration advocacy group that organized the protest.The Washington Post reported last week that Immigration and Customs Enforcement was planning raids on families that entered the country illegally during a surge in border crossings last year, most of them from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. According to the report, which ICE officials would not confirm, the raids would target hundreds of parents and children who were ordered for deportation by a judge.The protesters began at the Democratic National Committee headquarters and then walked to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office. Next, they went to the White House, where they walked in a large circle for about 20 minutes, drawing the attention of tourists. ""Obama, don't deport my mama,"" they chanted.Their aim is for the Obama administration to cancel its plans for deportation raids and instead offer Central Americans temporary protected status to remain in the United States given the high level of violence in their home countries. ""These people -- these are children -- that need our help, that need our support, that need our protection from the violence that the region is suffering,"" Abel Núñez, executive director of the Central American Resource Center, or CARECEN, said at the press conference. ""So this is not about opening the doors for everyone. It's about a conditional and specific region of our hemisphere."" It's a politically complicated situation. The Obama administration has said since the beginning of the surge in crossings by women and children last year that those who don't have valid asylum or relief claims will be deported, and failing to deport those already ordered for removal would only bolster the argument that the president is refusing to enforce the law, particularly at a time when border apprehensions of children and families are once again rising.ICE spokeswoman Gillian Christensen said in a statement that the agency prioritizes deportation of ""individuals who pose a threat to national security, public safety and border security.""""As Secretary Johnson has consistently said, our border is not open to illegal immigration, and if individuals come here illegally, do not qualify for asylum or other relief, and have final orders of removal, they will be sent back consistent with our laws and our values,"" she said in an email. But the idea of rounding up families in raids prompted outrage from immigrant rights activists. Advocates say that even if the Central Americans were ordered for removal, targeting them for deportation is unjust. Many mothers and children lacked counsel and may have been unaware of their court dates or unable to present their cases, even if they had good ones, they argue.They said Clinton should speak out against the raids to show she is an ally of the Latino community.Democratic presidential candidates Martin O'Malley and Bernie Sanders, eager to seem as pro-immigrant as possible, quickly criticized the plans. O'Malley sent a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson on Wednesday ""to respectfully request that DHS reconsider this approach.""Clinton's campaign said the front-runner and former secretary of state had ""real concerns"" about the plan. Clinton spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said on Wednesday that the candidate ""believes the United States should give refuge to people fleeing persecution, and should be especially attentive to the needs of children.""""Families who arrive here should be guaranteed due process on their asylum petitions, including a full and fair opportunity to tell their stories,"" Hinojosa continued in an email. ""She believes we should not be conducting large-scale raids and roundups that sow fear and division in our communities. And she believes we should be investing in a longer-term comprehensive solution to the challenge of violence in Central America that causes so many people to make the treacherous journey north.""Republicans, meanwhile, have largely called for more deportations. Business mogul Donald Trump even took credit for the plan for raids, writing on Twitter that they were ""because of the pressure put on by me.""Jeny Benavides, an undocumented woman who lives in Stafford, Virginia, told reporters her eldest son, who is in his early twenties, could be at risk for deportation if the raids take place. He came to join her and the rest of their family -- including two U.S. citizen siblings -- from Honduras to escape violence there, including the murder of Benavides' brother. He was unable to get legal help for an asylum application and was ordered for removal.""My son is traumatized because of that death,"" Benavides said, as translated by another advocate.

Kim was secretary of the ruling Workers’ Party and chief of its United Front Department, which manages North Korea’s relations with South Korea. As Bloomberg noted, Kim was a veteran policymaker who played a central role as a negotiator between the two countries.Last August, Kim was involved in crafting an agreement that served to defuse serious military tensions between the two nations following an exchange of artillery fire and a border blast that maimed two South Korean soldiers.He also played a “leading role” in the orchestration of the 2007 summit between the late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il and then-South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun, The Guardian reported. With Kim’s death, concerns have been raised that relations between the two Koreas may deteriorate.“The South has lost a reliable interlocutor and contact in Pyongyang,” Michael Madden, editor of the North Korea Leadership Watch blog, told Bloomberg. “Kim Jong Un has lost a capable and trusted elder adviser whom he could rely on.”Experts said that finding someone to take Kim's place will be a challenge.“In light of the North’s nature, I don’t see anyone who can replace [Kim] in his role in daring to offer policy ideas and advice to the leader in these fields,” Yang Moo-jin, a professor at Seoul’s University of North Korean Studies, told The Guardian. “This is going to deliver negative impacts on inter-Korean relations,” Yang added.There has been speculation that Kim's death may be the result of “political foul play,” Agence France-Presse reported. “Some of the North's most promising party leaders have died in traffic accidents,” AFP noted. Kim's predecessor, Kim Yong Sun, reportedly died in a traffic accident in 2003.However, North Korea experts have said that the high rate of fatal road accidents involving officials could also be due to the country's poor quality roads or the tendency of officials to drive intoxicated after attending exclusive parties. Country officials also “tend to flaunt traffic regulations,” Bloomberg reported.  Earlier on HuffPost: "

With Kim’s death, concerns have been raised that relations between the two Koreas may deteriorate.“The South has lost a reliable interlocutor and contact in Pyongyang,” Michael Madden, editor of the North Korea Leadership Watch blog, told Bloomberg. “Kim Jong Un has lost a capable and trusted elder adviser whom he could rely on.”Experts said that finding someone to take Kim's place will be a challenge.“In light of the North’s nature, I don’t see anyone who can replace [Kim] in his role in daring to offer policy ideas and advice to the leader in these fields,” Yang Moo-jin, a professor at Seoul’s University of North Korean Studies, told The Guardian. “This is going to deliver negative impacts on inter-Korean relations,” Yang added.There has been speculation that Kim's death may be the result of “political foul play,” Agence France-Presse reported. “Some of the North's most promising party leaders have died in traffic accidents,” AFP noted. Kim's predecessor, Kim Yong Sun, reportedly died in a traffic accident in 2003.However, North Korea experts have said that the high rate of fatal road accidents involving officials could also be due to the country's poor quality roads or the tendency of officials to drive intoxicated after attending exclusive parties. Country officials also “tend to flaunt traffic regulations,” Bloomberg reported.  Earlier on HuffPost: "

However, it also keeps alive the drama surrounding its deteriorating finances as investors wait for the next shoe to drop.The island will default on a $35.9 million payment due to its Infrastructure Finance Authority (PRIFA). It will also default on $1.4 million due to its Public Finance Corp, but will make payments to most other authorities. The island was facing a bill of about $1 billion had it made all payments.This announcement now opens the door to litigation from holders of defaulted bonds.The U.S. Commonwealth, suffering from a near decade-long recession with a 45 percent poverty rate and a shrinking tax base due to people leaving the island, first defaulted in August when it failed to make the full payment on its Public Finance Corp (PFC) bonds.Garcia Padilla is expected to address the island's debt crisis at a press conference shortly. He has said the $70 billion in debt outstanding is not payable and requires restructuring. Puerto Rico has been negotiating with creditors to try and persuade them to take a reduction.Puerto Rico's general obligation debt carrying an 8 percent coupon and maturing in 2035 last traded on Tuesday with an average price of 71.726 cents on the dollar. .Island officials have given clear warnings of defaults. Melba Acosta, president of the island's Government Development Bank (GDB) was quoted in local media saying the island was expected to default on a Jan. 1 payment on its PRIFA bonds.A creditor-side source told Reuters on Tuesday that some creditors were preparing possible lawsuits in the event of default, but it was unclear how quickly they could be filed.Maintaining the GO payment avoids the messy possibility of defaulting on debt backed by constitutional guarantees and considered the class with the strongest legal protection for investors. Its next test on GO debt is not until July, when it faces a about $1.9 billion payment.Garcia Padilla on Dec. 1 granted the U.S. territory power to take revenues from public agencies such as the highways agency HTA, PRIFA and its convention center authority in order to pay GO debt and maintain essential services.(Reporting by Megan Davies in New York; additional reporting by Nick Brown in San Juan; Editing by W Simon and Diane Craft)"

Complying with a deadline the court set earlier this month, Texas aimed to keep its prior victories in place and urged the justices not to take the case, arguing that the initial court order preventing the programs from moving forward -- plus an appeals decision affirming it -- “was necessary to uphold the separation of powers and ensure the proper functioning of the administrative state.”“This particular assertion of unilateral Executive power occurred in the immigration context. But if [the federal government’s] arguments are accepted, there is nothing stopping this Executive or future Executives from invoking resource constraints to declare conduct lawful in other areas -- such as environmental, tax, criminal, campaign finance, and civil-rights laws,” Texas stated in its brief to the court.Obama announced the new deportation relief program last November as part of a series of sweeping executive actions on immigration. The largest was a new policy called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA, to allow certain undocumented parents to remain in the country and work on a temporary basis. The president also announced an expansion of the existing Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which does the same for certain undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. before they turned 16.Texas sued to challenge the constitutionality of the program last December, and shortly after, 25 states joined the lawsuit, which has kept the policies in limbo ever since.Calling Obama’s policies a “sweeping and unprecedented assertion of Executive authority,” Texas repeated many of the arguments it has presented in lower courts -- among them, that these initiatives cause Texas substantial “harm,” that the program constitutes agency action and is thus perfectly reviewable by federal courts, and that Obama lacks “substantive authority” to enact it on his own.“In reality, of course, DAPA is a crucial change in the Nation’s immigration law and policy -- and that is precisely why it could be created only by Congress, rather than unilaterally imposed by the Executive,” Texas said.“President Obama’s executive action on immigration represents an unprecedented attempt to expand the power of the executive branch,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement accompanying the brief. “The president alone does not have the authority to grant millions of illegal immigrants a host of benefits -- like Social Security and Medicare -- which should be reserved for lawful citizens. Rewriting national immigration law requires the full and careful consideration of Congress, and Texas will continue to fight this affront to the rule of law.”Texas' latest filing with the Supreme Court comes after a procedural win for the Obama administration, which successfully opposed the state’s bid for an extension to respond to the appeal -- which, under court rules, could have pushed the case for resolution until after the presidential election. The move by Texas was widely viewed as an attempt to game the clock and prevent the Supreme Court from acting in the case before its current term ends in June, but the court instead set a deadline for the state to respond by Tuesday.Toward the end of the brief, lawyers for Texas seem to take a more conciliatory tone and appear resigned to the Supreme Court getting involved in the dispute “if the case merits review.” It's still unclear whether the court will do so, but as things stand now, the justices could decide to hear the case following one of their January conferences, which would allow for additional briefing in February and March, oral arguments in April, and a decision by the end of June.And if the court does add the case to its docket, it would join other blockbusters already under consideration, such as cases on abortion, affirmative action and the future of public unions. All of them, in one way or another, could energize candidates seeking the presidency. The 26 states that signed on to the lawsuit are Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin.Other states, cities and national lawmakers joined briefs in support of DAPA and the expanded DACA, arguing the policies are beneficial to the economy, public safety and those who live in the U.S. ""Each day that these reforms are delayed harms people who want nothing more than to come out of the shadows and live and work legally to support their families,"" Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who led one amicus brief, stated earlier this month. ""This affects our friends, families, neighbors, and our state as a whole.""Also on HuffPost:"
26,POLITICS,Donald Trump Says He's Finally Going To Start Spending His Money In 2016,Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-ad-blitz-money_us_5682a782e4b0b958f65a6a7f,"The GOP presidential hopeful is planning a ""big"" ad blitz.",2015-12-29,GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump says he'll start spending money in 2016 to support his bid for the White House.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5682a883190000190178abb9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump often brags about his wealth, and how, contrary to his rivals, he can self-fund his way to the White House. It is a boast intended to solidify his image as the un-buyable candidate with the mettle to take on the establishment. However, thanks to wall-to-wall media coverage of the Trump campaign, the GOP frontrunner hasn't had to spend as he reaps the benefits of free publicity. The businessman has led in the polls, since first entering the race over the summer, without dropping hardly a dime on his own behalf.That's about to change in the new year.On Tuesday, Trump announced via his favorite social medium that he is planning on spending ""big"" in early primary states.He also used the opportunity to take a dig at his preferred punching bag, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.As yet, no firm numbers have been mentioned, so it's not clear how much of his own money Trump is ultimately planning to commit to his bid for the White House. (It is worth noting that Trump has raised a substantial sum from unsolicited donations -- nearly $4 million in the third fundraising quarter.) The new ad blitz, however, ""could cost at least $2 million a week,"" according to Fox News, and would focus on the candidate and his vision for the country.The shift in strategy comes in the wake of Sen. Ted Cruz's (R-Texas) surging popularity -- in the last month he jumped into first place in the early caucus state of Iowa. It also follows fresh questions over the strength of Trump's early-state get-out-the-vote efforts, which have been described as less robust than those of his fellow rivals.Also on HuffPost:"
