Paul LePage (R) held a press conference Friday to stop some of the damage from his recent comments about heroin dealers, insisting he was not being racist when he said that men with names like ""D-Money"" come to the state and ""impregnate a young white girl before they leave.""""I apologize again,"" LePage told reporters, saying he ""slipped up."" ""My brain was slower than my mouth.""During a town hall meeting Wednesday, LePage told constituents that Maine needs to beef up enforcement in order to address the state's heroin crisis. He said there were traffickers coming from Connecticut and New York with names like ""D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty"" who ""come up here, they sell their heroin and they go back home.""Incidentally, half the time they impregnate a young white girl before they leave, which is a real sad thing because then we have another issue that we've got to deal with down the road,"" he added.The comments quickly went national, with the media calling them ""racist"" or, at the very least, ""racially charged."" Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign even weighed in, saying they were ""racist rants."" LePage, however, said Friday that his remarks had nothing to do with race.""I tried to explain that Maine is essentially all white,"" he said. ""I should have said 'Maine women.'""According to the Census Bureau, Maine is 95 percent white, which is a far higher percentage than the country at large. LePage also said he didn't intend to imply that people with names like ""Smoothie"" were black.""I never said anything about white or black on traffickers. ... What are they, black? I don't know. I just read the names,"" he said. LePage, as usual, also went after the media for focusing on his comments instead of the broader heroin crisis. He said they were goaded by blogs into covering his remarks.""You are in the back pocket of the Maine bloggers. Shame on you. Shame, shame, shame,"" he said. Reporters challenged LePage's charge that they haven't covered the heroin epidemic, asking him what they missed. ""I'm not certain of everything you've missed, but I've only read two articles that really explained what is happening in society,"" he said.LePage has long had a bitter relationship with newspapers in Maine, saying he'd like to blow up the Portland Press Herald's building and shoot a Bangor Daily News cartoonist. In April 2014, he also said the ""worst part"" of his life was that ""newspapers are still alive.""LePage is an outspoken supporter of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) and was the first prominent elected official to endorse his presidential bid. Also on HuffPost:"
1,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Says A Republican President Would 'Break' The Supreme Court,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-supreme-court_us_568fbb2fe4b0a2b6fb6f9ec5,"Clinton said that the court's composition ""could undermine virtually every pillar of the progressive movement.""",2016-01-08,"Secretary of State Hillary Clinton greets Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, two Supreme Court justices appointed by President Barack Obama, Jan. 25, 2011.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/568fc1161700002c00567073.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The future of the Supreme Court hangs in the balance, and Hillary Clinton wants you to know she's the one who can save it.In an op-ed for The Boston Globe published Friday, the former secretary of state and Democratic presidential hopeful explained how the 2016 election marks a ""make-or-break moment"" for the balance of power on the high court -- and what could happen if a Republican is elected president.""The stakes are clear,"" Clinton wrote of the slate of cases now pending before the court. ""In a single term, conservative justices could undermine virtually every pillar of the progressive movement.""It appears that Clinton did her homework, as she delves into the particulars of some of the biggest cases the court has heard in recent months, as well as those it's about to hear -- including cases on affirmative action, immigration, voting rights and the livelihood of public unions. ""Those who care about the fairness of elections, the future of unions, racial disparities in universities, the rights of women, or the future of our planet, should care about who appoints the next justices,"" Clinton wrote.The current demographics of the Supreme Court are what make the coming election such a relevant issue. Clinton noted that three justices on the court -- Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Antonin Scalia -- will all be in their 80s by the time November rolls around, ""which is past the court's average retirement age.""Clinton appears to be playing catch-up with the field of Republican canididates, many of whom have devoted significant airtime to the issue of who sits on the court. In debates and on the trail, various GOP candidates have spent time discussing the merits and demerits of specific justices. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), whom Clinton singled out by name, is perhaps the most vocal of them all. In November, Cruz told Bloomberg Politics that Republicans have an ""abysmal record"" picking Supreme Court justices. He has vowed to pick ""rock-ribbed conservatives"" to the court, and has also said that Chief Justice John Roberts -- whom Cruz himself once supported -- is actually a bad choice to lead the court because he lacks a ""true conservative record.""Democrats, by contrast, have not once brought up the composition of the Supreme Court during debates, and have only glancingly referred to ""litmus tests"" for whom they would eventually pick -- as both Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have done in reference to the court's Citizens United decision.Clinton's op-ed is also notable in that she argues how Republicans see this election as their chance to ""pack the courts with jurists who will turn back the clock"" on progress -- apparently an acknowledgement that some of the more controversial cases to go before the justices got their start in lower courts that were willing to hear them. ""After years of accusing liberals of judicial activism, conservatives are wholeheartedly relying on Republican-appointed judges to undo progressive achievements,"" Clinton wrote. ""They’re using radical legal strategies to accomplish through the courts what they’ve failed to do through legislation, like dismembering the Voting Rights Act or attacking unions.""Maybe this is the beginning of a shift in the Democratic field to remind the base that by voting with the future of the judiciary in mind, they're voting for many things at once."

Thankfully, after four months, doctors in Miami gave her one -- with the help of a tool you don't see in most operating rooms: a modest, build-it-yourself virtual reality viewer called Google Cardboard. Because of Teegan's missing lung, her heart is located in her far left chest, making it very difficult to operate. Doctors at the Nicklaus Children's Hospital were further disadvantaged due to a broken 3-D printer, which meant there was no way to design or plan a surgery.That's when the hospital got creative.Using Teegan's CT scans, the hospital converted the imagery into a digital 3-dimensional model, which was then made compatible with the Google Cardboard viewer, according to a press release from the hospital.When used in combination with a smartphone, Google's $20 kit enabled Teegan's team of doctors to view her heart from all angles within the context of her body. They were then able to design a surgery perfectly suited to her heart, greatly reducing the risk of operation.On Dec. 10, Dr. Redmond Burke performed a seven-hour open-heart surgery, essentially rebuilding the 4-month-old's heart.Burke believes Google Cardboard, simple as it may look, made the operation possible.“There are certainly more expensive technologies you could use to look at virtual imaging, but I thought this was really elegant because it’s essentially a cardboard box,"" Burke told reporters at a press conference. Now, though Teegan will require more surgeries, her parents are hopeful that she will pull through.""Being innovative seems to be the goal for this hospital and its doctors,"" Cassidy Lexcen said, according to the Miami Herald.

6,POLITICS,Democrats Criticize White House On Deportation Raids In Tense Meeting,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/white-house-democrats-deportation-raids_us_568eeaf3e4b0a2b6fb6f7499,The raids have picked up 121 people the administration says have received final deportation orders.,2016-01-07,"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.), left, have both criticized the Obama administration over deportation raids.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- White House officials faced frustrated and upset Democrats on Thursday when they went to Capitol Hill to discuss deportation raids on mothers and children. The raids, which have picked up at least 121 individuals, increased tensions between the Obama administration and champions of undocumented immigrants in Congress, who say the actions are inhumane and harmful to highly vulnerable people. That's what they told White House domestic policy adviser Cecilia Muñoz and Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas in a meeting that, according to one Democratic House aide, ""went quite poorly"" for the administration. Another aide briefed on the meeting called it tense, but not uncivil. Democratic members told officials they were concerned that mothers and children weren't receiving enough due process, and should be treated as refugees, according to multiple aides with knowledge of the meeting. The raids are targeting families who came to the U.S. without authorization sometime after May 1, 2014, in a wave of women and children who said they were fleeing violence in Central America. Members also told administration officials the actions were causing fear in the immigrant community as a whole, contradicting earlier efforts to focus deportation efforts on criminals. ""I think we made the concerns clear and we'll see,"" Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), one of the attendees, told Politico after the meeting. ""People are staying home for work out of fear ... it needs to be analyzed.""House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) attended the meeting, along with Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), a number of members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and other members involved in immigration matters. Pelosi criticized the raids earlier in the day, telling reporters she worried some families would be in danger if deported.Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said earlier this week that the deportations fit the administration's priorities for removal -- priorities that many Democrats supported. He said in a statement that the 121 people picked up in the raids all received final deportation orders by a judge and qualified as recent arrivals to the U.S., one of the categories considered a priority. He said at the time, as has been reiterated by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other administration officials, that the individuals in question had no pending appeals or claims for relief, and had exhausted legal remedies to stay. An administration official, who declined to be identified by name, confirmed that other officials briefed members of Congress on enforcement actions, noting that the number of border apprehensions of children and mothers is going up again.""While we recognize the serious underlying conditions that cause some people to flee their home countries, at the same time we cannot allow our borders to be open to illegal migration,"" the official said. ""Those who come here illegally will be sent home after being provided an opportunity to have their cases heard, consistent with our laws and values."" Also on HuffPost:"
7,BUSINESS,Why Bernie Sanders Wants To Make Credit Rating Agencies Into Nonprofits,Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-credit-rating-agencies_us_568d2826e4b0a2b6fb6e0bff,The presidential hopeful says the industry has a major conflict of interest. He's not wrong.,2016-01-07,"When it comes to credit rating agencies, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders wants to remove profits from the picture entirely.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/568d56d7190000c90178b342.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Bernie Sanders' financial reform plan is chock-full of clear goals, even if it's not always clear whether he can actually achieve them. He wants to break up the big banks. He wants to send financial fraudsters to prison. He wants to put a cap on ATM fees. And he wants to turn the country's credit rating agencies into nonprofits.Wait, what?The push to overhaul the rating agencies is one of the wonkier proposals to come from the Vermont senator. Why reform credit rating agencies? Despite what their name implies, these companies, such as Moody's and Standard & Poor's, are private, for-profit businesses that make money evaluating how risky debt is.The problem is that they were spectacularly bad at evaluating risk when it came to the junk mortgage debt that triggered the financial crisis. Tens of thousands of mortgage securities were given triple-A ratings in the runup to the crisis, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission found. At the same time, there were only six triple-A-rated companies. Of course, the rating agencies weren't the only parties that got it disastrously wrong on housing-related debt. They do, however, have a very specific conflict of interest: They are paid by the issuers of the debt, but they provide their services to the investors in the debt.As a result, the rating agencies' business model includes a built-in incentive to produce shiny ratings that make issuers happy. And in the case of mortgage securities, those issuers were the banks. Sanders' proposal is to change that business model -- to make it, in fact, not a for-profit business model at all.Investors would not have bought the risky mortgage backed derivatives that led to the Great Recession if credit agencies did not give these worthless financial products triple-A ratings -- ratings that they knew were bogus.Take away the profit motive, the thinking goes, and the rating agencies will produce fairer assessments of risk for investors. The strong implication is that under this plan, the banks and companies won't pay for the debt they issue to be rated. This is called the ""issuer pays"" model. The Sanders campaign did not respond to questions about who would pay and other specifics of the plan.And so, the question is: If the issuers aren't going to pay for the credit ratings, then who is? Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) has a plan to randomly assign ratings work to different companies. Under this plan, the more accurately a company rates the riskiness of the debt it's assigned, the more business it gets. The issuer still pays, but the incentives are changed.Or Sanders could try to make debt markets more like equity markets, where there are lots of analysts putting ratings on stocks. There is tension inherent in that model for stock research, and there have been glaring conflicts exposed in the past, but on the whole, because there are so many stock analysts, the individual stock ratings by themselves have very limited power.There's also the question of why investors, who were harmed by the rating agencies' bad work, haven't taken it upon themselves to solve this issue. After the financial crisis, you might have expected a critical mass of pension funds and other investors not just suing credit rating agencies, but demanding that the agencies eliminate the conflict of interest by paying for their own credit ratings, rather than relying on the people issuing the debt to foot the bill. It didn't happen.Maybe that's because big investors are expense-obsessed right now, largely for good reasons. Or maybe it's just logistically easier for the seller of the debt to pay for the rating. After all, while a single debt security can have thousands of potential buyers, it's only got one issuer.But the trickier issue is that paying directly for ratings would require big investors to take more immediate responsibility for what they buy -- rather than just gobbling up anything with the right letters of the alphabet slapped on it, and blaming someone else when it turns out to be worthless."

Now, thanks to a new study out of the University of California, San Diego, scientists have confirmed that sharks essentially smell their way through the open ocean.After capturing 26 leopard sharks near La Jolla, California, researchers temporarily impaired the sense of smell for 11 of them. The entire group, which is typically a nearshore species, was then taken about five and a half miles offshore and released. In order to prevent clever sharks from retracing their steps, the scientists did their best to confuse them, including by masking geomagnetic cues and driving the boat in figure-eight maneuvers. Researchers found that after four hours, the sharks with a normal sense of smell made their way about 62 percent closer to the shore, ""following relatively straight paths."" But the sharks with an impaired sense of smell only ended up about 37 percent closer, ""following significantly more tortuous paths,"" according to a press release.The results suggest that the sense of smell -- likely the ability to pick up on chemical gradients in the water -- contributes greatly to a shark's navigational abilities. Sharks are built to have a keen sense of smell. Their nostrils, which are used solely for smelling, are lined with specialized cells that pick up on dissolved chemicals in the water, and their brains have enlarged olfactory bulbs, allowing them to detect extremely small amounts of certain chemicals.This skill comes is especially handy when it comes to hunting prey.

Paul Gosar would establish a formal process for revoking the nation's highest civilian honor. Cosby, who has been accused of sexual assault or rape by more than 50 women, was awarded the Medal of Freedom in 2002 by President George W. Bush.Gosar said while the once-beloved entertainer should be presumed innocent until proven guilty, Cosby already admitted in a 2005 sworn deposition that he obtained Quaaludes, a prescription sedative drug, to give to women he wanted to have sex with. Cosby was also charged last week with sexual assault in Pennsylvania.""As a standing person with the Presidential Medal of [Freedom], you can't have that. You just can't have that,"" Gosar said Wednesday. ""That award should be so encompassing for the whole aspect of your life, and there's no room to have a bad apple.""Here's a copy of Gosar's bill:President Barack Obama was asked in July about taking away Cosby's award and responded that he had no way to do so. Gosar said that ever since he's been working with sexual violence prevention groups like PAVE (which stands for ""promoting awareness, victim empowerment"") to change that.Gosar spokesman Steven Smith said the lawmaker is still collecting co-sponsors for the bill from both parties. They'll have a more definitive headcount by Friday.""Obviously, this is not a partisan issue and we welcome all co-sponsors,"" Smith said.UPDATE: 4:30 p.m. -- Gosar said Thursday that he has six Republican co-sponsors and expects ""quite a few more"" from both parties. He said he hasn't talked to his party leaders, the Senate or the White House about the legislation. Instead, he said, he wants to build a groundswell of support for the bill from the bottom up.White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Thursday that Obama would take a look at Gosar's bill if Congress votes on it, but suggested the president may have concerns with it.""Commemorations are always difficult to deal with,"" he said in his daily briefing. ""You certainly wouldn't want a scenario where this kind of process could get infused with politics and you have successive Congresses in the future passing pieces of legislation to try to undo medals conferred by previous presidents that happened to be in the other party.""He added, though, that the president doesn't in any way condone Cosby's alleged behavior.Obama showed ""his own personal disgust"" for Cosby's alleged actions in a July press conference, Earnest said. ""The president made clear that he doesn't have any tolerance for it.""Matt Fuller contributed reporting.Also on HuffPost:"

They've lost sleep worrying about a potential police raid. An army of reporters accosted them every morning. And the majority of attendees at a community meeting voted for them to leave.But they do have a horse.On Thursday morning, an occupier on horseback rode around the base of a watch tower at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge headquarters, about 30 miles from Burns. I ran over to learn more about this man and his noble horse, even though I am allergic to horses. A pack of reporters soon followed, but were instructed to stay back, because the horse was ""pretty nervous."" For a glorious three minutes before other reporters were allowed to approach, this interview was entirely exclusive. The horse's name is Hellboy, like the comic book character, because he was a ""handful when he was a little baby,"" his rider explained.The man, who was later named as Duane Ehmer, wore a USA jacket and carried an American flag. He is staying at the headquarters with the other occupiers, who are led by the sons of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy.The occupiers want two local ranchers released from prison, and to free up federal land for local use. To make their point, they took over a remote federal building on Saturday. But so far, visible police have not appeared at the site. On Thursday, Arizona rancher LaVoy Finicum did not give any indication the protesters were planning to leave.Hellboy and Ehmer are from Oregon. Ehmer said he was shoeing horses in Heppner when his buddy told him to drive over and find out what was going on with the militants. He did, ""and they were really nice people, so I just decided to go get my horse and make a stand,"" he said. Unlike Jon Ritzheimer and Ryan Bundy, two key occupiers at the site on Thursday, the man on the horse did not appear to be openly carrying a gun.I pressed on.Ehmer said he is a cowboy, and he had nine horses when he left home. But he says his wife may have bought more since then. How long was he planning to stay? ""I will be here as long as I have something to feed my horse,"" he said."

Moore's move is an effort to circumvent the landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges in June 2015, which made marriage equality the law of the land.Brown argued that state governments shouldn't ""kowtow"" to the federal government in cases like Obergefell, which he said ""goes against all logic.""""Kowtow?"" Kelly cut in. ""The Supreme Court has the final say on what the law is. That was established long ago in Marbury v.

Kelly continued.""Well, I think you're misreading Marbury v. Madison,"" Brown responded.Kelly's reaction to the mansplaining says it all.Brown tried to make the point that states shouldn't have to obey the court's interpretation of the law because it has made ""horrible"" and unconstitutional decisions in the past.Kelly quickly shot down his argument.""There's a procedure for that. You go back to the legislature and you ask them to pass a law,"" she said.Brown went on to argue that ""there has to be resistance"" against unconstitutional Supreme Court decisions, or else ""you don't have democracy anymore.""""Interesting take on it,"" Kelly said diplomatically, and ended the segment.

27,POLITICS,Nancy Pelosi: Mothers And Children Picked Up In Deportation Raids Face Mortal Danger,Laura Barrón-López and Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nancy-pelosi-deportation-raids_us_568e9b77e4b0c8beacf5ffbc,She joined other Democrats in expressing concern about the raids.,2016-01-07,"""The Department of Homeland Security must ensure that no person is wrongfully deported to face certain persecution or mortal danger,"" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said on Thursday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/568e9e401600000001eba402.jpeg?cache=yYteFjzDB6&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) criticized President Barack Obama's recent deportation raids, telling reporters on Thursday that some of the women and children the administration wants to send back to Central America could face ""mortal danger"" there. Over the weekend, the Obama administration began to conduct raids to find mothers and children who entered the U.S. after May 1, 2014 and who had received deportation orders from a judge. The agency picked up 121 people, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said on Monday, all of whom fit within the administration's priorities for deportation. But advocates say that deporting the women and children is fundamentally unjust -- and potentially dangerous. Most of the families would be returning to El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. El Salvador surpassed Honduras last year and is on track to become the world's ""murder capital,"" with a 70 percent jump in homicides from the year before. “This is a very serious challenge,” Pelosi said on Thursday when asked if people rounded up in the raids should be deported. “In the processing of asylum claims of these women and children and others fleeing really horrific violence in Central America, the Department of Homeland Security must ensure that no person is wrongfully deported to face certain persecution or mortal danger -- and that's what's happening there.”While the department says these immigrants have used up all their other legal options, Pelosi argued that officials involved in the adjudication process must realize that not everyone has access to effective counsel.Families and children picked up during the raids, Pelosi said, should have full access to attorneys, clear explanations of what is happening to them in their native language, and understand their right to appeal. “We have to study every case separately. We want to obey our laws, but we also want to, in obeying our laws, make sure that the process is fair to people,” she said. Immigration advocates argue that many of the women and children have legitimate cases for asylum or other kinds of relief that would enable them to stay in the U.S., usually because they face the threat of domestic abuse or gang violence. Late Tuesday, an immigration court granted four families a stay of removal as they appeal the rulings. Attorneys say this demonstrates that many of the women and children being deported to Central America should get another chance to fight their removal.A spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement said the agency ""did not target individuals with pending appeals before the Board of Immigration Appeals, or individuals for whom the time period to file such an appeal had not expired."" ""While ICE will respect any lawfully issued stays of removal, we also reserve the right to pursue any legal avenues available to us to further litigate these matters,"" ICE spokeswoman Jennifer Elzea said in a statement on Wednesday. ""As noted by Secretary Johnson, we must enforce the law in accordance with our stated priorities, and secure our borders.""Pelosi and other lawmakers plan to speak with the administration about implementing U.S. law “fairly,” while also signaling that entering the country without authorization doesn’t automatically mean one can stay.Still, Pelosi characterized the situation many are fleeing in Central America as “horrific.” “Mortal danger is not an exaggeration of what some of these people will experience when they go home,” she said.A number of Democrats also criticized the raids, including Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chairwoman Linda Sánchez of California and Rep. Luis Gutiérrez of Illinois. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who is running for president, wrote to Johnson last week asking him to reconsider the plans, and on Wednesday called for the administration to offer temporary protective status to people from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. Hillary Clinton spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said last week that the former secretary of state and Democratic presidential candidate ""believes the United States should give refuge to people fleeing persecution, and should be especially attentive to the needs of children.""On Thursday, presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) sent a letter to the president and homeland security officials that suggested offering temporary protective status to the immigrants.""Raids are not the answer,"" Sanders wrote, according to The Washington Post. ""We cannot continue to employ inhumane tactics involving rounding up and deporting tens of thousands of immigrant families to address a crisis that requires compassion and humane solutions.""
