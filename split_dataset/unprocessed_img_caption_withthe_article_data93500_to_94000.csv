0,SPORTS,Why FIFA Won't Disclose How Much It Pays Its Executives,Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fifa-pay-disclosure-no_n_6938156.html,A lack of transparency at one of the world's most important sports institutions.,2015-03-25,"FIFA president Sepp Blatter holds a press conference at the FIFA headquarters in Zurich on March 20, 2015 at the end of a two-day meeting to decide the dates of the 2022 World Cup football tournament in Qatar. AFP PHOTO / MICHAEL BUHOLZER (Photo credit should read MICHAEL BUHOLZER/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb77a62260000300183506f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When FIFA, the famously opaque yet incredibly powerful international soccer governing body that puts on the World Cup, published its 156-page annual financial report on Friday, no mention was made of one basic facet of any organization: how much the employees make.There is no mention of how much money its president, Sepp Blatter, or his oft-adversary and vice president, Michel Platini, or any of the members of the powerful executive committee are paid. When The Huffington Post asked FIFA why it hadn't included information about employee pay in the report, the organization provided a statement saying it didn't see why anyone would need to know.“[W]e do not believe that, from a reporting perspective, the publication of individual salaries would provide any value in addition to what we already publish in the Financial Report,” a FIFA spokesman wrote in an email. In recent years, there have been many claims of corruption and bribery among FIFA leadership, largely related to where the World Cup takes place and how other contracts and endorsements are awarded. These charges have started to hurt the organization's relationships with sponsors -- three major backers ended their support for FIFA in January.The only information the FIFA report discloses about executive compensation is that in 2014 it paid what it calls “key management personnel” -- a group that includes Blatter, a 25-member executive committee he heads, a five-person finance committee and 13 top managers -- a total of $36.6 million. FIFA's report also explains the process by which the organization set employees' salaries. A three-person compensation subcommittee is solely responsible for determining pay. One of the subcommittee members is a FIFA Senior Vice President Issa Hayatou, who has repeatedly been accused of taking bribes.To establish a benchmark for FIFA salaries, the compensation subcommittee asked an outside human resources company to compare FIFA salaries to executive pay at other organizations. FIFA is a nonprofit association of national soccer organizations, yet it only looked at two sets of for-profit companies to help determine employee compensation. The first was the organization's sponsors and companies with similar global brand reach as FIFA, which is to say near-total worldwide recognition. The second group was companies with revenues similar to FIFA's -- $5.7 billion over the past four-year World Cup cycle.Daniel Borochoff, the president of nonprofit watchdog organization CharityWatch, told HuffPost that it’s not uncommon for nonprofits to benchmark pay to for-profit companies if they compete for talent. But that doesn’t seem to be the case here: FIFA executives are -- nominally, at least -- soccer administrators. There simply isn’t a line of global CEOs waiting to run for FIFA president, nor is Blatter being wooed by multinational corporations to join their management teams. If FIFA looked to other athletic nonprofits to help determine its employees' pay, it would encounter a wide of pay range among these groups' leaders: The head of the Swiss-based International Olympic Committee, for example, is an  unpaid volunteer. Meanwhile, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell took home $35 million last year. Borochoff also said he disapproved of the compensation committee having the sole and final say on pay. At the very least, he said, the executive committee should be able to review and have the final say on the president’s pay.FIFA said it followed the pay structure recommendations of Ethos, a Swiss corporate governance group. Ethos’ recommendations on how to pay people relate to variable pay -- for example, bonuses. It suggests some ways to award this type of compensation and recommends that the maximum bonus pay should be made public. FIFA paid variable compensation to some executives in 2013, but didn’t disclose how much it awarded. FIFA said it did not give out any variable compensation last year. By eliminating this type of pay, FIFA technically complied with Ethos' suggestion to limit and disclose variable pay. This is indicative of how FIFA complies with transparency suggestions: It seems the organization would rather stay within the rules by eliminating something that would require a little disclosure than disclose what it is doing. That’s how low, it seems, the bar has to be set for FIFA to achieve a semblance of transparency and good governance. "

Burke lost his life on 9/11 along with Firefighter Stephen Siller from Squad 1 in Park Slope, Brooklyn.Proceeds from the May 17 tower climb will support service members who've been catastrophically injured in war and help educate children who've lost a parent. The money also will help build 200 new homes for veterans with the worst disabilities, mostly triple or quadruple amputees. About 40 houses have been completed.On Sept. 11, 2001, Siller was off-duty when he ran with over 60 pounds of gear through the blocked-off Brooklyn Battery Tunnel to the World Trade Center. ""Our foundation couldn't be more honored to be chosen to hold the first stair-climb event at One World Trade Center,"" said his brother Frank Siller, foundation chairman and CEO.There's also a ""virtual stair climb"" — using elevators — for people who want to participate but are unable to handle the stairs.Participation is limited to the first 1,000 people who register by May 10. They'll all wear computerized chips that will record their finish time. The entry fee is $100, and there's a $250 minimum fundraising requirement.Sept. 11 first responders will lead the way into the building for the climb, which is to the 90th floor — 180 flights of stairs — of the 104-story building.Burke led firefighters on the day two terrorist-hijacked planes pierced the twin towers.His brother, Michael Burke, said Monday that even though Billy knew that the south tower had already fallen, he chose to remain behind to rescue two workers, one in a wheelchair.When the captain was urged to leave, he responded, ""'this is my job, this is who I am.' Then he went on and the tower collapsed,"" said Burke, who stopped talking several times, his voice breaking.""What he did that day should be inspiration for us to keep going,"" the foundation board member said.In May, as climbers reach the higher floors and their knees and backs ""are killing them,"" he said, ""just think of the words of Captain William Burke to his men: 'keep going, I'm right behind you.'""

Their advance has forced President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi to flee from Aden to an undisclosed location, The Associated Press reported Wednesday.The crisis in Yemen is one with many different groups and moving parts to it. The Houthis, who now control the capital of Sanaa and much of the nation's northern regions, are engaged in a bitter fight against some Sunni tribes in the country, and clashes have claimed hundreds of lives. On the other hand, the militants of the al Qaeda affiliate in the region, AQAP, have vowed to eradicate the Shiite fighters with attacks and suicide bombings. Now the Islamic State militants, too, are claiming a role in the violence, and last Friday carried out multiple suicide bombings at two of the capital's Shiite mosques, killing at least 137 people. The WorldPost presents a roundup of some of the best analysis and reporting on Yemen to help clarify the chaos.Who Are The Houthis?Gregory D. Johnsen, an author on Yemeni politics, provides an in-depth account for Buzzfeed of how what was once ""just a few men, disaffected students and farmers"" is now a group in control of large parts of the nation. Johnsen details the timeline of their rising influence, and the complicated power dynamics that led to the current violence. In a report on the state of Yemen since the Houthi takeover, Mona El-Naggar of The New York Times offers a look at what life is like in the capital:The Threat Of Sectarian ViolenceAccording to former Middle East correspondent Brian Whitaker, Friday's IS-linked bombings were a game-changer in Yemen's rapid descent into chaos. ""Friday’s mosque attacks, whoever was behind them, will intensify sectarian rivalries and invite bloody reprisals,"" Whitaker argues in an op-ed for The Guardian. ""The scene is set for a protracted civil war.""Whitaker believes that while the violent standoff between Hadi's government, the Houthis and the militants of al Qaeda had pushed Yemen to the brink of disintegration, the recent sectarian attacks have tipped the country over the edge. The longer the conflict lasts, Whitaker notes, the stronger the chances that countries like Iran and Saudi Arabia will double down on support for their proxies -- the Houthis and the Sunni tribes, respectively -- intensifying the conflict. Contrary to countries like Iraq and Syria, where sectarian violence has wreaked havoc in recent years, sectarian attacks like those perpetrated last week are an anomaly. That has changed with the rise of the Houthis, Ghaith Abdul-Ahad reports for The Guardian from Sanaa. He explains that the Houthis' power grab has invigorated the ""militarization and radicalization in the Sunni-majority Yemeni heartland, acting as a recruiter for jihadis.""  In this photo taken on Friday, March 20, 2015, militiamen loyal to President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi ride on an army vehicle on a street in Aden, Yemen. (AP Photo/Yassir Hassan)The Role Of The International CommunityFarea al-Muslimi, a visiting scholar at Carnegie Middle East, criticized the international community, and the United Nations in particular, for forcing Yemen's political actors to continue a process of reconciliation following the ouster of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh that has done more harm than good. ""The world has walked Yemenis into this process and should take responsibility for that. They have broken Yemen and it is time to pay for it,"" he wrote in a piercing op-ed published in The National.Al-Muslimi states:Violence and a declining quality of life have come to represent Yemen. The number of Yemenis now subsumed by the country’s continuing humanitarian crisis numbers 16 million. Basic functioning services have all become as rare as birthdays -- a once a year event.The Effect On American PolicyReporting for the New York Times, Eric Schmitt looks at the consequences of the United States' decision to pull back 125 U.S. Special Operations advisors in the wake of the increased violence. Hadi's government has been a crucial partner in America's global counterterrorism strategy and its fight against AQAP -- considered the most capable jihadi affiliate worldwide. ""The loss of Yemen as a base for American counterterrorism training, advising and intelligence-gathering carries major implications not just there, but throughout a region that officials say poses the most grievous threat to United States global interests and to the country itself,"" Schmitt writes. Schmitt's colleague at the Times, David D. Kirkpatrick, sums up the grim situation facing Yemen in a report on the Houthi clashes near Aden. As Kirkpatrick puts it: ""Yemen is sliding toward a civil war with ominous elements of a sectarian feud, a regional proxy conflict, the attempted return of an ousted authoritarian, and the expansion of anti-Western extremist groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State eager to capitalize on the chaos.""More from The WorldPost on the crisis in Yemen: "

Smith is just the latest in a long line to peddle the delusion that the GOP can change its ways and become an open-arms party for blacks.,2015-03-25,"NEW YORK, NY - FEBRUARY 13: Stephen A. Smith attend SiriusXM's 'Town Hall' With Clyde Drexler, Isiah Thomas, Dominique Wilkins And Stephen A. Smith at SiriusXM Studio on February 13, 2015 in New York City. (Photo by Robin Marchant/Getty Images for SiriusXM)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae08a5200000e800ff3048.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ESPN host Stephen A. Smith has gotten quite a reputation for being a controversial tell-it-like-he-sees-it guy. That's fine in sports punditry. He's an ex-jock, and in that world pretty much any inanity will fly. But when Smith pursed his lips and ventured outside sportsdom to quip that blacks should vote GOP at least one election go round he proved once again that sports and entertainment personalities that venture opinions about politics more often than not embarrass themselves. If we want to be more charitable, the best that can be said is that Smith is just the latest in a long line to peddle the delusion that the GOP can change its ways and become an open-arms party for blacks. Those who routinely peddle that are usually a handful of GOP would-be presidential contenders such as Rand Paul, an infinitesimal and politically inconsequential handful of GOP elected officials, and an always dependable core of conservative media and think tank contracted black conservatives. Before, during and after every national election, they kick into high gear and contend that getting more blacks to jump political ship will be a major seismic jolt to the Democrats and be a start toward breaking the lock that the Democrats have on the black vote. Smith, as with the rest that spout this fantasy, grab a headline or two, and get plenty of airtime on conservative talk radio and TV. Now that Smith has gotten that headline it's worth a moment to take a look at what gives their utterance some surface plausibility. The standard mantra is, as Smith said, that the Democrats shamelessly take the black vote for granted, election after election and that blacks get nothing in return for their supposed slavish loyalty to the Democrats. The black GOP cheerleaders trot out endless studies and reports that purport to show that black poverty, education and health care disparities, prison incarceration rates, homelessness, and joblessness have soared during Obama's tenure in the White House and in the major cities run by Democrats. Smith added a new wrinkle to this. He claimed that blacks need look no further than the immigration issue to see how both parties furiously court the burgeoning Hispanic vote and this insures that their interests, most importantly immigration, will be a focal point of both parties concern. Smith, and the other black GOP proponents, omit one, actually two small facts. The Democrats did not wreak the social and economic damage, race baiting, and neglect that characterized three decades of Republican rule in the White House and the sledgehammer attacks on or malign neglect of civil rights leaders and concerns when Republicans were out of the White House. There has not been one waking moment during Obama's six years in the White House that they have not turned vilification, obstructionism, hectoring, badgering, and barely disguised race baiting of him into a fine art. The party that Smith and others think blacks could have a temporary home in topped this with the invite of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address Congress. He then promptly turned around and nakedly race baited to win reelection in the recent Israeli elections. The GOP then showed a near treasonous disregard of Obama by attempting to make its own foreign policy with Iran.There's the endless foot in the mouth, racially insulting gaffes, racially loaded campaign ads by Republican officials and politicians and the refusal by mainstream GOP leaders to loudly condemn them and even defend them. This has continually ignited black fury the last three decades. The fight of House Republicans against the Affordable Care Act, affirmative action, the slash and burn of job and education programs, and the inflammatory attacks on Obama, time and again reaffirmed that the GOP is chock full of bigots. The flip side of this is that blacks vote Democratic not solely because of GOP reaction and bigotry but simple pragmatism. Most blacks still look to them to fight the tough battles for health care, greater funding for education and job programs, voting rights protections, affirmative action, and against Reagan, Bush Sr., and George W. Bush's draconian cuts in job, education, social service, funding and programs, and their retrograde nominees to the Supreme Court who have done everything possible to roll back the civil rights clock, and peck away at affirmative action, civil rights and civil liberties protections. The Democratic Party often has been roundly criticized and deserves that criticism for not fully mobilizing and engaging African-American voters in state and local elections and for downplaying their interests at times. But even at its worst the Democratic Party is light years ahead of the GOP in what it has done or will do for black voters.Smith claims that blacks are props for the Democratic Party. And that it's time to change that. It will take more than a sports jock's laughable shock peddling of the GOP to do that.Earl Ofari Hutchinson is an author and political analyst.

I still have to put ""working mother"" in quotation marks. Women are going back to work after maternity leave and think of themselves as abandoning their children -- and I don't think they are coming up with this idea on their own.I know this because I work with and coach women who are making the transition from maternity leave and back to work. And every time I ask my workshop attendees what they are most nervous about, the answer is almost always that they will feel guilty about spending such a little amount of time with their children during the work week.Erin M., a mother who just went back to work when her baby was six months old, actually told me: ""the idea that my son calls my name during the day and I can't be there when he needs me absolutely breaks my heart.""Whenever I hear stories like this, my head immediately goes to the vision of my husband and my children on a weekday night, laughing and playing games. He is a man who works the regular 40+ hours a week, especially when you calculate the amount of hours he spends commuting and entertaining clients at night. I think about the kind of father he is and how connected my children are to him. I think, there is no way they will ever grow up and say, 'that dude didn't spend enough time with us.'My husband is always doing bath time and reading books at night, helping with piano practice and making it to parent teacher conferences. And on the weekends, it's non-stop between piano lessons, gymnastics, multiple trips to the playground, family dinners and much much more. When we think of the fathers of our children, we don't instantly jump to the notion that they won't be spending enough time with their kids because they're working. So, when is this light going to refocus and shine on the working mother and when will we drop the quotation marks and all just be working parents? I ask this because when society decides to normalize the working mother, that's when women who are making this extremely difficult transition will start to let their shoulders drop just a little bit. Maybe they will only be waking up at 4 a.m. and dreading the day they return back to work once a week, instead of EVERY SINGLE NIGHT. Maybe they will feel empowered by their decision and feel confident that they are doing the right thing for their family, simply because it is THEIR family.Maybe when we decide to normalize something that now affects 67% of women in the workforce we can break the cycle of guilt that has plagued too many mothers in this country. One that forces them to make decisions, like leaving their career of eight years that totally fulfilled them, because they didn't want to ""abandon"" their baby.Yes, we can agree that there are some other major changes that need to happen besides the normalization of the working mother, but this sure would make the whole thing just a little bit easier. And we all know a new mother can use all the help she can get."

In the coming decades, this burgeoning demographic segment will serve as a keystone for economic and political development in the region, with significant implications for the rest of the world.The OECD estimates that the global middle class (defined as households with daily expenditures of $10-100 per person, in 2005 purchasing power parity terms) will swell to 4.9 billion people by 2030, from 1.8 billion in 2009. Two-thirds are expected to reside in Asia, up from 28 percent in 2009, with China home to the largest share. Indeed, if China pursues the structural reforms and technological upgrading needed to maintain rapid economic growth, its middle class should exceed one billion people in 2030, up from 157 million in 2009.The rapid emergence of Asia's middle class will bring far-reaching economic change, creating new market opportunities for domestic and international companies. Already, demand for consumer durables has increased in the region, with China becoming the world's largest market for automobiles and mobile phones. But there remains substantial room for more consumption in luxury goods and technological products, as the purchasing power of the developing world's middle class catches up to that in the advanced countries.This convergence will contribute to more sustainable economic growth, with Asia's economies rebalancing toward domestic demand, especially household consumption, and thereby becoming less vulnerable to external shocks. Given the decline in export demand since the global economic crisis, this shift could not be timelier. And the benefits will not be confined to Asia; as imports to the region increase, global trade imbalances will decline, improving the sustainability of economic growth worldwide.Indeed, Asia's growing middle class will transform a region known as a global manufacturing hub into a consumption powerhouse. As demand rises, more and better jobs will be created not only in Asia, but also globally, along supply chains and across production networks.With rising prosperity comes improved education and health care, which promise to help drive long-term economic growth by improving productivity. In China, this would represent a significant shift from prevailing conditions, in which the children of poor households, especially in rural areas, lag in terms of nutrition and school enrollment, despite significant progress in recent decades on lowering infant mortality and raising educational attainment.Equipped with high-quality education, Asia's rising middle class will demand higher-quality public services. Increased confidence in their country's political systems and institutional structures, enhanced by improved perceptions of upward mobility, will help to strengthen the rule of law. And there will be more opportunities for women to learn and work, leading to greater gender equality.Most important, the rise of the middle class is likely to be accompanied by growing demands for political freedom and civil liberties, thereby fostering democratization. Indeed, an examination of a large sample of countries, from the 19th to the 21st centuries, reveals that a larger population of affluent, educated citizens -- especially women -- brings about more political participation and greater support for democracy, particularly in less-developed countries.In the West, capitalism and democracy progressed in tandem, as the development of markets reduced the power of landlords and increased that of the working and middle classes. By participating actively in politics, basing their electoral choices on rational self-interest, and developing the sense of moderation needed to resist dictatorship, the middle class promotes democratic progress. At the same time, the growth of private organizations associated with the rise of the middle class prevents state institutions from monopolizing political resources.In Asia, South Korea experienced a similar progression, with rapid economic growth spurring the rise of a large middle class, which in turn drove democratization in the 1980s. That history may repeat in China before long.Given the benefits of having a large middle class, Asian countries should be nurturing theirs by improving health care, upgrading infrastructure, investing in universities and technical training, and addressing income and educational disparities. Moreover, social safety nets should be created or strengthened, in order to help safeguard the middle class from negative shocks and boost consumption growth (which continues to be hampered by precautionary saving).Finally, public policies -- aimed at strengthening the rule of law, promoting trade, and achieving sound macroeconomic management -- are essential to sustain growth, thereby ensuring the continuous upward mobility of lower-income families. That upward mobility is the key to keeping in motion a virtuous circle of middle-class expansion and economic growth.© Project Syndicate"

Of course social media is remarkably powerful and nothing short of spectacular when it comes together as it did for Odin. Yet the sad undertow of his story keeps drawing me back and prevents me from riding high on the crest of a Facebook wave. As a mom with a young child, much younger than Odin, I can relate. My son also has high functioning autism (formerly known as Asperger's) and in the circles I move in, I see Odins every day. Kids left on the sidelines, bullied and friendless. On forums, there are daily calls to wish Odins a happy birthday or send a friendly message of support. Most of these Odins you will never hear of. Most of them will never see their name in tweets, or receive so much as a text from a famous actor or sports star. But even that Odin will be forgotten once the initial rush dissipates. So I can only hope his 14th birthday will be very different from his 13th -- not punctuated by the greetings of total strangers, but rather graced by a couple of quiet, meaningful wishes. Ideally, I can only hope my son will join some club or group whose members shares his interests. There he will make one, maybe two, friends who will get to know him and like him for who he is, Asperger's and all. One or two true friends, as opposed to legions of well-meaning strangers.And as parents, maybe that should be the goal. Maybe for kids like Odin -- for kids like mine -- inviting the whole class or some dozen kids is only setting up our kids for disappointment and humiliation when no one shows up. I don't blame Odin's mom or any other parent who reaches out. After all, having an Odin is equal parts heart-wrenching and utterly amazing. All you want is for others to see everything about yours that is cool and likable. All you want is for the world to see your child through your lens. But sadly, the world isn't ready to wear your glasses. It's not ready to see him as you do... not yet, anyway. For now, for my son's next birthday, I'm going small. You won't hear about it or read about it anywhere."

Unfortunately, it's usually plagued by one negative thought: that it can't become a reality. But many people have turned their dreams into daily realities. How did they get there? What inspires them? Surely they took all the right steps at the exact right time, without suffering any detours. I spoke to a few very successful people working their own ""dream jobs"" hoping to glean some insight.   Did you know that the definition of the word ""photography"" is ""to draw with light?"" Interestingly, its origins are Greek just like the multitalented photographer, Calliope. Stepping into Calliope's, light-filled apartment overlooking a beautiful neoclassical boulevard in Athens is like stepping into a showroom boasting exotic merchandise from around the world -- everything looks like it has a story to tell. Not surprising, considering that Calliope herself is a true global citizen. She spent her childhood in Athens, borrowing her father's Pentax to take photos of her friends and sister. ""I'm instinctive, artistic. It happens automatically, like breathing. With the camera there was a natural evolution to my artistic needs of expression."" But she took a deviation on her way to becoming a renowned photographer.After graduating high school, Calliope moved to London to study fashion design. Her innate sense of personal style quickly caught the eye of Milanese influencers, Carla and Franca Sozzani, the sister duo of Italian Vogue and Vogue Bambini who offered her a job. ""My greatest school was working for Italian Condé Nast,"" Calliope says. ""Carla and Franca opened the doors for me. They were my mentors."" They encouraged her to develop her creativity, talents and constant ""bombardment"" of creative ideas. Working in the fashion editorial world was all an incredibly ""fun game"" to her. ""I started working with big photographers, traveling. Then, one day I said, 'I want to take my own pictures.' People laughed."" Persistence paid off and finally Carla entrusted her to take six children's outfits with her to London where she was working with photographer, Neil Kirk, on a shoot for Italian Vogue. At the end of the day, Calliope used his studio to shoot the clothes with a 7-year-old model. ""I didn't have any assistants. I used natural light, close to the window and made the girl look like an angel. There was feeling in the images. Carla couldn't believe that I took the pictures myself."" A few days later, Calliope's innate talents were put to a true test. Carla wasn't happy with the final photos for Vogue Bambini's big winter issue, so, she charged Calliope to redo them all -- 60 pages plus the cover. ""I found snow at a ski resort high in the mountains of Utah; I grabbed an assistant, the clothes, no stylist and no makeup. I did it all myself. I had the best time of my life!""The issue was such a success her phone started ringing, ""like crazy,"" prompting Calliope to move to New York City, the place she'd always wanted to be. ""I worked constantly, traveling as the staff photographer for Vogue Bambini; styling and photographing the shoots myself. I created a 'school of style' for photographing kids which began being copied."" Ralph Lauren and Guess campaigns were added to her expanding portfolio which also included editorials for women's magazines such as Mademoiselle and Glamour. ""I enjoyed my work very much; it was interesting from all points of view.""I can't help but ask, after finding such success in one of the most competitive industries in NYC, what made her return to Greece? ""Although I love my country and enjoyed visiting, returning wasn't my intention. But I found out I was pregnant while here and then was told that I had to stay in bed for 8 months. Then I had the twin girls and I just fell in love with them. I forgot about everything else. So, I kept postponing my return to NYC. I woke up one morning and a year had past.""But her creativity has far from slowed down along with her lifestyle's change of pace. Calliope's photography has since evolved; it still depicts fashion, but of a different kind. Her first book, Traditional Costumes, (2004) was an ode to the customary Greek dresses of her homeland. Her second, Children of the Light, (published by Skira, Jan 2015) is a testimony to, ""the Greek spirit; because Greece is light. I wanted to contribute to my country with this book, to give a message of optimism and to show its essence."" To note, proceeds from the sale of both books have gone to charities.But Calliope hasn't forgotten her ""other big love"": fashion. Queen Calliope is her line of clothing and accessories which she sells at her eponymous store in the upscale Kolonaki area of Athens and soon at Elounda on Crete. All pieces are designed by her and made by Greek artisans. I wasn't surprised when Calliope said that firstly, her designs are made with one customer in mind -- herself! Her globetrotting style is very evident in each tunic's embroidered stitching and the buttery soft fringes of her suede handbags. ""Drawing with light,"" is what Calliope continues to perfect through the years, but she does so through so many pursued expressions of creativity that to call her simply a ""photographer"" is misleading. ""What drives me every day is my need to seek out truth and beauty. All the good things of life; the manifestation of the human spirit,"" she says. ""We live in such a materialistic society, but the spirit matters more and this is what we have to uplift and hold onto."" After talking to this multitalented woman, I realize that sometimes the pursuit of a dream leads us down many different paths until the dream is finally realized; and yet, sometimes it's the culmination of all those paths that's what the dream is really made out of.Visit TALKS with Sara Lee Bentley for Calliope's Top Ten Fun Facts!"

The researchers reported fully restoring the memories of 75 percent of the mice that were treated with the therapy, with no damage to the surrounding brain tissue. The mice displayed improved performance in three memory tasks: completing a maze, recognizing new objects and remembering places they should avoid.""We’re extremely excited by this innovation of treating Alzheimer’s without using drug therapeutics,"" Jürgen Götz, one of the team members, said in a press release. ""The word ‘breakthrough’ is often misused, but in this case I think this really does fundamentally change our understanding of how to treat this disease, and I foresee a great future for this approach.""According to the release, Alzheimer’s disease is usually the result of a buildup of two types of lesions: amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Amyloid plaques sit between the neurons and turn into dense clusters of beta-amyloid molecules, a sticky type of protein that clumps together and forms plaque. In this trial, ultrasound technology was used to clear the buildup of defective beta-amyloid molecules, as well as tau proteins, from the brains of the test mice.The study was released in the journal Science Translational Medicine, which is published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science.The researchers caution that their finding is preliminary, since it has only been tested on mice. The release said that the next step will be trials with higher animal models, like sheep. They hope to get human trials underway in 2017.The Alzheimer's Association says there are more than 5 million Americans living with the disease. In 2013, 15.5 million caregivers provided an estimated 17.7 billion hours of unpaid care valued at more than $220 billion, according to the association. Given the aging of the U.S. population, the National Institutes of Health has called Alzheimer's disease ""a fast growing world-wide epidemic."" Last year, President Barack Obama signed a funding bill that contained an unprecedented $122 million increase for Alzheimer's research, education, outreach and caregiver support.According to other new research, the way in which animals wake up from hibernation could help scientists devise new treatments for dementia. Recent research from Leicester University isolated a cold-activated protein, RBM3, which helps restore the brain activity of animals that are coming out of long hibernation periods. This protein also exists in humans, but has been found to be missing among Alzheimer's patients.  Like Us On Facebook |   Follow Us On Twitter | "

Thanks to the weak yen, Japan is suddenly affordable. Visitors from Asia and elsewhere are coming in record numbers to experience that most iconic of Japanese events, cherry blossom season.Japan's favorite nationwide party runs from mid-March until May 10th. Tokyo should be in full bloom around April 1st, through the hanami (blossom viewing) parties get going several days in advance. Northern cities like Hirosaki in Aomori Prefecture see the best blooms during the last week of April. Sapporo, sometime in May. (Kyoto and Osaka are usually a week to 10 days earlier than Tokyo.) Crowds flock to popular viewing spots. Photo by S. Nakada.The Japanese edition of Korean Daily Joongang Ilbo has projected an increase of inbound Korean cherry blossom travelers by up to 70 percent for this period. Travel by inbound Chinese is growing exponentially as well. During February's Lunar New Year, over 1.3 million Chinese visited Japan according to the Japan National Tourism Agency (JNTO). That's more than double the arrivals for the same month last year. Newly relaxed visa rules have boosted visitors from Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia (no visa needed for a stay of up to 15 days). February statistics from the JNTO show an increase of 14 percent from the U.S. and 20 percent from the U.K., with higher rates anticipated for spring.This is good news for hotels. A survey of 556 Tokyo hotels from the Chinese-language Morning Post newspaper and published through the online Record China website showed only five not fully booked from April 1-28. Lines are already long at immigration counters in Narita and Haneda International Airports, and it's only going to get worse as the season peaks. Cherries drape gracefully along castle moats. Photo by S. Nakada.This is a tricky event to plan a trip around for both tour operators and individual travelers. Weather plays a critical part in both the date the flower front hits on its journey from south to north, and how long the fragile blossoms remain. Arrive a few days too early, and it's bare trees. A few days late, and they're sweeping up the petals.Record crowds are expected at Tokyo's prime cherry blossom viewing spots in Ueno Park, Shinjuku Gyoen park, along the Imperial Moat (Chidorigafuchi) and the Meguro River. Visitors hoping for solitary contemplation among the fluffy pink clouds of blossoms are in the wrong city -- especially this year. Timing your visit to see the trees in full bloom is tricky. Photo by S. Nakada.Low cost airfares by Japanese domestic carriers to regional airports (see my Huffington Post blog post on cherry blossom travel) and affordable Japan Rail passes just for foreign visitors are encouraging independent travelers to get out of Tokyo and chase the pink wave north or south.Not everyone is here just to admire the blossoms. Chinese tourists are aggressive shoppers and the biggest spenders among Japan's inbound visitors. A Consumption Trend Survey for October to December 2014 by the Japan Tourism Agency (JTA) showed the average Chinese visitor dropped around 157,000 yen per person ($1311) just on shopping. Actually the average is deceiving. According to statistics assembled by Yahoo News Japan, that spending increased to around 200,000 yen ($1666) in February. Japanese have even invented a term for this tourist spending phenomenon -- Bakugai -- exploding sales!  Don't let the appearance of those fragile blossoms fool you.

I've been delighted to have attended most years' celebrations and hosted a few events, seminars and book signings along the way.  The ""Heart of the Festival"" is the tented Culinary Village at Marion Square, where back-to-back demos, Low Country excursions, signature dinners, fish fry, book signings, storytelling, gospel brunch (above) and music jams are held throughout each day. Testament to the success and popularity of the festival is not just that it's grown steadily but that its various events sell out weeks in advance. What I like best about this festival, as opposed to those in cities like Aspen and Miami, is that the latter depend on glitz and the same tired TV food show celebrities, while Charleston celebrates new people each year, largely local but also working chefs of regional fame that they well deserve. Add to all this the beauty of Charleston itself, and three days go by very fast and beg for you to return. I certainly intend to, if only to keep up with what's new.  ARTISAN MEAT SHARE 33 Spring Street  843-641-7299 artisanmeatsharecharleston.com Very new indeed is Artisan Meat Share, a sandwich and charcuterie shop on Spring Street that grew out of Chef Craig Deihl's charcuterie program at the superb downtown restaurant Cypress. Deihl (above) is a founding member of the Butcher's Guild, and in any given season makes an array of 80 varieties of meat products that are among the finest I've tasted anywhere in this country.  I just left myself in Deihl's hands and out came rafter after rafter of exquisite meats and cheeses--liverwurst, provolone, mortadella, coppa, pepper rings, potato bread, bean salad, cheese grits and gravy, pastrami, bratwurst, crostini, chicken wings and more. His bun mi ($10) of pￃﾢtￃﾩ, smoked ham, kimchi mayo, carrots, soy pickles, cilantro on a steamed bun was a wonder in a Low Country spot like this, as was the porchetta ($11) with spicy 'nduja condiment, pork cracklins', watercress, caramelized onions and mayo on ciabatta bread. There are beer and wine and artisanal sodas, and on Wednesdays they offer three pieces of fried chicken for $10 and a wine and meat tasting on the first Thursday of every month. So much goodness in such profusion; this is a very generous eatery with a big heart.LEON'S FINE POULTRY & OYSTERS 698 King Street 843-531-6500 leonsoystershop.com I heard more than once that Leon's is the new hit in town. It's a very casual, ear-splitting eatery with a focus on oysters and a dogged emphasis on fried food in the Southern tradition. It's a first-come-first-served kind of place, so it's usually jammed with people who come to chow down rather than dine at a leisurely pace. You'll probably get food or beer on your clothes. I had a couple of good items: a charred radicchio salad with yogurt dressing, hazelnuts, golden raisins and mint ($10), and Leon's vanilla soft serve ice cream for dessert ($3). Most other dishes I found, first of all, extremely salty, and second, extremely fried. This ruined a made-to-order serving of fried chicken ($8-$10 for two pieces, half a chicken $16 and whole chicken dinner $39), whose spices were more intense than Popeye's, obliterating whatever flavor the chicken itself had; its grease-absorbed dark brown, burnt breading fell from the meat. Lettuce wraps had equally salty fried clams, along with mayo, slaw and butter pickles ($12). The fish sandwich ($13) may be ordered grilled or fried. A whole fish of the day--grilled beeline snapper with seaweed butter, artichokes and lemon ($32)--would have been better had it not been undercooked that day.  My friends who gobbled up a selection of oysters seemed perfectly happy with their choice, so I would say that, if you go to Leon's, stay clear of the fried food. And bring noise-canceling earphones. The loud, bombastic music is rough. The MacIntosh 479B King Street 843-789-4299 www.themacintoshcharleston.com ` I was very much looking forward to getting back to one of Charleston's finest restaurants, The MacIntosh, which opened two years ago on two levels on King Street, where Jeremiah Bacon has proven himself one of the city's most inventive chefs at a time when others are playing the farm-to-table game more for publicity than out of true religion. Upstairs at The MacIntosh there's a loud bar and lounge scene, but downstairs is a long, brick-walled dining room that casts the right balance of casualness with the seriousness of fine food. Bacon is a hearty cook with unexpected finesse, as evident in his oxtail ravioli with onion soubise and rich bordelaise sauce ($14). And his signature use of beef deckle ($40), a dish of great largess involving an underutilized cut of meat with marvelous results, served with enriching bone marrow bread pudding, carrots, baby onions, Brussels sprouts and a deep reduction of red wine (below) is a magnificent dish that takes a lot of talent to bring off so successfully. But then even a seemingly simple plate of peas and carrots with gnudi pasta, lamb neck, onions and mint ($16) is an education in the cooking timing of individual ingredients. His sweetbreads ($15) have real flavor on their own, coaxed to another level by the addition of green garlic, benne seeds, maitakes, a caramel made from fish sauce, and shiso. The tender texture and sweetness of pea rago￈ﾗt enhances a thick cut of succulent pork shoulder, with a fennel marinade and bacon sorghum glaze ($27).  Every bit as sumptuous are Kelly Kleisner's desserts, like double chocolate torte with raspberry sorbet and coca nib tuile ($8) and banana bread pudding with malted chocolate ice cream and butterscotch, toffee-cocoa crumble ($8). The MacIntosh has as fine a wine list as it has one of spirits, and it would be difficult not to have a good time here, both for its conviviality and for the surprise of how, dish by dish, everything is so amazingly good. HOMINY GRILL 207 Rutledge Street 843-947-0930 .hominygrill.com  Rare is the year I go to Charleston without eating at The Hominy Grill, which since 1966 has been a bellwether of Southern downhome cooking without the slightest pretense or hype--although the food media have long acknowledged just how outstanding chef-owner Robert Stehling is as a proud son of the South.  The white shotgun house dates to 1897, recently appended with another dining room, and it is always bright, with antique tin ceilings and slow-moving fans, wooden floors, captain's chairs, and windows that let in the Low Country sun. You could not wish for a more amiable, friendly staff. Stehling knows his clientele well, and I suspect as many are locals as visitors, all of whom will wait a while for a table in peak hours. I've never had better soft shell crabs with baked cheese grits; scrambled eggs, buttermilk pancakes and country ham for breakfast; and lovely, pale yellow buttermilk pie tinged with lemon and lavished with whipped cream. In contrast to the many versions of disappointing fried chicken found around Charleston, Hominy Grill's is nonpareil: lightly floured, very carefully fried to achieve an even, golden color, the meat inside very juicy; it is everything that Southerners exalt but so rarely make this well. And the breading never crumbles off the chicken here; it stays intact, so every bite has crunch. Long before the food media discovered that Charleston was a first-rate restaurant town, Hominy Grill was here, and it is as good as ever, if not better. If practice does indeed make perfect, then the cooks at Hominy Grill must practice very hard and with a lot of care in what they do."

I jumped from coach to coach, psychic to psychic, anyone that could give me the answers...This last year in particular I have been borderline obsessed with trying to find that thing that has been missing, that emptiness, that void, you know that thing that drives us? I have lived inside my head, sat in my room and written and written and written, and read and read and read. I didn't leave the house much, didn't really want to interact with people in person, except I did go overseas to look for it. I was on a mission to find it. And today, I found it.Since I have found it, I haven't stopped laughing. I've been laughing at me and the simplicity of it and how it was there all along!Let me just tell you a bit about me and what I know I want to do. I know I want to serve others, to help them realize their potential, to bring to life those big dreams that they are too scared to talk about openly, to see and feel what I see and feel for them, to believe in themselves. I know that's what I want to do for other people.Now lets get one thing straight too. I help people all of the time and I give them advice and tell them what steps they can take in order to make their dreams a reality. But do you think I could do this for myself? I was blind and deaf. I couldn't hear or see anything, until today. Last night I had a session with a coach, and when we first connected, I was asked what it was that I wanted to do for people, I then proceeded to explain. After I finished, she asked me this, what if you turned that around for you? I laughed and answered, yea that would be simple, but brushed it off.This morning I spoke to someone new, who gave me amazing words of advice and made me cry because of the way they so eloquently put things, but also because I tell people to do things that I don't do myself or forget about!And then I spoke to one of my dearest friends. We got talking and I could tell that her energy had positively shifted after getting some disappointing news. I told her again, what I saw in her and how much I believed in her and then I can't really recall what happened, but I got this overwhelming sense of sadness wash over me, and I heard the words, I need a me for me. And that's it. That is what I have been looking for all of these years! Me.For me to give myself what I give to others. How simple is that and how much do we overcomplicate it and look outwards for it?So if you are searching, looking for answers or that big thing. Stop and look at you. You have you on tap 24 hours a day seven days a week. I still highly recommend that you have others push and support and brainstorm and teach you, but love you, trust you and listen to you first. I mean, who else has your best interests at heart like you do? Can you see why I am laughing?So now that I have finally discovered that big fucking secret, I am going to go and hang out with me, be nice to me, take me out and have some fun with me. No more hiding me away from me and keeping me away from me. I'm going to love me like I love those around me and give me the support and encouragement that I give to those around me. Thank you for being a part of this discovery. xxI have a new business and website and would love to have you come visit and say G'day!"

In part one, we visited the Garden of Eden as seen in analogies with the movie Avatar. Like Adam and Eve's fall from grace, darkness covered the world in Star Wars. Instead of a fallen angel, Lucifer, we see a fallen man, Anakin Skywalker. Like Lucifer, once the angel of light, Anakin becomes consumed with pride and declares that he is greater than all. No longer the star of light, Lucifer is kicked out of heaven and associated with darkness and evil as Satan. Likewise, in Star Wars, we see a brilliant Jedi, Anakin Skywalker, consumed with arrogance, turning from the light of the force and joining the dark side as Darth Vader.  If Vader is not Satan per se, he is definitely the agent of darkness for the emperor. However, the force is not left without a savior. For religious symbolism, it is important that the savior takes on human qualities of man -- ""the word was made flesh and dwelt among us"" in the person Jesus. God becomes savior when he humbles himself as man -- Jesus, walks among his creation, living among them to redeem what once rejected him as creator and lord in the Garden of Eden via Adam and Eve.  In Star Wars, the savior comes from the offspring of Anakin, now Darth Vader. Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker are the means by which the force and the world are to be redeemed. Like Jesus, young Luke Skywalker spends much of his life in a normal working class environment, on the outskirts of the galaxy. Although Christ was always aware of who he was (God the son in flesh), Luke's true lineage is hidden from him by his aunt and uncle to protect him. Like Christ, an event happens that catapults him from obscurity to savior. For Christ, it is his first miracle turning water to wine. For young Skywalker, the death of his aunt and uncle start his journey to savior/Jedi.Just as Jesus was tempted by the devil in the wilderness, so too Luke is tempted by Vader to join the dark side revealing that he is Luke's father. That declaration incites anger in Luke making him realize his own potential for darkness. Good and evil dwells in all men. Circumstances and convictions are the only barriers that separate us from depravity.  Instead of Luke's crucifixion, in the end it is Vader that dies. But before his death, like the robber crucified next to Christ, Vader seeks redemption from his son and encourages him to overcome the emperor and the dark side.The MatrixFor a futuristic version of the dark side with martial arts that rivaled Bruce Lee's style, we turn to The Matrix. Follow the white rabbit may as well said follow the innocent lamb that takes away the sins of the world. The religious symbolism is rather blatant. In the Russian novel, The Master and Margarita, Mikhail Bulgakov coined the phrase that the greatest trick of the devil is making the world believe that he does not exist.  The greatest trick of the Architect in The Matrix is that the world does not know that he and agents exist. Just as the Bible issues an ultimatum -- ""chose this day whom you will serve,"" so does Morpheus to Neo. The Matrix exists, but you must chose to believe or not believe -- red pill or blue pill. One lets you continue to live in the Matrix without knowledge of its existence. The other pill takes you into the darkness of the beast. Ah, there's the rub. Enlightenment does not mean serenity. As Jesus told his followers, following him did not mean no suffering, happy ever after, wealth or prosperity. ""In this world, you will have troubles, but be of good cheer for I have overcome the world."" Likewise, Morpheus instructs Neo that taking the red pill only begins the journey, but be of good courage for Neo is the savior of Zion.Neo is reluctant to put on a savior cape, but curiosity induces him to stay in Wonderland to explore how deep the rabbit hole goes. There is the Oracle -- a sort of John the Baptist foreshadowing the savior, Neo. The agents represent the rulers of darkness assailing Zion.  As Judas betrayed Jesus, Neo is betrayed by Cypher. Instead of 30 pieces of silver, a succulent steak dinner suffices. As Cypher betrays Neo, Morpheus' ship, the Nebuchadnezzar, is under attack. The symbolism behind the ship's name is too much for this post. Neo is killed by Agent Smith and resurrected by Trinity (the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) who speaks life to his soul about who he is. This is the ultimate symbolism of the crucifixion and resurrection. There is a new day in Zion as Neo, like Christ, descends into hell (the Matrix) and defeats Agent Smith, setting the besieged Nebuchadnezzar and Zion free. Yet freedom does not mean a happy ending, ""in this world you will have troubles, but be of good cheer for I have overcome the world."" Just as Jesus was alive on earth after his resurrection, a resurrected Neo remains for the battle of Armageddon where he finally overcomes the Matrix and the Architect, establishing a new earth where all are unplugged and enlightened in a new Zion.In part three, we follow Frodo and Harry Potter's battle against evil.This originally appeared in Ronda's blog, Ronda-isms: Good Bad & Ugly."

Over 8 million children in working families with income too high to qualify for Medicaid but too low to buy affordable health coverage receive health care through it. In tandem with Medicaid, CHIP has cut the nation's uninsured rate for children in half since its creation. Reflecting that success, CHIP has strong bipartisan support from our nation's governors, over 1,500 organizations from across the country, and an array of dental organizations. In an American Viewpoint poll, voters expressed overwhelming support (74-14 percent) for extending the program. Simply put: CHIP works.And yet, CHIP has witnessed a few near death experiences over the years and its future is at risk, once again, due to the fact that funding for the program expires this September. Although both Democrats and Republicans in Congress have introduced bills and proposals about how best to proceed, we live in an era where money and politics take precedence and the question of doing what is ""in the best interest of children"" is far too often forgotten or ignored. That must end.CHIP's Development and ImprovementCHIP was established in 1997 during a different era in which Democrats and Republicans often worked together to find common ground. The final compromise was forged by a bipartisan group in the Senate Finance Committee and based on legislation by Senators Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Edward Kennedy (D-MA), John Chafee (R-RI), and Jay Rockefeller (D-WV). The legislation, signed into law by President Bill Clinton, provided states with a great deal of flexibility to choose to use their CHIP dollars to form a separate state program or to use Medicaid to expand coverage to children.Although both parties had to compromise over the structure, CHIP highlights how, when policymakers actually think about and act upon what is in the best interest of children, good things can happen. For example, in partnership with advocates, families, and providers, states established unique CHIP plans that are child-focused and address the special health and development needs of children. And over time, CHIP has been improved as states chose to reduce out-of-pocket costs, improve benefits, and strengthen pediatric provider networks for children. In addition, at the federal level, improvements have been made to CHIP on a bipartisan basis. For example, in 2004, President George W. Bush, recognizing the popularity of CHIP across the nation, spoke at the Republican National Convention and said he would initiate a major effort to expand outreach and enrollment to children. President Bush said:America's children must also have a healthy start in life. In a new term, we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up for the government's health insurance programs. We will not allow a lack of attention or information to stand between these children or the health care they need.After Bush's reelection, Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) and Senator Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) introduced bipartisan legislation based on the President's initiative. This provision, which provides funding to expand outreach and enrollment efforts to children, was included in CHIP when Congress passed and President Obama signed into law the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIRPA). Congress also included a number of other improvements to the program in CHIPRA. For example, Senators Bingaman, Richard Lugar (R-IN), Jon Corzine (D-NJ) Olympia Snowe (R-ME), and Blanche Lincoln (D-AR), recognizing that access to prenatal care for pregnant women leads to healthier babies, successfully passed a change that gives states the option to expand coverage pregnant women through CHIP.Lugar and Bingaman also passed their bill giving states the option to adopt Express Lane Enrollment (ELE) in order to simplify coverage under the program and eliminate bureaucracy and red tape that have been barriers to coverage for children.CHIP's Near Death ExperiencesUnfortunately, while CHIP has made important advances over its 18-year history, other battles that have swirled around CHIP have not been focused on the best interest of children. For example, in 2007, just months after enacting a major health care expansion of the Medicare prescription drug bill, President Bush tried to use CHIP's popularity and link his more partisan and sweeping change to the tax code for health insurance to CHIP's extension. Fortunately, on a bipartisan basis, Congress rejected Bush's effort to link CHIP to, what the Washington Post described as ""his proposal to replace the long-standing tax break for employer-based health insurance with a new tax deduction that would help people pay for insurance, regardless of whether they get it through their jobs or purchase it on their own.""Instead, Congress passed a bipartisan bill that, ironically, fulfilled President Bush's campaign pledge by providing money to expand coverage to millions of eligible but unenrolled children. Unfortunately, the President still vetoed the CHIP reauthorization bill. Senators Hatch (R-UT) and Charles Grassley (R-IA) rallied Congress to override the veto with Hatch arguing that the fight to reauthorize CHIP was ""the morally right thing to do."" President Bush did not relent and vetoed a second bill too.Just as states were sending out disenrollment notices to families, the Congressional Black Caucus initiated an effort in the House and Senator Max Baucus (D-MT) worked with Republicans in the Senate to save CHIP with a short-term extension until President Barack Obama was able to sign CHIPRA into law in February 2009.The second near death experience happened just months later when Congress began work on comprehensive health reform. In their desire to make sure the newly created Marketplace exchanges in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) would be affordable, the House of Representatives chose to phase-out CHIP and move millions of those low-cost children into the new exchange plans at the end of 2013. Child advocates asked Congress to be certain that ""no child would be left worse off"" in such a transfer and urged Congress to exhibit extreme caution before moving millions of CHIP-covered children into a new and untested system. Once CHIP was gone, there would be nothing to turn back to if the new system had shortcomings.Despite the request, proponents trying to sell the House bill ignored what was in the best interest of children. Some acknowledged that kids would be worse off by the repeal of CHIP but argued for the ""greater good"" that health reform would bring. Others went so far as to argue that ""millions of children"" would be better off if CHIP were repealed and kids were moved into the exchange plans, even though child advocates had demonstrated the opposite was true. Consequently, despite having voted to reauthorize and improve CHIP just months earlier, the House voted to phase out CHIP in its version of health reform.Child advocates did not give up and insisted that health reform should not do harm to children. Using an independent actuarial study that compared CHIP coverage to the exchanges and found children would actually be left worse of if CHIP were ended, Senators Rockefeller (D-WV) successfully offered an amendment that saved CHIP from repeal and, instead, extended the program through 2015. Rockefeller's language was ultimately passed and signed into law by President Obama.Just as proponents had threatened CHIP's existence, the opponents of health reform decided to also put CHIP at risk just months later when House leaders scheduled a series of over 50 votes to ""repeal Obamacare."" Failing to recognize that repeal of the ACA also meant the repeal of a two-year extension of funding for CHIP that was part of the ACA, the House repeatedly, even if unintentionally, voted to defund the program. Fortunately, the Senate repeatedly killed such efforts.The Current Threat to CHIPWith funding for CHIP scheduled to expire at the end of September, what is in the best interest of children now? First and foremost, we need action by Congress to extend CHIP because millions of children would be left worse off if the program expired. Due to the ""family glitch,"" it is estimated that over 1 million children would be left without coverage if CHIP expired because children would be ineligible to transition to exchange coverage in the ACA.And even with those that could transfer to the exchange, an independent study by Wakely Consulting Group found that exchange plans have fewer benefits and cost sharing that, on average, is over 900 percent more expensive than CHIP.To protect millions of children from being harmed and left worse off, over 1,500 organizations, our nation's Republican and Democratic governors, and Senate Democrats have unanimous called for extending funding for CHIP for four years. Others have proposed extending CHIP for just two years. While that is obviously better than no extension, putting CHIP at risk in 2017 and then having to go through the reauthorization process again in 2019 is troubling considering the near death experiences that CHIP has gone through in the past. We already know that, yet again, some are eying the possibility of using CHIP as a weapon to further other political agendas in 2017. For instance, writing in favor of a House draft proposal to fix a Medicare physician payment formula known as the sustainable growth rate (SGR) and to extend CHIP funding for just two years, Grace-Marie Turner with the Galen Institute writes:...the deal would extend the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for two years. It is due to expire September 30, and the extension buys time for a new president to tackle health reform and begin to streamline the government's wastefully-siloed health spending programs, including Medicaid, CHIP, and ObamaCare.Under her scenario, CHIP would be a pawn in a larger political game in 2017 to wreck Medicaid, the ACA, and maybe even CHIP itself. We also know that extending both CHIP and funding for community health centers in 2017 would cost billions of dollars, and that Congress would undoubtedly require budget cuts to offset those costs. So what would Congress cut? Medicare? Medicaid? Obamacare? CHIP? None of those offsets are appealing and any proposed cuts in those areas would likely be met with strong opposition that could delay or even kill CHIP.Certainly, Congress should move forward with legislation, as soon as possible, to fix a number of other important things in the proposed House legislation, including the extension of funding for the home visiting (the Maternal Infant and Early Childhood Home Visiting program or MIECHV) and community health centers. However, rather than put CHIP at risk with a two-year extension, we are strongly supportive of efforts in the Senate to pass a four-year extension of CHIP funding. As Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) said on the Senate floor on March 16th: We know that CHIP works. It works for parents, and it works for children. We know that if we don't act now, States will start rolling back their CHIP programs. Legislatures are adjourning almost as we speak. We need to provide States with certainty so they can budget for CHIP now and 4 years into the future."

I kinda cried.But then I remembered cowgirls don't cry...Wait a minute....OK, so maybe Reba sang that... but you get the point. After licking my wounds and moving on with my life (be it ever so difficult), something weird happened.I came into the computer room the other night and saw a Garth Brooks article on my computer.""What the?""It was from The Irish Times (or something like that) and it was about his concert over there in Ireland.I had no idea why it was there and who did it, so I interrogated the children.My oldest daughter then confessed it was she who Googled it.She was trying to buy me Garth Brooks tickets, but didn't know how.Oh. My.
