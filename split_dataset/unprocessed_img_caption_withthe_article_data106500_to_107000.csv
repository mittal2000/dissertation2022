Monte dei Paschi had the largest capital hole to fill at 2.1 billion euros, even after its money raising efforts this year.The exercise provides the clearest picture yet of the health of the euro zone's banks more than seven years after the eruption of a financial crisis that almost bankrupted a handful of countries and threatened to fracture the currency bloc.Although investors may take heart, it remains to be seen whether the exercise can spur banks to lend more as the region's economic growth stutters to a virtual halt.While 25 of the euro zone's 130 biggest banks failed the health check at the end of last year with a total capital shortfall of 25 billion euros, a dozen have already raised 15 billion euros this year to make repairs.Alongside Italy, regulators said three Greek banks, three Cypriots, two from both Belgium and Slovenia, and one each from France, Germany, Austria, Ireland and Portugal had also missed the grade as of end-2013.A recent survey by Goldman Sachs of large institutional investors found they believed the ECB ought to ask lenders to raise an additional 51 billion euros of capital for the tests to be credible.Once overvalued loans across the sector were taken into account, the ECB said the overall impact on banks was 62 billion euros.Analysts gave the results a cautious welcome, although some cautioned that it was only the beginning rather than the end of a banking clean-up in Europe.""Although this should restore some confidence and stability to the market, we are still far from a solution to the banking crisis and the challenges facing the banking sector,"" said Colin Brereton of PwC.The exercise, which saw officials trawl through more than 40 million individual bank figures, has two parts - a strict review by the ECB of assets such as loans, followed by a wider test of how banks would cope with a new economic crash.It is the fourth attempt by Europe to clean the stables of its financial sector and has been billed as much the most rigorous.Previous efforts failed to spot problems, giving lenders in Ireland a clean bill of health shortly before a banking crash drove the country to the brink of financial collapse.""It is credible,"" said Nicolas Veron of Brussels think tank Bruegel. ""But it is only the start of a longer sequence of cleanup that will extend well into 2015.""The ECB's passmark was for banks to have high-quality capital of at least 8 percent of their risk-weighted assets, a measure of the riskiness of a banks' loans and other assets, if the economy grows as expected over the next three years, and capital of at least 5.5 percent if it slides into recession.Banks with a capital shortfall will have to say within two weeks how they intend to close the gap. They will then be given up to nine months to do so. A CORNER TURNED?The ECB has staked its reputation on delivering an independent assessment of euro zone banks in an attempt to draw a line under years of financial and economic strife in the bloc.ECB Vice President Vitor Constancio said the exercise would ensure that ""economic recovery will not be hampered by credit supply restrictions.""But there is no certainty bank lending will pick up as the ECB hopes.""Thinking that lending somehow can lead GDP is an illusion, and I don't know how that has somehow crept into the policy debate,"" said Erik Nielsen, global chief economist at Unicredit.For many banks, the biggest impact of the ECB tests was not in identifying capital holes but in finding that their assets, such as loans, had been overvalued.In total, the ECB said banks had been valuing their loans and assets at 48 billion euros more than they are really worth.That accounted for 11 billion of the 25 billion euros banks were collectively short of at the end of last year. It also eroded 37 billion euros of capital amongst the banks that passed bringing the total impact on the sector to 62 billion euros.Among the major listed banks, the biggest hits were to Greece's Piraeus bank, whose core capital fell by 3.7 percentage points after the ECB adjusted the bank's capital to reflect the new asset valuations.Monte dei Paschi's capital was reduced by almost a third, a figure that counts for almost 3 billion euros. There was also a big impact on Austria's Erste Bank.The adjustments put many banks in an uncomfortable position. Thirty-one had core capital of below the 10 percent mark viewed by investors as a safety threshold, while a further 28 were on the borderline with ratios just 1 percentage point above.The ECB will not immediately force lenders with overvalued assets to take remedial action but they will have to hold more capital eventually, leaving less room to expand, lend or pay dividends.For lending, the more fundamental question is whether the demand for credit is there. The ECB is about to take on its new regulatory responsibilities but it may be its monetary policy powers that the euro zone needs most.""Businesses need to believe in an increase in the demand for their products before asking for credits, and now that external demand growth is no longer there, this is when the euro zone needs demand stimulus,"" Nielsen said.

It was me, my wife, and one of my good friends from college, who was in town to visit, and we were getting together at my place for a weekend of debauchery, which sounds much cooler than it really was. In reality, all we did was network our computers together to play first-person shooter games, drink cheap beer (since it was all we could afford at the time) and bond over the experience.As the wind chill cut through the haze of smoke, I listened to my friend rattle off another story about what was happening back in the old college town, when suddenly, he stopped, mid-sentence, and said, ""You know, Josh, I hate it when you do that.""My mind was shaken off track, as I was taken aback by the sudden critique. ""Hate what, exactly? What did I do?""""You do it all the time,"" he continued, ""I can tell that you've checked out of the conversation and now, you're thinking of the next thing you want to say.""I was shocked and bewildered. ""No I wasn't,"" I persisted! ""Yes, actually, you were,"" he snapped back. ""You get this glazed-over look in your eyes. Happens all the time, man.""Still confused, I turned to my wife for support, only to be met with her nodding head and a quick, ""Yep. He's right. You do it all the time.""Thinking of a quick comeback, I fired off the only thing I could muster, ""If I do it all the time, why is this the first I'm hearing of it?""My friend was the first to speak up, ""Because whenever anyone criticizes you, you get all defensive. You're kind of an a**hole, man.""Ouch. That remark cut deep. Turning again to my wife, her head still nodded in agreement, as she remarked, ""True story. You really are a jerk when criticized.""For the remainder of the evening, their concerted attack on my identity was all I could think of. Had I really been like this all my life? If they knew, but didn't want to tell me, how many other relationships had failed because of this? I decided that the next morning, I was going to find some answers, so I called the friend who had known me the longest, only to be met with the exact same reply.This newfound truth rocked me to my core, and not in that hyperbolic hipster sort of exaggeration that is so prevalent in today's social media. I was facing a side of me I never knew I had. From that point forward, I started paying more attention to the sound and tone of my words, particularly when being criticized, whether large or small, and sure enough, criticism was my trigger to turn from Dr. Jekyll into Mr. Hyde. And boy, was it ugly.What I had experienced in this tale was opening myself up to what is called the blind spot. In communication studies, we frequently reference the Johari Window, a concept that suggests we have four areas of our identity: a public self that is known to ourselves and others, a private self known only to us, an unknown self that is neither open to the public nor us and a ""blind spot,"" which is that which others know about us that we are not yet aware of ourselves.A blind spot can be dangerous. A blind spot, as in my case, could be the potential cause for many a failed relationship. For the better part of my young adult life, I could not, for the life of me, figure out why I was driving people away after a certain and consistent amount of time in a relationship, but once I learned about my ego defensive tendencies, it all became clear. A blind spot is also dangerous because of its power over our subconscious behaviors, to the point where, as the blind spot is discovered, it could present a serious threat to one's identity. If we are not flexible and resilient enough to face the impending change presented by learning of the blind spot, we may very well build up walls to keep others away.Within the context of many of my communication courses, I have the following activity as an assignment in confronting potential blind spots:Contact a close friend, family member, or mentor, but I suggest someone who knows you well, and invite this person to share a meal with you. During the meal, ask this person to share with you the one thing that annoys her or him most about you. Before the response, tell the person that nothing is off-limits and that you are not allowed to respond defensively -- only to listen with an open heart and mind.As you can imagine, this is a gut-wrenching, potentially life-altering exercise in self-awareness. First of all, the other person is someone important in their lives, so the opinion matters a great deal, presenting a threat to the asker in the exercise, because, what if the other person reveals something Earth-shattering? How might we see ourselves differently after that moment, knowing that something potentially serious bugs one of these people who matter most to us? Second, not being allowed to defend oneself during the exercise opens the other person up to being more honest and forthright, but it also causes the asker to listen more deeply. Rather than listening and gathering information to use in a strategic defense of the ego, the asker must sit and dwell on the information, looking at it in terms of the other person, which is the core of empathic listening.In the near-decade that I have been employing this exercise, I have heard a wide array of responses reported from people taking part in it, but never once have I heard someone come back from the activity with anything but a profound learning experience. Allowing others to shine a light on our blind spots, particularly with respect to our faults, teaches us how to become better conversationalists, better listeners, and ultimately, better people in general. What we learn about our blind spots may not always be pleasant, but it can open up a whole new world we never even knew existed.A few months ago, I assigned this exercise to a class, and as always, I would never ask them to do something I wouldn't be willing to do myself, so I partook in the exercise as well. This time, I asked my two youngest children the question, on the drive home from school. They hesitated at first, but then they spoke, openly and comfortably with me:From my 7-year-old son: ""It makes me sad when you yell at me, Dad. It makes me feel like you don't love me anymore, and it makes me want to go hide in my room.""From my 10-year-old daughter: ""I don't like it when you get mad at me, either. It hurts me and makes me cry. I don't want to make you mad.""At that point, I couldn't concentrate on the road, so I pulled the truck over, and on the side of road, unbuckled my seat belt so that I could hug them both, embracing them tightly. Swept up by a moment of pure clarity and raw openness, we starting crying, which then erupted into sobbing together for what felt like an eternity.Slowly, as we calmed down, I pulled away so that I could see their faces. Wiping my eyes and theirs, I replied, ""I'm sorry. I didn't realize I had been yelling so much lately, and even though I get frustrated with you two at times, I don't want you thinking I'm mad at you. I promise that I will do better.""I could have told them that my yelling had a purpose. I could have brought up all the fights they had, all the times they forgot their chores, all the things they've broken, and any of the other plethora of mistakes they've made. But I didn't. Instead, I gave them their moment to vent. Instead, I gave them the gift of listening without judgment.I did this in an effort to teach my children humility through example, to show them that it is possible to hear others' critique, absorb it, and then actually do something to change that which necessitates change out of a spirit moved by love.But mainly, I did it because, as with the first time I confronted the demon in my blind spot, it wasn't so much that I cared about what others thought of me, but how I saw myself reflected back.Read more from Josh Misner, Ph.D. on the Facebook page, Mindful Dad"

Government forces were preparing for a major overnight operation against them.In the latest fighting, 67 members of the Iraqi security forces and Shi'ite militias as well as 300 Islamic State fighters were killed, the officials said.It was not possible to get independent verification of the casualty tolls in the town 60 km (40 miles) south of Baghdad.Speaking to state television in the town, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said Iraqis forced out by fighting would soon return to their homes.Islamic State swept through northern Iraq in the summer, facing little resistance from U.S.-trained government troops.The al Qaeda offshoot then declared a caliphate and threatened to reach Baghdad, rattling the Shi'ite-led government and intensifying sectarian bloodshed.On Saturday, a suicide bomber killed seven Shi'ite militiamen in a town just north of Baghdad, police and medical sources said.Islamic State controls large parts of the Sunni heartland in Iraq's western Anbar province, as well as swathes of Syria and wants to redraw the map of the Middle East.STRATEGIC ISLAMIC STATE NETWORK AT STAKESunni insurgents have been moving fighters, weapons and supplies from western Iraq through secret desert tunnels to Jurf al-Sakhar, Iraqi officials have said. Now it appears government forces may be able to disrupt that network.While Iraq's army and Shi'ite militias have resisted Islamic State efforts to move closer to Baghdad, Kurdish forces have also gained ground, recapturing territory in the north.The Kurds retook the town of Zumar and several nearby villages from early on Saturday after heavy coalition air strikes against the insurgents, security sources said.If the Kurds manage to hold Zumar, that could enable them to disrupt Islamic State supply lines to nearby towns and cities.A Kurdish intelligence officer in Zumar said Kurdish peshmerga forces had advanced from five directions in the early morning and encountered fierce resistance. A spokesman for the peshmerga also said Zumar was now in Kurdish hands.Zumar was one of the first Kurdish-controlled towns to be overrun in August by Islamic State who went on to threaten the autonomous region's capital, Arbil, prompting air strikes by the United States - a campaign since joined by Britain and France.If the Kurds are able to keep Zumar, it would also make it easier for them to advance on Sinjar, where Islamic State are besieging members of Iraq's Yazidi minority on a mountain.Helped by the air strikes, Kurds have regained ground but progress has been hampered by a lack of heavy weaponry and by homemade bombs and booby-traps laid by the militants.Gains have been easily lost in the war against Islamic State.The Kurds claimed victory in Zumar in September, only to withdraw from the town again after suffering heavy losses.One peshmerga fighter deployed in the area on Saturday said a sniper was still at large in a village adjacent to Zumar, and a car bomb had exploded when they approached a vehicle, killing seven peshmerga.In another village, Ayn al-Helwa, the peshmerga said 17 militants had been taken captive, all of them Sunni Turkmen.While U.S. air strikes have had some impact on the insurgents, it is not clear whether they will be enough to secure a defeat in the long term in the major oil producer and in Syria.The United States and its allies conducted 22 air strikes against Islamic State forces in Iraq on Friday and Saturday, the U.S. Central Command said.U.S. warplanes also destroyed an Islamic State artillery piece near Kobani in Syria, officials said Saturday. The town near Turkey's border appears in less danger of falling, but the threat remains, U.S. officials said on Thursday.The 22 strikes in Iraq included attacks on frequently targeted areas near the vital Mosul dam, the city of Fallujah and the northern city of Baiji, home of an oil refinery.

Kaplan noted that Mississippi has the highest percentage of gay couples with children, and that was one of the reasons why she thought it was an important case to take.”They said, 'We need rights. We need to have our families protected the way other families are,'” she told me in an interview on SiriusXM Progress. “I agreed with them.

[That’s] because the entire case just quotes case after post-Windsor case, just making the argument over and over and over again for why we’re right. Normally in a brief you have to analogize to other situations as to why you’re right. Here, we didn’t have to analogize. We have 40-plus decisions already deciding exactly the same thing.”Kaplan also weighed in on the U.S. Supreme Court’s momentous decision nearly three weeks ago -- what she called its ""non-decision decision"" -- to let several circuit court decisions stand, bringing marriage equality to many more states but obviously not stepping in to rule on marriage equality for all 50 states, as some had hoped and expected. She referred to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s statements of a few weeks before, in which Ginsburg said the court would likely wait until a circuit court ruled against gay marriage before it stepped in. Ginsburg's remarks seemed to reflect the take-it-slow approach she has telegraphed on the issue in the past.""Along with [the late Justice] Thurgood Marshall, Justice Ginsburg was one of the greatest strategic litigators of our country’s history,” Kaplan said.“When [Justice Ginsburg] says, ‘You know, you guys should take your victories, and let it happen,’ you know, call me crazy. But I listen very carefully to Justice Ginsburg, and I tend to take her advice.” "

""I declined because I wanted to speak to our PGA Board of Directors, offer a personal apology and let the due process take place in this matter.

They were doing a story on the November election and wanted to know why she, an 89-year-old Catholic woman, was voting for Democrats. In her responses to the GMA reporter, Mom related how her life experiences had shaped her politics. Her words are as relevant today, as they were 18 years ago. In the matter of fact way that was her style, my mother began by telling how when her Lebanese immigrant family arrived in Northeast Pennsylvania at the turn of the 20th century, it was the Democratic Party in their town that helped them find their way. They lived in the heart of coal country and most of their neighbors were immigrants from Ireland or Eastern or Central Europe who worked long tough hours in the mines. Again, it was the Democrats who fought for their rights and protected their interests. When the Great Depression hit hard, it was Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal that put people back to work and created a safety net for those most impacted by the crisis. And moving forward, it was Democrats who defended civil rights, Social Security, Medicare, and programs that addressed the needs of the poor, the disabled, and at risk children. In short, Mom grew up not only believing that government had a responsibility to lend a helping hand to those who needed it; she had seen, first-hand, government fulfilling those responsibilities and serving the greater good. When I was in my teens, I read Ayn Rand and became enamored of Barry Goldwater's Conscience of a Conservative. Mom would have none of it. One day as I was spouting off about individualism and the evils of government, my mother pointed a disapproving finger in my face and told me ""if it weren't for Social Security survivor benefits [which I had been receiving since my father's death when I was 15], you'd be out working right now instead of being in school""; and if it weren't for the New York State scholarship you'd won, we wouldn't have been able to afford to send you to college"". She concluded with ""don't deny to others what you take for yourself"".   The phase through which I had been going was typical stuff for teens -- a kind of infantile narcissism where you think only of yourself. Mom's injunction was, in short, to grow up, get over my self-absorption, and see the bigger picture of benefits we receive from and the responsibilities we have toward others. My rebellion was short-lived. My family, like so many other immigrants before us, and so many others who have come since then, arrived in the New World with nothing but hopes and dreams and a commitment to work hard to produce a better life for their families. Sure, my dad and mom worked hard. And yes, we succeeded -- in many ways beyond their wildest dreams. But my mother's point was that the success we realized wasn't ours alone. It was also due to a social contract that had provided some degree of security and support when we and our neighbors and friends needed it most. Whether it was the public school system, the Works Progress Administration, Social Security, the efforts of unions that won battles for a minimum wage and a 40-hour work week, and the vast social movements that fought for civil rights and women's rights -- we owe our success to working together and for each other. At the end of her interview, the Good Morning America reporter attempted to throw Mom a zinger. She asked, ""But you're a Catholic who goes to mass everyday -- how can you vote for Bill Clinton, when he supports abortion?"" Unfazed, my mother said, ""On issues like that I go to my priest. But when I vote for President, I want someone who will fight to save Social Security and Medicare, and who'll be there to help those in need"". That was mom's lesson then, and the values she conveyed still apply today. Because I was born into a Lebanese immigrant home -- grounded by my church, my ethnic heritage, and my family -- I look at every election through the lens of those values. That's why I vote for Democrats.Follow @AAIUSA for more."

Time and again, Democrats and Republicans say, ""I'm going to fight for you."" That's the big problem we have on all levels of government -- there's just too much fighting. I'm looking for the candidate who says, ""I'm going to work for you."" We need politicians who spend time ""working"" -- not ""fighting"" -- with their fellow legislators on the other side of the aisle.We hear political pundits -- both the Democrats and Republicans -- saying it is a mistake to compromise: ""We must stand up and fight for what we believe in."" It is important to hold firm on principles that are the very core of who you are, but in most instances, it is possible to reach consensus. However, it takes ""give"" and ""take"" -- and that takes work -- it doesn't just happen.There are multiple examples, starting with our founding fathers, of people in government that held very firm views on various issues -- for example, forms of government, proposed legislation, foreign relations, and subjects of national security--who made compromises to reach consensus. The United States Constitution, a truly remarkable document, came about as a series of compromises. But rather than reflecting on bygone days, there are three examples that readers of various ages, political preferences, and ethnic heritage can relate to.Let's start with Lyndon B. Johnson and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Johnson, the President, was a Democrat. The Senate and House had substantial Democratic majorities -- 65 Democrats to 35 Republicans in the Senate and 258 to 177 in the House. Even with those majorities, Johnson could not get his civil rights legislation through the Congress. After working with the Democratic Speaker of the House and the Republican Minority Leader, Johnson was able to get a slightly different version than what he really wanted passed in the House. But the Senate was a different matter.After much politicking, and ""horse trading"" from Johnson, Senators supporting the House bill were able to outmaneuver some fellow Democrats, who were from the South and staunchly opposed to integration, and get the bill out of committees and to the full Senate for debate. Immediately, however, a block of nineteen Southern Democrats and one Republican launched a filibuster to halt discussion. After fifty-four days of filibuster, the Democrat Leader and the Democrat Majority Whip of the Senate, and the Republican Minority Leader and Republican Minority Whip, joined in introducing a comprise or substitute for the bill the House had passed earlier.At that time, it took 67 votes to end a filibuster in the Senate. Based on the substitute motion, the Senate voted by 71 to 29, four more votes than needed, to end the filibuster, and both the Senate and House passed the new bill. By Democrats and Republicans ""working"" with each other, instead of ""fighting"" for their own positions, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 became law on July 2.Let's move on to 1981. Ronald Reagan, a Republican, was President, and the Senate and the House were controlled by Democratic majorities -- 53 Democrats to 46 Republicans and 1 Independent in the Senate and 244 to 191 in the House. In a time of recession, highlighted with high inflation and unemployment, Reagan set out immediately after his inauguration to fulfill a campaign promise: to get the economy moving again by a program primarily of tax cuts for individuals and cuts in government spending, providing Americans with more money to spend.The idea was viewed with misgivings by many Republicans, and most Democrats adamantly opposed the idea. But Reagan aggressively lobbied members of Congress, resulting in the House leadership drafting a bill that was easily passed by a bipartisan vote of 238 to 195. The details of the bill, however, were not acceptable to Reagan. He then worked with the Democratic Senatorial leadership in drafting a substitute bill that was acceptable. The Senate passed that bill by a bipartisan vote of 53 to 47. The substitute motion then went back to the House, where it passed by another bipartisan vote, 323 to 107, with 8 not voting. Democrats and Republicans, ""working"" with each other rather than ""fighting,"" -- being willing to compromise -- resulted in passage of the Economic Recovery Act of 1981, which lowered personal income tax by approximately 23 percent for most Americans: less than Reagan wanted and more than the Democrats wanted, but helpful for American families.Finally, let's look at welfare reform legislation in 1996. Bill Clinton, a Democrat, was President, and this time the Senate and the House were controlled by Republicans. In 1992, Clinton had campaigned for President on the promise to ""end welfare as we have come to know it."" Newt Gingrich, the Speaker of the House, was the author of the ""Contract with America,"" which also featured welfare reform. Clinton, four years into his term as President and running for re-election, seemed more interested in universal health care than welfare reform. Gingrich accused Clinton of stalling on welfare reform until after the election, and the Republican House passed two welfare reform bills; Clinton vetoed both.Clinton and Gingrich then negotiated secretly and compromised on a bill more liberal than Gingrich wanted and more conservative that Clinton wanted. The Bill passed the House. Clinton also worked behind the scenes with the Republican Leader of the Senate, and a similar bill was passed there. The House and Senate reconciled the differences and the House approved it by a bipartisan vote of 328 to 101 and the Senate by 78 to 21.By working together, the President, Senate, and House agreed on the ""Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996,"" commonly referred to as ""Welfare Reform."" The bill was a fundamental shift in federal assistance to the poor, adding a workforce development component that encouraged employment among the poor and replacing ""Aid to Families with Dependent Children,"" a program instituted in 1935. In voting on November 4, you and I should be careful to select candidates who will ""work"" for us, rather than those -- Democrats or Republicans -- who insist on ""fighting"" for us."

The Obama administration is expected to announce a nominee to replace him by the end of the year.Brown's death sparked angry protests across the St. Louis suburb and has drawn global attention to race relations in the United States.Holder's legacy as attorney general, a position he has held since the start of the Obama administration, has been largely shaped by his vocal advocacy for racial justice.Holder also said he was ""exasperated"" to see leaks earlier this week from the grand jury reviewing the case locally. The leaked information indicated that Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, was acting in self-defense.""It appears that people are somehow trying to shape public opinion,"" Holder said.In addition to the criminal investigation into Wilson's actions, the Justice Department is also conducting a civil investigation into the patterns and practices of the Ferguson Police Department.(Reporting by Julia Edwards; Editing by Sandra Maler and Eric Beech)"
