0,HEALTHY LIVING,Here's Another Huge Reason To Eat A Plant-Based Diet,Leigh Weingus,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/plant-based-diet_n_6857770.html,,2015-03-13,Vegetables and spices vintage border and empty cutting board,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e9cce250000360036eee5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you're a vegetarian, we have some good news for you: Munching on all those plants may cut your risk for colorectal cancer -- the second leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. -- by about 20 percent.For the study, published in the March 9 online edition of JAMA Internal Medicine, researchers kept track of 77,000 men and women over the course of seven years. Roughly half the participants were meat-eaters, and the others fell into four vegetarian-like groups: Semi-vegetarians (ate meat less than once a week), pesco-vegetarians (ate fish but not other meat), lacto-ovo vegetarians (ate eggs and dairy but no meat) and vegans (no meat, no dairy, no eggs). Researchers found that after seven years, there were 380 colon cancer cases and 110 rectal cancer cases among the group. As it turns out, vegetarians were less likely to develop the disease compared to participants who ate meat, but pesco-vegetarians, in particular, were the real winners. ""All vegetarians together had on average a 22 percent reduction in the risk of developing colorectal cancer, compared with non-vegetarians,"" lead researcher Dr. Michael Orlich said, according to CBS. Those who ate fish, on the other hand, saw a 43 percent reduction rate. However, it should be noted there's still no concrete evidence that this reduction in colorectal cancer is due to diet. ""That's the problem in dietary studies of cancer. We don't know exactly what the connection is,"" Dr. Alfred Neugut, professor of epidemiology at Columbia University Medical Center said, according to CBS. CNN points out that participants in the study sample are Seventh Day Adventists, ""a group that typically avoids alcohol and tobacco.""Colorectal cancer risk aside, there are plenty of other reasons to stick to a plant-based diet. Not only do vegetarians have a lower risk of Type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease and high blood pressure, but they can maintain a healthy weight more easily. ""Let face it. If you are eating a lot of plant foods, many of which have only 10 to 50 calories per cup, you are going to lose weight,"" Carole Bartolotto, RD, wrote in a blog post for The Huffington Post. ""If you eat these foods instead of fast, fatty, processed, and sweet foods, you will cut out a ton of calories -- and the best part is, you will feel full!‚Äù Ready to hit your local farmers market yet?

The three are in a committed relationship and are raising a young boy, Gareth. This photo essay of mine was part of an evening projection series at the 7th Yangon Photo Festival in Myanmar (Burma) last month, where the theme, ""I Love You,"" was a fitting one. The story was also featured on Vocativ.com with text by Luke Malone.Although Brittany and Cliff are legally married, they plan to hold a ceremony with Dave to make his part of the three-person marriage as official as possible. Gay marriage is now legal in Washington state, but marriages with multiple people are not legal. This isn't stopping them from living together as a relatively normal, typical family unit.Gareth is the biological son of Brittany and Cliff, although Dave shares parenting duties. Gareth considers both men to be father figures and isn't quite yet at the age where he knows that his family is different than others. At this point, Gareth seems better off than most kids since he has one extra parent. Despite a decreasing issue with speech delay, Gareth seems happy, healthy, and normal.When presenting this work in Yangon, some audience questions revolved around how these three can make the relationship work. After all, don't they get jealous? For me and many like me, jealousy would get in the way. With Brittany, Cliff, and Dave, jealousy isn't really an issue. They approach their lives in a pretty logical way and they are able to think their way through issues, if they arise. I've found that polyamory tends to be more popular among logical, analytical personalities. In my opinion, this is because if you approach relationships from a logical point of view, non-monogamy with multiple committed partners makes a lot of sense. However, most people aren't ready to take the risk to try to make polyamory work. Those that do tend to be the kind of people that work in tech fields or at places like Microsoft, which is my theory as to why polyamory is popular in the Seattle area. It's also a liberal part of the country and a relatively large population center, but I still think that left brain/rational personalities are more likely to try polyamory.All in all, polyamory just works for Brittany, Dave, and Cliff. And I am happy for them. They would also tell you that for them, polyamory is at times a method of survival. Living on a tight budget, polyamory simply helps them to be able to get by and to support a child. In this arrangement, Gareth has the love and financial support of three parents ... and, after all, it takes a village to raise a child, right?-- See more from Seattle photographer David Ryder on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, or at photographer-in-seattle.com."

6,POLITICS,Obama Calls For Improved Veterans' Care During Visit To Troubled VA Hospital,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-phoenix-va-visit_n_6867142.html,,2015-03-13,"US President Barack Obama speaks alongside Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert McDonald (L) following a briefing on US military veterans healthcare at the Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center in Phoenix, Arizona, March 13, 2015. The government announced a new advisory committee of private sector, non-profit and government leaders to improve the VA's ability to improve care for veterans from the Phoenix VA that was at the center of scandal last year regarding the health care of US military veterans. AFP PHOTO / SAUL LOEB (Photo credit should read SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ed7a250000cf003a5b0f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Jeff Mason(Reuters) - Making his first stop at a troubled veterans facility in Phoenix that sparked a political crisis for his administration, President Barack Obama said on Friday that progress has been made but more work is needed to address delays for care.Obama joined a group of veterans and lawmakers, including Arizona Senator John McCain, his opponent in the 2008 presidential race, at the medical center that prompted outrage after revelations that wait-list delays had been covered up.""We all know that there have been significant problems at this facility: the kind of cooking the books and unwillingness to face up to the fact that veterans were not being adequately served went on too long and, as a consequence, we didn't fix what needed to be fixed,"" Obama said after meeting with the group.""There is still more work to do.""Widespread delays and other systemic problems at the Phoenix facility and others around the country sparked the resignation of then Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki in 2014.Obama said his administration was chipping away at problems to ensure wait times were shorter and access to care was better. But he said trust in the VA system still needed to be rebuilt.The administration announced on Friday the creation of a new advisory group made up of public officials and leaders from the private sector to advise on further improvements.That solution did not sit well with McCain.""It is truly stunning that nearly a year after the scandal of VA health care was first uncovered, President Obama used his long-overdue visit to the Phoenix VA to announce the creation of yet another advisory committee to study the problem,"" the senator said in a statement.""The truth is that while thousands of Arizona veterans continue to experience unacceptable delays in VA care, the Obama Administration has been slow and reluctant to fundamentally reform VA operations.""Obama also made a stop to visit Sergeant First Class Cory Remsburg, an Army Ranger who has fought to recover after being seriously wounded by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan. Obama paid tribute to Remsburg during his 2014 State of the Union address.Obama made the Arizona stop after a brief trip to California, where he attended a Democratic fundraiser and appeared on a late night television show.

In the last days, in fact, support for mountaintop removal has appeared to collapse -- the last banks are closing their doors and refusing to lend money to finance the devastating practice, former MTR coal companies like Patriot have thrown in the towel, the most notorious MTR coal baron Don Blankenship is in federal court for conspiracy charges, and for the first time ever state agencies officials are acknowledging the 25 peer-reviewed scientific studies on the links to high cancer rates, birth defects and serious health problems.But as new applications and permits for mountaintop removal in West Virginia and the region continue to be issued, the ""dying"" Appalachian coal companies, as one Illinois coal industry CEO crowed recently, are not going to quit any time soon without a fight -- and government intervention. ""We're asking Congress to do what it should have done a generation ago,"" said Kincaid, referring to the Appalachian Community Health Emergency Act, which was reintroduced last month by Kentucky Rep. John Yarmuth and eastern Kentucky-native Rep. Louise Slaughter, calling for a moratorium on mountaintop removal operations until a federal health study is conducted. ""It should have never begun, but now we have the science to know that it must end immediately."" In effect, the ACHE Act corrects the disastrous loopholes of current strip mining regulations, which have allowed over 500 mountains and adjacent communities to be destroyed and polluted, and forced central Appalachian residents to endure a health disaster and mounting death toll from reckless strip mining over the past half century.New York Times, August 4, 1977   In 1977, after a decades-long battle to abolish strip mining operations, President Jimmy Carter reluctantly signed the ""watered-down"" Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, calling it a ""disappointing effort,"" which effectively granted federal sanctioning of mountaintop removal mining. ""The President's other main objection to the bill,"" wrote the New York Times, ""is that it allows the mining companies to cut off the tops of Appalachian mountains to reach entire seams of coal.""New York Times, August 4, 1977  ""The West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection continues to ignore the studies that show mountaintop removal is drastically harming our health and cutting our lives short,"" representatives with the ACHE Act said in a press release. ""The most recent study, ""Appalachian mountaintop mining particulate matter induces neoplastic transformation of human bronchial epithelial cells and promotes tumor formation,"" found a direct link between mountaintop removal dust and lung cancer. WV DEP Secretary Randy Huffman has finally admitted that the health studies should be considered, but has no plan for doing so.

In the last days, in fact, support for mountaintop removal has appeared to collapse -- the last banks are closing their doors and refusing to lend money to finance the devastating practice, former MTR coal companies like Patriot have thrown in the towel, the most notorious MTR coal baron Don Blankenship is in federal court for conspiracy charges, and for the first time ever state agencies officials are acknowledging the 25 peer-reviewed scientific studies on the links to high cancer rates, birth defects and serious health problems.But as new applications and permits for mountaintop removal in West Virginia and the region continue to be issued, the ""dying"" Appalachian coal companies, as one Illinois coal industry CEO crowed recently, are not going to quit any time soon without a fight -- and government intervention. ""We're asking Congress to do what it should have done a generation ago,"" said Kincaid, referring to the Appalachian Community Health Emergency Act, which was reintroduced last month by Kentucky Rep. John Yarmuth and eastern Kentucky-native Rep. Louise Slaughter, calling for a moratorium on mountaintop removal operations until a federal health study is conducted. ""It should have never begun, but now we have the science to know that it must end immediately."" In effect, the ACHE Act corrects the disastrous loopholes of current strip mining regulations, which have allowed over 500 mountains and adjacent communities to be destroyed and polluted, and forced central Appalachian residents to endure a health disaster and mounting death toll from reckless strip mining over the past half century.New York Times, August 4, 1977   In 1977, after a decades-long battle to abolish strip mining operations, President Jimmy Carter reluctantly signed the ""watered-down"" Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, calling it a ""disappointing effort,"" which effectively granted federal sanctioning of mountaintop removal mining. ""The President's other main objection to the bill,"" wrote the New York Times, ""is that it allows the mining companies to cut off the tops of Appalachian mountains to reach entire seams of coal.""New York Times, August 4, 1977  ""The West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection continues to ignore the studies that show mountaintop removal is drastically harming our health and cutting our lives short,"" representatives with the ACHE Act said in a press release.

Two have already passed.

My first table of the evening just sat down. It was a couple I had never seen before in the the restaurant where I worked at a retirement living community. I was eager to meet them. I picked up my water pitcher in a great mood and headed to the table. When I arrived, I poured the glasses of ice-cold water, and introduced myself. ""Hello, my name is Di-"" was all I could muster before the gentlemen rudely interrupted with the demand that I bring him an iced tea, without even looking at me. Instantly my mood changed, and it took every ounce of my being to swallow my pride. I took the high road as this job has taught me to do and kindly said, ""Yes sir.""Add more living to your life. This is the motto that attracts residents to the community, and ironically, describes what it's like to work there. I would know -- the residents will certainly liven your day during mealtime. This is my first job and it has forced me to mature in ways I never imagined. I have learned to remain calm in the face of so much disrespect from the people that I serve French toast and eggplant Parmesan on a weekly basis.If being outgoing ever becomes something that can be measured and sold, I would easily become a millionaire. I love to go to social events, interact with different personalities, and socialize with a mixture of diverse people. In high school, my people oriented personality developed into an interest in marketing, a field I intend to explore in college. During my high school years, I never fit into any one clique or limit myself to one group of people. I work very well with others and have always easily got along with most people. Given my personality, I never thought being a waitress at a retirement community restaurant would pose such a difficult challenge.Treat others the way you want to be treated. At a young age, my parents instilled this lesson in me as well as taught me to always stand up for myself and treat others fairly. Working at the restaurant has exposed me to people who do not always treat me with the same respect that I deserve and show. As a waitress, I can't stand up to them and demand respect in the way my parents nurtured me to do. This inner conflict has been difficult to navigate. Over time, I have become a more disciplined person as I curb my impulse to say something disrespectful to the rude people I serve. To prevent myself from snapping, I have learned to pause. Breathe in and out.I have also learned to appreciate and focus on the good rather than allowing the bad to consume my experience at work. The optimist in me has grown. For example, Mr. Jones, a resident who dines at Atrium every day, takes care of his wife, who is diagnosed with early onset of Alzheimer's disease. Though he is always requesting extra food, and therefore making my job harder, he is extremely polite and always has a smile on his face even when dealing with his wife. Almost every time he asks for something else, he always says, "" I do not mean to trouble you but... ""This simple comment instantly puts a smile on my face and softens my mood.I am now more tolerant of others and realize that having the last word is not always important. Sometimes kindness and a smile are the best ways to handle a tense situation. ""Kill them with kindness,"" as the saying goes. I learned this lesson up close at work. As a result, I have grown into a stronger person as I make my transition into adulthood.Diamond Grady is a 2014 graduate of Seton Keough High School in Baltimore and a freshman at Spelman College."

The press conference was held to discuss the overnight shooting of two police officers outside the Ferguson Police Department who were rushed to a local hospital. Two police officers shot overnight in the troubled Missouri city of Ferguson were victims of an 'ambush,' the police chief of St Louis County said Thursday. AFP PHOTO / MICHAEL B.

There is certainly nobody in custody,"" said Belmar, who leads the force in the Missouri county where Ferguson is located.It was still unclear what kind of handgun was used in the wounding of the officers, the chief said at a news conference, and whether the officers had been deliberately targeted in the attack during a volatile rally early Thursday morning.Belmar would not be drawn on any possible connection between the shooter or shooters and the demonstration.""It's kind of really hard to speculate what kind of nexus that may or may not have existed regarding the shooters and any individuals who would have been out there for whatever reason,"" Belmar said.Even so, authorities had ""a pretty good idea"" where the gunshots that wounded the two officers had originated, but Belmar declined to provide specifics or details about any other evidence that may have been gathered.In Thursday's shooting, a 41-year-old St. Louis County police officer suffered a shoulder wound and a 32-year-old colleague from the nearby Webster Groves Police Department sustained a facial wound that left a bullet lodged near his ear. Both were treated and released by a local hospital.The shooting of the officers came less than three months after the killing of two New York City patrolmen by a troubled man who said he was seeking to avenge the deaths of Brown and an unarmed black man in New York who was killed by police.The vacuum of news on the manhunt has kept the focus on efforts by community leaders to ratchet down tensions in Ferguson, where a majority of residents are African-American and most of the police are white.""We can find these criminals who committed this heinous act,"" said Benjamin Crump, attorney for the family of Michael Brown, a black teenager killed by a white police officer in August, an event that made Ferguson a national symbol of strained relations between police and African-Americans.""This can be an opportunity,"" Crump told CNN. ""The community and the police can come together.""Activists have pressed for more reforms to address what a Justice Department report this week called a ""toxic environment"" for the city's black residents.Protesters, condemning the wounding of the officers, held a candle-light prayer vigil for peace in Ferguson late Thursday. About 100 people then held a boisterous but peaceful protest outside the police station in light rain.The crowd blocked traffic at times, but there were no arrests and the demonstration passed without incident.(Additional reporting by Jeff Mason in Los Angeles, Suzannah Gonzales in Chicago, David Bailey in Minneapolis; Writing by Daniel Wallis and Frank McGurty; Editing by James Dalgleish and Ken Wills)"

Saturday‚Äôs flight comes after U.S. and Cuban officials agreed in December to take steps to normalize diplomatic relations for the first time since 1961. The group traveling to Cuba will participate in the ‚ÄúCuba Hoy,‚Äù or ‚ÄúCuba Today,‚Äù Conference from March 14 to 21, organized by the New Orleans-based International Cuba Society and At The Threshold, according to the New Orleans Biz Journal. The agenda includes seminar on topics including foreign investment, energy development and historic preservation led by both U.S. and Cuban experts. ""Re-establishing Louisiana's historically strong ties with Cuba could have a huge economic impact on Louisiana, particularly New Orleans,"" Joe Doss, the president of At The Threshold, told the Times-Picayune in January, when the conference was first announced. ""This trip will help position Louisiana as a leader in the engagement process and set the stage for a mutually beneficial relationship."" The Dec. 17 announcement that the U.S. and Cuba would mend diplomatic ties generated increased interest in investing in the island. The U.S. announcement included the easing of restrictions on some sales of agricultural and other products to Cuba, as well as permitting Americans to bring up to $400 of Cuban goods when returning from the island. The December changes also eased restrictions on U.S. travel to Cuba, though travel for tourism remains prohibited. But despite the unprecedented forward movement on U.S.-diplomacy since December, the U.S. trade embargo remains in place and cannot be removed without an act of Congress. Nevertheless, a series of concrete changes in recent months show that the two countries are slowly becoming more friendly toward one another. The two countries have held two rounds of high-level diplomatic talks aimed at reestablishing formal embassies, removing Cuba from the U.S. ""State Sponsors of Terrorism"" list and dealing with ongoing bilateral issues like immigration. A third round of talks are scheduled to take place on Monday in Havana.This week, the Cuban telephone company, Etesca, announced the reestablishment of direct phone links to the United States for the first time in 15 years. Prior to the change, calls between Cuba and the United States had to be routed through a third country, driving up the cost. The tour operator Cuba Travel Services will also begin offering weekly direct charter flights from New York to the island, Bloomberg News reported Friday. "

In his new book, Frank: A Life in Politics from the Great Society to Same-Sex Marriage, Frank reveals how he decided to come out of the closet as a gay man, the impact that decision had on his political career, and his subsequent efforts to advance LGBT rights along with other progressive causes, including his influence on Bill Clinton, who despite his advocacy of the harsh ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy, also showed his support for gay rights in a number of ways. The book describes Frank's political career, his personal life, and the sometimes awkward connections between the two. Although he was the second member of Congress to come out of the closet, he did not do so on the terms he would have liked. Nevertheless, he was so well-respected among journalists and fellow Congressman that his ""outing,"" although a big news story at the time, did not do much harm to his subsequent political career except in one way. It meant that he would no longer be considered a candidate to be Speaker of the House, which is unfortunate, because he would have been an incredible Speaker. Right before he came out, Barney went to House Speaker Tip O'Neill, a fellow Massachusetts Democrat, to warn him. In his book, Barney describes his delight when O'Neill immediately expressed support for Frank, saying that he had hoped that Barney would some day become the first Jewish Speaker. O'Neill wanted to help Barney minimize the potential damage, so he told his press secretary (and now an MSNBC talk show host), Chris Matthews: ""Chris,"" he said, ""we might have an issue to deal with. I think Barney Frank is going to come out of the room.""Voters in Barney's Congressional district -- which included liberal areas like suburban Brookline and Newton but also more moderate areas like Fall River -- continued to return him to Congress. (He served from 1981 until 2013). After he came out of the closet, Barney broke ground in several ways, including insistence that his then partner, Herb Moses, be invited to all events at which the spouses of other Congressmembers were invited. In 2012, Barney married Jim Ready, making him the first Congressperson to be married to someone of the same sex.Barney could not avoid being the target of Congressional homophobes. The most disgusting example occurred in 1995, when Cong. Dick Armey of Texas, then the House majority leader, during an interview with a group of radio broadcasters, referred to Barney as ""Barney Fag."" Armey later claimed that he had simply mispronounced Barney's last name, but nobody believed him. (He later apologized to Barney for his remark, but Armey's subsequent career as a Tea Party spokesperson suggests that he remains an outrageous opponent of LBGT rights). Barney also reveals some of the surprising support he received from some folks who did so out of basic human decency. One of them was David Locke, a conservative Republican state senator from an area within Barney's Congressional district, who approached Barney and asked him march alongside him at a Memorial Day parade soon after Barney had gone public about being gay. Frank also describes the support he received from conservative Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming, who supported Frank's word to remove an anti-gay immigration rule and who told Barney that he admired his courage in coming out. Barney also has kind words to say about my former boss, Boston Mayor Ray Flynn, who publicly praised Barney for his support for many liberal causes at a time when some politicians were distancing themselves from the newly out-of-the-closet politician.Barney's book describes some of the ways he helped advance the cause of gay rights. Despite Clinton's support for the ""Don't Ask/Don't Tell"" policy in the military, Frank reveals that Clinton was pretty good on LGBT issues in other ways. Clinton hired a number of gay staff members as well as the first openly gay or lesbian presidential appointee -- Roberta Achtenberg, who became assistant secretary of HUD. In 1995, Clinton issued an executive order revoking the ban on security clearances. At Frank's urging, Clinton's Attorney General Janet Reno added people who'd been persecuted for their sexual orientation or gender identity to the list of those who were eligible for refugee status. Clinton also the director of the Office of Personnel Management to send a letter to every federal agency reminding them that they could not discrimination against hiring people on the basis of sexual orientation. One of the most fascinating parts of Frank's book is his revelation -- kept secret until now -- of how he persuaded Clinton not to appoint Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia to become Secretary of State because of his persistent track record of homophobia.  In his book, Barney explains what came to be known as the ""Frank rule."" Barney knew that quite a few members of Congress, including many Republicans, were gay, but he did not think it was appropriate to ""out"" them. But he also believed, as he explains in his book, that ""the right to privacy does not include the right to hypocrisy."" He believed it was appropriate to ""out"" gay Congressmembers if they used their influence to oppose gay rights, and his book describes a number of instances in which he was on the verge of doing so, but he never carried out his threat.Frank grew up in Bayonne, New Jersey and moved to Boston to attend Harvard and later Harvard Law School. After serving as a top aide to Boston Mayor Kevin White, he ran for the Massachusetts legislature in 1972 from a liberal district in Boston. One of his re-election campaign posters showed a photo of the then-overweight and disheveled Frank under the heading ""Neatness Isn't Everything"". When I was teaching at Tufts University and working as a housing activist in Boston in the late 1970s, I got to know Barney, who, as a state legislator, was an effective ally of the housing/tenants movement. When Barney first ran for Congress in 1980, I invited him to speak at Tufts. Even though the campus (in Medford, MA, a Boston suburb) was not in his district, I figured his talk might inspire some students to volunteer for his campaign. But that night, as Barney arrived at the auditorium at Tufts, rather than thank me, he gruffly said, ""What the hell am I doing here?"" He nevertheless gave an inspiring talk. The next day he called me to apologize for his comment, explaining that he'd had a rough day and was tired and not feeling well that evening, and also said that he was grateful to me for the Tufts students who had signed up to help his campaign.When I went to work for Boston Mayor Ray Flynn in 1984 (through 1992), I continued to rely on Barney (along with Cong. Joe Kennedy, who was also a member of the House housing/banking committee and also a real progressive) for help on housing issues. At the time, I didn't know Barney was gay, but when he came out in 1987, I wrote him a note expressing my support, and he wrote back a wonderful thank-you note that also mentioned a housing issue he was working on to help protect government-subsidized housing in Boston and other cities, which I had talked with him about several times. He never got the credit he deserved for championing this cause on behalf of low-income tenants. Barney always spoke very rapidly and with a thick New Jersey accent that made him sound a bit like the cartoon character Elmer Fudd. For most politicians, this speaking style -- which to some sounded like a speech impediment -- would have been a handicap. But Barney was so funny, so quick, and so brilliant that it never posed a problem. It simply meant that to understand him, you had to listen carefully. Barney used his position in Congress, and his willingness to appear frequently on TV shows and be quoted in the media (reporters loved him because he was so quotable), to advance LGBT rights. But he continued to fight for other progressive causes. One of my favorite of Barney's quips was his statement that right-wing anti-abortion activists, who also typically oppose the government safety net for the poor, ""believe that life begins at conception and ends at birth.""During the 1980s, all the major players in greater Boston -- business, labor, contractors, politicians, transportation experts -- supported a huge megaproject to dismantle the elevated I-93 highway that cut through the heart of Boston (officially called the Central Artery) and replace it with several underground tunnels in order to reduce traffic congestion and create a huge park in the middle of the city. The project, often called the ""Big Dig,"" was delayed for many years (construction began in 1991 and wasn't completed until 2007) and wound up costing over $15 billion, more than double the original estimate. Even before construction began, Barney warned that the project could wind up being a boondoggle. He joked: ""Wouldn't it be cheaper to raise the city than depress the artery?""Barney's book is filled with wonderful and insightful examples of legislative maneuvering and political intrigue. His last major battle in Congress was his effort to pass tough regulations on the banking industry, which ultimately led to the Dodd-Frank bill. As Elizabeth Warren describes in her autobiography, A Fighting Chance, Barney was a brilliant legislative strategist. Whenever there were meetings about that bill with other members of Congress, bank lobbyists, and progressive activists, Barney was always the smartest person in the room and always savvy about which compromises to make in order to advance the cause, even if those compromises were not what he (and the reformers) wanted. Dodd-Frank was hardly a perfect bill but it did include some important progressive parts, including creating a consumer financial protection agency that Elizabeth Warren, along with Barney, had championed.Barney wasn't the most progressive member of Congress, but he generally got close to 100% ratings from unions, environmental groups, women's rights organizations, gun control advocates, and other groups on the left. Like Henry Waxman, who also recently retired from Congress, Barney was a principled liberal who knew how to cut a deal that led to much-needed reforms. The process was rarely pretty, or the way it is supposed to work in textbooks, but Barney has a master at it. He could be caustic and even nasty with people sometimes, but these were characteristics most folks were willing to overlook because he was so damn funny and, more important, so damn effective. I'm grateful for Barney Frank's great work in Congress over many years. His new book is worth reading as both the story of a public figure who has lived a full and fascinating life as well as a primer about American politics from an insider who knew how to make the system work and who became a voice for people without much political clout.

The most disgusting example occurred in 1995, when Cong. Dick Armey of Texas, then the House majority leader, during an interview with a group of radio broadcasters, referred to Barney as ""Barney Fag."" Armey later claimed that he had simply mispronounced Barney's last name, but nobody believed him. (He later apologized to Barney for his remark, but Armey's subsequent career as a Tea Party spokesperson suggests that he remains an outrageous opponent of LBGT rights). Barney also reveals some of the surprising support he received from some folks who did so out of basic human decency. One of them was David Locke, a conservative Republican state senator from an area within Barney's Congressional district, who approached Barney and asked him march alongside him at a Memorial Day parade soon after Barney had gone public about being gay. Frank also describes the support he received from conservative Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming, who supported Frank's word to remove an anti-gay immigration rule and who told Barney that he admired his courage in coming out. Barney also has kind words to say about my former boss, Boston Mayor Ray Flynn, who publicly praised Barney for his support for many liberal causes at a time when some politicians were distancing themselves from the newly out-of-the-closet politician.Barney's book describes some of the ways he helped advance the cause of gay rights. Despite Clinton's support for the ""Don't Ask/Don't Tell"" policy in the military, Frank reveals that Clinton was pretty good on LGBT issues in other ways. Clinton hired a number of gay staff members as well as the first openly gay or lesbian presidential appointee -- Roberta Achtenberg, who became assistant secretary of HUD. In 1995, Clinton issued an executive order revoking the ban on security clearances. At Frank's urging, Clinton's Attorney General Janet Reno added people who'd been persecuted for their sexual orientation or gender identity to the list of those who were eligible for refugee status. Clinton also the director of the Office of Personnel Management to send a letter to every federal agency reminding them that they could not discrimination against hiring people on the basis of sexual orientation. One of the most fascinating parts of Frank's book is his revelation -- kept secret until now -- of how he persuaded Clinton not to appoint Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia to become Secretary of State because of his persistent track record of homophobia.  In his book, Barney explains what came to be known as the ""Frank rule."" Barney knew that quite a few members of Congress, including many Republicans, were gay, but he did not think it was appropriate to ""out"" them. But he also believed, as he explains in his book, that ""the right to privacy does not include the right to hypocrisy."" He believed it was appropriate to ""out"" gay Congressmembers if they used their influence to oppose gay rights, and his book describes a number of instances in which he was on the verge of doing so, but he never carried out his threat.Frank grew up in Bayonne, New Jersey and moved to Boston to attend Harvard and later Harvard Law School. After serving as a top aide to Boston Mayor Kevin White, he ran for the Massachusetts legislature in 1972 from a liberal district in Boston. One of his re-election campaign posters showed a photo of the then-overweight and disheveled Frank under the heading ""Neatness Isn't Everything"". When I was teaching at Tufts University and working as a housing activist in Boston in the late 1970s, I got to know Barney, who, as a state legislator, was an effective ally of the housing/tenants movement. When Barney first ran for Congress in 1980, I invited him to speak at Tufts. Even though the campus (in Medford, MA, a Boston suburb) was not in his district, I figured his talk might inspire some students to volunteer for his campaign. But that night, as Barney arrived at the auditorium at Tufts, rather than thank me, he gruffly said, ""What the hell am I doing here?"" He nevertheless gave an inspiring talk. The next day he called me to apologize for his comment, explaining that he'd had a rough day and was tired and not feeling well that evening, and also said that he was grateful to me for the Tufts students who had signed up to help his campaign.When I went to work for Boston Mayor Ray Flynn in 1984 (through 1992), I continued to rely on Barney (along with Cong. Joe Kennedy, who was also a member of the House housing/banking committee and also a real progressive) for help on housing issues. At the time, I didn't know Barney was gay, but when he came out in 1987, I wrote him a note expressing my support, and he wrote back a wonderful thank-you note that also mentioned a housing issue he was working on to help protect government-subsidized housing in Boston and other cities, which I had talked with him about several times. He never got the credit he deserved for championing this cause on behalf of low-income tenants. Barney always spoke very rapidly and with a thick New Jersey accent that made him sound a bit like the cartoon character Elmer Fudd. For most politicians, this speaking style -- which to some sounded like a speech impediment -- would have been a handicap. But Barney was so funny, so quick, and so brilliant that it never posed a problem. It simply meant that to understand him, you had to listen carefully. Barney used his position in Congress, and his willingness to appear frequently on TV shows and be quoted in the media (reporters loved him because he was so quotable), to advance LGBT rights. But he continued to fight for other progressive causes. One of my favorite of Barney's quips was his statement that right-wing anti-abortion activists, who also typically oppose the government safety net for the poor, ""believe that life begins at conception and ends at birth.""During the 1980s, all the major players in greater Boston -- business, labor, contractors, politicians, transportation experts -- supported a huge megaproject to dismantle the elevated I-93 highway that cut through the heart of Boston (officially called the Central Artery) and replace it with several underground tunnels in order to reduce traffic congestion and create a huge park in the middle of the city. The project, often called the ""Big Dig,"" was delayed for many years (construction began in 1991 and wasn't completed until 2007) and wound up costing over $15 billion, more than double the original estimate. Even before construction began, Barney warned that the project could wind up being a boondoggle. He joked: ""Wouldn't it be cheaper to raise the city than depress the artery?""Barney's book is filled with wonderful and insightful examples of legislative maneuvering and political intrigue. His last major battle in Congress was his effort to pass tough regulations on the banking industry, which ultimately led to the Dodd-Frank bill. As Elizabeth Warren describes in her autobiography, A Fighting Chance, Barney was a brilliant legislative strategist. Whenever there were meetings about that bill with other members of Congress, bank lobbyists, and progressive activists, Barney was always the smartest person in the room and always savvy about which compromises to make in order to advance the cause, even if those compromises were not what he (and the reformers) wanted. Dodd-Frank was hardly a perfect bill but it did include some important progressive parts, including creating a consumer financial protection agency that Elizabeth Warren, along with Barney, had championed.Barney wasn't the most progressive member of Congress, but he generally got close to 100% ratings from unions, environmental groups, women's rights organizations, gun control advocates, and other groups on the left. Like Henry Waxman, who also recently retired from Congress, Barney was a principled liberal who knew how to cut a deal that led to much-needed reforms. The process was rarely pretty, or the way it is supposed to work in textbooks, but Barney has a master at it. He could be caustic and even nasty with people sometimes, but these were characteristics most folks were willing to overlook because he was so damn funny and, more important, so damn effective. I'm grateful for Barney Frank's great work in Congress over many years. His new book is worth reading as both the story of a public figure who has lived a full and fascinating life as well as a primer about American politics from an insider who knew how to make the system work and who became a voice for people without much political clout.

Security Council with an Iran deal would be ""a direct affront to the American people.""State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters a Security Council resolution would not impact the U.S. ability to act unilaterally on Iran or compel it to remove sanctions, many of which pre-date U.N. nuclear penalties.""The Security Council would not impose new binding obligations on the United States that would limit our flexibility in any way to respond to future Iranian non-compliance,"" Psaki said.She added it was always known the council would need to act to repeal U.N. sanctions if there was a deal.Some eight U.N. resolutions, four of them imposing sanctions, demand that Iran halt uranium enrichment and other sensitive atomic work. They also bar the country from buying and selling atomic technology and anything linked to ballistic missiles. There is also a U.N. arms embargo.Western officials close to the talks said one of the advantages of a U.N. resolution endorsing a deal with Tehran is that it could shield any agreement from attempts to undermine it. Some 47 Republicans wrote an open letter to Iran's leadership this week warning that any deal with Obama bypassing the Senate would not be binding and could be rescinded later. Israel also opposes the deal.Psaki acknowledged that steps taken by the council under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter related to unwinding U.N. sanctions would be binding for U.N. member states. Chapter 7 deals with measures to compel countries to comply with U.N. decisions.However, a mere council endorsement of the deal would not make the agreement binding for Washington, she added.Other Western officials close to the talks said a council endorsement would make the deal binding for European Union states.Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States ‚Äî the five veto-wielding members of the Security Council ‚Äî plus Germany and Iran are discussing a possible U.N. resolution. The topic has become a major issue in difficult negotiations that resume next week over constricting Iran's nuclear ability.Iran and the six are aiming to complete the framework of a nuclear deal by the end of March and achieve a full agreement by June 30.

For decades, the residents of River Rouge and surrounding communities have been living with severe air pollution from nearby coal plants, and together, they came out in force to pack a public hearing and call on the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) to put a plan in place that will finally clean up this pollution and correct a longstanding environmental injustice.Detroit is home to some of the most polluting coal plants in the country, which are major contributors to significant health problems in Wayne County. In fact, the River Rouge coal plant was listed as one of the nation's top environmental justice offenders by the NAACP in their ""Coal Blooded"" report. Exposure to sulfur dioxide pollution -- which comes from coal plants -- is a known trigger of both short-term health emergencies, like asthma attacks, and long-term, chronic health problems.""It's not right to let big corporate polluters dirty our air for so long and threaten the health of our families,"" said Ebony Elmore, a childcare provider and activist in River Rouge. ""We deserve safe air to breathe. This is a basic human right and MDEQ isn't protecting us.""Asthma rates in Wayne County are through the roof -- the statistics will shock you: According to recent studies, the county has the highest number of pediatric asthma cases in Michigan. Asthma hospitalization rates are three to six times higher than the state as a whole. The prevalence of asthma among Detroit adults is 50 percent higher than the rest of Michigan.At Wednesday's rally and hearing I heard person after person tell stories about asthma and respiratory problems from the bad air quality in the area. These families have lost loved ones to respiratory illnesses. One man described comforting the mother of an 11-year-old who died from asthma. Another young woman who grew up in the shadow of a coal plant described childhood soccer games where asthma attacks were so frequent that her teammates were regularly taken away by ambulance. It was heart-wrenching.The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has determined Wayne County has chronic, dangerous levels of sulfur dioxide pollution. And Detroit-based DTE Energy's coal plants are responsible for a whopping 85 percent of all sulfur dioxide emissions in Wayne County. That means cleaning up this pollution would go a long way towards improving public health in these communities.The state of Michigan is now required to put a plan in place to reduce this dangerous air pollution by 2015. As part of its plan to clean up sulfur dioxide emissions in Wayne County, the state must hold DTE responsible for its major contribution to health impacts. The state must require DTE to prevent its emissions from exceeding health standards, by either installing best-performing pollution controls or by ceasing burning coal, which is the source of these dangerous pollutants.This is all very possible. I have seen city after city make the decision to phase out an outdated, polluting coal plant as a result of tenacious grassroots campaigns launched by local residents. From Chicago to Indianapolis, from North Omaha to Alexandria, Virginia, just across the Potomac from Washington, D.C., local residents have won campaigns to phase out the coal plants that were contributing to sky-high asthma rates and other local health problems. Electricity rates have stayed low, and the lights have stayed on, thanks to cheap, clean alternatives like wind and solar and energy efficiency.If MDEQ doesn't put a plan in place to clean up this pollution, the Sierra Club will continue to join our partners and friends in River Rouge and across the region to fight for clean air by calling on EPA to put a federal plan in place that will do the job. We aren't going to stop until the air is safe and the kids and families of Wayne County no longer have to fight for the right to breathe."

I shall be writing about Austrian wines in another column, but I could ignore them entirely and still convince you that Burgenland, about an hour from Vienna and bordering on Hungary, Slovenia and Slovakia, is well worth visiting for its natural beauty alone. This is not an area dotted with little Hansel-and-Gretel-style cottages, for the Burgenlanders are a practical people who live in minimally decorated, comfortable stucco homes. But it is rich as a place where hundreds of species of birds and indigenous breeds of cattle dwell that include the longhorn Graurinder (gray cattle), white donkeys, water buffalo, and Mangalitza pigs famous for their delicately flavored meat.  Watered and fed by Lake Neusiedl (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) in the eastern parts of the Alps, the region is home to six nature parks, including the huge National Park, founded in 1993. Indeed, the park is prime bird-watching territory, and people are more likely to be seen on their bikes or hiking through the marshes than driving cars. The birds range from the great gray shrike (Raubw√ºrger) and short-eared owl (Sumpfohreule) to the red-tailed phalarope (Odensh√ºhnchen) and the imperial eagle (Kaiseradler).  My wife and I visited Burgenland last autumn, when most of the foliage and harvesting had taken place, so we contented ourselves with visiting the towns, restaurants, and one very special castle in the region. On our first day, we visited the small lakeside village of Gols, now famous for its exceptionally well done Weinkulturhaus (Wine Culture House), which not only stocks more than 400 Austrian wines (above) but has a beautifully lighted stone wine cellar to visit.  Afterwards we sat down for lunch at nearby Restaurant Varga, whose sign reads ""FISCH"" in big letters, and whose ingredients come straight from the lake each day. Only 14 fishermen are allowed to work in the lake, and Varga has its own, most of whom use nets and traps, not hooks.  Varga's interior is old-fashioned Austrian d√©cor, with heavy wood and heavy antiques, but come spring the outside tables are where you want to dine in the sunshine. The menu, on any given day, will be rich with zander (walleye pike), perhaps with eggplant and pumpkin puree; wels (catfish) with tomato, zucchini, potato dumpling and bacon (above) or hecht (pike), simply saut√©ed with boiled buttered potatoes. Drink the restaurant's own wine, name Zummitnehmen. Prices are according to availability of the fish.  After lunch we visited the remarkable Dorf Museum, a labor of love crafted almost singlehandedly by Christine and Josef Haubenwallner as homage to the farming heritage of the great plain. It is a kind of amiable ghost town lined with small houses, a schoolroom, grocer's shop, post office, craftsmen's shops, bakery, even an old cinema, all reclaimed from a century of village life now largely vanished. That evening we stayed on the grounds of the extraordinarily baroque Schloss Halbturn Castle, built in 1711 as a hunting lodge for Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI, who gave it to his daughter, Empress Maria Theresa of the Hapsburg Dynasty.  Today it is a museum with a small hotel owned and cared for by the very cordial Waldbott von Bassenheim family, which also oversees the vast Markus Count of Koenigsegg winery, well known for its Pinot Noirs.  The castle is home to a superb collection of furniture, as well as a glorious 1765 ceiling fresco ""Allegory of Time and Light"" by Franz Anton Maulbertsch, given as a wedding present for Archduchess Marie Christine. The rooms are ideal as galleries for the highly popular seasonal art exhibits, concerts, and garden parties, including an annual visit from Vienna's famed Lipizzaner stallions. The hotel's guest rooms, located in a building across the courtyard, have all been refurbished in a very minimalist, modern style--ours in a riot of bright orange colors. Down the winding staircase is a wholly charming dining room, Restaurant Wieser (below) , with wooden booths and beautifully set, candlelit tables where we enjoyed hearty autumnal fare that included that wonderful Mangalitza pork scented with rosemary (‚Ç¨12.80), and chicken paprika with housemade noodles and sauerkraut (‚Ç¨9.80). Complete meals range from ‚Ç¨18 to ‚Ç¨25, or you can order √† la carte. Lingering here over coffee and candlelight gave us a sense that Burgenland can seem as remote and removed from Vienna as Capri is from Naples. The next morning we drove to Burgenland's largest town, Eisenstadt (Iron City), actually a small city of just 13,000 residents, its center dominated by the magnificent Esterhazy Palace, once owned by one of the richest of the Hapsburg families and now wholly restored to 19th century grandeur, with several floors of superb and opulent furniture befitting the family's station. There is also a grand music hall with impeccable acoustics, where many of Haydn's works were first performed. We had a really splendid lunch at one of the town's finest, most modern restaurants, Henrici, located within the palace's former royal stables, with a menu featuring foods cooked on a lava stone grill, like juicy suckling pig and crispy potatoes. The interior, reached through glass doors, has high, barrel-shaped ceilings, and fine modern tables, chairs and a counter, all lighted by brightly colored, glowing lamps.  We began with goose liver with apple-poppyseed chutney (‚Ç¨15) and herb- marinated lake trout with roe, with an avocado potato salad and Mangalitza bacon (‚Ç¨13), and a dish of marinated, fried cep mushrooms with a chervil cream (‚Ç¨14). Our main courses included a dead ringer for Southern fried chicken (‚Ç¨16), here served with potato and corn lettuce, and sliced filet of beef, which came with herbed dumplings (‚Ç¨19). We finished our meal with curd cheese dumplings and stewed plums and a lovely chestnut cake with red wine pear and plum jam sorbet. That evening we dined at a very new restaurant with an even more modern look and menu--Zur Blauen Ganz (Blue Goose), whose owner, Peter Szigeti, is also proprietor of one of the region's most forward-looking wineries, Szigeti. There are two dining rooms here, both brightly lighted and therefore very convivial, and the menu ranges far and wide for its effects while still using Burgenland's products as much as possible. Thus, we enjoyed dim sum with black pudding and sauerkraut as well as foie gras with plums and brioche (‚Ç¨15); there was sushi with polenta (‚Ç¨13), and carpaccio with apple and horseradish (‚Ç¨9). One of the best dishes was a white zucchini soup with burrata cheese and roast beef and black olives served on the side (‚Ç¨8.50). Grilled wild shrimp with romaine lettuce and kohlrabi (‚Ç¨19) was simple and perfect, and the cold autumn air was kept at bay by a gutsy gulasch soup with black caraway and garlic (‚Ç¨6.50). There was also a traditional form of Tafelspitz--boiled beef with Sardinian fregola (‚Ç¨20).  Desserts were sumptuous--mango and coffee with hazelnut crisp (‚Ç¨8), and a rich chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream (‚Ç¨7). One of the few towns in Burgenland that probably concurs with tourists' expectations of quaintness is Rust, granted ""free state"" status by the Holy Roman Emperor, whose broad streets end at the waterline and whose chimneys are famous perches for storks.   The Austrian Wine Academy is also located in the city, which is surrounded by vineyards that produce its principal income and its most famous sweet wine, Ruster Ausbruch. The main streets are mostly off limits to cars, and charming shops line the few blocks of the center. You walk through Rust at a slow pace, through archways, past the town hall and the Gothic Fischerkirche church. The wine taverns, called Bushenshanken, are gregarious gathering places. Most buildings date back to the 16th through 19th centuries, with mildly baroque fa√ßades mounted with royal heraldic decorations. It's a storybook village, home to only 300 or so citizens, and for its beauty is actually protected by the Hague Convention for the protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, which one hopes will keep Rust from ever changing. Once at the gates, the barbarians will be asked to leave. . . politely."

I shall be writing about Austrian wines in another column, but I could ignore them entirely and still convince you that Burgenland, about an hour from Vienna and bordering on Hungary, Slovenia and Slovakia, is well worth visiting for its natural beauty alone. This is not an area dotted with little Hansel-and-Gretel-style cottages, for the Burgenlanders are a practical people who live in minimally decorated, comfortable stucco homes. But it is rich as a place where hundreds of species of birds and indigenous breeds of cattle dwell that include the longhorn Graurinder (gray cattle), white donkeys, water buffalo, and Mangalitza pigs famous for their delicately flavored meat.  Watered and fed by Lake Neusiedl (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) in the eastern parts of the Alps, the region is home to six nature parks, including the huge National Park, founded in 1993. Indeed, the park is prime bird-watching territory, and people are more likely to be seen on their bikes or hiking through the marshes than driving cars. The birds range from the great gray shrike (Raubw√ºrger) and short-eared owl (Sumpfohreule) to the red-tailed phalarope (Odensh√ºhnchen) and the imperial eagle (Kaiseradler).  My wife and I visited Burgenland last autumn, when most of the foliage and harvesting had taken place, so we contented ourselves with visiting the towns, restaurants, and one very special castle in the region. On our first day, we visited the small lakeside village of Gols, now famous for its exceptionally well done Weinkulturhaus (Wine Culture House), which not only stocks more than 400 Austrian wines (above) but has a beautifully lighted stone wine cellar to visit.  Afterwards we sat down for lunch at nearby Restaurant Varga, whose sign reads ""FISCH"" in big letters, and whose ingredients come straight from the lake each day. Only 14 fishermen are allowed to work in the lake, and Varga has its own, most of whom use nets and traps, not hooks.  Varga's interior is old-fashioned Austrian d√©cor, with heavy wood and heavy antiques, but come spring the outside tables are where you want to dine in the sunshine. The menu, on any given day, will be rich with zander (walleye pike), perhaps with eggplant and pumpkin puree; wels (catfish) with tomato, zucchini, potato dumpling and bacon (above) or hecht (pike), simply saut√©ed with boiled buttered potatoes. Drink the restaurant's own wine, name Zummitnehmen. Prices are according to availability of the fish.  After lunch we visited the remarkable Dorf Museum, a labor of love crafted almost singlehandedly by Christine and Josef Haubenwallner as homage to the farming heritage of the great plain. It is a kind of amiable ghost town lined with small houses, a schoolroom, grocer's shop, post office, craftsmen's shops, bakery, even an old cinema, all reclaimed from a century of village life now largely vanished. That evening we stayed on the grounds of the extraordinarily baroque Schloss Halbturn Castle, built in 1711 as a hunting lodge for Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI, who gave it to his daughter, Empress Maria Theresa of the Hapsburg Dynasty.  Today it is a museum with a small hotel owned and cared for by the very cordial Waldbott von Bassenheim family, which also oversees the vast Markus Count of Koenigsegg winery, well known for its Pinot Noirs.  The castle is home to a superb collection of furniture, as well as a glorious 1765 ceiling fresco ""Allegory of Time and Light"" by Franz Anton Maulbertsch, given as a wedding present for Archduchess Marie Christine. The rooms are ideal as galleries for the highly popular seasonal art exhibits, concerts, and garden parties, including an annual visit from Vienna's famed Lipizzaner stallions. The hotel's guest rooms, located in a building across the courtyard, have all been refurbished in a very minimalist, modern style--ours in a riot of bright orange colors. Down the winding staircase is a wholly charming dining room, Restaurant Wieser (below) , with wooden booths and beautifully set, candlelit tables where we enjoyed hearty autumnal fare that included that wonderful Mangalitza pork scented with rosemary (‚Ç¨12.80), and chicken paprika with housemade noodles and sauerkraut (‚Ç¨9.80). Complete meals range from ‚Ç¨18 to ‚Ç¨25, or you can order √† la carte. Lingering here over coffee and candlelight gave us a sense that Burgenland can seem as remote and removed from Vienna as Capri is from Naples. The next morning we drove to Burgenland's largest town, Eisenstadt (Iron City), actually a small city of just 13,000 residents, its center dominated by the magnificent Esterhazy Palace, once owned by one of the richest of the Hapsburg families and now wholly restored to 19th century grandeur, with several floors of superb and opulent furniture befitting the family's station. There is also a grand music hall with impeccable acoustics, where many of Haydn's works were first performed. We had a really splendid lunch at one of the town's finest, most modern restaurants, Henrici, located within the palace's former royal stables, with a menu featuring foods cooked on a lava stone grill, like juicy suckling pig and crispy potatoes. The interior, reached through glass doors, has high, barrel-shaped ceilings, and fine modern tables, chairs and a counter, all lighted by brightly colored, glowing lamps.  We began with goose liver with apple-poppyseed chutney (‚Ç¨15) and herb- marinated lake trout with roe, with an avocado potato salad and Mangalitza bacon (‚Ç¨13), and a dish of marinated, fried cep mushrooms with a chervil cream (‚Ç¨14). Our main courses included a dead ringer for Southern fried chicken (‚Ç¨16), here served with potato and corn lettuce, and sliced filet of beef, which came with herbed dumplings (‚Ç¨19). We finished our meal with curd cheese dumplings and stewed plums and a lovely chestnut cake with red wine pear and plum jam sorbet. That evening we dined at a very new restaurant with an even more modern look and menu--Zur Blauen Ganz (Blue Goose), whose owner, Peter Szigeti, is also proprietor of one of the region's most forward-looking wineries, Szigeti.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and 20 heads of state and government, including Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.Denis McClean, spokesman for the U.N. Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR), said the current 10-year plan, known as the Hyogo Framework for Action, had been a ""limited success.""""In many countries we have seen the growth of a culture of disaster risk management which was not there before, and would not have been possible without the guidance and the guidelines contained in the Hyogo Framework for Action,"" he said.By 2015, 86 countries had set up formal national bodies to coordinate disaster risk reduction efforts, and 121 countries had enacted legislation to support policy to reduce disaster risk, according to the UNISDR.In addition, there are now 85 national disaster loss databases, giving those countries a headstart in tackling the factors that cause deaths and economic losses when hazards like floods or an earthquake hit, McClean said. FEWER LIVES LOSTJo Scheuer, director for climate change and disaster risk reduction with the United Nations Development Program, said voluntary frameworks like the Hyogo agreement were important because they steered investments, strategies and programs in the right direction.""In terms of dealing with disaster events, we are in much, much better shape than we have ever been before, and you see that in (a) reduction of loss of life,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in Sendai.""A global framework does have an impact on what happens on the ground,"" he said, citing improvements in early warning systems, search and rescue, evacuation drills and identifying safe shelters.But while the world has got better at dealing with disaster events, it is not yet basing development decisions on risk information in an accountable way, so that building codes are enforced, for example, Scheuer said.Philippines Senator Loren Legarda said her country had responded to the Hyogo Framework for Action by enacting laws on disaster risk reduction and climate change.But 10 years after the framework was adopted, ""we realize the gaps in implementing our laws,"" she said.When Typhoon Haiyan hit the central Philippines in 2013, more than 6,300 people died because many living in vulnerable areas were not evacuated ahead of the storm, demonstrating the importance of early warning systems, she added.Efforts must be made to raise awareness that laws to protect people exist, and to find resources to put them into practice, Legarda said. ""Doing otherwise means...death, means loss of livelihood,"" she said.At preparatory talks on Friday ahead of the start of the Sendai conference, negotiators failed to reach agreement on thorny issues in the draft text for the new global plan, including targets to measure progress and how to increase funding for disaster prevention.Talks could continue through Tuesday, in a form to be decided on Saturday, so that a final version of the plan could be presented for approval on Wednesday, when the conference is scheduled to close.

The BBC documentary, which was banned from airing in India, tells the story of the brutal 2012 gang rape of Jyoti Singh in South Delhi, India that resulted in 23-year-old Singh's death. In her speech, Pinto discussed the movement to combat violence against women across the globe and men's roles in this fight. ""Today in 2015 despite the vast improvements in the lives and rights of women across the world in the last century. There still seems to exist this very complex network of ideological and cultural norms that still plague our society and that make global misogyny, in my opinion, a great scourge and most pressing issue of our age,"" Pinto said. ""But really our pride is misplaced when there is one gender on this planet that is yet to be emancipated.‚ÄùPinto told the audience that gender inequality is not limited by country, but manifests across all cultures and societies. She also discussed the importance of feminism as a shared understanding of mutual values. ""I cannot wait for that day when this generation of women and men finally realizes that claiming to be a feminist is simply asserting that you share the same spiritual and economic value as your male counterparts -- as each other,"" she said.Men are an integral part of the feminist movement, Pinto said, particularly those who don't believe in gender equality. ""We equally call upon men who do not believe in equal rights. This is your fight too,"" she told the men in the room. ""Your fight to defeat and transcend your own mind sets. Women don't ask to be ahead of you or behind you, we just want to be by your side as equals.""She explained that we need to empower women in order to rid the world of violence against women and gender inequality. ""The shame is not in admitting the existence of such violence, the shame is in the crime and not speaking out,"" Pinto said. ""In this way, if not us, at least our grandchildren will grow up in a world that's free of gender discrimination."" Another route to gender equality is encouraging women to support other women. ""And finally and most importantly I call upon women to raise each other up, to make each other‚Äôs welfare a priority and to never shame a woman for the choices she makes,"" she said. ""Refuse to internalize and reject the centuries of woman hating as hard as that might be, with all of us doing these things and educating our children to do the same, we may finally have that chance to stamp on that opportunity to shift the paradigm that led despicable events of this film.""Head over to Examiner.com to read Pinto's full speech.

Know Your IX, founded by student sexual assault survivors, is working with the gun control advocacy organization Everytown For Gun Safety to demand that pro-gun lawmakers stop ""exploiting"" the issue of campus rape to loosen gun laws. Pro-gun rhetoric, the groups say, hijacks the work students have done in recent years to address sexual violence.""It's proof there's a fundamental misunderstanding in campus sexual assault,"" said Erika Soto Lamb, spokeswoman for Everytown for Gun Safety, the group backed by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. ""The gun lobby is hijacking something that is already in the news for its own purpose to sell fear and sell more guns and allow more guns everywhere.""In Florida, for example, state legislation is moving forward to allow guns on campus despite opposition from students, university police and former GOP lawmakers-turned college presidents. State Rep. Dennis Baxley (R) -- a sponsor of the bill who admits a close relationship with an NRA lobbyist -- has cited campus rape as reason for allowing firearms at colleges.Similar debates have taken place this year in Nevada  and Indiana. In all, legislation has been proposed this year in at least 14 states to allow guns on campuses.Pro-gun groups, including Students for Concealed Carry, founded after the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007, have long insisted students would be safer if more carried guns. That argument won over legislators in seven states that have laws allowing guns on campus. But now, gun advocates backed by the NRA are adding sexual assault as fresh reason for students to be armed in dorm rooms and classrooms.Students for Concealed Carry has repeated the argument multiple times on Facebook last month alone.""Honestly, it's an opportunity for us to reach audiences we would not normally be able to reach,"" said Michael Newbern, a spokesman for Students for Concealed Carry. ""We've been saying this for a long time -- this is not new to us. We're happy that people are now paying attention to us, paying attention on a larger scale to what we've been saying for years.""The NRA is backing lawmakers in more than a dozen states who this year are proposing to erase restrictions against guns on college campuses.The NRA declined to comment. However, NRA radio host Cam Edwards said recently during his show that opponents of campus carry laws ""are OK with real sexual assaults happening.""""Frankly, they're wrong,"" said Dana Bolger, a sexual assault survivor and co-founder of Know Your IX. ""Lawmakers are basing their legislation on rape mythology -- that the greatest threat to a potential victim is a stranger.""There may be some individual survivors ""who say they wish they'd had a gun,"" Bolger conceded. But she said she'd rather see ""solutions that work for all survivors -- including campus dating violence survivors -- not those that help a few while putting thousands more at risk.""Lawmakers in  Nevada, Colorado and Indiana have argued over the past two years that allowing guns on campus will curb sexual assault. When Colorado Democrats tried to pass legislation to reinstate a campus firearms ban in 2013, Students for Concealed Carry circulated a photo of a teary-eyed woman with the statement, ""How does removing my right to defend myself from a rapist make you any safer?""But as the issue of campus rape has gained attention, proponents of guns on campus increasingly use the sexual assault issue to support their arguments. Meanwhile, advocates against sexual violence have united to push back, saying arming potential victims isn't realistic in the vast majority of assaults against students.""The idea that defensive gun use is likely to be an effective method for deterring or dealing with sexual assault seems to overlook what we know about the large majority of sexual assaults experienced by college students,"" said Chris Krebs, senior research social scientist at RTI International. Nine in 10 sexual assaults of collegiate women are committed by someone known to the victim, and 89 percent involve the use of alcohol, according to Justice Department-funded research. A weapon is present in 2.4 percent of assaults on collegiate victims. The advocates said they also worry about students having greater access to firearms while they may be intoxicated.Mary Koss, a University of Arizona professor and longtime sexual violence researcher, called the gun advocates' approaches ""cynical.""""We also know that the level of resistance by the victim tends to be pegged on the level of aggressiveness they face from the perpetrator,"" Koss said. ""If people think it through, you don't normally have someone step on your foot and in response stab them, but this is what this law would suggest is going to work in campus rape situations."" Newbern, a military veteran and recent Ohio State University graduate, said laws forbidding campus guns give offenders the upper hand by removing the possibility that victims could be armed. ""My question is, who are you to limit someone's ability based on what you think they are and are not capable of doing?"" Newbern said.Know Your IX issued an open letter, distributed last week by Everytown for Gun Safety, demanding apologies from Nevada Assemblywoman Michele Fiore (R) and Baxley of Florida for comments the activists say blame rape victims for not having guns. Neither Fiore nor Baxley, both recipients of NRA endorsements and donations, responded to multiple requests for comment.""We're able to step back and see this is just the next way the gun lobby is injecting fear into Americans to make them think we need to have guns everywhere used by everyone,"" Soto Lamb said.NRA-Backed Lawmakers Pushing For Guns On Campus This Year:"

Or even worse, they can't stand each other and refuse to collaborate. But you still need their skills...Last year we were hired by a CEO to assist his executive team with the goal of improving their collaboration. At the first meeting the CEO told us that the members of the team were very skilled, but they were not effective at all when it came to the way they worked together. The reason was that several of them refused to collaborate. And by now the situation had escalated to total misery. It was difficult to meet in the same room at the same time. Even going out for dinner to celebrate their wins was totally out of the question. No wonder the CEO was a little stressed about the situation.  It would be easy to conclude that the CEO had done a bad job when choosing his team members because of their somewhat obvious lack of social skills. But that is too simple an explanation. It did not start out like this. The situation developed over time. What the CEO was most guilty of was not acting earlier.But when we got our chance to address the issue, we knew exactly where to start.We'll share the tips we gave the CEO because most of us need this reminder to lead a good team. No matter if we run a smooth or mal-functioning team. Just remember these three factors, and you will come a long way.You're in charge: No matter what it feels like, or what the other members of the team think, it is always YOU who define what you expect of your team. Of course, feel free to involve them in the process and get input on what they'd like. But it is you who hold the final say. That's your job. Remind them about this, and let them know that you are up for some changes because you are not satisfied with status quo.""You can dislike a person, but still trust her. However it is hard to like someone you do not trust.""That's it. If you do this we promise that your team will be in better shape and find common ground. But there's one thing left for the magic three factors to work:Now you just need to practice, practice, practice A strong team does not materialize overnight. Every team, no matter how team-oriented each member is, needs to practice on working together. The more matters you solve together, the better you get. Avoid executive meetings where the only thing you do is just do updating and reporting. Bring in a challenge or two, and work on how to solve it together. Not only does this build a stronger team, but it also brings you forward, and often it ends up being quite... (you'll never guess) FUN!Final note: You should know that even if though this was an extreme case, we do see executive teams like this all the time. It is not because they do not like each other, but because they do not use the full potential of their collective powers. They meet on a regular basis, and spend their time reporting things to each other, and at best get some new action points assigned.The executive team is not just a group of people. It is a highly skilled, trained, and experienced collection of individuals that TOGETHER create a powerful force for the company. Make sure you utilize this power for the greater good.This blog post is also published in the blog LeadershipCourageFun.

The world has changed. Content related to global unemployment, terrorism, climate change, disease, and so many other critical global issues inundates our digital devices 24/7. The way we produce communications and the speed at which we can reach global audiences have dramatically changed:Our children must know the world. Here's a framework to make that happen. http://globalcompetencecertificate.org/ #globaledchat @WorldSavvy @AsiaSocietyPGLBeing Global is my new series which will explore the challenges we face and some of the innovative initiatives in the works from education systems and commerce around the world at the forefront of this crucial movement to support teaching and learning for global competence.THE GLOBAL COMPETENCE CERTIFICATE (GCC) is a new online, graduate-level certificate program in global competence education for in-service educators developed by Teachers College, Columbia University, World Savvy, and the Asia Society. GCC was designed to increase the number of K-12 teachers who are able to teach for global competence. The Global Search for Education welcomes today Bill Gaudelli (Teachers College, Columbia University), Dana Mortenson (World Savvy), and Jessica Kehayes (Asia Society) to discuss this unique, fascinating initiative. ""GCC courses include a variety of activities that encourage collaboration with colleagues, co-development of work products, dialoging across and about difference, inquiring into complex subject matters that defy facile explanation, experiencing life in another part of the world and working with colleagues to translate all of this into their classroom teaching."" - Gaudelli/MortensenJessica - Increasing respect is being given to global readiness. Why now?Education is affected by the same trends we see in business, government and our day-to-day lives: rapid technological advances, increasing interconnectivity, higher levels of diversity, and greater levels of uncertainty in how to handle complex problems. As these trends increase, there is more pressure for the education sector to respond at all levels - this includes a recognition that we must engage with the world in order to better prepare students.Additionally, as concerns about inequality continue to rise, there is growing appreciation for global readiness. We are hearing a growing call from the international community for education goals related to access, quality, and relevance to be addressed simultaneously, not sequentially, to catalyze upward mobility and provide every child with the skills to address global challenges and spark innovation. Bill and Dana - How do you rate the capabilities of today's teachers in teaching global competence? Decades ago, teachers were chiefly responsible for delivering all content - often acting as the sole arbiter of knowledge dissemination in the classroom. Today, students can access content and information online instantaneously while shaping the media with which they interact. Young people are both consumers and producers of information forcing a change in the role of teacher, from guru to guide. Teachers need to be expert facilitators to help students examine, critique and synthesize information, while developing meaningful connections to their lives. All of this is happening in a considerably more global, interconnected world, which requires a different kind of preparation for young people - critical and creative thinking, empathy, comfort with ambiguity and willingness to change. This profound shift requires a new set of skills and dispositions for educators as well. Since this has not traditionally been a focus of teacher education programs, there is a considerable need for learning programs like the GCC.  ""The structure of the GCC - through technology - allows teachers to build both human and social capital, while building a community of educators who can continue to support one another long after the program concludes."" - Gaudelli/MortensonWhat are the key teaching gaps that need to be addressed? How do teachers in the US rate compared with their European and Asian counterparts? Teachers everywhere increasingly face the same challenges; maneuvering in a new media-rich, information-saturated environment that requires a thoughtful approach to inquiry. While there are no cross-regional metrics of teacher quality that directly respond to this question, differences that do exist often relate to the amount of professional development afforded educators to support their ongoing intellectual growth. The intensity of effort in teaching multiple sections and large class-sizes suggests a need for system-change that repositions teachers as co-learners and collaborators with their students and colleagues. Such a change is considerable given the deep grove of an industrial mode of schooling that is increasingly outdated and unworkable. What are the key elements or drivers of your program that are intended to address the needs?GCC courses include a variety of activities that encourage collaboration with colleagues, co-development of work products, dialoging across and about difference, inquiring into complex subject matter that defy facile explanation, experiencing life in another part of the world and working with colleagues to translate all of this into their classroom teaching. These pedagogical models are all aimed at developing 21st Century skills by allowing teachers to experience their learning about the world so that they can do the same for and with their students. How large a role will technology play in realizing these goals? Technology allows teachers in the GCC to access instructors - academics and practitioners - who are the top in their field, from a wide range of disciplines and backgrounds. It also allows teachers from across the country and globe to come together to learn and work collaboratively, and learn from one another, despite geographic distance. Technology also allows these students to build and share portfolios that track their progress and learning over the course of 15 months, allowing for ongoing reflection throughout the program. The structure of the GCC - through technology - allows teachers to build both human and social capital, while building a community of educators who can continue to support one another long after the program concludes. ""So often - regardless of where students are from - they tend to stay in their neighborhoods, and in groups that are known and familiar to them. Opportunities that allow students to work together, sharing perspectives and solving problems across those divides, are invaluable to build global competence.""  - Gaudelli/Mortenson In addition to classroom teaching, what other learning experiences would be valuable for K-12 students to develop global competence?  For students today to build global competence, classroom learning that allows them to take ownership over their learning and make content relevant to the real world is critical. Tackling complexity in the classroom, working in teams, and learning to identify and consider multiple perspectives are also key. Beyond that, students who have opportunities to expand their learning through exposure to new experiences that stretch their cultural boundaries - like travel and service learning - can be transformational for young people. These are such important chances to take what they learn in the classroom and to see and apply it in the real world, and understand how to navigate change and unfamiliar situations. What do you think are the best ways to expose students to global cultures and make them comfortable and capable in those environments? Global travel can have a profound impact on students, but so can exposure to new cultures, communities and groups of people within students' home communities. The demographics of the US are changing so rapidly that in this country, so many locales are 'global' now, offering opportunities to learn and explore with peers from a diverse range of ethnic and cultural backgrounds. So often - regardless of where students are from - they tend to stay in their neighborhoods, and in groups that are known and familiar to them. Opportunities that allow students to work together, sharing perspectives and solving problems across those divides, are invaluable to build global competence.Jessica - Where does your program fit or compliment the other global programs currently available for students, e.g. the International Baccalaureate?Asia Society supports and promotes globally-focused education, including the learning of world languages, as well as cultivates opportunities to learn from innovations in education around the world. We work collaboratively with many partners to help all students graduate globally competent and ready for college and careers. In addition to our initiatives, Asia Society uniquely serves as a platform for dialogue and has devoted considerable effort to raising awareness and building thought leadership in the global education field, including advancing a definition of global competence (which was created with CCSSO and formally adopted by the US Department of Education) and leading numerous networks to connect and collaborate across the field and advance learning for all students.
