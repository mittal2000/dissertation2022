But public opinion on the meaning of the symbols of the Confederacy remains divided along racial and regional lines, part of a larger disagreement over the significance of the Civil War revealed in multiple polls over the last quarter-century. From the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research archives:A divisive symbolA 1991 poll of Southerners was the first to ask what the Confederate flag symbolized to the public. The vast majority of whites thought that the flag was a symbol of Southern pride, while a majority of blacks thought it was a symbol of racism. A national poll the following year found that 69% of all Americans also saw a symbol of Southern pride. A 1994 Harris poll asked if Georgia and Mississippi should change their flags to remove the confederate flag. Only 21% of the country thought they should, while 63% thought they should not. In 2000, South Carolina's display of the Confederate flag at the Capitol drew a boycott from the NAACP. Legislators removed the flag from atop the Capitol dome, only to place it elsewhere on the Statehouse grounds. In a CBS News poll at the time, 45% of the public thought the Confederate flag should be removed from the South Carolina State Capitol building, while 42% thought it should remain. While the public was nearly evenly divided on what should be done, a strong majority agreed they did not want this issue to become part of the presidential election campaign - 64% in an NBC/WSJ poll said that candidates should not take a position. In 2011, a Pew poll found that just 9% of the country had a positive reaction to seeing the Confederate flag, while 30% had a negative one, and 58% had neither. Among those respondents who considered themselves to be Southerners, 18% had a positive reaction and 19% a negative one. Fourteen percent of Southerners displayed the Confederate flag in their home or office or on their car or clothing.A CNN/ORC poll conducted after the June 17, 2015 shooting deaths of nine black Americans in Charleston found that national perceptions of the meaning of the Confederate flag had not changed since the question was last asked in 2000. Fifty-seven percent of the country saw the flag as a symbol of Southern pride, including 66% of all whites and 75% of Southern whites. But 72% of blacks saw a symbol of racism. Blacks and whites also disagreed on the actions that should be taken regarding the Confederate flag and other monuments to the Confederacy. Americans' understanding of the Civil WarIn 2011, the 150th anniversary of beginning of the Civil War, a number of polling organizations asked Americans about the roots of the conflict. Question wordings which offered the options of states' rights or slavery as the main cause found pluralities choosing states' rights over slavery; for example, Pew found 38% saying that the main cause of the Civil War was slavery and 48% saying states' rights. Self-identified Southerners were no more likely to say states' rights than others, and blacks were only a little more likely than whites to say slavery (46%) rather than states' rights (39%). Slightly different results were found in a CNN/ORC poll that asked if the main reason that the South seceded was ""because they wanted slavery to remain legal in their states."" Fifty-four percent agreed; 42% said it was not.In the same CNN/ORC poll, 67% of the country said they sympathized more with the Union in the Civil War. Nearly one-quarter of Americans (23%) said they sympathized more with the Confederacy. Sympathy for the Confederacy was higher in the South (36%) than in the West (11%) or Northeast (13%). Polls have also found significant positive feelings for the leaders of the Confederacy. In a 1997 Time/CNN/Yankelovich poll, half of the country said they considered Robert E. Lee to be a hero, while 27% said he was not, and 19% were not familiar enough with him to say. Half of the country in a 2001 Gallup/CNN/USA Today poll thought it was appropriate for public officials to praise the leaders of the Confederate States during the Civil War. However, when Pew updated this question in 2011, the proportion saying so had dropped to 36%. Among self-described Southerners, 46% thought so. In the 2011 CNN/ORC poll, 41% of Americans said they had a great deal of admiration for the leaders of the northern states during the Civil War, and 40% had some. A lower proportion of 19% said they had a great deal of admiration for Southern leaders, but 43% said they had some.Don't know much about history?Several polls from the nineties found that some Americans were not particularly knowledgeable about the Civil War. In 1998 the Public Agenda Foundation asked parents of public school students whether they could explain the causes of the Civil War to their child; 65% said they could do so immediately, while a third said they would feel more comfortable if they looked it up first.

Continuing importance of the Civil WarIn the 2011 Pew poll, a slim majority of 56% said that the Civil War was still relevant to American politics and public life today, while a substantial minority of 39% said that it was important only historically and had little relevance today.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) plans to block President <a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/barack-obama"">Barack Obama</a>'s nominees to the State Department to protest the Iran nuclear deal.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55a936e41300002c0093a256.jpeg?ops=crop_89_6_2858_1738%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) says he will block all of President Barack Obama's nominees to the State Department -- there are about 40 ambassadors in the queue -- in protest of the nuclear deal that the U.S. and other world powers struck with Iran this week.In a Thursday letter to the president, Cruz says he wants written assurances that Obama will do whatever it takes to prevent the U.N. Security Council from voting on the Iran deal before Congress finishes its 60-day review of the agreement. The council has already scheduled a Monday vote on a resolution endorsing the deal.""Until you provide such assurances, I intend to block all nominees for the Department of State and hold any legislation that reauthorizes funds for the Department of State,"" says Cruz, who is a candidate for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.If Cruz's threat to block nominees sounds familiar, it's because it is. It's become his go-to form of protest for Obama policies he doesn't like.In June 2013, he vowed to block all State Department nominees until Obama nominated a Inspector General to the agency, citing widespread mismanagement. In July 2014, he again threatened to block all State Department nominees until the administration explained its decision to halt flights to Israel for a day and a half -- a decision made after a Hamas rocket struck close to the Tel Aviv airport. Early this year, Cruz urged Senate Republicans to block confirmation of attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch in protest of Obama's executive action on immigration. That was after he called on incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in November to block every single executive and judicial nominee until Obama agreed to reverse his executive action.Despite his strategy of going after nominees, Cruz's efforts to sideline Obama's agenda haven't really panned out. Lynch was confirmed in April and Obama has stood by his immigration action, although it's tied up in courts right now.A Cruz spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on how blocking State Department nominees could lead the U.N. to delay its vote on the Iran deal, which is the result of two years of international negotiations. A White House aide did not respond to a request for comment. However, White House spokesman Eric Schultz said Thursday that he doesn't understand why some lawmakers are upset about the U.N. moving forward before Congress does.""We have committed to engaging with Congress in their 60-day review period,"" Schultz said in a press gaggle. ""That is why, even before the President spoke with all of you Tuesday morning, he spoke with the four leaders of Congress both in the House and the Senate and to both parties. That is why the Vice President went up to Capitol Hill yesterday to brief members of Congress.""And that’s why I believe three key Cabinet Secretaries -- Secretary Moniz, Secretary Kerry, and Secretary Lew -- will be up in front of Congress testifying next week,"" Schultz added."

5,HEALTHY LIVING,Seattle's Polio Vaccination Rate Is Lower Than Many Developing Countries,Erin Schumaker,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/seattle-parents-arent-vaccinating-their-kids-against-polio_us_55a7fd63e4b04740a3df4b39,We were smarter in the '90s.,2015-07-17,"BERLIN, GERMANY - FEBRUARY 26: A children's doctor injects a vaccine against measles, rubella, mumps and chicken pox to an infant on February 26, 2015 in Berlin, Germany. The city of Berlin is facing an outbreak of measles that in recent weeks has led to over 700 cases and one confirmed death of a little boy who had not been vaccinated. Vaccination in Germany is not compulsory by law though the vast majority of parents have their children vaccinated. (Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55a82b321900002600b86dab.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"While the United States' polio vaccination rate among 1-year-olds sits around 93 percent, Seattle's rate is in free fall: Currently, only 81.4 percent of kindergartens are vaccinated against the disease. In fact, Seattle's polio immunization rate is lower than Zimbabwe's, Rwanda's, El Salvador's and Yemen's, according to the World Health Organization. And despite a recent poll showing that parents' perceptions of vaccines are improving across the country, in Washington State, increased approval hasn't translated into action. Many parents, especially educated ones, are choosing not to vaccinate. ""If you look at a line on graph for all of Washington, for how many kids are fully vaccinated, it's dropping precipitously since 1998,"" Isolde Raftery, the online editor for Seattle's KUOW radio station, said on air this week.Low vaccination rates are a problem because herd immunity, meaning the critical number of individuals who need to be vaccinated for the community at large to be protected, drops off when less than 95 percent of the population is immunized. When that number falls below 95 percent, babies who are too young to be vaccinated and people who can't safely receive vaccines, such as those with comprised immune systems, are at risk. While 95 percent of Washington State kindergartens were vaccinated against polio in 1998, only 88 percent were immunized against the disease this year, according to KUOW.Polio is not a trivial disease. It's highly infectious and can cause difficulty breathing, and in severe forms, paralysis and death. But because the last naturally occurring case of polio in the U.S. happened back in 1979, young parents, who don't remember the epidemic outbreaks of the disease in the 1940s and 50s, are more cavalier about vaccination than their parents or grandparents were, according to the CDC. As for Washington State, new public health messaging or vaccinate mandates, like the one California's Gov. Jerry Brown signed in June, may be in order. ""If the state wants people to be vaccinated, doctors and nurses need to come up with a better way of talking about immunization,"" Raftery said. ""They set it up like a choice. And if it's a choice, then you're going to have people not choosing to get their kids immunized."""

On this issue, we must lead with our progressive values to rebuild the American Dream.”O'Malley's campaign released the statement shortly after Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton, at a town hall event in New Hampshire, declined to say whether she would support a $15 national minimum wage. Clinton told BuzzFeed on Thursday that she supports raising the minimum wage and is working with Democratic lawmakers on an increase. But she said she was unsure whether the U.S. should implement a $15 minimum wage.“I think part of the reason that the Congress and very strong Democratic supporters of increasing the minimum wage are trying to debate and determine what’s the national floor is because there are different economic environments,"" Clinton said. ""And what you can do in LA or in New York may not work in other places.” The Los Angeles City Council voted in May to increase the minimum wage in the city to $15 by 2020, making it the largest U.S. city to take that step. Seattle and San Francisco also have approved $15 minimum wages, and a board commissioned by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) this month began considering the possibility of a $15 minimum wage for New York fast food workers. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) has proposed a $15 minimum wage by 2019, but it hasn't been approved by the state legislature.Thursday’s statement was O'Malley's first formal declaration of his stance on the minimum wage since announcing his candidacy. He said in April, before formally declaring his candidacy, that he supported a $15 minimum wage. As governor of Maryland, he authorized increasing the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 an hour. Clinton has said she supports a $15 minimum wage in large metropolitan areas, where the cost of living is higher. In June, she contacted organizers from the “Fight for 15” group, which has advocated for a $15 wage nationally.“We need more cities and states to follow the lead of Los Angeles, St. Louis, and New York,” Clinton told the organizers.Clinton’s position on the minimum wage also sets her apart from her closest opponent in the polls, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has championed a $15 minimum wage and other progressive economic policies.Both Sanders and O’Malley trail Clinton in national Democratic polling, but Sanders has captured a groundswell of support from the party’s progressive wing and is inching closer to Clinton in Iowa and New Hampshire.This article has been updated to note that O'Malley said before declaring his candidacy that he supports a $15 minimum wage."

(Photo by Joel Ryan/Invision/AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Canada, a nation whose border security has been known to deprive residents of quality hip-hop acts, has now taken a stance against perhaps the biggest rapper of them all: Kanye West.  Early Wednesday morning, Minnesota Timberwolves forward and Toronto native Anthony Bennett told the world that Kanye West would be playing at the closing ceremony of the 2015 Pan Am Games in Toronto on July 26. By that afternoon, the news was confirmed. And soon enough, there was a Change.org petition demanding his removal from the closing ceremony's bill because, well, Kanye's not Canadian. The petition had already racked up over 35,000 signatures by early Friday morning. Canadians (and perhaps people of other nationalities) really don't want Kanye to perform. Even Toronto Mayor John Tory has objected, telling reporters at a Wednesday press conference that he wished the artist chosen to headline the ceremony had ""been a Canadian."" Protestors would like to see a Torontonian or Canadian perform (Drake, The Weeknd and deadmau5 were suggested as replacements).""Why was a local artist or group not chosen and supported, just as our local athletes are throughout the games?"" asked Allen Simans, the creator of the Change.org petition.But let's take a step back. If the games, which are held every four years as an ""Olympics of the Americas,"" were the ""Canadian Games,"" then protesters would have an argument. But the Pan Am games are, well, just that: Pan-American. Kanye is American. This works. So too is Pitbull, a Cuban-American musical act on the bill with Kanye. Both Americans will perform at the Closing Ceremony, but Pitbull is cool to cross and Kanye's not? Get it together, Canada. Kanye's great and American and you're great and geographically above the United States. The Pan Am games are for all residents of the Americas -- not just Torontonians. What's really going on here? Why do thousands of Canadians hate Kanye? His seminal album, 808s & Heartbreak, is the only reason Drake exists to begin with. Shouldn't they be welcoming the father of their hip-hop messiah with open arms and fresh poutine? Kanye West performs at Glastonbury on June 28.Other copycat petitions have peeled back stronger feelings of resentment towards Kanye. One petition writes, ""Kanye West is an American singer, rapper, songwriter and husband to Kim Kardashian ... I believe his moral and ethical compass is not aligned with values that most Canadians adhere to.""Another provided a truly non-sensical, but equally revealing reason: ""Because it's Kanye West ... Have you heard him? The Universe 'can't even' with this guy.""Ah, now we're getting somewhere. It's not just that Kanye's not Canadian -- it's that some Canadians flat-out don't like the guy. There's no separation of the art from the artist being processed here, which is problematic, especially when we're talking about one of the greatest artists of the century. Canada, let's make this work. "

Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas gestures as he speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Feb. 27, 2013, to explain what border communities are asking for in the context of immigration reform.

Beto O'Rourke (D-Texas) wanted to see for himself how veterans in his district are faring with health care they receive through the Department of Veterans Affairs, so he tried something different: He funded a survey himself. A year later, he did it again.More than 1,100 El Paso veterans participated in this year's study, which O'Rourke paid for with money from his congressional office's annual budget. The results were mostly disappointing. Veterans said they waited an average of 77 days to see a doctor, and 64 days to see a mental health provider. Worse, 34 percent said they weren't able to get an appointment with a mental health provider at all.But one detail in particular caught O'Rourke by surprise: Eighty-two percent said they didn't care whether they got their health care through the VA or from within the community, as long as it was timely.""That breaks with my assumption that veterans want their care in the VA,"" he told The Huffington Post. It turns out they really just ""want to be seen somewhere.""The finding has forced O'Rourke to rethink his approach to veterans' health care. Democrats tend to resist calls to fund treatment outside the government system, worried it could lead to privatization of the VA, a longtime goal of conservatives who see the agency as the single-payer system of their nightmares.The Texas Democrat clarified that he is ""absolutely not"" in favor of privatization, but said he has arrived at a ""politically uncomfortable"" conclusion. Despite the additional billions of dollars Congress has pumped into the system, along with a recent change in leadership, it may be time for veterans to start getting at least some of their care outside of the VA. ""I reached the conclusion that there must a be a fundamental problem with the structure and system at the VA,"" he said. ""We can't just continue to spend more money on the same system moving in the same direction and expect a different result.""O'Rourke pointed specifically to the fact that it takes more than two months for many veterans to even get a mental health care appointment.""It is possible to connect that denial of care to veteran suicides in El Paso,"" he said, noting that 22 veterans take their own lives every day in the U.S. ""I know that number would be smaller if we had that capacity to see every veteran who had that mental health issue.""There's no easy solution, but O'Rourke says the data he's collected from his surveys is hugely helpful. Other members of Congress, he notes, have asked him how they can replicate his study in their districts. He responded by introducing the Ask Veterans Act, which would require the VA Secretary to pay for an independent third party to annually survey veterans on their access to care. The bill has bipartisan support and even cleared the House Veterans Affairs Committee last year. It hasn't moved in this Congress, though.""It is not currently scheduled for markup, but that doesn’t mean it won’t be considered eventually,"" said a committee aide.For now, O'Rourke is still mulling ideas for how to get veterans the care they need from sources other than the VA. ""What we should be looking for is a solution … that capitalizes on more of the community capacity that's there,"" he said."

Chris Christie (R) went after the failure of ""liberal policies"" Thursday during a speech on criminal justice, saying they failed to prevent the death of Kevin Sutherland, a 24-year-old who was murdered on the Washington, D.C. metro on July 4.The reference to Sutherland's death left Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.) disgusted. Sutherland was an intern for Himes in late 2013, and the congressman said in a statement Friday that he deserved better than to be used for partisan shots. ""Kevin Sutherland was a friend of mine,"" said Himes. ""He was an intern on my campaign and in my Congressional office. I am friends with his parents. By speaking about Kevin Sutherland and his family in this way, Christie has once again shown himself nothing more than a pure opportunist with no sense of decency and a severely distorted idea of right and wrong.""""To use Kevin's death to score political points is vile. Kevin was empathetic, kind, and wanted to create a better America and world by lifting up those around him,"" he added. Christie, a 2016 presidential candidate, said in his remarks that it was important to ""focus on keeping dangerous and violent offenders behind bars"" in order to keep the streets of America safe, citing his time as a U.S. attorney.""And lately we've seen what happens instead when you don't have that focus,"" said Christie.""On July 4, Kevin Sutherland got on to a subway train in Washington, D.C. Kevin was a bright young man with a promising future, a former congressional intern,"" he said. ""And now all his parents can do is mourn. Because Kevin was stabbed to death on that train -- right in front of people -- by a man who had been arrested just two days earlier for violent robbery.""Jasper Spires, the suspected murderer, was freed after that arrest while awaiting trial. He has now been charged with first-degree murder for killing Sutherland.""Well here's a question I want to ask all those mayors and defenders of a broken system,"" said Christie. ""How much compassion did liberal policies show for the families of Kevin Sutherland and Kathryn Steinle?""Steinle, 32, was fatally shot on July 1 in San Francisco, allegedly by an undocumented immigrant with seven felony convictions who had been deported five times. Her murder prompted both Republican and Democratic politicians to question the policies of sanctuary cities, which limit their cooperation with federal immigration officials. ""The fearmongering and thinly veiled racism evident in Christie's speech reveal that he knew nothing about Kevin and his family or what they believed in, and he should be ashamed. Although, at this point, I find myself doubting if shame is something he’s capable of,"" said Himes in his Friday statement. The congressman also said Christie was being hypocritical in his criticism of San Francisco and Washington, D.C., saying the governor has ""slashed state aid to cities, cut funding for neighborhood revitalization, called for the elimination of Urban Enterprise Zones, and led a budget that has caused police layoffs.""""If Christie wants to spout his particular brand of hate-filled nonsense to whomever is unfortunate enough to be in earshot, that's his right,"" added Himes. ""But when he uses the memory of a beloved friend and son in such a grossly disrespectful way, it's our duty to stop listening, move on to more serious topics and people, and continue the work that Kevin believed in.""Christie's campaign did not return a request for additional comment.On July 8, Himes paid his respects to Sutherland on the House floor.UPDATE: 4:39p.m. -- Sutherland's parents also criticized Christie Friday. ""The fact that Gov. Chris Christie would invoke my son's name in a politically motivated speech just three days after our family laid him to rest shows that he cares little about the grief my family is feeling,"" said Douglas and Terry Sutherland in a statement to Hearst Connecticut Media. Devon Puglia, spokesman for Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy (D), said the governor was ""disappointed"" with Christie's remarks as well. ""We’re very disappointed that Governor Christie would choose to politicize the death of this young man -- to make an intellectually backwards point, no less -- at a time when important conversations nationwide about criminal justice reform are taking place,"" said Puglia. UPDATE: 7/18 -- On Friday, Christie shrugged off the Sutherland family's criticism of his remarks: ""I was using that as an example, and an appropriate example, of the problems that we have in our country. No, I don't agree with that, with all due respect to them."""

The resolution passed unanimously.One of the main buildings on campus is named for Tillman, a white supremacist who openly advocated and celebrated the killing of black people, and who was also a founding trustee of the university. His nickname was ""Pitchfork Ben,"" and he served as both a South Carolina governor and U.S. senator. The ""views of Benjamin Tillman are repugnant to our values and our fundamental purpose,"" the trustees' resolution states. It goes on to call for a task force of students, staff, faculty and alumni to determine ""how to best preserve and tell the complete history of Clemson.""Tillman is considered instrumental in founding Clemson University as a late 19th-century politician. Clemson is named for Thomas G. Clemson, son-in-law of John C. Calhoun. In his will, Clemson named Tillman as a lifetime trustee for the school.However, the Board of Trustees' resolution conceded that ""recent events in our state and nationally have prompted concerns,"" including from Clemson faculty leaders. The resolution stated:Benjamin Tillman was also known to be by his own admission an ardent racist and led a campaign of terror against African Americans in South Carolina that included intimidation and violence of which he boasted about publicly; and For some members of our university family Benjamin Tillman’s legacy included not only contributions to Clemson University but also oppression, terror and hate.A state law known as the Heritage Act prevents the university from renaming the building without a vote of two-thirds of the legislature. ""Understanding and communicating the full story of Clemson's history is an important part of creating a more inclusive and welcoming campus environment,"" Clemson President Jim Clements said in a statement Friday. ""To further support that effort, as part of a comprehensive diversity plan, we will also initiate a process to create a series of historical markers to recognize the history of African Americans, Native Americans and women on land that later became our campus.""Tyler Kingkade covers higher education for The Huffington Post and is based in New York.
