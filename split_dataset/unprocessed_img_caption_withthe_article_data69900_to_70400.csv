Arenas’ Instagram posts claimed that many WNBA players are “ugly chicks,” and suggested that they compete in virtually no clothing to entice more people to watch their games. WNBA players weren't having it, declaring that Arenas' remarks exemplify the sexism that female athletes are subjected to on a regular basis that their male counterparts never even have to consider.  Swin Cash, three-time WNBA champion (2003, 2006, 2010)Elena Delle Donne, WNBA MVP (2015) Candace Parker, two-time WNBA MVP (2008, 2013)Mistie Bass, WNBA champion (2014) Well, I think what he said was sexist and I’m not ugly. I know that, and I don’t need him to tell me I’m not. But I honestly think he should be a lot more concerned about what example he’s setting. I think he needs to really realize that his words do hold some weight. We don’t go watch men play in Speedos, that’s not what we’re looking for -- we’re looking for awesome dunks, great passes, we’re looking for a show. And the kind of show he wants us to be out there doing is not getting us the attention that we want. We want people who enjoy what we’re trying to do. Stefanie Dolson, WNBA All-Star (2015) Ivory Latta, two-time WNBA All-Star (2013, 2014)They are, of course, completely correct. Arenas’ comments make all the more evident the double standard that still rages on in sports today. NBA players would never be asked to strip down on national TV to more fully engage their audience. These WNBA stars are some of the most skilled athletes in the world. It’s time we start treating them as such.Also on HuffPost:"

Bernie Sanders' (I-Vt.) Democratic presidential bid on Thursday, in the organization's first presidential primary endorsement since former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean (D) founded it in 2004.  Sanders earned the endorsement after receiving 87.9 percent of the 271,527 votes cast by DFA members nationwide over a nine-day voting period. No Democratic candidate was able to clear the 66.7 percent supermajority needed to earn the DFA endorsement ahead of the 2008 presidential election.“Bernie Sanders is an unyielding populist progressive who decisively won Democracy for America members’ first presidential primary endorsement because of his lifelong commitment to taking on income inequality and the wealthy and powerful interests who are responsible for it,"" Charles Chamberlain, the group's executive director, said in a statement. “Throughout his campaign, Bernie has repeatedly said that the huge problems of income inequality, money in politics, and structural racism that our country must confront are bigger than a single campaign -- they need a political revolution."" The group, which claims 1 million members, says it has ""knocked on hundreds of thousands of doors, made over 11 million phone calls, and raised and contributed more than $32.7 million to help elect 843 progressive candidates nationwide"" since its founding. It said it would run a positive campaign on Sanders' behalf, rather than attack his rivals for the nomination.“DFA’s tireless focus on bringing people together through grassroots organizing is the best way we can fight back against the billionaires and oligarchs who have rigged our economy,"" Sanders said in a statement. ""I also want to congratulate DFA for its principled support for grassroots democracy and for its internal democratic process. It is no secret that the founder of DFA -- my friend and fellow Vermonter former Gov. Howard Dean -- has chosen not to support my candidacy. Yet the leadership of DFA allowed a fair and free vote to take place which we won. That's pretty impressive.""All three of the Democratic candidates sent pitches to DFA's members asking for their vote before the announcement. Notably, Hillary Clinton's email to DFA's list was sent from her and Dean, who endorsed her last year. DFA and MoveOn.org tried until June to draft Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) into the Democratic primary. At that time, it finally became clear to the groups that Warren would not run and that progressive voters were connecting with Sanders' campaign. The endorsement was Sanders' second on Thursday. Earlier in the day, the 700,000-strong Communications Workers of America union endorsed his campaign. The vast majority of the nation's other major unions, including the American Federation of Teachers, the Service Employees International Union and American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, have endorsed Clinton. The Working Families Party endorsed Sanders last week. However, MoveOn.org and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, two other progressive groups which do similar work to DFA, have not yet indicated whether they will endorse in the primary.This article has been updated to include comment from Bernie Sanders.

Inspired by the same series of debunked undercover videos that the Planned Parenthood shooter, Robert Dear, cited as his motive, GOP leaders in the House established a select committee with the sole purpose of investigating the abortion practices of Planned Parenthood. The videos purport to show doctors discussing the sale of fetal parts for profit -- a claim that has inspired much inflammatory rhetoric from Republican politicians -- but so far, a federal investigation and multiple state investigations into the women's heath care provider have turned up no evidence of wrongdoing. Since the Colorado shooting, which left three dead, Democrats and women's rights advocates have been calling on Republicans in Congress either to drop their investigation into Planned Parenthood or redirect its focus toward increasing threats of violence at women's health clinics. In addition to the high-profile shooting, there have been four lesser-known arsons at Planned Parenthood clinics and numerous death threats to abortion providers in recent months.Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) called on House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to disband the special committee in light of these incidents, suggesting that the anti-Planned Parenthood rhetoric in Congress is contributing to an atmosphere of violent extremism that leaves clinics vulnerable to attacks. “It is time to stop the demonizing and witch hunts against Planned Parenthood, its staff and patients, and the lifesaving health care it provides to millions every day,” she said.The Feminist Majority Foundation, a women's equality nonprofit founded by Gloria Steinem in 1987, launched a campaign on Wednesday urging Congress to investigate the Center for Medical Progress, the anti-abortion group behind the inflammatory videos, and Troy Newman, a prominent anti-abortion activist and CMP board member who has argued that the murder of abortion providers is justified. Ads appearing in major media outlets like Politico and the Washington Post demand, ""When did the right to life become the right to terrorize?"" “The House Select Investigative Panel must call on Newman and other CMP officials to answer questions under oath about how their activities may have contributed to anti-abortion harassment, intimidation, and terrorizing of abortion providers,” FMF President Eleanor Smeal said in a statement.While Republicans have condemned the Planned Parenthood shooting, they have also stood by their efforts to investigate the provider. Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), the leader of the select committee, said in a statement that Democrats should stop ""playing politics with this tragedy."""

Brady, who moved into the Ways and Means slot after Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) left the position to become speaker, said the most important thing for voters to know was that ""this bill prevents their taxes from increasing, helps create more jobs in their communities and makes it easier for them to do their taxes.""But Democrats largely objected to the sweeping tax legislation, which would make the so-called Research and Development tax credit permanent and extend several other tax breaks.""The long-term negative dangers of this legislation make the price too high,"" said the top Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, Sander Levin of Michigan.Levin criticized the bill for not finding a way to replace the revenue the government would lose. He said that the measure would further jeopardize future cuts to other domestic programs as Republicans try to balance the budget by cutting programs.Republicans countered that many of these tax provisions have been around for decades, and they argued that providing longer term extensions would provide more certainty to businesses and families.Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, however, said he had heard this speech from Republicans before.""The certainty of this bill is that we will explode further deficits and provide for disinvestment,"" Hoyer said. ""That's the certainty of this bill.""The Maryland Democrat continued that he did actually support many of the tax provisions in the bill, but he thought Congress ought to do the difficult work of actually paying for the legislation.""This is easy to do,"" he said. ""No courage required to vote for this bill. All you have to do is suspend commonsense.""Of the cuts that made it, here are the largest permanent breaks:Boosting the child tax credit to $3,000: $88 billion.The American Opportunity education credit: $80 billionThe earned income tax credit: $30 billionDeduction for state and local sales taxes: $42 billionThe research and development tax credit: $113 billion""Section 179"" deductions for business expenses: $77 billionActive financing income breaks for keeping foreign earnings offshore: $78 billion Michael McAuliff contributed to this report.Also on HuffPost:"
6,RELIGION,You Can Now Customize Your Loved One's Urn With A 3D Printer,Jaweed Kaleem,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/3d-printing-urns-foreverence_us_5672145ce4b0688701dc4172,What kind of container would you design for your ashes?,2015-12-17,One woman's dying wish was to steal away from her cancer treatments and share a White Castle hamburger with her sister. It was her act of defiance against the struggle of her illness.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/567222aa1f0000dd00e9c019.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Felipe Herrera decided long ago that he wanted his body to be cremated after he died. His family found a creative way to follow through with his wishes.Before the 95-year-old former NASA engineer took his last breath this month, his daughter Yvette Wilson gathered with her son, daughter-in-law and fiancé to surprise Herrera with an urn that was also a 22-inch replica of the space shuttle Columbia. Helping build the original shuttle was one of Herrera's proudest moments.In her father's Temecula, California, home, Wilson asked Herrera to sit down. She covered his eyes with a shirt, then gently lifted it so he could see the gift.“You're not going to leave today or tomorrow, but the day you go, all your cremains will go inside of here, and it will fill this base, and then they'll seal this -- just like this,” she told her dad. She read the inscription on the hollow statue’s base: “Felipe Herrera. STS-Mission Accomplished.”In some families, presenting such a gift might have been uncomfortable or even insulting. Herrera didn't see it that way.“That’s beautiful. … What can I say?” he told the family gathered around him, as Wilson recalled and captured in a video she uploaded to YouTube.The rate of cremations in the United States has doubled in the last 15 years, with the method now being chosen over burial in more than 46 percent of deaths. Seeking a personalized experience at the time of death has become, in some ways, de rigueur for the 2.5 million Americans who die each year and the aging baby boomer population. Caskets now range from plain pine boxes to extravagant final resting places with customized stained wood, elaborate chiseling and velvet interiors, and it’s not unusual to find colorful funerals with upbeat pop music, costumes and even performances. Yet, the options for what to do with ashes have remained slimmer, and urns tend to be more mundane and generic. Many are ceramic, wood or glass vases with two handles and personalized inscriptions or photos.Now, a new startup is using 3D printing to take cremation urns to another level. The Minneapolis-based company Foreverence lets customers request custom-designed urns online that are delivered within 10 days.So far, in addition to Herrera’s spaceship, the company’s dozens of designs have included a red Chevrolet Chevelle (for a sports car fanatic), a battleship (for a former Navy sailor) and even a White Castle hamburger with pickles (for a burger lover, of course).“There is inherent sadness and grief associated with death,” said Foreverence founder and CEO Pete Saari, who works with a team of eight others. “Our mission is to add not only personality, character and individuality to each person's memorial but possibly some relief and joy. If we can replace just a little sadness with just a little joy, then mission accomplished.”Saari came up with the idea after years of working as a 3D-printing consultant who sold technology and services to corporations and medical companies. Foreverence, he said, is also trying to elevate the cremation experience, which has historically been a less costly option than burial.“We are here to dispel a notion put forth by the funeral service industry that people choose cremation for financial reasons. The fact they've chosen cremation does not diminish their desire for something unique, personal and meaningful,” he said.The company’s clients have included families whose loved ones died years ago and whose cremains were stored in urns they didn’t like, as well as people like Wilson, who helped her father plan for his death.“We wanted to share in the memorial process with him,” said Wilson, who is taking the urn this week to her Carlsbad, California, home, which has custom niche for it. “We all sat in silence, blown away by such an amazing completed work of art that so perfectly encapsulates our dad and grandfather. When we saw it, it wasn’t what we thought of urns. It wasn’t, ‘holy cow, there is a dead person.’ It wasn’t sad, it instead felt amazing.” Foreverence has also gotten a celebrity boost.Before it officially launched a little over a year ago, the company's first client was the family of Bob Casale from the famed '80s band Devo. After Casale's death in 2014, Foreverence designed two urns in the shape of the iconic red energy domes band members wore during performances. One was given to Casale's family members in Akron, Ohio, and the other to his relatives in Los Angeles. Each took about nine hours to print. The urns aren’t cheap. While each varies in price and the funeral directors the company typically works with are able to charge their own rates, the one Wilson chose for her father cost around $2,500. The average urn in the U.S. had a price tag of $280 last year, according to the National Funeral Directors Association.“We are definitely a high-priced product compared to [regular] urns. And if you're just looking for a ‘container,’ we're not a good choice,” Saari said.Saari, 49, hasn't given much though to an urn for himself. He's an avid traveler -- his passion for visiting different countries kicked off when he immigrated to the U.S. from Hungary at age 7 -- and wants to commission an artist to design an abstract urn that reflects his various interests, which also include music and theater.Saari said he holds no judgment against those who choose to go a more traditional route with a casket burial, or even choose a more traditional urn design.“We don’t aspire to influence end-of-life decisions around cremation versus burial or one religion versus another,” he said. “We are simply here to help people tell the stories of their lives.”Watch the video of Felipe Herrera's daughter Yvette Wilson and his family presenting him with his Space Shuttle Columbia urn last spring."
7,BUSINESS,Here's How To Get Investors To Save The Planet,Shahien Nasiripour,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/get-investors-to-save-planet_us_5672c8b9e4b0688701dc60a4,A top advisor to big investors says the U.S. needs to tax carbon emissions.,2015-12-17,"“It’s no longer a good business bet to drill in the Arctic or develop tar sands in Canada,"" says Ceres President Mindy Lubber.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"World leaders should tax carbon emissions if they want institutional investors to commit their assets toward clean energy projects, according to a top environmental adviser to U.S. money managers.Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, a nonprofit group that pushes investors to pay attention to the financial risks of climate change, said forecasts of energy-related investments over the next few decades demonstrate why this is important. In a sign of the energy industry's priorities, the sector is forecast to invest more money in oil and gas supply over the next 25 years than in projects that would increase energy efficiency, according to the International Energy Agency.Lubber's call comes as Wall Street looks to capitalize on the growing interest in climate change-focused investments and the Obama administration increases its outreach to the business community in an effort to boost investments in environmental initiatives.Goldman Sachs, the nation's fifth-largest bank by assets, said in a securities filing this week it would launch an exchange-traded fund that would exclude fossil fuel-heavy industries. Meanwhile, the Department of the Interior separately announced the formation of a Natural Resource Investment Center that the White House hopes will spur investments that would eventually reduce water usage by up to 33 percent and annual carbon dioxide emissions by up to 1.5 percent.About 190 governments are forecast to spend $16.5 trillion over the next 15 years, or about $1.1 trillion annually, on clean energy-related technology under pledges made for the recent United Nations climate talks in Paris, the IEA said.Negotiators in Paris agreed to try to reduce pollution to the point that average global temperatures rise no more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, a move President Barack Obama said “sends a powerful signal that the world is firmly committed to a low-carbon future.”But the immense cost is unlikely to be shouldered by governments alone, especially in developed nations like the U.S. that are assuming the costs of aging populations and limited taxpayer resources amid mounting concerns over their debt levels.That’s why Lubber believes policymakers should propose new measures to encourage private sector investors to finance new clean energy-related projects and technologies.“Generally, when there is a need for a new market and a new opportunity, Wall Street can fill it,” she said.The most impactful moves senior policymakers could take, Lubber said, would be to put a price on carbon and increase subsidies to the still-developing clean energy industry.“Investors have been looking for a market signal that the economy is moving to a new direction,” she said. “Putting a price on carbon accomplishes that. It says to investors that the fossil fuel companies won’t prevail.”Estimates from the IEA appear to support Lubber’s central point.Just 15 percent of total investment in global energy supply over the next 25 years will be devoted to renewable energy sources, according to the IEA. Meanwhile, governments around the world gave about $490 billion in subsidies to the fossil fuel industry in 2014 alone.“There are unmistakable signs that the much-needed global energy transition is underway, but not yet at a pace that leads to a lasting reversal of the trend of rising [carbon dioxide] emissions,” the IEA said in a report this year.Lubber said that unless policymakers make investing in clean energy industries more attractive, the energy sector will continue to devote more than half a trillion dollars a year to developing fossil fuel energy sources -- money that could be put to better use by advancing renewable energy projects or increasing the energy efficiency of buildings.In addition to her work for Ceres, Lubber directs the Investor Network on Climate Risk, a group of about 115 institutional investors that collectively manage $13 trillion in assets. This gives her unique insight into the needs of investors who want to back environmentally friendly projects.Investors need to be wary of backing projects that ultimately increase pollution, Lubber said. “Continuing to invest in more fossil fuels is foolhardy at this point,” she said. “It’s no longer a good business bet to drill in the Arctic or develop tar sands in Canada.”Also on HuffPost:"

""We have done a tremendous disservice not only to the Middle East -- we've done a tremendous disservice to humanity. The people that have been killed, the people that have been wiped away, and for what? It's not like we had victory. It's a mess. The Middle East is totally destabilized, a total and complete mess.""Trump's observation isn't uniquely insightful. It's an obvious truth. And during the 2004 campaign, anti-war Democrats had no problem making such criticisms of President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney. Now the Obama administration has overseen seven more years of expensive overseas debacle, yet few of the 2016 candidates from either party are interested in criticizing the entirety of U.S. foreign policy post-9/11. Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq and, as secretary of state, was a key strategist in the removal of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, which created a power vacuum that has fueled violent radical groups.As for the GOP candidates, they're happy to slam President Barack Obama, but far less eager for broader-picture rethinking. The Republicans -- including Trump -- remain virulently hawkish on foreign policy, with the sometime exception of Kentucky Sen.

They divided 16 animals into pairs and designated one dog in each duo as the “donor dog.” ""In the test, the donor dogs used their mouths to pull a string to bring a tray toward a second dog. They could choose either an empty tray or a tray containing a treat on the partner's side,"" the study’s lead researcher, Friederike Range of the Messerli Research Institute, said Wednesday in a press release.What researchers found was that donor dogs were typically willing to throw their counterpart a bone (figuratively and literally), especially if the two dogs already knew each other. Donor dogs that didn’t already know their partners, however, were less inclined.""Prosocial behavior was exhibited less frequently toward unfamiliar dogs than toward familiar ones,"" Range said.Researchers don't think the unfamiliar dog distracting the donor dog played a role in the latter dog's judgment, Range said.""Only rarely did a donor dog interact with the unfamiliar dog,"" he explained.The dogs seemed to understand which string would do what, as the dogs were given the option to feed themselves at the end of each series of tests and generally chose the string attached to the treat. People have long wondered whether the good-natured attitude of most dogs is inherent or if it has developed after years of humans domesticating them, and Range's research provides some insight into this question. ""Dogs and their nearest relatives, the wolves, exhibit social and cooperative behavior, so there are grounds to assume that these animals also behave prosocially toward conspecifics,"" Range said.

The space agency released a photo of the phenomenon Thursday, just in time for the release of the new ""Star Wars"" film.“Science fiction has been an inspiration to generations of scientists and engineers, and the film series Star Wars is no exception,” John Grunsfeld, an astronaut and associate administrator for the NASA Science Mission Directorate, said in a statement. “There is no stronger case for the motivational power of real science than the discoveries that come from the Hubble Space Telescope as it unravels the mysteries of the universe."" Unfortunately for the Rebel Alliance, it's unclear if the twin jets of energy could be harnessed for the purposes of bringing down the Death Star. Unlike a lightsaber, which derives its deadly force from a contained crystal-powered laser, the matter emitted from the nascent star would probably be too hot to handle.NASA explains:When stars form within giant clouds of cool molecular hydrogen, some of the surrounding material collapses under gravity to form a rotating, flattened disk encircling the newborn star. Superheated material spills away and is shot outward from the star in opposite directions along an uncluttered escape route — the star’s rotation axis.The twin jets that make up this particular ""lightsaber"" are known as HH 24.

11,SPORTS,A.J. Green: It's Super Bowl Or Bust For The Bengals,Jordan Schultz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/aj-green-cincinnati-bengals_us_56687e23e4b080eddf569a0e,Cincinnati's superstar receiver desperately wants to change the playoff narrative for his team and his city.,2015-12-16,"Bengals wide receiver A.J. Green ranks fifth in the NFL in receiving this season to go along with eight touchdown catches, and is well on his way to a fifth straight Pro Bowl selection.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/566b196d1900002400789aca.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A.J. Green may only be 27 years old, but the Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver is already on pace for one of the great all-time careers at his position. Green, the fourth overall pick in the 2011 NFL draft out of Georgia, has earned Pro Bowl honors every year of his career, with this year soon to be his fifth. He has amassed at least 1,000 yards in each of his first five seasons, the only player in league history besides Randy Moss to do so. The Huffington Post caught up with Green earlier this month to talk about the maturation process of quarterback Andy Dalton, Georgia's firing of head coach Mark Richt and why it's Super Bowl or bust for his first-place 10-3 Bengals. (N.B.: This interview took place before Dalton fractured his thumb.)This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.How much value do you put into your nutrition on a daily basis? This year I have a personal chef that cooks dinner for me every night. I get three to four massages a week. Cold tub, ice tub -- I think it's very important if you want to play this sport for a long time, and I think this is the recipe for longevity in the league. To be able to take care of your body and recover from week-to-week and still play at a high level.Past the halfway point in the season, how much harder is it for you to stay fresh, and then how much more important does it make those little things?You know, my body feels great. I don't think a lot of people look at this aspect of the game. [Being] mentally fresh [is important] -- you know, we've been in this grind for weeks, and at this point of the season, people's bodies tend to break down, but also their minds ... I think if you keep your mind fresh, your mind tells your body what to do. I think that's what I'm trying to do, actually -- keep my mind fresh or change up my routine a little bit more, just to try something new to not get bored with my same routine.This has a chance to be the best year of your career, and of your quarterback's as well. What have both you and Andy Dalton done differently?I think the biggest [thing] for Andy and I is our communication -- you know, where we talk on and off the field is the biggest thing, and then the attention to detail. Having to be more critical of the detail -- I think that really helps us, because he knows exactly where I'm going to be on the field.With every win the Bengals amass, I would imagine it becomes more of an affirmation that you guys are doing the right things, especially with you and Andy. I don't think people realize how athletic he is outside the pocket. So for you, when he's scrambling, what is the process in breaking your route to help him make a play?Our receiving crew -- we work on that a lot, when Andy gets out of the pocket and he scrambles so we all know our assignment. When Andy was at [Texas Christian University], he ran a lot. He was like the second rusher on the team. So you know he's very athletic outside the pocket. We gotta keep our routes alive and get open somehow.The common view is that he's winning more games with his mind this year. Is that a fair assessment?I think so. I think he has matured more. As an offense, you know, we've been together so long now, going on our fifth year, and like I said, we are just playing good around him. You know, the fault can't just go on one person, and these last couple years in the playoffs, we haven't played good as a team at all -- offense, defense, special teams.You and Andy have lost four consecutive playoff games together. Is that something the team openly discusses?We take each game at a time, man. I think that’s the biggest thing for us this year. Even when we were 8-0, we took it week by week.And that's the message that the coaching staff -- specifically the offensive coordinator, Hue Jackson, and your head coach, Marvin Lewis -- provide this football team?Right, right. We have a special team and [given] our background in the playoff games, I'm pretty sure it's in the back of everybody's mind, but we know the task at hand. That’s why we got to get these games. That’s how we [are going] to have success in the playoffs.With that in mind, what would you deem a successful year? How much do you have to win in the playoffs?I think we have to win the Super Bowl [to be] successful. I think we have a team to do it. I think this is the most talented team I’ve been a part of, the most of these last couple years I’ve been here. I think anything less than that is a disappointment. I think that is the standard we hold to each other.You mentioned that the fans in Cincinnati have embraced you. This is a fan base so desperate for a winner.Yeah, and I think that's deserving of the city. You know, they see the talent that we have and they see the potential that we have to go all the way, and why not? And it's ""why not"" for us. ""Why not"" for the Cincinnati Bengals winning the Super Bowl.When you mentioned the weapons, a healthy tight end in Tyler Eifert obviously with the 12 touchdown catches has been huge. How has Tyler's play in the seams and inside the 20s helped you personally?Oh man, it keeps every defense honest. And with Marvin [Jones], Mo [Mohamed Sanu], and Gio [Bernard] and Jeremy [Hill], and the way Andy's playing, it keeps everybody honest. They can't just take away one weapon, because we have Tyler in the middle, Marvin and Mo outside and inside and Gio and Jeremy in the backfield. So you have to keep it honest when you play us.How much do you judge individual success with the team? I know you're going to say ""winning,"" but I guess I have to hear it from you.Haha, hey man, it's all about winning. My stats will come as we win -- you know, I had the 98 catches or 1,400 yards last season, 11 TDs, so I had those seasons already. But we still didn’t win. So this season I'm still having similar stats and we're winning.Your college coach, Mark Richt, was fired by Georgia, despite a tremendous amount of success over a 15-year period. By all accounts, he is a very classy guy, in the locker room and outside. Give me a sense of Coach Richt. [Note: Richt has since accepted a head coaching position at his alma mater, the University of Miami.]Oh yeah, he definitely is, man. It's very shocking that he left. It's hard to see the University of Georgia without Coach Richt, and it's going to be even harder to see him on [different] sidelines if he decides to ever coach again. So it's gonna be weird. But I support him where he goes, and I support the University of Georgia with the decision.Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com or ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram at @Schultz_Report."

Then, the researchers conducted a statistical analysis of their data and found that humans are the shortest sleepers of all the primates, snoozing for an average of about seven hours a night. Most primates get between 14 and 17 hours of shut-eye. The researchers concluded that humans are able to rest less because they get more rapid-eye-movement, or REM, sleep per hour than do other species. About 25 percent of our time sleeping is spent in this deeper, more relaxed mental state, compared to only 5 percent in other primates. Scientists aren't sure why humans evolved to make the most of sleep. One hypothesis is that the advent of artificial light ""tricked"" our biological clocks into sleeping less, but the researchers think that a shift towards a shorter and more efficient snooze may be linked to humans sleeping on the ground instead of in trees, as our early human ancestors probably did.""Certain prerequisites have to be met in one’s sleep environment to have deep sleep because when you are in it you are less easily aroused, and thus more vulnerable,"" Samson said. ""This vulnerability would have been life threatening in the wild, if not for early humans living in larger groups, controlling fire (which keeps you warm and repels predators small and large) and sleeping consistently on stable, terrestrial sleeping surfaces,"" he added. ""All these elements working together could have removed previous barriers in attaining the kind of high quality sleep humans are characterized by today.""The study was published in the journal Evolutionary Anthropology on Dec. 12.Also on HuffPost:"

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said during Tuesday's GOP debate that they ""understand"" the sentiment behind Donald Trump's proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States, even as the plan has drawn global condemnation. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump called last week for a ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States"" after the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, which authorities are treating as a terrorist attack. The celebrity billionaire has built his candidacy around making inflammatory comments about minority groups -- voicing his support for the surveillance of ""certain mosques,"" among other things -- but this time, he drew criticism from within his own party. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said the idea is ""not what this country stands for,"" and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called religion-based bans ""inconsistent"" with American values.But during the debate, Cruz and Rubio said they related to where Trump was coming from. ""Everyone understands why Donald has suggested what he has,"" Cruz said, later adding, ""I understand why Donald made that proposal."" He pointed to his own legislation, which would suspend refugees from certain countries for three years, as being more narrowly focused. Cruz, who has recently surged in the polls, had previously said he disagreed with Trump's proposal. Rubio said the proposal ""isn't going to happen,"" rather than directly criticizing its merits. In response to a question about how the ""majority"" of Republicans support Trump's idea, he said, ""I understand why they feel that way, because this president hasn't kept us safe."" Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush took a much harsher tone. ""Banning all Muslims will make it harder for us to do exactly what we need to do, which is to destroy ISIS,"" he said. Referencing the Trump ban, Bush's spokesman, Tim Miller, tweeted that ""nobody except Jeb has criticized him"" 30 minutes into the night.That the ban is even being debated before a national audience, however, shows just how much Trump has done to normalize extreme positions on immigration and xenophobia. Bush, who called Trump ""unhinged"" in a tweet earlier this month, said in November that the U.S. should focus on assisting Christian refugees in the Middle East over refugees of other faiths -- a position that might once have been seen as out of the bounds of reasonable political discourse. Retired neurosurgeon and Republican presidential hopeful Ben Carson, who has called Trump's proposal unconstitutional, said last month that it was important to screen Syrian refugees coming to the U.S. ""to determine who the mad dogs are.""Polls have varied widely as to whether Americans support Trump's proposal. But as The Huffington Post’s Ariel Edwards-Levy points out, Americans may be more likely to support a ban on Muslims if they think it will be temporary -- or if they don't have to admit their support out loud to another person.Trump, meanwhile, has not backed down from his remarks. Last week, when defending the plan, he invoked former President Franklin D. Roosevelt's internment camps for people of Japanese descent, which are generally considered a deeply shameful chapter of U.S. history. (Trump added that he did not support internment camps.) He has claimed that his Muslim friends are ""so happy"" he is discussing Islamic extremism -- although he's also acknowledged that they don't support his plan. At the debate, Trump said, ""we're not talking about religion, we're talking about security. Our country is out of control."" See the latest updates on the debate here.Related:Also on HuffPost:"

""I've gained great respect for, in different forms, people on the dais ... I have great respect for the people I've met through this process.""Republicans may remain suspicious of Trump's resolve, since he flirted with the prospect of leaving the party as recently as late November, when he gave a much less definitive answer as to whether he would rule out an independent bid.

Despite spending the holiday season in a whitewashed hospital room in the heart of Oklahoma, Janneh had only one wish this Christmas: to meet local hero Russell Westbrook, the Thunder’s superstar point guard. But when a hospital phone rang on Monday afternoon, no one was expecting to hear that the OKC superstar was in the lobby, eager to meet Janneh. According to ESPN’s Royce Young, Westbrook arrived ""unannounced,"" with no cameras or media there to turn the moment into just another cookie-cutter PR opportunity. “You could tell it wasn't a publicity stunt,"" Melissa Richey, the director of communications at the Children's Center Rehabilitation Hospital, told Young.

""It was really funny between the two of them. Russ was such a great sport and gave it to him back. He didn't hold back with him.

19,POLITICS,Yet Another Plea For Calm About Polling,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/polling-plea-for-calm_us_5671a0c7e4b0648fe301ccf6,"Will this be the last time I have to write this? God, I hope so.",2015-12-16,"Sorry, election polls are basically garbage right now.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5671a135190000240078a0be.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"So, you say you've noticed a poll! Maybe it was a poll in an early primary state. Maybe it was a national poll. Maybe it was a series of head-to-heads in which Hillary Clinton was paired against Marco Rubio in Florida, or Donald Trump was paired against Bernie Sanders in Wisconsin, or Martin O'Malley was paired against a candelabra in the parlor. Did you see the results of that poll? That poll had such results, man! Now you're worried, or confused, or giddy, or your body is so stuffed with endorphins that you might never come down.But you've been burned before! You can remember that time when the fears you felt after reading about a poll did not end up being realized. You have a distinct memory of another time a poll gave you a big old sugar high when you saw the candidate you liked at the top, and the crushing emotions to which you were reduced weeks later, after some nice Midwestern folks said, ""You know what? Nah,"" to the earlier results that made you feel so nummy-yummy warm inside. Why do polls do this to us? Should you believe them? Should all pollsters be pushed out to sea on an ice floe? How many multitudes are contained within the 288 people in New Hampshire called between Dec. 7-10? When angels dance on the head of a pin, what is the margin of error: the number of angels or the size of the pinhead?Ugh. Can you calm down? Let's try all of this again.Is election polling accurate?Sure! It depends, though. How far away was the election date when the poll was conducted? We have some very good political science suggesting that the most accurate presidential polls are those conducted right before an election, and that the further we are from that election, the less accurate the polls get.So, let's see -- we are what, 300 some-odd days out from the election? Okay. Election polls are basically garbage right now, sorry. Polls of the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary are a little better, but still not great. Agh! You're kidding!No, I'm not. It's always been this way and it always will be this way until that blessed day the sun goes supernova and we perish from this earth.If polls aren't accurate, why do pollsters take them?Well, to practice their craft, for one thing. Polling is a fairly meticulous science and pollsters spend a considerable amount of time just calibrating their instruments so they're in peak form when respondents are likely to give salient and predictive responses. Pollsters would have no hope at accurately predicting an election if they just jumped into it late. Imagine if the cast of ""Hamilton"" was asked to perform the musical on the day they all first met. It would be a terrible performance, and you would feel terrible watching it, and you'd tell your friends, ""'Hamilton' was terrible!"" and then ""Hamilton"" would be a huge flop and Lin-Manuel Miranda would have to go work as a government contractor or something and all his wondrous talents would be wasted filing government procurement forms. In the real world, though, that cast got to practice their work for a period of time and it helped make it a success. The only difference is that they had the luxury of practicing privately. Well, why does the media constantly report on the parts of polls that are just inaccurate snapshots?Take your pick. a) The media favors short-attention-span garbage over depth.b) The high demand for short-attention-span garbage is how revenues are raised to fund things that aren't short-attention-span garbage.What if the media just decided to stop publicizing polls?What would happen in that situation is the media would be accused of suppressing information.What's the solution?Calming down and becoming more accepting would be a good start. Short of that, let's recognize that there's more to these early presidential polls than the top line that tells you who's ""winning"" at the moment. Down in the crosstabs is interesting information that can guide both pollsters and campaigns toward greater success. I'm not convinced that polling shouldn't just be phased out, or to some extent discredited. After all, they keep getting things wrong, like the U.K. elections in 2015.Are you British? Because if you're not, I don't see why you need to be so hung up on their elections, dude. But, yes, it's true that was a high-profile failure. And it's also true that as technology moves people onto new platforms and away from the ones pollsters rely on to contact them, pollsters could have to make some adjustments to keep up. Sometimes, the old way of doing things breaks before the new way of doing things is perfected. It's possible that we're at some inflection point right now that's going to force the science of polling to evolve. Someone should do a poll of pollsters, I guess?But people should calm down. There's a world of polling work beyond election polling. And pollsters are helping us explain the world every day. At The Huffington Post, we have a series of polls that help explain the fundamentals of the political environment. Public opinion on how the economy is faring, whether the country is on the right track, whether approval of Congress is trending up or down -- these are the measures of the parameters and forces of the political world that underpin all the metaphysical stuff about how Bernie Sanders might do against Rand Paul in Ohio if the election were held today. (The election is not being held today.)Beyond that, pollsters offer us a wealth of information about the world we live in. Take for example, Pew Research Center's in-depth look at how Americans view their governing institutions or Brookings' American Values Survey, which both explore the state of the American mind on many key issues of the day. Are you worried that the middle class is losing ground? They are! Those were some good instincts. (Did you think the middle class was doing okay?
