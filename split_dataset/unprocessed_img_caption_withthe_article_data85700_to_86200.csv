The racially divisive Confederate battle flag flew at full-mast despite others flying at half-staff in South Carolina after the killing of nine black people in an historic African-American church in Charleston on June 17.

It truly has been a symbol of hate and injustice going all the way back. In the Civil War it was used to rally slave-holders and their sympathizers to battle. And in the segregationist South of the 1950s and 1960s, it was revived as a means of expressing resistance to the cause of civil rights and equality. It is time to strike those colors once and for all, remove them from the South Carolina statehouse grounds, expunge them from the Mississippi state flag, and banish them from any and all places of honor in American society.But we should go deeper than asking for symbolic change, as important as that is. I'd like in particular to call attention to a troubling development found mostly in deep red, Republican states, and that is the unholy marriage between Confederate ideology and the Second Amendment.The bond that unites Confederate ideology and the Second Amendment is the idea of ""nullification."" This is the belief that the states are the ultimate arbiters of what is or is not constitutional and that the states are thus always free to ignore federal law. States and not the courts, on this warped view of the Constitution, judge what is or is not constitutional.This ideology has a long and deep and ignoble history. We might begin with John Taylor of Caroline (1753-1824), whom Garry Wills called ""the principal theorist of nullification.""  He was a lawyer and a planter who sought to insulate his home state of Virginia from what he feared as early as the 1790s to be the growing, threatening powers of the national government.The best way to defend Virginia, Taylor proposed, was to ensure that the states were the final word on what the Constitution meant. States, he argued, always retained the right, if not the responsibility, to disobey the federal government where they believed the federal government overstepped constitutional limits. Taylor meant by this doctrine to strengthen and make secure the system of slavery, from which he personally profited, since Virginia and the other Southern states would always be free to declare null and void any federal law infringing on slave-holders' ""rights.""In the 1820s and 1830s, this proposal was worked into a full-blown constitutional theory by John C. Calhoun (1782-1850). Calhoun opposed the federal tariff that was then threatening the profitability of South Carolina's plantation-based way of life. Fearing the implicit threat to the slave-based economy, Calhoun insisted that South Carolina might declare the tariff unconstitutional.South Carolina tried to do just that in 1832, but backed off this ledge when confronted with federal military intervention. South Carolina climbed back onto that ledge in 1860/1861 when it -- and other Southern states -- seceded from the Union.These states acted as they did because they believed that the states might judge the federal government and withdraw from the Union as a last resort. Nullification, in other words, was a prominent feature of the constitutional theory that justified the Confederacy. It was a doctrine finally repudiated by the Civil War and by the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868.What does this history have to do with the Second Amendment? Simply this: Nullification, a concept that should have died a century and a half ago, has been resurrected from the tomb by gun-rights extremists and is triumphing in legislature after legislature in America's deep-red states.Consider Kansas. Kansas under the leadership of Governor Sam Brownback, is well-known for its extremist politics. Brownback's fiscal policies have wrecked the Kansas economy, Kansas education, and much else. Brownback has sought steady reductions in the state income tax, substituting for it ""the highest tax on food in the nation.""  And what does Kansas have to show for its regressive fiscal policy? While most regions of the United States are enjoying economic recovery, Kansas is not. In May, 2015, a report showed that Kansas lost ""nearly 4,000 jobs ... trailing the national trend.""That is bad enough, a tragedy for the Kansans who are suffering under Brownback's misrule. But just as bad is the gun legislation he has signed. In 2013, the state legislature enacted the ""Second Amendment Protection Act."" By its terms, the legislation ostensibly prohibits the federal government from enforcing federal gun control laws on Kansas soil with respect to certain classes of weapons.Alright, you might say, Brownback is an unrepentant extremist. But, unfortunately, Kansas is not an outlier. In recent years, other red states have followed a similar path. Bruce Otter is the 70-something governor of Idaho. He has spent a lifetime in Idaho politics, he is a staunchly conservative Republican in tune with his constituents, but he has never caused anyone to question whether he is tethered to reality. He is not typically prone to conspiracy theories or the other fever dreams that haunt the far right.But even Bruce Otter has recently felt politically compelled to sign nullification legislation declaring that the federal government lacked the constitutional authority to enforce gun-control legislation within Idaho's borders. And, really, he had little choice. The Idaho nullification statute passed the legislature unanimously.For sure, in any constitutional showdown, neither Kansas, nor Idaho, nor the other red states that have embarked on this fool's errand will prevail. The federal government has the authority to ensure that the laws it enacts are duly enforced in all 50 states.The neo-nullificationist movement, however, represents a dangerous trend. Grassroots conservatism is no longer part and parcel of mainstream American life. For there is nothing about nullificationist ideology that represents American values. It is the failed constitutional theory of a treasonous movement -- Southern secession. Its modern-day resuscitation can only be seen as a kind of existential alienation on the right.I am grateful to see Nikki Haley and Mitt Romney and other Republican leaders finally take a stand on the Confederate flag. It is an unambiguous symbol of hate and sedition and needs to be retired to a museum where its true place in American history might be explained.But Republicans must go beyond the flag debate to confront the simmering ideological stew on the far right. The idea of nullification in its own way is equally odious. It is a failed constitutional theory that should likewise be banished to a museum of legal antiquities. It has no place in modern-day America. It is frightening that such an idea has captured the imagination of so many Republican legislators. It is an idea that the national GOP leadership should repudiate, and soon. Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, and the rest of the candidates, we're talking to you."

I've been throwing up a lot, so we're trying to get to the bottom of it. I had a recent ER visit over it, so I was referred to a GI Specialist. I had never met this doctor before and the referring physician had seen me once for 10 minutes. They gave me a print out of my labs to bring with me. He had no other background information on me. There were no forms to fill out with my medical history or what medications I'm on -- just privacy practices and billing to sign.I brought my youngest daughter, Carly, into the office with me. He walked in and feigned a smile, commented on her ""down's eyes"" and then he just stared. I said, ""Yes, she has Down syndrome.""""How is she doing?""""Great! She had an open heart surgery at four months over at CHOC and she's been phenomenal since.""""What was wrong with her heart?""A large VSD, two small ASD's and a mildly hypoplastic aortic arch.""""Swiss cheese! That's common in Down's kids."" It's like nails on a chalkboard hearing her referred to as a ""Down's kid."" She's a child with Down syndrome, and her name is Carly.""Yep, I think it's around 50 percent of children with Down syndrome have a heart defect of some kind."" I over emphasized the words in hopes they'd sink in.""Is she your only?""""No, I have four other children.""""So what's going on?""""I've been throwing up several times every morning for months. I went in the ER because there was blood.""""Have you considered stress contributing?""""Of course, I'm sure it does but I throw up every morning before I even start my day. I really think there's something more to it. I'm not having a panic attack and then throwing up. It hits before I'm even fully conscious.""""Do you feel nauseated before?""""No..."" And before I even had a chance to explain the stabbing pain and where it hurt, he cut me off.""Sounds to me like it's psychosomatic. Don't feel bad about it. You have a down's kid. Anyone would be depressed and anxious. Life is hard, it's not what you expected or hoped. No one could handle what you have to deal with and not be depressed. I'd be depressed in your situation. We'll do tests, rule out some things -- but I think it's pretty obvious why this is happening and it's not gastrointestinal.""That was it. My entire medical history, the cancer that runs in my family, none of it mattered. I had a child with Down syndrome, so obviously that's where the problem lies.Could you imagine if he said that to any other mother about the way their child was born? ""It's just your child's gender making you depressed! I'd be depressed if I had a daughter too instead of my perfect son!""I wish I could tell you that I put him in his place. That I stood up for my daughter and told him that she wasn't a burden. That while I didn't plan on having a child with Down syndrome, I had never NOT planned on having a child with Down syndrome either. I was just grateful to be a parent. The only thing I envisioned in parenthood was love -- and my daughter is nothing but. She's my heart. I broke down crying, to which I'm sure he took as a sign of being right. I took the order for the upper endoscopy and left.I cried out of frustration. I cried out of not being heard. I cried for my daughter's future, and the cruel reminder that there are those that see her as less than. When we got home, I held Carly to my chest and rocked. I felt her now strong little heart beat and she gave me some giant grins as the rest of the world melted away. She's what saves me.She's almost a year old. Her 11 months have taught me more about life, about family, about love, about what's truly important. It's not cliche. She's made me grateful for all of the things I used to take for granted. She's been through more in her short little life, than I have been through in my entire adult life. She's tough as nails but she greets every single morning with the biggest smile. She's calming. She's my strength.The hardest thing about having a child with Down syndrome isn't the child and it isn't the Down syndrome -- it's public perception. It's a lack of funding, resources and research.

This provocative clip features an almost naked Cyrus suggestively cavorting on a simulated wrecking ball and nearly licking a metal phallic symbol.  From some conservative religious perspectives, the popularity of this popular video may be a perfect example of so-called ""moral corruption"" which may partially fuel the anti-Western hatred and jihadi rage of extreme terrorist organization such as the Islamic State. These groups view Western culture as evil, immoral, overly sexual, and destructive.  While the American media consistently broadcasts scenes of torture, murder, and violence attributed to ISIS, almost no news outlet discusses the moral and religious issues that shape the Islamic State's ideology.  Foreign fighters from around the world are joining ISIS because these fighters are morally outraged by several factors including: excessive nudity and sex in the Western media, the perceived corruption of some Islamic leaders, and a profound desire to coerce the Islamization of the world.  ISIS is not only a religious-based movement and a violence-based movement, it is also a moral calling for millions of young Muslim fighters who are willing to become martyrs by sacrificing their lives in battle.   Unfortunately, the leading Western leaders have not yet developed an effective and comprehensive strategy nor employed successful tactics that would be reasonably calculated to bring about the destruction of ISIS. Therefore, I offer a three part strategy which I call ""The Triangulation of ISIS"".  This strategy is based upon my highly personal experiences as an anti-terror fighter in the Middle East. When I was a soldier in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), I came face-to-face with the fanatical forces of the Shiite army known as Hezbollah (Party of God). Led by Hassan Nasrallah and supported by the Islamic Republic of Iran, Hezbollah is a constant threat to Israel and a source of political chaos in Lebanon. These intimate encounters with terrorism while in the IDF informs my perspective on handling the dangerous threat posed by ISIS. Mark Hardie, as an anti-terror commando in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), on the Israel-Syrian border.  The Triangulation of ISIS  The first part of the strategy is calls for the isolation of the ISIS leader. The commander of the Islamic State (ISIS) is Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, an extreme and mysterious Islamist who is dedicated to world domination and holy war. He is the new strategist for total war who promotes an Islamic world revolution.  After an exhaustive psycho-social analysis, I opine that al-Baghdadi views himself as the reincarnation of Abu Bakr, who was the first successor and the father-in-law of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). I believe al-Baghdadi's followers also view him as Abu Bakr reborn; a divinely inspired leader who will lead the Islamic Caliphate to victory over perceived inferior and corrupt non-believers. It is critical that Western policymakers realize that the demise of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi would cripple and demoralize ISIS.  The second part of the triangulation strategy calls for the formation of the ""Islamic Corps"" (IC). The Obama Administration and America's allies can recruit millions of Arab fighters to join this new military institution. Defeating ISIS will require ""boots on the ground""; however, it would be tactically advantageous for the infantry soldiers to be drawn from Arab and Muslim states. America must not be drawn into another Iraq War. This ""Islamic Corps"" guided by Western specialists and intelligence officers could defeat ISIS with the proper military training and the utilization of superior weaponry.  The final part of triangulation involves the aggressive use of both education and pro-Western propaganda. First, an ""Islam is Peaceful"" television campaign must be broadcast, in Arabic, throughout the Muslim world. Such a media effort might influence some young people to embrace a peaceful version of Islam.Second, the Central Intelligence Agency and State Department could commission the publication of a series of Arabic-language books which pontificate on a moderate, pro-Western, and modern version of Islam. These ""books of peace"" should be distributed free of cost to youth in Arabic-speaking countries. Finally, so-called moderate Muslim regimes such as Egypt and Jordan must be provided with improved military and economic support. ISIS must not be allowed to dominate Egypt, Jordan, and threaten Israel.  As a former Israeli soldier who has lived in the Middle East for over five years, I know what it takes to confront Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and bring about the defeat of ISIS. Western leaders must adopt the policy of ""victory through strength"" and adopt this triangulation strategy in order to defeat the Islamic State and save the world from the violent tyranny of jihad.

7,POLITICS,How Many Public Schools Does it Cost to Bomb ISIS?,"Emil Mella, ContributorAmateur political commentator who sometimes tries to be funny;...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-many-public-schools-d_b_7615094.html,"We, as a human race in general, just need to take a huge 7-and-some-billion-people-dosage of the chill pill.",2015-06-22,2015-06-21-1434854128-8465452-fighterjet63090_1280.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-21-1434854128-8465452-fighterjet63090_1280-thumb.jpg," The F-15 Strike Eagle fighter jet, one of the aircraft currently in use as part of the American offensive against ISIS.Marvelous question that you totally absolutely came up with, Reader! It's also a very tough one to answer, and, on top of that, it's really not quite the point of this article. The point here, to be blunt, is that we, as a human race in general, just need to take a huge 7-and-some-billion-people-dosage of the chill pill. Vladimir Putin just announced Russia will be adding forty new intercontinental nuclear weapons to their 7,500-strong arsenal of civilization-destroying, mushroom cloud-making warheads, world leaders have been in a tizzy over the nuclear deal with Iran, and Donald Trump announced he's running for President. Maybe I'm just a hippie, but those are just too many big fat white warheads popping up for my tastes.  Pictured: Ew.War is violent. It's horrible. It's a testament to rash action and lack of diplomacy. It's also a business. And, well...Business. Is.  Booming. What, with ISIS plowing through Iraq and Syria, the Houthis raising revolution in Yemen, and the gargantuan United States Army... existing, the demand for machines and vehicles that work to kill other human beings is high as ever.Governments all over the world are continually stockpiling massive amounts of weaponry, and to what end? To look more menacing, more defended? To hold a hypothetical gun to the billions of fellow humans out there who frankly never had an intention to invade your country in any way, as part of what really just seems to be the biggest manhood-measuring contest in the history of humankind? To put billions towards this massive murderous monstrosity of a weapons stockpile when people in your own country are uneducated, unhealthy, underfed?So, to answer my- sorry, your, original question, Reader - how many public schools does it cost to bomb ISIS? Let's run the math! How much does it cost to drop a single, solitary bomb on some goat herder in ISIS-occupied Syria?Simple, right? How much does one of these bombs go for? The most commonly used missile in this mission so far is the Raytheon Systems-designed Tomahawk Cruise Missile, a common projectile that can be equipped with a nuclear or standard payload, and which is not to be confused with the Tom Cruise Missile, which is much dreamier and whose payload consists mainly of insane Scientology-based rants and half-decent acting.  Pictured: A plaque honoring the lives lost to this vicious killing machine.One of the Tomahawks will set you back a teensy tiny $569,000. Obviously you wouldn't only use one missile, but this is hypothetical, and we hypothetically really want to get that one goat herder. Good, so we've got our answer, no?Not quite. You also need to calculate the cost of the aircraft that will be doing the actual dropping of the actual missile on the actual goat herder - let's call him Hassan. We apparently really want Hassan to burn in the flames of freedom and righteousness, so we need a proper jet to get the drop on him on. Five military planes are currently being deployed against ISIS, these being the B-1B Lancer, the F-15E Strike Eagle, the F-16 Fighting Falcon, the F-22 Raptor and the F/A-18 Hornet, all of which are produced by contractor giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Let's go with the most common one: Lockheed Martin's F-16 Falcon, each of which costs $18.8 million to make. So, is that our total amount, then? That's not so bad; let's get to the bombing, yeah?Well, no. Before that, the bomb in question and the aircraft that will drop it both have to be carried over closer to where they will be doing the actual bombing by an aircraft carrier - in the case of the current American offensive against the Islamic State, that carrier would be none other than the USS George H.W. Bush, which cost $6.2 billion to make. That last price tag is just a bit bigger, see? Changes things a bit. The average cost of construction for an American public high school in 2010 was estimated to be $54,900,000. So... not including the cost of fuel for the aircraft or for its carrier, or the salaries of all the soldiers who man any part of this massive operation from beginning to end, dropping that one single bomb on poor Hassan will cost you a measly six billion, two hundred nineteen million, three hundred sixty-nine thousand dollars. That's approximately 113 public high schools built. One hundred and thirteen. Serving an average of 1,600 students each. To drop a single missile.  The extremely expensive (not to mention much more beneficial to society) Charlotte R. Bloomberg Children's Center and Sheikh Zayed Tower at The Johns Hopkins Hospital cost $1.1 billion to build and prepare. With the money we just used to rain a single burst of potent Tomahawk hellfire on Hassan, you could've built approximately five and a half of one of the largest hospital construction projects in history. This is a problem. Just look at the United States. Yes, we're talking about you, America, if you haven't noticed thus far. When the world's largest Air Force is your Air Force and the world's second largest Air Force is your Navy and Marine Corps' combined Air Force, you deserve this one.  At the time of writing this article, military action against ISIS has cost $4.6 billion, the cost of the war in Iraq has soared at $818 billion, and fighting in Afghanistan has cost your country $704 billion. You can watch those figures climb here. That sort of money could go towards doing absolutely amazing things. With $70 billion a year, you could make public universities free for all Americans through the College For All Act. Sound like a lot? Again, Afghanistan cost over ten times that, and, if you need some perspective on what that kind of money means, over the course of four years, Apple Computers on its own moved $74 billion in profits to a tax-dodging subsidiary in Ireland. ""But let's not make this about taxes,"" he said, writing on a MacBook Pro and quickly changing topics. You could, however, pay for a year of free college tuition for all Americans, and still have four billion dollars to buy yourself four billion or so Snickers bars. Or put those funds into education or health programs. Your call, really.The United States could enact single-payer, universal health care for every American through Rep. John Conyers's (D-Mich.) Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act, which would, in theory, save the nation $592 billion annually on health care costs (not to mention the $1.8 trillion saved over the course of a decade due to the lack of health cost inflation), not add any additional costs. But, say that an unimaginable amount of money was suddenly also necessary to enact this, maybe you've got to give every health care giant CEO billions of dollars in golden parachutes, they own the system anyway, I don't know - you'd still be doing much, much better than the operation to kill Osama Bin Laden which spent $3 trillion over fifteen years. Three. Trillion. Twelve zeroes and a three. Dollars. To kill one man. That's over four hundred and eighty-two times what it cost to take out Hassan, guys.  Pictured: A person whose death cost more money than what most of the world's nations make in a year. Of course, a lot of the things that these members of Congress (and I, by extension) have proposed seem to be absolutely against American principles, against the general national mindset, so let's let all that slide. But just know this.When you and your desensitized eyes look up and down a Facebook wall and a Twitter feed full of news about grisly deaths in Afghanistan, or Iraq, or Syria, know that not only are you, you know, reading about grisly deaths that your nation is entirely involved in, you're also watching public schools, hospitals, college tuitions, healthcare, the literal investment into the improvement of society going right down the drain with a missile, an aircraft carrier, and a poor mangled goat herder named Hassan.

Suburban residents from the 1950's onwards consumed far more resources when commuting long hours to work or maintaining their lush lawns. Suburbia was space squandered, inefficiency welcomed.And those who moved to the suburbs at that time -- the largely affluent white community of the 50's and 60's -- did so knowing full well that the price they paid for seclusion would be one they could bear.Not so for the many thousands who are now being forced to abandon their homes in cities across the country and move to America's increasingly depressed suburbs. These former city dwellers, often renters, often from low-income households, previously lived in the city because they could not afford the plush life of the suburbs.As gentrification has attracted younger, wealthier, more educated residents into the city, it has pushed out low wage earners to the suburbs. The same suburbs that today, as before, require the luxury of time and charge the penalty of convenience.Except that these new suburban residents lack both the time (many work multiple low wage jobs to make ends meet) or the desire to live farther from the city.In the transaction that gentrification represents, It seems only one party benefits: the wealthy who buy and rent the increasingly homogenous downtown lofts of the inner city."

Unfortunately, this practice is old news in Indian Country; non-Natives, mostly Caucasians, have been posing as Native people for years.""Playing Indian"" is so common that most Native peoples have grown inured to the cringe-inducing spectacle of white folks doing ungainly dances at hobby powwows all over the world. Not all participants at these events claim Native ancestry - many just want to be Indian for a day.There are more and more individuals and groups, however, claiming Native heritage in order to reap benefits, either professional or monetary. Many of these imposters also present themselves to the general public as authorities and spokespeople for Native peoples. These practices are a line in the sand for some Native people like Ben Barnes, Second Chief for the Shawnee tribe of Oklahoma and Tribal Historic Preservation Officer (THPO). He and representatives from other Oklahoma tribes are joining together and taking action.Barnes and leaders from the three federally recognized Shawnee tribal governments all located in Oklahoma (the Shawnee, Absentee Shawnee and Eastern Band Shawnee, as well as the Miami tribe), traveled to Illinois in May to oppose a state bill that would have conferred state tribal recognition to the Vinyard Indian Settlement. The group, located in Herod, Illinois, claims to be Shawnee.George Strack, THPO for the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma described the group as hobbyists.According to a story on the Daily Register newspaper website in Harrisburg, Illinois the legislation recognizing the Vinyard Settlement would have made the group eligible to receive resources from the federal government and state agencies. The group expected to use that funding to create an elder living center, a daycare center and make improvements to the surrounding environment.Illinois State Representative Brandon Phelps, D-Harrisburg, introduced the bill into the Illinois House in February, where it passed unanimously and was headed to the Senate for what appeared to be easy passage until representatives from the Oklahoma tribes presented the legislature with historic documentation that called the Vinyard claims into serious question.Tribal leaders from Oklahoma are hopeful that the bill will not resurface. ""Groups like the Vinyard tribe take funding that is earmarked for genuine state and federally recognized tribes,"" Barnes said. He also noted that states without federally recognized tribes have little experience in Native affairs and can easily fall victim to claims by hobby groups. ""Some of the states are simply unaware of how to verify the claims made by these groups and are often misled.""There are about 35 groups claiming Shawnee heritage who have formed 501 c 3 (non-profit) status with the government. Some conduct public presentations falsely claiming to present Shawnee culture and tradition,"" according to Barnes.Most of the 35 groups are located in Ohio. Some, such as the United Remnant Band (URB) of Shawnee claim to have formal state recognition.Ohio has no state recognized tribes nor does it have a recognition process, according to Rob Nicholas Communications director for office of Ohio Gov. John Kasich.In 2007, the U.S. Mint issued offered customer refunds for pouches produced by the URB for the 2004 Lewis and Clark Commemorative. According to an article in the Los Angeles Times, the Shawnee group was one of several Indian tribes hired by the federal government to manufacture pouches sold with the limited run of 50,000 silver dollars. The Ohio Shawnees were involved in making about 2,000 pouches, and were cited in the ""certificate of authenticity"" that came with each coin-and-pouch set.The problem, the mint said, is that ""neither state nor federal authorities recognize the Shawnee Nation United Remnant Band of Ohio as an official Indian tribe."" As such, ""the pouch is not an authentic American Indian arts and crafts product.""According to Barnes, the Shawnee tribe has found all of the claims by these groups to be unfounded. ""These groups are misleading the public especially when they are associated with state museums, parks and schools,"" he said.He is concerned with activities at the Fort Ancient Archeological Park in Oregonia, Ohio, where he believes the museum relies on hobbyists, many of them from the 35 groups falsely claiming Shawnee citizenship, to present facts about Shawnee culture and history to visitors.Fort Ancient is the site of a series of massive earthworks created by the Hopewell, an ancient Native American culture. Shawnee people believe they are descendants of these people. It is one of 58 historic sites and museums owned by the Ohio History Connection, a non -profit organization that serves as the state's partner in preserving Ohio's history.According to the Fort Ancient website, ""the sites mission is to provide visitor and educational services focused on archaeology, Native American culture, and heritage stewardship as they relate to the site.""Fort Ancient site archaeologist Jack Blosser says thousands of school children tour the site each year, where they are presented with information about the site's history as well as information about contemporary Native culture.Fort Ancient also sponsors the annual Fort Ancient Celebration that is structured like a powwow with drum groups singing under a central arbor with attendees clad in various interpretations of Native regalia dancing in a circular direction around the arbor. According to the Fort Ancient website, the Celebration features Native heritage experts from whom visitors can learn about ancient and current Native Americans.Indian Country Today Media Network (ICTMN) recently published an article about controversy surrounding the event.Barnes noted that the Ohio History Connection has reached out to the three Shawnee tribes for discussions about pursuing status as a world heritage site with United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) for some of the earthworks sites. Fort Ancient, however, has not sought any tribal involvement in creating public programs purporting to present facts about the Shawnee.Barnes believes that the general public is being misled by the information presented at Fort Ancient.Its managers may be taking note of those concerns; ICTMN visited Fort Ancient's Celebration earlier in June and observed that several vendors displayed signs indicating that their goods were ""Native inspired.""This was presumably done in response to tribal concerns regarding violations of federal Indian Arts and Crafts Act that prohibits misrepresentation in marketing of Indian arts and crafts.Additionally Lynn Hanson, vice president of the Dayton Society of Natural History, the organization that manages the Fort Ancient site for the Ohio History Connection said that managers of the site are grappling with a way to address concerns by federally recognized tribes. ""Ohio has so little contact with Native peoples, their issues and concerns that we know little about them. We need to address this,"" she said.Hanson indicated that the Dayton Society hopes to follow the lead of the Ohio History Connection and begin to involve leaders of the federally recognized tribes in Oklahoma in conversations about Fort Ancient programming. ""We want to work on a way to fix this while still making the site open and available to everyone,"" she said.When fantasy takes overWhile people of color may see ethnic fraud as the ultimate luxury of choice for white people, it speaks to a darker psychology that serves a strange need for some. According to an article in Thinkprogress, such self-deception allows people to avoid uncomfortable parts of their lives. It could also be an indication of body dysmorphic - a condition in which people are preoccupied with their appearance and go to great lengths to change it.The article further noted that humans have the unique ability to keep absolute truths out of their mind so they can lead more pleasant lives.As we've seen in the Rachel Dolezal case, however, the pursuit of a more pleasant and interesting life may wreck havoc on the lives and cultures of others.Sherri Clemons, THPO for the Wyandotte tribe of Oklahoma the genuine descendants of the ancestors found in Danbury, found out about the reburial two years after the event. ""When we unearthed the remains we found they had been buried in plastic garbage bags and an old whisky box,"" she said.""When news of archeological finds gets out to the public, these fake groups come out of the woodwork and try to lay claim to remains,"" she said. ""This has been going on in Indian Country for a long time. We have to fight these fake organizations every time and convince state governments we are the people they should be dealing with.""The Wyandottes were finally successful, two years after finding out about the remains, in giving their ancestors a proper burial.Why do so many people claim to be Native American? ICTMN recently published an article about a new report by the Pew Research Center on the growing number of multiracial adults in the U.S.""When news of archeological finds gets out to the public, these fake groups come out of the woodwork and try to lay claim to remains,"" she said.

My thoughts and prayers are with the victims' families and community. My prayers are especially with the African American community, and their spiritual leaders and communities; they work hard to bring Godliness into the world. These shining examples of selflessness and Godliness were killed, angels among us that bring light to the world, were slain. Leaders who brought goodness and happiness and comfort to so many have been senselessly murdered. God this is not right.As the leader of a congregation in LA, I understand this is about the most devastating thing that could ever happen. Not only loosing your religious leaders in a senseless vicious attack - but that crime being committed in the place you gather to worship and study.As Jews we have always known that those who seek to destroy us, aim for our synagogues. Where we congregate and pray and commune with God -- that is the place where evildoers go to do evil. Synagogues around the world have been targets of these kinds of massacres and we, the Jewish community, have to place guards at many of our houses of worship because of these threats. I don't wish this upon anyone else, a sense that someone might come and attack you while in prayer simply because of how you look and how you pray and what kind of religious beliefs you hold dear.The pathological nature of man who did this comes from a place of real evil. It is hard to imagine that a human is capable of such an act - and yet we see this kind of evil perpetrated here in our own country all too often. This heinous hate-crime committed in a place of worship has the power to provoke our nation to really do something about gun violence and racism. Charleston can become that tipping-point moment with a confluence of public outcry and political will are combined to really get something accomplished. It can become the time when Americans stand up and say enough is enough. No more easy access to guns. No more public sanctioned racist flags flying. No more tolerance for those fomenting and leading others to racism. No more tolerance of the NRA providing the ammunition and guns to destroy our society.When our country was attacked from terror from abroad, we banded together. But when our country is attacked from within?The massacre at the Charleston church is a crime against all of America and all Americans.I pray to God that we are provoked into action - now!"

It's even more glaring in the face of the state's American flags, which were all appropriately lowered to half-mast out of respect for the horrific mass murder at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charlotte. But it's worse than that. For most Americans the Confederate flag is as offensive, as repulsive, as the swastika is to Jews. The real question is: why does South Carolina insist on flying this venomous flag at all, right there on the grounds of the state capital?Many folks look to the Confederate flag as a source of ""Southern pride,"" as they describe it. Pride in what? That they enslaved millions of African Americans? That they imposed themselves on their women? That they callously broke families apart? That they rejected the United States of America's democracy, seceded from the union and went to war over the disgraceful insistence on maintaining their ownership of their fellow man, in subservience? A war that cost 620,000 Americans their lives?South Carolina first flew the Confederate flag on top of the Capital dome in 1962 - their response to the widespread and growing push for civil rights, a movement they objected to - because to them, and to most of the rest of us to this day, it symbolizes the South's initial struggle to preserve its ""right"" to enslave blacks. After facing their own protests for flying the flag, they were forced to move it to front of the Confederate Soldiers Monument - still on the Capital's grounds.A few years later (1968), in response to widespread demonstrations against the Vietnam War, and ultimately triggered by the burning of an American flag in Central Park, New York City, Congress passed the Flag Desecration Law. This law prohibited any display of ""contempt"" against the flag, and made such a thing illegal until the Supreme Court overturned it the next year.The Supreme Court made ""flag desecration"" legal in 1969, declaring that the burning of the American flag was protected by the First Amendment. If it's ok to burn our American flag, then it's sure as hell ok to burn the Confederate flag.Want to send a message to South Carolina and the rest of America? Want to demonstrate magnanimous visible support for racial equality? Want to stand united as genuine Americans? Get yourself to the South Carolina State House, or the climb the steps to the Lincoln Memorial, or stand out in the plaza in front of the Alamo. Gather on Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House. Bring a Confederate flag, and torch it. Burn it. Send it up in flames and make it clear how most Americans view the public display of something abhorrent, a symbol that stands for the worst example of criminal human cruelty and blatant discrimination in our country's history.(By the way, Mississippi may be worse: their official state flag includes a full reproduction of the Confederate flag).Grieving families in Charleston, the ones who lost nine brothers and sisters, fathers and sons, aunts and uncles, and a grandson, are gracious enough to be forgiving the shooter. Beyond the pale. Beyond any reasonable expectations. This twisted racist of a demon, this wannabe white supremacist, deserves no sympathy, and yet here they are, some of Charleston's finest, forgiving him. Most Charleston citizens, and South Carolinians, claim there is genuine love for each other across the city, and state. Non-discriminate, unhesitating love for their fellow man. And they continue to demonstrate their love throughout the state, as an example for the rest of us.Here's what I say: honor these people. Acknowledge your love for one another. South Carolina is in a position to send a signal to the rest of the world. Do something dramatic. Create a watershed moment. Send a strong unmistakable message to Charleston, and Ferguson, and Atlanta, and Madison, and Staten Island - and America and the rest of the world, that we are finally dedicated, one and all to eliminating the ugliness of racial discrimination.Governor Nikki Haley, ""take down that flag!"" Get rid of it. Put it away. Tuck it away in that museum on your state capital's grounds, the one dedicated to ... Confederate Southern pride. The one that proudly displays South Carolina's session flag right on their website. That's owned by Charleston's chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. But get it the hell out of sight and get with the rest of America.One more thing: how was this punk - charged with a felony (possession of Suboxone, a prescription narcotic) - able to have a gun in his possession in the first place? The killer made his intentions, his feelings about blacks, clearly known on his own website! By law, he should not have been able to buy a gun from a dealer - where background checks are required. They are not required at gun shows, where nearly 50% of all gun purchases are made (see my earlier columns on various gun control - or lack thereof - issues). This thing stinks all the way around, and runs to the heart of the unique challenges - and failures - that exist in our ... so-called democracy. At long last, something must be done. Something. Anything. Enforce the existing laws. Require background checks!! Require a 30-day waiting period!! There are no rational reasons not to implement these two simple steps nation wide. Are we Americans going to allow the NRA to continue to put our lives at risk without the slightest checks on the grotesque accessibility to guns, many of which end up as murder weapons?"

Now, imagine that straw shrinks to the size of a coffee stirrer, making it even more difficult — nearly impossible — to inhale enough oxygen. This is what asthma feels like for Doris Toles, a Baltimore resident who had her first asthma attack when she was just two years old.  Doris is not alone. Children, the elderly and those suffering from respiratory illnesses are especially vulnerable to asthma attacks. One of the main triggers is ozone pollution. Also known as smog, ozone is considered one of the most harmful air pollutants and has been linked to low birth weight in newborns, cardiovascular episodes, increased visits to emergency rooms and even death. Because minorities and low-income households suffer from higher rates of asthma, they are often disproportionately affected by ozone pollution.On his first day in office, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan illegally blocked a safeguard to reduce ozone pollution. This standard was supported by public health advocates, Maryland's Air Quality Control Advisory Council, the Maryland State Medical Society, environmental groups and one of two major coal plant owners in the state. Yet, the Hogan administration has still not offered a reasonable explanation for why it blocked such a critical health protection.While the Hogan administration drags its heels, Marylanders across the state struggle to survive during bad ozone days. Take Christine Keels for example, she used to travel the world representing the United Methodist Church, but now it is a daily struggle just to get to work, which requires her to map hospitals along her commute from Baltimore to Washington, D.C., because she's terrified of getting an uncontrollable nose bleed or being unable to breathe because of her asthma. Many areas in Maryland were given a failing grade from the American Lung Association for the number of High Ozone Days.Children and black Marylanders like Christine face some troubling facts when it comes to ozone pollution and asthma:  F. The grade given to Prince George's County, Baltimore, Baltimore County and Anne Arundel County from the American Lung Association for the number of High Ozone Days; Montgomery County got a ""D"".Twice the national average. An alarming 20 percent of Baltimore children under 18 have asthma, more than double the national average.Twice the rate of non-Hispanic whites. Non-Hispanic blacks have the highest asthma hospitalization rates out of any group in Maryland — more than double the rate of non-Hispanic whites.More than twice as likely. Black Marylanders are nearly 2.5 times more likely to die from asthma than white Marylanders.The safeguard blocked by Gov. Hogan would protect Marylanders like Doris and Christine by reducing nitrogen oxide pollution from coal-fired power plants that leads to harmful ozone levels. After more than a year-long stakeholder process, the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) adopted the rule on Jan. 16, 2015. The safeguard was submitted that same day for publication in the Maryland Register. But Gov. Hogan illegally blocked its publication to thwart its implementation.  Gov. Hogan essentially tossed out the result of the entire stakeholder process and MDE's expertise when he refused to allow the safeguard to be published. Although his administration has promised to start a new process to consider long-term NOx reductions, such a process would simply duplicate MDE's extensive process from last year. It could also lead to a less protective result.  Chesapeake Physicians for Social Responsibility and Sierra Club's Maryland Chapter, represented by Earthjustice, recently sued the Hogan administration. If successful, our lawsuit would require this safeguard to be published and prevent the administration from further blocking this critical health protection.Without this lawsuit, there is absolutely no guarantee or binding document that these protections will ever be established. The only promise Marylanders suffering from poor air quality have is the Hogan administration's word.  People like Doris and Christine that know firsthand what #AsthmaFeelsLike deserve better."

Lois Capps, ContributorU.S. Representative for California's 24th District",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/one-month-after-the-plain_b_7623928.html,"The Plains Spill is yet another tragic reminder that oil spills happen and will continue to happen as long as we depend on fossil fuels for our energy needs. Until we can move beyond oil, we must do everything we can to ensure safety -- not profit -- remains our number one priority. Our economy and our environment depend on it.",2015-06-22,"Workers clean oil from the rocks and beach near Refugio State Beach in Goleta, California, May 22, 2015. The oil company behind a crude spill on the California coast vowed to do the 'right thing' to clear up the mess, even as reports emerged of past leaks involving its pipelines. Plains All American Pipeline made the pledge as it said nearly 8,000 gallons of oil had been scooped up, out of some 21,000 gallons believed to have flooded into the ocean near Santa Barbara, northwest of Los Angeles. AFP PHOTO/ MARK RALSTON (Photo credit should read MARK RALSTON/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb16cdc2100000001c7364a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Touring oil-covered Refugio Beach last month -- just a few days after the Plains All American Pipeline spewed more than 100,000 gallons of oil onto the pristine Gaviota Coast and into the Pacific Ocean one month ago today -- I could not help but think back to a similar journey I took in 1969 with my young children to East Beach in Santa Barbara after the devastating spill from Union Oil's Platform A.The sights and smells from these spills were incredibly similar -- the noxious odor of crude oil permeating the air, wildlife drenched with oil, workers in white jumpsuits scooping oil off the sand by hand, boats busy deploying booms in the water, and miles of previously pristine shoreline covered in thick black tar.These sights and smells are not easily forgotten; they stay with you and are a constant reminder of the need to act. Since that 1969 spill, our state and community have demanded the highest environmental protection standards for all local industries, but especially for oil and gas development. It seems clear to me that Plains is not meeting these standards, and I am working with federal, state, and local officials to find answers to the many questions that remain and to enact safeguards to better protect our communities.Based on what we know so far, one of the biggest tragedies behind the Plains Spill is that it likely could have been prevented. Inspection results from the last five years revealed systemic and extensive corrosion throughout the length of the pipeline. An in-line inspection just weeks before the spill showed disturbing levels of corrosion on both Line 901 -- the pipeline that ruptured -- and Line 903, an adjoining pipeline also operated by Plains here on the Central Coast. Third-party metallurgists on site estimated the metal loss at the rupture site left only 1/16 of an inch of pipe between pressurized crude oil and our environmentally sensitive coastline. Federal inspectors from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) also found three corrosion repairs near the rupture site made after a 2012 in-line inspection, and the May 5, 2015, inspection found three other areas of ""extensive corrosion"" on Line 901 requiring ""immediate investigation and remediation.""Analysis of the adjoining pipeline Line 903 is just as concerning: An April 2013 investigation of a 38-mile segment of Line 903 found ""99 metal loss anomalies requiring investigation."" A June 2013 inspection of another 75-mile segment of Line 903 found ""a number of metal loss anomalies that may indicate general corrosion.""This alarming pattern of corrosion on both lines is highly disturbing and simply unacceptable. This begs the question, just what is the state of the thousands of miles of pipeline running throughout our country and under our communities?As the images of this spill fade from national headlines, we cannot let the impetus to improve safety fade as well. I have continued to work on behalf of the Central Coast community in Washington to call attention to this spill, address the failures in oversight that allowed it to happen, and promote ways to prevent similar disasters in the future. These efforts will take time, and I am committed to working until all questions are answered and corrective actions are taken by all involved.In the month since the spill, I have met personally with the leadership of Plains, PHMSA, and the response team to demand answers and transparency for our community. In light of the evidence, I have also called for the continued shutdown of both Lines 901 and 903 until they can be proven safe and the corrosion issues are addressed.Congress has an essential role to play in ensuring that this spill is cleaned up and that corrective actions are taken both by Plains and PHMSA to prevent future tragedies. I am pleased to announce that the House of Representatives recently passed an amendment I authored to help push federal regulators to finalize enhanced safety rules for oil pipelines, and I have also called for an oversight hearing to investigate the causes of and response to the Plains Spill, as well as the adequacy of current federal spill detection and prevention regulations. And this is just the first step. Later this year the Energy and Commerce Committee, of which I am a senior member, will be considering comprehensive pipeline safety legislation. During that debate, please know that I will make sure that the Plains Oil Spill is a central topic of discussion, ensuring that we strengthen federal pipeline regulations to help prevent a tragedy like this from happening again.I have spent my entire congressional career working to stop new offshore oil and gas development and prevent these types of spills. While we have successfully prevented expansion of drilling along our coast, the Plains Spill reminds us that drilling and transporting oil is an inherently dangerous, dirty business that poses serious risks to our economy and environment. There is simply no such thing as a truly safe pipeline.The Plains Spill is yet another tragic reminder that oil spills happen and will continue to happen as long as we depend on fossil fuels for our energy needs. Until we can move beyond oil, we must do everything we can to ensure safety -- not profit -- remains our number one priority. Our economy and our environment depend on it."

In an attempt to clarify, here are 5 things I learned from Rachel Dolezal that clarify what it means to be Black, white, and gullible in America.1) White privilege is audaciously elastic   Rachel Dolezal's last decade of perpetrating herself as a Black woman encapsulates the audaciousness of white privilege and weird elasticity.White privilege is defined as the societal privileges that benefit white people. Elasticity is the ability of something to change and adapt. White privilege goes to great lengths to defend whiteness at all costs. No matter how crazy white people get, their privilege still manages to protect them. In the case of Rachel Dolezal, she was literally drenched in Blackness and yet her privilege still remained intact.As a white woman perpetrating to be Black, Rachel never actually gave up her whiteness; she only reinforced it. As a white woman who attempted to expunge any association to racism, she did the exact opposite. By disguising herself as a Black woman, she embodied racism by prioritizing her white self over others, occupying space, claiming to be an expert over certain experiences, and arrogantly disparaging anyone who made claims against it. 2) The NAACP is defunct  During the Rachel Dolezale debacle, we saw how useless the NAACP has become in the fight for justice. In a statement after the racial furor, the NAACP stated that:""One's racial identity is not a qualifying criteria or disqualifying standard for NAACP leadership. The NAACP Alaska-Oregon-Washington State Conference stands behind Ms. Dolezal's advocacy record. In every corner of this country, the NAACP remains committed to securing political, educational, and economic justice for all people, and we encourage Americans of all stripes to become members and serve as leaders in our organization.""This statement sums up just how detached the NAACP is. Of course, no one's racial identity should disqualify them from leading an organization, but one would assume that lying about your ethnicity--whether you want to identify with it or not--should be grounds for dismissal. Unfortunately, the NAACP sees it another way, as reflected in their decision to defend her. This merely confirms how deeply misguided they are when it comes to race. Like, for real? You mean to tell me your version of the advancement of colored people looks like letting a white woman wear blackface inside of your organization? *Sips Tea*3) Black leaders are too gullible   Rachel Dolezal's role as the chair of the Spokane NAACP Chapter and quarterly professor of African American Studies at Eastern Washington University conveys the naïveté of Black people in these spaces. Did no one ever once question the absurdity of what was going on? For the Black people in these organizations to never fact-check their leadership explains the unfortunate turn in organizational practices and just how easy they can be compromised without any notice. Where were the guardians? Who are the gatekeepers? And why are they defending her now that the truth is out?Whether they were aware or not, the Black leaders she was around were far too embracing and because of their failure to do the homework, important Black spaces from the classroom to the board room that should serve as safe spaces to discuss strategy and combat racist practices, are being compromised. 4) We have a poor understanding of racial fluidity  When discussing race, many people forget how fluid it can be in regards to ""passing"" as another race.Passing in America has been occurring for centuries and reached high levels during the Jim Crow era, during which lighter-skinned Blacks would routinely escape the racial stigmas attached to being Black (and the violence that accompanied it) to assimilate into white mainstream culture. Rachel Dolezal has done the same thing, in reverse.Rachel Dolezal feared that she would be persecuted as a white woman for wanting to identify with Black culture, and so to remove her whiteness (and any stigma she felt surrounded it), she felt the necessity to appropriate the very culture she sought to save.Since race is a social construct with legitimate bearings in biological characteristics, Rachel's Black disguise (bronzed skin, kinky braids, and twists) reveals her misunderstanding of Blackness, altogether. 5) It's time to redefine what ""Blackness"" really is  The case of Rachel Dolezal has revealed the ambiguity of Blackness. While the perception of Blackness is comprised of a collective Black experience (a history of enslavement, civil rights struggle, etc.), it is so much more. I maintain that American Blackness is rooted in our Africanness, not in our shared oppression. Being oppressed doesn't make you Black; being of African descent makes you Black. When African Americans ground their Blackness in the country they were brought to rather than the continent they came from, they forfeit the incontestable meaning of what it means to be Black altogether. Once we root our Blackness in the right soil, it will qualify what it means to be Black and put to rest any argument of the experience that surrounds it. The legacy of being Black is something that Rachel Dolezal will never be able to co-opt or replicate.Black culture is not a costume, nor is it a thematic experience to take part in. Being Black is a part of a very proud legacy entrenched in the customs and practices of West African countries. But in order to safeguard that legacy, Black people have some serious work to do.That work looks like critiquing the ways that whiteness seeks to replicate and co-opt Blackness by redefining and reclaiming the definitions we ascribe to our individual Blackness. If not, Black people will continue to get duped in our own spaces and allow the curtains of minstrelsy to open up right behind this one. And I don't know about you, but my Blackness can't handle another Rachel Dolezal. Yours shouldn't have to either."

Today, the most profound struggles in the Middle East are between democratic visions, whether secularist or religious, and authoritarianism, whether secularist or religious.",2015-06-22,"Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan speaks during a graduation ceremony for foreign students in Ankara, Turkey, Thursday, June 11, 2015. In his first televised appearance since his ruling party lost its parliamentary majority, Erdogan has asked all Turkish political parties to put aside their differences and rapidly form a new government. Erdogan had campaigned voraciously in a bid to win a supermajority for the ruling party, which would have enabled it to change the constitution and usher in a presidential system allowing him to control government affairs. The party is now forced to seek a coalition partnership.(AP Photo/Burhan Ozbilici)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/60d98b3b280000d0376ff7e8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The death of former Turkish President Süleyman Demirel in the same month as Turkish parliamentary elections emphasizes the fact that there have been significant changes in Turkish politics in recent years. Demirel's political career followed a military coup that deposed the Turkish government in 1960 and resulted in the execution of a democratically elected prime minister, Adnan Menderes, on charges of undermining the constitution. In 2015, widespread opposition to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's plans to make considerable changes in the constitution resulted in his political party losing a notable number of seats in parliament, not his execution. Many people, inside and outside of Turkey, see the results of the June 2015 elections as a confirmation of the strength of democracy in Turkey. President Erdoğan's political party, the Justice and Development Party, lost many parliamentary seats, although it remained the largest party in the assembly. The vote is interpreted as a rejection of Erdoğan's plan to amend the constitution to grant more powers to the president, which many viewed as a step toward a more authoritarian political system. However, Erdoğan and the AKP prime minister and party head, Ahmet Davutoğlu, quickly confirmed that they accepted the election results and would begin work on creating a new government. Ahmet Davutoğlu stated, ""Our people's decision is final. It's above everything and we will act in line with it.""The Turkish election results counter a long-standing view of the relationship between Islam and democracy. In the 1990s, as Islamic movements began to participate actively in mainstream politics (when given the opportunity), more secular Muslims and many analysts in the West mistrusted the motives of the Islamists. People made, and continue to make, the accusation that Islamists are supporters of democracy only until they win elections and gain control of the government, so that they can control or eliminate elections. It is common to hear people claim that the democratic program of Islamically identified groups is ""One man, one vote, one time."" Many identify the AKP as ""Islamist"" and critics argue that the long-term program of the party is to use democracy to subvert the Turkish secular state and ultimately to establish state enforcement of a traditional version of sharia. Party leaders reject that charge, viewing the AKP as a socially conservative democratic organization. They note that the AKP has been elected in democratic elections and held power in Turkey since it gained a parliamentary majority in the 2002 elections. After more than a decade of AKP government, the 2015 elections showed that the ""Islamists"" had not taken away the ability of the political opposition to make significant gains in elections. It is ""one man, one vote, more than one time.""""One man, one vote, more than one time.""The refutation of the old ""one man, one vote, one time"" mantra is strengthened by recent elections in Tunisia as well. In Tunisia, following the overthrow of the secular dictatorial regime of Ben Ali, the ""Islamist"" party, Ennahda, won the first round of elections and established a new government. However, the Ennahda-led government faced major economic and politics problems and popular discontent grew. The party did not use extralegal means to remain in power but, instead, held elections in 2014, which brought to power a new government led by an old-line secularist named Beji Caid Essebsi. Although Ennahda lost the elections, the longtime leader of the party, Rachid Ghannouchi led a celebration in which he proclaimed: ""What are we celebrating today? We are celebrating freedom! We are celebrating Tunisia! We are celebrating democracy!"" Ghannouchi has been an advocate of democracy throughout his long career as a student activist, a political exile and as a political leader in post-Arab Spring Tunisia.Islamic activists include both strong advocates of democracy and supporters of authoritarian rule. However, that spectrum is similar to the spectrum of advocates of secularism. Some of the most brutal authoritarian dictatorships in the Muslim world and elsewhere have been secularist in their political ideology. The major dictators who were overthrown in the Arab Spring -- Ben Ali in Tunisia and Mubarak in Egypt -- led basically secularist regimes, as did Saddam Hussein in Iraq. In the current world of Middle Eastern politics, the self-consciously anti-Islamist regime that came to power through a military coup in Egypt in 2013 guarantees itself victory in elections, with Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi winning 97 percent of the vote in 2014 presidential elections. In the reputedly authoritarian Islamist regime in Iran, on the other hand, the winner of the recent parliamentary elections, Hassan Rouhani, received almost 51 percent of the vote in an election that was actually contested. It is possible to see in this development a strengthening of the longstanding progressive Islamic democratic movement that is more than a century old in Iran.The relationships between Islam and democracy after the Arab Spring are complex and changing in important ways. In the late 20th century, much attention was given to the question of whether or not Islam and democracy are compatible. This was an old debate that had been presented in many different ways. However, by the second decade of the 21st century, the terms of the debate have an anachronistic feeling, even though some people, both within and without the Muslim world, continue to repeat the old slogans. ""Some of the most brutal authoritarian dictatorships in the Muslim world and elsewhere have been secularist in their political ideology.""For the majority of Muslims in the world, the issue is settled. They see no real contradiction between Islam and democracy. The major debates are about what forms Muslim democracy can take, with a growing recognition that a democratic Muslim state may take many different forms. The real battles and civil conflicts are not between advocates of a ""religious"" state and advocates of a ""secular"" state. The profound struggles are between progressive democratic visions, whether secularist or religious, and authoritarianism, whether secularist or religious. The secularist dictatorship in Egypt suppresses all opposition, whether Islamist or secular, while the extremist Islamists leading the so-called Islamic State create a brutal authoritarian regime. At the same time, major Islamic movements and secularist political groups cooperate in successful democratic systems in many parts of the Muslim world, from Senegal to Indonesia. Recent elections in Turkey and Tunisia should be effective reminders that Islam and democracy are not incompatible."

Morton)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb803581f0000df00252fc9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I was already reeling from the video of Dominican citizens cutting the hair of a Haitian man with scissors as a crowd ridiculed him in the street for his dark skin. I prayed that the baseball bats and machetes would not be swung. I was already struck speechless by the report of an undocumented detainee found with a sock down his throat and 200 others on hunger strike protesting their incarceration at a for-profit prison in Arizona. I was already burdened by the pain from #transracial, the estimated estimated 500 people who could die in police custody this summer alone, and the truly tragic state of Black and Latino men in the prison system in America. And then, I was setting my alarm to go to sleep last night and I heard what happened in Charleston. At first no one was reporting the shooting and then the stream of details turned into a river as the rest of world caught of up with the reality of racism in America. I am sad. I'm so sad I didn't know what to do when friends reached out. So sad, I didn't know how to respond to Twitter feeds and sympathy. So sad because I'm so tired of shouting that we are being killed and no one seems to notice. So if this is the first time you're taking a look at the plight of black Americans in this country. Here are some things that would be really helpful.1. Acknowledge that is not an isolated incident. Please know that the violence against and within the black community didn't stop with the end slavery, it has been constant since our extraction from Africa. There are systems and structures in our country and the world that perpetuate pain and brokenness worthy of our anger and lament.Here are two great resources.What is Systemic Racism? What is Cultural Appropriation?2. Please stop talking and listen. Take a moment to listen to those people in pain and who are immobilized by grief and wrestling with anger and rage because of the unrelenting flow of events against black and brown people in the world. The greatest gift that you can give is your silent, attentive presence. 3. Ask yourself, ""why didn't I do this earlier?"" Take a moment to ask yourself, why didn't I care about this earlier? Why didn't I ask these questions when Trayvon was killed? Or Michael Brown? Or Walter Scott? Or Tamir Rice? Or Amadou Diallo? Or Sean Bell? And the list goes on...And please don't say, ""those were different"" and minimize our collective suffering. (See point 1.) Ask yourself the following:What fears, assumptions, or cultural narratives have kept you from exploring your own ethnic identity and the stories of those different from you?How have you actively participated in or passively allowed systems of oppression to continue against marginalized people?4. Lament and Repent Cry. Write down what you are angry, sad, and afraid of and weep. Because an Susie Jackson, an 87-year old woman who lived through Jim Crow did not deserve to die at the hands of Dylann Roof. Ask God for forgiveness. It is a violation of our purposes in this world as people made in the image of God to flourish, work, rule and create when we crush the image of God in other people implicitly or explicitly by actively participating in systems and structures oppress the poor and marginalized or passively allowing them to continue. God of all mercy,We confess that we have sinned against you, opposing your will in our lives.We have denied your goodness in each other, in ourselves, and in the world you have created.We repent of the evil that enslaves us, the evil we have done, and the evil done on our behalf. Forgive, restore, and strengthen us through our Savior Jesus Christ, that we may abide in your love and serve only your will.Amen.5. Pursue Racial Reconciliation  Take a moment to explore your own ethnic identity and celebrate the gifts that God has given you. To say you don't have an ethnic identity is a lie. And to say you're just going to pick on is to be disingenuous. Follow the steps from this amazing article by Cristina Cleveland. 6. Learn to forgive and be forgiven You will hurt people and say ignorant and hurtful things. And then you should ask for forgiveness. You will hear hurtful and ignorant words and be hurt. And then you will extend forgiveness. Extending grace and receiving grace is the right response to the radical grace that God extended towards us. It is a difficult, sacrificial one, but the only one that leads to peace and reconciliation.I am still sad but I am comforted by these words which I believe wholeheartedly to be to be true. My prayer is that you would believe them as well. Because my only consolation is knowing that this world is not all there is and Jesus has much more in store for those murdered praising His name. 1 Thes 4:13-1613 But we do not want you to be uninformed, brethren, about those who are asleep, so that you will not grieve as do the rest who have no hope. 14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who have fallen asleep [k]in Jesus. 15 For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive [l]and remain until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep. 16 For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a [m]shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. 17 Then we who are alive [n]and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall always be with the Lord. 18 Therefore comfort one another with these words."

In the past 12 months my brother has been harassed by police twice. Once with a gun pointed directly at his chest. He wonders why the color of his skin makes him a target when all he wants to do is play ball in his neighborhood.My sister, she occasionally has nightmares. In her nightmares police officers are hunting down and killing innocent black people. Our family gets separated and that is when she wakes up. She wonders if her dreams have meaning. A trail of black bodies lay in the memory of our consciousness causing trauma, stress, and anxiety. But instead of mustering up the empathy to say a simple, ""I can't imagine how you must feel,"" many non-black millennials stay silent, make excuses, or undermine the reality of racism.As I attempt to put words to paper in the wake of the Charleston Massacre at Emanuel A.M.E church, I find that the words don't come as easily as the tears? But I have to write anyway.I don't have the luxury of silence. So even though the eloquent words that speak to my college education currently fail me, today, I am not looking for credibility through credentials. My goal is singular: to give insight to Millennials at large on how the rhetoric of color blindness and the consistent invisibility of black social justice issues fuels a deep racial chasm that will not be mended by ignoring race. Today, I just need you to FEEL where I'm coming from instead of reaching for excuses or invalidating my life experience. As Millennials champion the front lines of social media activism, Facebook and Twitter have become more than just a space to tell people about your day. For me, and many others I'm sure, social media is a place to learn about socio-political events, share thoughts, and engage ideas. In these spaces, it is becoming more and more difficult to deal with the noisy excuses, the apathetic silence, and the absence of empathy that abounds. In the era of the Black Lives Matter Movement, Black Millennials are fed up with our counterparts who time and time again say that they do not see race. I will not tolerate such willful intellectual negligence. And to be quite honest, there is nothing in me that can understand it as benign ignorance. In the Black Lives Matter Movement and all social justice movements, silence is violence. And we are tired of hearing color blindness as an excuse for not having uncomfortable conversations.I can understand how difficult it is to believe that an entire group of people are targeted, killed, and denied justice all because of skin color in the 21st century.Blah. Blah. Blah. The truth is, I ACTUALLY CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND. But I find myself pretending that I do. I find myself engaging in conversations empathizing with white people when I am the one hurting, and they cannot return the favor. It is beyond baffling and this blatant refusal to acknowledge the role of race in America is not a credit to Millennials, even though many often wear it as a badge of honor. Be clear that your silence does not make you part of an imaginary post racial utopian society. it makes you complicit. While I know that generalizations do not represent all individuals, it certainly creates a narrative. Let me tell you what I see. Everyone can get involved in the Ice Bucket Challenge, but cannot mobilize around #blacklivesmatterEveryone is in an uproar when a puppy is mistreated, but says that human beings should do as their told to avoid getting killed by the police. Everyone shows concern for a young white man who kills 9 black people in a church, but kills a black man with a toy gun on site even though gun possession is legal. These stories are just a small drop in the bucket that make me think that Millennials are not color blind, they just cannot be compelled to empathize with situations that call into question the privilege of whiteness. And to be honest, I hate the term white privilege. To me, it implies that being treated like a human being is a privilege. And while I cannot accept that basic humanity is a privilege, I have a long list of names that prove this to be true. I want to be clear that black people are not begging for acceptance or understanding. The point is to expose the hypocrisy and idiocy of color blindness in an era where people are being gunned down every other week. If you want to care, seek to understand rather than explain away. But if you do care, DON""T CARE! Just don't pretend like you cannot see what is going on because we are not accepting ignorance as an excuse. And if you plan on saying anything other than, I feel you... just, don't. -Latasha KinnardFeaturing the Millennial Voice of Latasha Kinnard gives us a black millennial generation perspective adding to the important conversation of the crucial civil rights times we are in.

The killing of Black people in the Mother Emanuel AME Church is an act of terrorism, and will go down in infamy as the Charleston Massacre. This heinous crime of shooting Black people in the midst of a Bible study in church is just one more dramatic example of how racism is deeply infused in the United States. As the global moderator for Metropolitan Community Churches (MCC), founded to welcome LGBTQ people, we know what it is to have our people murdered and our churches burned. We know that these acts are acts of terrorism are based on hate and intended to dominate whole swaths of people. We grieve for the families who lost loved ones in this massacre. We grieve for all those who are victims of racist systems. We grieve for our country built on racism. Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church of Charleston, South Carolina, was the site of the shooting. It is one of the oldest Black churches in the South and is no stranger to hate. White slave owners burned Emanuel AME in 1822 when founding church member, Denmark Vesey, attempted to organize a slave rebellion. Now, once again, this historically Black church must endure racist violence.We stand to say all racial terrorism must stop. If White people admit that our privileges are grounded in endemic racism, there might be a chance to turn things around.I do not speak alone. I speak as part of a diverse community with members in dozens of countries and from many races. My colleague Rev. Darlene Garner, head of emerging ministries with responsibility for diversity in MCC, is a woman of African descent and says:""As an African American woman, I know we have not come very far when a 21-year old man can sit in a Bible study for an hour and then announce that he was there to ""kill black people."" He spewed racial hate and executed African Americans in their own church--starting with an 87-year-old woman.""In the United States we say 'Remember 911,' 'Remember Normandy,' 'Remember the Holocaust,' but when we remember our history of slavery and racism, too many people say, 'Get over it!' ""We will never forget the Charleston Massacre. ""As a Black child, I learned about Juneteenth, a Black celebration that few in the dominant culture know about. This year is the 150th anniversary of Juneteenth , when the news that slavery was over reached African Americans in Galveston, Texas--two and a half years after the Emancipation Declaration was signed.""The Charleston Massacre taking place during the season of Juneteenth is a clear and undeniable reminder that not everyone knows that slavery and racial tyranny are over. African Americans have now been legally free for more than 150 years, but racist systems of lynching, redlining, voter suppression, poverty, imprisonment, and massacres have continued to enforce racism from then until today. ""The Charleston Massacre is not an incidental act of senseless violence by a disturbed young man. It is an example of the racism taught to generation after generation and reinforced by seemingly color-blind policies that systematically deny the humanity of people of color.""Institutionalized racism raised another one of its ugly hydra heads in 2013. At the same moment SCOTUS made history by ruling to allow same-sex couples in California to marry, they gutted the Voting Rights Act of 1965. This month, the Supreme Court may make marriage equality the law of the land, but this country's pact with racism overshadows everything. Any celebration will be dulled by the ongoing grief we feel for the human family.""People in the United States who wield power have a choice. Will we evolve into massive change for a more just society with checks and monitoring of historically racist practices, or will we devolve into ever expanding violent terrorism against people of color? It is up to us. ""If we as a country would fall to our knees in repentance, and then rise to challenge the underlying racism that pervades this country, change would be possible. The Charleston Massacre could become a historic turning point. ""For Metropolitan Community Churches, founded almost 50 years ago as a haven from homophobia, this most recent act of racial terrorism reminds us that people of all colors, classes, and creeds must remain vigilant, because, as Dr. King said, 'No one is free, until we all are free.'"""

This way, you can determine if it even makes sense to register. Depending on the size of the event, one competitor shouldn't make a difference.",2015-06-22,2015-06-20-1434825520-7920009-BusinessNetworking3PeopleTalking.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-20-1434825520-7920009-BusinessNetworking3PeopleTalking-thumb.jpg,"What if you're at a networking event and you bump into someone that does what you do?Great question!Of course, if you're a financial advisor, broker, rep, agent, or producer, and you go to an association meeting in your industry, you expect to bump into others in your profession. But usually at meetings like that, your goal is to learn, improve the profession and/or industry, socialize, or perhaps give back in some way.But if you're at business meeting like a networking group or chamber mixer and your goal is to prospect, it can be unnerving to bump into someone that does exactly what you do. Heck, you may find yourself in a bitter struggle for territory. Power. Control. Rights. Success. Revenge. Freedom. Kind of like outlaws. Bikers. Street gangs. Mafia families. Warlords. Drug cartels. Late night talk show hosts. Turf wars, baby!Sorry. The reality is, you can't make your competitors go away. Just ask Letterman! But you can make the best out of a less than perfect situation. And, if the competition makes you better at what you do, everybody wins. Including your clients. If nothing else, competitors that are more successful than you show you what is possible. When it comes to the competition, here are some seven suggestions to consider!Do Your Homework When possible, before going to events, learn about who will be in attendance. This way, you can determine if it even makes sense to register. Depending on the size of the event, one competitor shouldn't make a difference. But if it does, you can opt out and go to another event. If it doesn't make a difference to you (for whatever reason) then, when meeting your counterpart, simply be social and use the opportunity to compare notes. Be positive, upbeat, and complimentary. Keep the lines of communication open. You never know!There's Enough Business for Everyone In most cases, there's enough apple pie for everyone. And another whole pie right behind that! You couldn't possible service every client in your marketplace, but it is fun to think about. If most of your focus is to work with small business owners, do a search for all the small businesses in your particular geography (maybe within a 50-mile radius) and you'll see what I mean. Remember, there are only so many hours in day. Relax and have some pie. Create a Niche If you can focus on a specific industry, profession, marketplace, geography, demographic, or dynamic, you can become a big fish (in some cases the only fish) in a much smaller pond. I just finished a one-day seminar on power-lifting through my Crossfit gym (or box as we call it). Diane Fu, the woman that taught the seminar, traveled to NJ from San Francisco. She also ran full day seminars in Philadelphia and Boston before traveling home. Since everyone paid for the seminar, she made a good piece of change. Diane created a powerful niche that has given her celebrity status in the world of Crossfit. What pond should you be fishing in? Collaborate If you happen to find yourself face to face with a competitor, use it as an opportunity to compare notes and discuss best practices. Be open and honest. In some cases, you may find that you aren't direct competitors and there is only some overlap. Maybe they're industry specific or deal with a different type of client. They could be in a different phase of their career. Perhaps there are opportunities to do joint work or refer one another business for various reasons. If it becomes awkward or weird to speak with someone that seems to do what you do, offer them good luck and simply move on. Always be Complimentary Saying great things about others in your field makes you look good. Never be disrespectful or speak negatively about those that might be in your profession. In fact, try not to be negative about anyone period! It makes you appear unsure of yourself and jealous. Offer a compliment when possible and talk about the things you know they do well if appropriate. Here's the exception. If a colleague is going to do business with someone that you know lacks ability and/or ethics, that's a good time to say, ""I don't mean to come across as unprofessional about one of my counterparts. But may I share something with you in good faith?""Get Involved If you're part of the local chamber or another networking related group, get involved with a committee, serve on a Board, be in a leadership role, fundraise, or help recruit members. By doing so, you'll help a lot of people, make friends, and get something accomplished while getting a lot of visibility. Those that tend to be movers and shakers outside of their business tend to be movers and shakers inside their business. What a great way to stand out from the competition!Be a Connector Connectors know everyone! If you spend a good portion of your marketing time getting to know other business owners while helping them get what they want, they'll help you (not your competitors) get what you want. In fact, spend time with more connectors. Just don't look at everyone you meet at an event as a prospect. Focus on learning and helping and the prospecting will take care of itself. Keep this in mind! Even if you do all the right things, some of your competitors will feel uncomfortable to be around you. Especially if you're great at what you do, run a successful practice, have a strong personality, and have the ability to develop important relationships. There's nothing you can do about that. What you can do is always strive to not feel threatened and use every opportunity to learn, develop your skills, serve your clients, and help others do the same. Your prospects, clients, and referral sources will always notice!"

Clearly people are looking to get meat smart.",2015-06-22,2015-06-22-1435011799-3651244-LowSlow2PitmasterPorchetta.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-22-1435011799-3651244-LowSlow2PitmasterPorchetta-thumb.jpg,"Just in time for BBQ season, New Orleans food writer Colleen Rush and beloved Chicago Barn & Co. pit master Gary Wiviott have come out with the book Low & Slow 2: The Art of Barbecue, Smoke-Roastings and Basic Curing. Clearly people are looking to get meat smart, a term I've borrowed from Rush who is also the author of The Mere Mortal's Guide to Fine Dining.To get your mouth watering, see one of Rush's favorite recipes in the book: Smoked New Orleans-Style Barbecue Shrimp which she says is ""inspired by the New Orleans classic, but with an added touch of wood smoke to give the traditional black pepper/Worcestershire/butter a rustic note.""Favorite number two, pictured above, Rush says is ""Pitmaster Porchetta (what my co-author now refers to as his 'favorite vegetable;' it's a show-stopper. It's a riff on the traditional Italian porchetta. A brined pork tenderloin rolled inside pork belly with really vibrant fresh herbs -- smoked low and slow, then crisped to give it a smoky, fatty, crispy exterior. It's a ridiculously tasty smoked pork torpedo.""If pork torpedoes even need a follow-up, there's Pakistani Hunter Beef which she describes as Pakistani pastrami. ""This is one of the most unusual and interesting recipes; it combines a technique that turns a regular, brined corned beef into smoked pastrami, delicious in its own right, but instead of using the traditional herbs/spices of pastrami (heavy coriander, black peppercorns), we asked a Chicago food writer, Mike Sula, also a James Beard award-winner, to develop a hunter beef rub -- cumin, coriander, chile pepper, ginger, cinnamon, cardamom,"" Rush describes. ""He'd been writing about hunter beef found in Pakistani restaurants around Chicago, and the rub he developed is tasty. Not as salty as typical hunter beef, totally unusual, and definitely not your typical barbecue book recipe.""The book isn't the typical barbecue recipe read, Rush explains. ""Just like the first one, it is a book about learning the true ""secret"" to barbecue -- building a clean fire, controlling airflow in your cooker. The recipes are great, but its the step-by-step method of learning how to cook with charcoal and control the temperature in a grill or smoker that makes it different. ""So many barbecue books say, 'Start a fire, run the cooker at 250*F for 10 hours,' but nobody tells you HOW to do that. It starts with the right charcoal load for your cooker, building a good fire, and adjusting the cooker's vents to control the airflow and grate temperature. We give a separate set of cooking instructions for four different cookers (the Big Green Egg, the Weber Smokey Mountain, an offset cooker, and the kettle grill). "" With some help from Low & Slow 2, I feel meat smarter already."
