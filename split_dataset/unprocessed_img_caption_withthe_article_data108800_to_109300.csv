Patrick Rowan said in a letter to Geller.Geller writes a blog criticizing Islam. Her group, American Freedom Defense Initiative, paid for a six-ad series scheduled to run for a month on the city's mass transit system.The ads, including one showing Foley in the video of his beheading released in August, suggest that Islam is inherently violent and extremist, and call for the end of American aid to Islamic countries.""Having lived in and reported from communities in which nearly everyone was of Muslim faith, he had great respect for the religion and those who practiced it,"" the Foley family lawyer wrote, referring to the journalist.""The advertisement you are preparing to run seems to convey the message that ordinary practitioners of Islam are a dangerous threat. This message is entirely inconsistent with Mr. Foley's reporting and his beliefs.""Foley, 40, was kidnapped by armed men in Syria in 2012. Islamic State has seized parts of Syria and Iraq.Geller's lawyer said the image will be replaced out of ""compassion for the family's pain and anguish.""New York City politicians and religious leaders last week criticized the ad campaign, saying no faith should be subject to attack ads and calling it an attempt to divide the city.Geller was behind a similar ad campaign in 2012 on the city's transport system, which was initially rejected by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, a state agency. A federal judge later decided that the MTA's rule against ads that demeaned race, gender, religion or several other categories was unconstitutional.The MTA has since revised its standard, and so-called viewpoint ads like Geller's now run with a large disclaimer saying the MTA does not endorse the views expressed."

""In all fairness, it was their show, so I said if we can't do this, this and this, I'd like to be released, and they said you're released.""The trainer didn't elaborate on the specific changes she requested, but it seems likely that some of them were related to how the series depicted her treatment of contestants on the show.

I never know how to answer that question and it usually occurs when someone notices my kid throwing a tantrum in public, so I wonder if they really mean it.Honestly, I don't do it all, and even when I am accomplishing a lot I still feel like I'm falling short.Sometimes it seems to be happening all at once. Sometimes just two dance classes a week land you in traffic for an extra three hours. Sometimes there's a fight in your daughter's school, so you are taking off work to volunteer in the classroom. Sometimes there's a lice outbreak and you need to do daily checks to see if the little pests hitched a ride that day on the hair train. Sometimes you are working two jobs and your husband's working three.Then there are other times when you are putting all your extra beans into something to see if you can make it grow and possibly sacrificing other areas you really should be taking care of.When life is moving so fast and you have to check three times to make sure you actually put the baby in the car you can think, This is too much.Maybe it is.One minute a child is driving me nuts and the next she brings a feeling to my heart that swells it with pride, but because she drove me nuts, does that mean I'm a bad mom?We are bombarded in our society with the idea that if we go on vacation we will be happy. Really good wine, that will make us happy. A new car will solve it. What if I move to another city or buy a trendy blouse?Life is funny and weird and exciting and a lot to deal with all at once.I guess it's OK to feel all the emotions that come with life. I guess if we are feeling them that can indicate to us we are alive. I'd rather feel something than nothing.Can you do or have it all? For the past two weeks I did... well, sort of. I had some warm and loving time with my children, success at my work, for a few hours my house stayed clean and one day I got to exercise. I even went on a date with my husband.I think the lie we are fed is that you have to have it all at the same time. That if you are not in a constant state of happiness and bliss with a clean house, well-behaved children and a fat bank account, something must be wrong.Maybe one day the house is going to be messy, but you are going to have an extra 40 minutes to drive your daughter to ballet. On another day that floor is going to be spotless, but the kids watched too much TV. Sometimes your husband may be working way too much, but you can finally afford to buy some extras without feeling you're cutting into rent money.What if doing it all means one day you did one thing right and the next you did two?Recently, I've found cleaning to be grounding. It's a completely foreign feeling as normally I hate it, but the feel of a freshly washed floor under my feet, which is a direct and finite result of my physical action, makes me feel in control.I've found I need to choose what's important for both my short term and long term goals and not allow real or imagined failures, overwhelm or guilt stop me from taking the next step upward.Life has actually gotten more hectic since school started. I don't understand the idea that the kids being in school makes things easier. Homework, lice outbreaks, school meetings, after-school activities, my own job, it has all ramped up to a rather high-pitched roar of activity.This week I kept all the plates spinning by finding one thing I could control. I could wash the floor.This week I was totally in control of one thing.Maybe next week it will be two, but for now, I'm going to feel the floor beneath my feet.This post originally appeared on Our Urban Playground.

Combined.",2014-09-29,"SAN FRANCISCO, CA - JANUARY 31: Cuts of beef are displayed at Marina Meats on January 31, 2012 in San Francisco, California. Severe drought is a contributing factor in the declining cattle count, which has sent wholesale beef prices up 6.4 percent in the past 12 months. The price for a pound of beef peaked in price at $1.98 a pound on November 23, the highest price since 2004. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13de32400005400e4792e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A few years ago, I was talking with Al Gore (yes, I'm name dropping). I asked him a very simple and pointed question: ""Animal agriculture contributes about 18 percent of the gases that cause climate change. Why didn't you mention this in your book or movie?"" His answer was disconcertingly honest. I'm paraphrasing, but he said: ""For most people, the role of animal agriculture in climate change is too inconvenient of a truth."" We like our animal products. Well, you like your animal products. I've been a vegan for 28 years, so to be honest, I don't even remember what they taste like. But collectively, as a species, we seem to like animal products. A lot. To wit: Each year, the U.S. grows and kills about 10 billion livestock animals. Globally, we're raising and slaughtering about 56 billion animals each year. If you do the math, that means we're killing 1,776 animals for food every second of every day. That doesn't even include fish and other seafood.But even though I'm a vegan for ethical reasons, I don't want to write about the animal ethics of animal agriculture. I want to write about the ways in which animal agriculture is killing us and ruining our planet.I know, that sounds like left-wing hyperbole. ""It's killing our planet!"" But sometimes what sounds like hyperbole is just the clear-eyed truth. I'll start with climate change.The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations released a conservative report wherein they stated that animal agriculture causes about 18 percent of current greenhouse gas emissions. To put this into perspective: animal agriculture is responsible for more climate change gases than every car, boat, train and airplane on the planet, combined. But we like our animals -- or at least growing and eating them. So we make the trade-off: animal products for climate change.Climate is complicated. And climate change is complicated. But the role of animal agriculture in climate change is simple. And how about famine? There are over 7,000,000,000 people on the planet, and many of them are very hungry. Article after article and book after book ask the question: ""How will we feed a planet of 7 or 8 or 9 billion people?"" The discussions turn to fertilizer, GMOs and arable land. But here's a painfully simple idea: stop feeding human food to livestock. It takes around 15 pounds of grain to make one pound of beef -- which can feed a couple people for a few hours. In comparison, 13 pounds of grain fed to humans directly can feed 13 people for most of the day.  Animal agriculture is responsible for more climate change gases than every car, boat, train and airplane on the planet, combined.Globally, we don't have a famine problem; we have a livestock problem. Feeding food to animals and then eating the animals is kind of like heating your house during the winter by burning wood outside. Speaking of winters: a few years ago, tired of cold winters in New York, I moved to California. Last year in L.A., we had around 362 beautiful days of sunshine. It was 80 degrees on Christmas, and there wasn't a cloud in the sky. Which is great, apart from the fact that California and most of the West are now experiencing the worst drought in recorded history. As Californians, we've been asked to take shorter showers and use less water on our lawns. Both are good ideas. But let's put this into perspective: a 10-minute shower uses around 30 gallons of water, whereas it takes 660 gallons to create a one-third-pound hamburger. More than 90 percent of the water in California goes to agriculture. Some agriculture is very water responsible. It takes about 216 gallons of water to make one pound of soybeans, for example. But other agriculture is egregiously water-intensive -- including rice and cotton but especially animal agriculture. Each pound of chicken requires about 500 gallons of water, and pork requires about 576 gallons of water. Personally, I'd like to make a deal with California. I'll take much shorter showers if you stop subsidizing water use for livestock. If I just jumped in the shower and bathed quickly, I could even get it down to five gallons of water per shower. And after 132 quick showers, I would've used as much water as is needed to create a one-third-pound hamburger. Personally, I'd like to make a deal with California. I'll take much shorter showers if you stop subsidizing water use for livestock.The 56,000,000,000 livestock animals on the planet are also making tons of feces and urine every year — three times as much as humans. Here’s a specific comparison: the good people of Philadelphia create roughly 1,000,000 tons of urine and feces per year. And one, only one, large pig farm will produce roughly 1,600,000 tons of urine and feces per year.Our lakes and rivers are being fouled with algae blooms. Our groundwater is being polluted. And the main culprit is livestock. It's also fouling our homes. A University of Arizona study found more residual feces and waste in the average omnivore's kitchen than in his toilet bowl, largely due to fecal bacteria from raw meat. The animals spend their lives in their own feces and urine, and when they're killed and packaged, they bring their feces and urine with them. Into your home. They also bring pesticides, antibiotics, growth hormones, cholesterol and saturated fat. One large pig farm annually creates 600,000 tons more urine and feces than the good people of Philadelphia.To that end: if we collectively stopped eating animals and animal products tomorrow, studies suggest we'd see a drop in obesity, heart disease, diabetes and some cancers. We don't have a global health epidemic; we have a global livestock epidemic. Too much of the Western world health care budgets go to curing people of diseases caused by the consumption of animal products.When I talk to people about animal agriculture and meat eating, people often say, ""But meat is inexpensive."" And it is -- but only because it's heavily subsidized by our tax dollars. In the U.S., we spend billions of dollars in subsidies to grain farmers, whose crops feed livestock. Billions of our tax dollars subsidize an industry that hurts our environment and health. In addition to everything else, saving the best for last, animal agriculture also brings zoonotic diseases. ""Zoonotic"" sounds like an erudite part of a zoo, where the animals read books and live on boats. But zoonotic diseases are not fun or fancy. Some zoonotic diseases you might be familiar with: E. coli, salmonella, SARS, Bird Flu, Ebola and even some old standards like the flu and the common cold. Zoonotic diseases come from animals, including livestock. Luckily, thus far, we've been able to treat most zoonotic diseases with antibiotics. But here's the rub: animals on factory farms are so sick, and in such bad shape, that antibiotics are all that's keeping them from dying before they're slaughtered. The animals are fed obscene amounts of antibiotics while they're alive, and these antibiotics are then found in their milk, eggs and meat.When you're eating an animal, you're eating the fat and the muscle but you're also eating all of the antibiotics the animal has been fed during its life. As a result, animal agriculture contributes to our growing human problem of antibiotic resistance. It has helped create superbugs who don’t respond to conventional antibiotics. We don't have a global health epidemic; we have a global livestock epidemic.That's the fun world of animal agriculture. As a species, we are faced with complicated and seemingly intractable problems (like curing baldness). So let’s focus on a doable solution: ending animal agriculture.All we have to do is stop subsidizing it and stop buying animal products. And climate change gases are reduced by about 18 percent.Famine could end. Fresh water could become clean and more abundant. Deaths from heart disease, diabetes, obesity and some cancers could be reduced. And zoonotic diseases could be reduced.We've done hard things in the past. We've ended slavery. We've given everyone the right to vote. We've passed legislation prohibiting children from working in factories. We're even moving towards a time when cigarette smoking will be seen as a foul distant memory.We can do this. We have to. Our reliance on animal agriculture is literally killing us and ruining our climate and our planet. I'll end by quoting Albert Einstein: ""Nothing will benefit human health and increase the chances for survival of life on Earth as much as the evolution to a vegetarian diet."""
8,IMPACT,Breaking Bread for Peace: Conflict Kitchen and Cultural Food Diplomacy,"Vanessa Thevathasan, ContributorFreelance writer, Independent Consultant on the Rights and Pro...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/breaking-bread-for-peace-_b_5875744.html,"Food is one of the oldest forms of exchange, with yet untapped recognition to deliver social conflict transformation.",2014-09-29,2014-09-24-debateencourgaedatburmeseconflictkitcheninHoxtonjeffgilbert.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-09-24-debateencourgaedatburmeseconflictkitcheninHoxtonjeffgilbert-thumb.jpg,"Food diplomacy initiatives are increasingly being recognized as a successful means to open up peace dialogue as a result of our increasingly cosmopolitan palettes. Food is one of the oldest forms of exchange, with yet untapped recognition to deliver social conflict transformation. With this in mind, International Alert's Conflict Kitchen London opens up a new avenue to pursue peace dialogue by taking people on a tantalizing journey exploring new culinary experiences. With the renewed openness and organic quality that food elicits, Conflict Kitchen London can help promote better community engagement around the complex interchange of cultures, religions and ethnicities in one of the most multicultural cities of the world. Food is a natural convener of people, and the favorite place for discussion is where food is made and served, the kitchen. Yet, rarely do people have conversations about the food they eat, where the ingredients have come from, the detailed preparation it may have needed or the politics behind cuisines. Food and the kitchen are often under-utilized avenues for cultivating peace dialogue within our own community. To this end, International Alert has opened a pop-up Conflict Kitchen during its Talking Peace Festival to mark International Peace Day 21st September.Conflict Kitchen London, in collaboration with London pop-up network, Grub Club, and Monikers Restaurant, has been serving dishes from Burma, Jordan and Peru. On the table for discussion includes Burma's struggle to achieve civilian democracy during its political transition after decades of military rule; Jordan's geopolitical hotspot in the Middle East as the destination for refugees from Israel, Syria and Iraq; and the impact of illegal gold mining on Peru's indigenous people. These countries are often not on our radar for political discussion and even less is known about their national cuisines. Conflict Kitchen has taken the opportunity to initiate conversations about these countries and their food. The globalized market has enabled food from all areas of the globe into our homes and by doing so access to other cultures. By acknowledging the shared space we live in, all people can be included in the exchanges and interactions of another's cultural community, helping to reduce stereotypes and misinformed narratives of particular communities. London is one of the most multicultural capitals of the world, and it is this vibrancy and cross-section of cultures and ethnicities that provides the platform for open and frank discussions about other countries by thinking global, acting local. Conflict Kitchen London embodies this thinking for a better world through enhanced civil engagement using food as a medium. Indeed, a meta-analysis of 515 studies that was carried out by Thomas Pettigrew et al in 2011 found that ""intergroup contact typically reduces prejudices.""The increasing number of pop-up kitchens in the United States is certainly testament to this finding. Conflict Kitchen in Pittsburgh, America, is the brainchild of Jon Rubin and Dawn Weleski that seeks to stimulate political awareness by serving cuisines from Iran, Afghanistan, Venezuela and North Korea, all countries that the United States is in conflict with. Artist Michael Rakowitz created the Enemy Kitchen in 2007, using food to open critical dialogue around the war in Iraq. His project invited students and adults to cook and share a meal together, all of which was made using recipes from his Jew-Iraqi mother. The practice of eating together allows all sectors of the community to have an input in discussions, and as such becomes ""a public act that enlists and audience as vital collaborators in the production of meaning (Rakowitz).""The idea of food as a connector of people and communities has been well recognized in many cultures. In Afghanistan, the saying ""I have had water and salt in your home,"" means that through food eaten together ""we are bonded to one another."" Food is a powerful broker of peace and used as a source to resolve conflicts in many villages across Afghanistan. International Alert's Director of Emerging Programmes, Phil Champain, recognizes the power of food rituals as tools for conflict resolution. The practice of food rituals across the Middle East encourages forgiveness and reconciliation through sharing a meal between offender and victim, cooked and hosted by the perpetrators family. Community peace is created through musafaha (hand-shaking), and mumalaha (breaking bread together). Such practices underpin the idea behind Conflict Kitchen London.This is not to say that food is always a source of unity. As the infamous hummus wars between Lebanon and Israel indicate, food is equally a point of contention and competition for national legitimacy. Food can pull communities apart as a result of the intense national narratives that they are often imbued with. Hummus embodies such division: in 2008, Lebanon entered the Guinness Book of Records by creating the world's largest hummus plate topped with the Lebanese flag to solidify its position as the original owner of the traditional dish. Projects like Conflict Kitchen London seek to overcome such hostilities between cultures, and move to collectively embrace food as a welcoming entry point to more comfortably discuss difficult topics of national and political significance. Therefore, the offer to share food is a gesture much deeper than is often realized. It is far from trivial or frivolous, as it may seem, after all food is a basic necessity and an everyday presence in our lives. Yet, national cuisines are flavored with history and seasoned with culture that is both fascinating and educational. It is one of the easiest routes towards galvanising cultural diplomacy, the ""exchange of ideas, values, traditions and other aspects of culture or identity"" (Institute of Cultural Diplomacy.) Conflict Kitchen London's invitation to share in the experiences of other's is effectively using food to open the door to national and international forms of cultural diplomacy. Diplomatic food actions make an important contribution towards peace dialogue. Food is a great story-telling device that encourages and inspires people to talk, engage and learn from other people's thoughts, history and experiences. People often feel uncomfortable talking about politics with strangers in public. Conflict Kitchen ensures that a safe space is created so that people are included in civil engagements around political discussions, not just to express themselves but to also learn from each other. During Burma Week, the kitchen, based in Hoxton Square in Hackney, was decorated with artwork by Syrian artist Tarek Tuma and Pure Evil produced for the Festival and large shared tables allowed for conversations to open with ease, with fact cards providing useful talking points. Burmese chef Debbie Riehl underlines the importance of the Conflict Kitchen London: ""I am convinced that sharing a meal can be a vehicle for discussing important global issues that affect us all.""By generating cultural inclusion and understanding through projects like Conflict Kitchen London, greater cross-cultural communication and engagement will help build bridges to other people's world view that is little known or understood. Instead of food being a point of division or competition, food needs to be seen as a commodity across the globe that unites people. The success of Conflict Kitchen London clearly shows the importance of food in bringing people together to find common ground. It also reminds us of the need to recognize and capitalize on the inherent diversity of food and cuisines as a staple of community cultural diplomacy. The project has certainly shown the truth in the saying: ""The easiest way to win hearts and minds is through the stomach."" This week is Peru Week."

(AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13de5240000030a51aeb7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Monday that the U.S. should not withdraw its troops from Afghanistan as quickly as it did from Iraq, where extremist group Islamic State, or ISIS, has since gained territory.“We requested to America, regarding the defense withdrawal subject -- please do not repeat the mistake that you did in Iraq,” Modi said during a discussion at the think tank the Council on Foreign Relations.“Because after withdrawal from Iraq, you know what happened there. So the withdrawal process from Afghanistan should be very slow, and only then can we stop the Taliban from emerging its head.”A senior adviser to President Barack Obama said Monday that Afghanistan will sign a deal Tuesday to allow about 10,000 American troops to stay in the country after the international combat mission ends on Dec. 31. The announcement comes after Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai was sworn in Monday as Afghanistan's new president. The same day, extremist violence killed at least 12 civilians and police officers in the country.India is home to the world's second-largest Muslim population, behind Indonesia. When Modi was asked if he is concerned that ISIS or other Muslim extremism could spread to India, he dismissed the possibility.“As far as India is concerned, no matter which community or village a person belongs to, there is a basic philosophy which drives everyone. It is symbolized by Buddha, Mahatma Gandhi. We believe in nonviolence,” Modi said. “That’s in our very nature.”He said Indians are very concerned by terrorism that is has been exported to India. “It’s not homegrown,” he said. “The Muslim in India … will fail al Qaeda.”In a 55-minute video released earlier this month, the current leader of al Qaeda promised to ""raise the flag of jihad"" in India. India issued a security alert in several states after the announcement. Al Qaeda reportedly has no presence on the ground in India, but may be trying to reach  disaffected Muslim youth, especially in Kashmir and Gujarat.Modi, visiting the U.S. for the first time since he took office, will meet with Obama for a private White House dinner Monday night. On Tuesday, they will hold a summit aimed at strengthening U.S.-Indian relations.Prior to this trip, Modi was a denied a U.S. visa for about a decade following the religious riots in 2002 that killed more than 1,000 Muslims in the state of Gujarat, where he was the top official. Modi has denied involvement in the violence, and India’s Supreme Court has said there was no case against him. However, the day before Modi’s arrival in New York, a U.S. federal court issued a summons for him to respond to a lawsuit that accuses him of human rights abuses in connection with the riots. Modi has not responded, and it's unlikely the lawsuit will affect his visit.On Sunday, a whopping 19,000 cheering fans came to see Modi deliver a speech in Madison Square Garden in New York City."

Balvín, 29, who is currently opening for Enrique Iglesias and Pitbull on the ""Sex and Love"" tour, spoke to The Huffington Post after his Sept. 25 performance at Madison Square Garden about life on the road and his nominations. Balvín finds himself far from his native Medellín, but in an earlier interview with HuffPost, the artist said he wanted to show what Colombia could offer the urban genre. ""It's always been my dream to be among the big names of Colombia,"" the singer told HuffPost in August. ""Obviously when they talk about Colombian music [they mention] Juanes, Shakira, Carlos Vives, Jorge Celedón and various other great artists from our country, but I always felt that there needed to be an urban pillar. There's vallenato, there's pop, there's rock, but we need the urban part -- and thankfully we've been able to do it, little by little. Obviously we're still in the process of growth, but there's been a clear vision for the public that there's good urban music coming from Colombia for the world.""Now Balvín finds himself among some of those greats as a Latin Grammy nominee. Juanes and Carlos Vives will be representing the South American country at this year's awards, along with Fonseca, Don Tetto and Doctor Krápula. But Balvín will be the only Colombian artist in an urban category. ""6 AM"" is up for a Latin Grammy as best urban performance and best urban song, while Balvín's ""La Familia"" is up for best urban music album. You were nominated for three Latin Grammys, congratulations. Tell me about how you found out.Actually it was early, at 6 a.m., like the song. [laughs] They called us and I was just overcome by the beautiful feeling of being nominated. I've dreamt about this for many, many years -- I think since I decided to become an artist. It's one of my biggest dreams and, well, we'll have to see what happens. We're still working. That's what's important, to work and keep moving. I was about to say, it's one of the biggest dreams an artist can have. So what's J Balvín's next big dream? So many, there are so many dreams -- [like] filling the Madison Square Garden in a year or two. We're working so we can keep growing, so that people don't just talk about the music but also identify with our mentality of arduous hard work and discipline. In life you always have to keep fighting. It's not easy. Right now you're on tour with Enrique Iglesias and Pitbull, but what artists would you like to collaborate with in the future? Someone who maybe inspired you as a child? There are so many artists that have inspired me. Juan Luis Guerra, Juanes, Pitbull, Enrique -- I admire many things about every great artist.Would you ever collaborate with someone in a drastically different genre? Yeah, I have no problem jumping on any [project] as long as we do it right. You've been on the road with Enrique and Pitbull for over two weeks now. What has the day-to-day been like with these two Latin music greats?Incredible, incredible. They're both super humble, and that speaks to their greatness even more.The 15th Annual Latin Grammy Awards will air November 20, 2014, on Univision."

The oldest were 18 and youngest less than a year old -- they saw it in re-runs.Critics weren't particularly kind to Gilligan's Island. So what! It was a great escapist show which is often the best kind, particularly for a young child. Was it realistic? Of course not. Why would Mrs. Howell have so many different outfits packed for a three-hour tour? Does it really matter? No.Gilligan's Island had characters that all young people could relate to in one fashion or another. However, I must admit that though I'm a Life Coach and work mostly with women -- I can only write about the program from a young male's perspective.I'd love to read some comments from women who enjoyed this show.As a little boy, I related strongly to the beleaguered Gilligan, who was really a man-child. I liked the Skipper because I could see through Alan Hale Jr's brusqueness and feel his affection for Bob Denver.I was one of the boys who wanted to meet Mary Ann or someone like her in real life. She was so sweet, and Dawn Wells played her character to perfection. I'm still looking for a real-life Mary Ann.I admired Russel Johnson, The Professor's ingenious inventions -- my Dad was a brilliant scientist, so I unconsciously engaged in a bit of transference.And then there was Mr. Magoo! Thurston Howell III played by the very talented Jim Backus. Self-centered, rich, married to a somewhat vacuous woman -- though I didn't know the term back then. Thankfully, there are far more pithy roles available to older actresses today.Let's not forget Tina Louise. I must confess I was a little young to fully appreciate her allure. I'm glad, actually, since mooning over one actress was enough.There are those who to this day will say Gilligan's Island was banal and a symbol of the waste of the boob tube. To them I say, to each his or her own. One thing most all can agree on -- the show's theme song is virtually contagious. Once it gets in your head, it's hard to stop humming it. Many a tune has made or broken the success of a TV show.I can only think of two other songs that still stick with me and they're from commercials. ""Fluffer Nutter"" sometimes plays over and over in my head -- drives me to distraction -- as does the Oscar Meyer Wiener song.Wait, I can't help myself. ""It takes fluff, fluff fluff to make a Fluffer Nutter, Marshmallow Fluff and lots of peanut butter."" ""Oh I wish I were an Oscar Meyer wiener, that is what I truly want to be..."" You get the idea. I'd like to say I've matured through the years and wouldn't appreciate a modern day equivalent of Gilligan's Island. I would -- and I don't particularly enjoy the bulk of today's most popular sitcoms.There was something about the innocence of poor Gilligan and the anticipation of how he would get into trouble with the Skipper the next time. And there always was a next time.It's quite nostalgic as a Baby Boomer thinking back to that turbulent period in America's history when a simple show brought so much enjoyment and feelings of respite to all the challenges a young child faced.At the same time it offers the opportunity to reflect upon the years gone by -- what I've done with my life and what I'd still like to accomplish before I end up watching re-runs in the great white theater room in the sky.Pondering a bit brings the realization that my future can be reshaped in any way I wish. I have the power, much more than as a youngster to make of my life all that is desired. Yet another positive by-product of celebrating the 50th anniversary of the iconic Gilligan's Island.If you are still a skeptic of the show think about this -- none other than the film great Ida Lupino directed four episodes of this Baby Boomer treasure!!And now as I bid you a fond farewell, here's a You Tube clip of our favorite young sailor Gilligan before he hit the high seas!I'm heading out now for a ""Gilligan's Anniversary Party!"" Ahoy -- thar she blows!"

The victim is Dr Modupeh Cole, Sierra Leone's second senior physician to die of Ebola. Kailahun along with the Kenema district is at the epicentre of the worst epidemic of Ebola since its discovery four decades ago. The death toll stands at more than 1,000. The Ebola epidemic in West Africa claimed a fourth victim in Nigeria on August 14 while the United States ordered the evacuation of diplomats' families from Sierra Leone and analysts warned of a heavy economic toll on the stricken region.

Some Western aid workers have been killed by suspicious locals who fear foreigners are spreading the disease, not stopping it.Piot is now reaching out to African religious and cultural traditionalists who believe that the goal of life is to become an ancestor, and that particular funeral rites are required to ensure the deceased’s passage into “the other world.”"

(Photo by Harry Engels/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb76e8124000032005704c5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Alistair Tait & Alex Miceli, Golfweek.comAUCHTERARDER, Scotland – The European team left Gleneagles as 12 men unified in victory. The U.S. team left in disarray.Phil Mickelson made sure of that.The five-time major winner laid into Tom Watson’s captaincy during the team’s post-match interview. He accused Watson of ignoring the winning formula Paul Azinger had laid down in 2008. The awkward atmosphere in the interview room could have been cut with a plastic knife.“There were two things that allow us to play our best, I think, that Paul Azinger did,” Mickelson said. “One was he got everybody invested in the process.“He got everybody invested in who they were going to play with, who the picks were going to be, who was going to be in their pod.“The other thing that Paul did really well was he had a great game plan for us, how we were going to go about doing this.“I’m just looking back at what gave us the most success, because we used the same process in the Presidents Cup and we do really well. Unfortunately, we have strayed from a winning formula in 2008 and the last three Ryder Cups. We need to consider maybe getting back to that formula.“Nobody here was in on any decision.”Mickelson played the first two sessions with Keegan Bradley, but was benched for Saturday’s session. It’s the first time Mickelson has sat out an entire day in the Ryder Cup. He cut a lonely, despondent figure Saturday afternoon as he stood at the back of the 18th tee watching Justin Rose and Martin Kaymer play U.S. rookies Patrick Reed and Jordan Spieth.Needless to say, Watson disagreed. He placed the blame squarely on his players.“I had a different philosophy as far as being captain of this team,” Watson countered. “It takes 12 players to win. It’s not pods. It’s 12 players. Yes, I did talk to my players, but my vice captains were very instrumental in making decisions.“I did mix and match a little bit. You have to go with the evolution of playing the match and see who is playing the best and who to play with whom. That’s what I did.“I felt that the assessment of the players was paramount from the standpoint of my vice-captains and me to see who is going to play with whom. My two most important jobs are to make the captain’s picks and then put the team together.”PGA of America president Ted Bishop was instrumental in picking Watson as captain, and was dismayed by Mickelson's post-tournament comments.“It was disappointing to hear some of the things said in the press conference, we were a team all week,” Bishop said. “There is no set winning formula, except the players playing better on the golf course.”Bishop still believes in Watson and his philosophy, which gave almost total control to the captain with what seems to be varying degrees of input by the players.Watson had not consulted the players before making his three captain's picks of Keegan Bradley, Hunter Mahan and Webb Simpson – who produced a record of 2-5-2.Further, in two distinct cases this week at Gleneagles, players publicly criticized Watson on his communication.The first was Jordan Spieth when he was told he would play in the Friday afternoon foursomes if he and Patrick Reed played well in the morning matches. They won 5 and 4 by slaying one of Europe’s best in Ian Poulter, yet still sat in the afternoon.Mickelson and Keegan Bradley sat all of Saturday matches, although neither expected to have the entire day off.“The responsibility – in the end it's up to the player, but knowing your player, knowing how to communicate with your player, knowing what worked in the past, and not ignoring what worked in the past, blatantly ignoring what works and what has worked, gone are the days where we dominate this competition,” Azinger said in how to approach the captaincy of the Ryder Cup in the 21st century.“I don't care how bad we lose, it's still razor thin. I don't care how often we lose, it's still razor thin, the difference. It's razor thin.”Watson and Azinger agree it is eventually up to the players, but they clearly disagree on how to get the players in the best possible position to win the matches.“Europe wants to win,” Azinger said. “That's why they have every captain pulling from all the other captains' advice and knowledge and having future captains as assistants for years leading up to these matches. They have a business model in place in their leadership role, because the captain does matter, he creates an environment.”The reverberations of Mickelson’s attack will last a long time. It remains to be seen how serious of a dent they could place in Watson’s stellar reputation within the game.Europe’s message all week had been 12 become one. The U.S. seemed set to depart Gleneagles as 12 against one. Or at least one against one.The rift between Watson and Mickelson might never be healed."
