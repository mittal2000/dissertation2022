Their remote region is ground zero for many of the world’s most vexing problems, including an Islamic militant insurgency, crippling poverty, and the devastation wrought by climate change.Now, the United Nations warns that the area may face a new calamity: famine.People in the region “are used to coping with extreme hardship, exploiting every and any option they can to keep their families going,” U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator Stephen O’Brien told the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday. “But … this suffering has pushed them to the absolute limit ― it is unlike anything they have felt before.” He called it “a humanitarian catastrophe.”The hunger crisis has been growing since militant group Boko Haram captured swaths of northeast Nigeria in 2014, crippling agriculture and the local economy and displacing more than 2 million people. The insurgency by Boko Haram extremists, who in recent years have killed more people in terror attacks than the Islamic State, has left more than 20,000 people dead.The fighting has further isolated the region from the rest of the world. That means the humanitarian crisis brewed mostly out of sight until Nigeria and its allies began pushing Boko Haram out of camps, villages and towns over the last year.Aid groups are just beginning to reach areas that were recaptured, and representatives said they’ve been horrified by what they’re finding. In mid-June, more than 1,000 people were evacuated from the Nigerian town of Bama so they could receive medical treatment. Aid group Doctors Without Borders said 39 percent of the town’s children were severely malnourished.“When we saw that, we realized the severity, and it was a shock,” said Isabelle Defourny, Doctors Without Borders director of operations. A week later, the aid group’s staff reached the town for the first time with a military escort and found more than 1,200 graves, including 480 for children, had been dug in the past year. Humanitarian officials with decades of disaster experience said the situation was among the worst they’d ever seen. “What we have uncovered and assessed is deeply, distressingly alarming, even for those of us who have witnessed such depths of humanitarian need before,” O’Brien told the U.N. Security Council. “I have been traveling throughout this region on and off for the past 37 years [and] I have never heard such fear and desperation. This is a new terrible.”Bruno Jochum, Doctors Without Borders general director, called it “a large-scale humanitarian disaster” and urged the U.N. to set up an emergency food pipeline. “Probably the medical and epidemiological indicators are the worst we are facing today in the world,” he said.“This is about as bad as it gets,” Toby Lanzer, U.N. assistant secretary general in the Sahel, told The Guardian this month. “There’s only one step worse ― and I’ve not come across that situation in 20 years of doing this work ― and that’s a famine.”The numbers are daunting. The U.N.’s Children Fund estimates that nearly a quarter-million children in the region are severely malnourished, and some 50,000 will die without immediate treatment. That warning, stark as it may seem, may not capture the full extent of the crisis. Only half of the estimated 500,000 to 800,000 people in displacement camps in northeastern Nigeria’s Borno state are reachable by aid agencies, Defourny said. Most of them are living in isolated towns destroyed by fighting, taking shelter in the remaining structures while under military guard. In the town of Bama, for example, 15,000 people, mostly women and children, are living in a hospital compound with no latrines, poor access to water, and little food, Defourny said.Outside the camps, aid groups have no clear picture of how many people are still trapped in their villages, or how bad their situation is. Thousands continue arriving in urban areas, many in poor health recounting stories of ongoing fighting and starvation back home.How did the situation get so bad? First, the Boko Haram insurgency destroyed the local economy. Farmers couldn’t farm, markets shut down, and millions fled to escape the fighting.Second, neither Nigerian authorities nor international aid agencies have yet mobilized a humanitarian response robust enough to meet the need. This is partly due to ongoing fighting. The U.N. on Thursday temporarily suspended aid operations in Borno state, with the exception of Maiduguri, after Boko Haram militants attacked a humanitarian convoy, injuring a UNICEF employee and a contractor.But some aid workers criticize humanitarian organizations, including U.N. agencies, for being too slow to recognize the extent of the crisis and to respond. Additionally, the Nigerian government didn’t make clear its need for aid, claiming that Boko Haram had been defeated and the displaced population could return home.Some ex-government officials say Nigerian authorities deliberately covered up the extent of the crisis to avoid international embarrassment.“We were not aware of the gravity of the situation. We were not fast enough,” Defourny said. “People in this region have already lost a lot of life due to political violence, and today they are dying because of something else, malnutrition, that is avoidable.”Nigerian officials in recent weeks have sounded the alarm with more urgency. Last month, Nigeria’s minister of health declared a nutrition emergency in Borno state, and the local government has appealed for international assistance.Aid groups have urged the government to lift bureaucratic barriers in order to facilitate the entry of aid, as reports begin to circulate that corruption ― soldiers demanding protection money, or government workers pilfering aid supplies ― is slowing the response. “Taking from these people is like stealing from a corpse,” said one police officer in a Nigerian displacement camp, according to Foreign Affairs.With limited aid, people in northeast Nigeria are doing all they can to help their community survive. About 90 percent of displaced people in the region are staying with extended families or community members, and schools and empty buildings in Maiduguri have been repurposed to house displaced families. Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., on Wednesday recalled a university security guard she met in northeast Nigeria, who had taken in more than 50 relatives displaced by the violence. “He is a national hero and there are tens of thousands of such heroes across the region,” Power told the U.N. Security Council. “I think we of greater means should all be inspired by these heroes to do much, much more.”"

The state's agriculture lobby is fighting a lawsuit that could set a new national precedent for farming-related water pollution.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587c4e33170000850192a3fb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Earlier this month, the Iowa Soybean Association had a big announcement to make.The group, which represents some 11,000 growers of the state’s second-most-lucrative crop, pledged $150,000 in support for three highly agricultural counties — Buena Vista, Calhoun and Sac — named in a controversial lawsuit brought by the Des Moines Water Works. The lawsuit, which was filed in 2015, claims that nitrogen-rich water flowing off the area’s farms pollutes the Raccoon River, which, along with the Des Moines River, provides drinking water for half a million people. The water authority wants the counties to pick up the dramatically higher treatment costs for the water. The counties, who want the case dismissed, counter that there’s no proof that agriculture is directly responsible for the nitrates.The case has thus far been upheld, though it won’t be brought to trial until next June. Meanwhile, both sides are digging in for a pivotal Iowa Supreme Court hearing on the matter set for September. If the water utility wins the suit, it would mark the first time in the U.S. that agribusiness is forced to pay for water pollution, potentially setting a precedent with nationwide ramifications.The ISA, which previously contributed $65,000 for the counties’ legal expenses, considers the case a “must win.” Meanwhile, it says, the lawsuit is an “unfortunate distraction” from the voluntary approaches to solving the state’s nutrient runoff issues that it has been touting. ISA CEO Kirk Leeds said the suit is affecting the progress the state has made over the past 15 years in encouraging farmers to implement practices to mitigate runoff, like putting cover crops and conservation tillage in their fields.“The lawsuit does not identify one tangible tactic or strategy that would actually improve water quality,” Leeds told The Huffington Post in a statement. “Without the lawsuit, labor and financial resources could be focused on deploying more practices across the state to improve soil and water resources.”The ISA pointed to the over 970,000 acres Iowa farmers have enrolled in the federal conservation reserve program — more than any other state — as further signs the state’s industry is on the right track toward addressing the problem. (The program removes environmentally sensitive lands from agricultural production, which helps improve water quality and wildlife habitat.)But the ISA’s efforts are “nothing more than greenwash” to Des Moines Water Works CEO Bill Stowe. “They’re sprinkling money and acting like they have some kind of environmental awareness when, in fact, they’re undermining public health and environmental protections,” Stowe told HuffPost. The ISA isn’t the only group supporting the defending counties in the lawsuit, but it’s hard to know who’s been paying the rest of the bill. As the Des Moines Register has reported, the donors picking up 90 percent of the counties’ $1.1 million legal tab are anonymous and likely to remain that way, thanks to a state law regulating private foundation contributions to government groups.Stowe’s utility has been spending a lot of money, too — seven figures’ worth of extra treatment costs to ensure the drinking water he delivers to their customers is safe, he said.The DMWW is home to what he calls the “world’s largest” nitrate removal facility. The plant is in need of repairs and expansion, he said, thanks to the historically high amount of nitrates they’ve had to remove from the drinking water they provide to their customers.Excessive nitrate exposure is most dangerous for infants and pregnant women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Infants who are exposed can develop what’s called blue baby syndrome, which can be fatal if left untreated. For these reasons, the EPA sets a maximum contaminant level for nitrates of 10 milligrams per liter. Anything higher needs to be removed by water providers. In 2013, when nitrate levels in the source water reached a record high, the utility’s tab for additional treatment costs and lost revenue totaled $900,000, DMWW said. Last year, it spent $1.5 million on denitrification efforts.Stowe argues that tile drainage systems used by the upstream farms to reduce crop flooding should be identified as “point sources” of pollution under the federal Clean Water Act, from which they traditionally have been exempt.The Iowa lawsuit could drastically change how the Clean Water Act can be used to remedy nutrient pollution, which is having a severe impact on communities throughout the U.S. For this reason, the suit carries national significance. John Rumpler, senior attorney at Environment America, a Boston-based nonprofit, called it a “huge, precedent-setting” matter.Rumpler authored a report last month linking nutrient runoff from agribusiness to the growth of algal blooms and dead zones that have devastated ecosystems and damaged local economies in places like Lake Erie, the Chesapeake Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. The EPA has also linked nutrient runoff to acid rain and air pollution.He sees what is happening in Iowa as one example of runoff issues bubbling up nationwide, like South Florida’s “guacamole-thick” algal blooms that prompted Gov. Rick Scott (R) to declare a state of emergency earlier this summer. Environmentalists have largely blamed agriculture, and particularly the powerful sugar industry, for the pollution.“The overriding story here is that the corporations that are producing our food in an industrializing fashion are now threatening our water,” Rumpler said. “America should not have to choose between healthy food and safe water.”Some Iowa farmers have already changed their ways ― before the lawsuit was even filed.One of them is 62-year-old Tim Smith. Smith has been farming his whole life and currently grows 800 acres of corn and soybeans in Eagle Grove, Iowa, not far from the three counties named in the suit. Five years ago, Smith signed up through a USDA program to start planting cover crops on some of his fields, as well as installing a woodchip bioreactor with the aim of reducing the nitrogen runoff from his farm.It wasn’t long before he observed, through sampling, that the amount of nitrates flowing off his farm had been cut in half. Seeing the results made him acknowledge he’d had a runoff problem he wasn’t aware of.“I thought I was doing everything right on my farm prior to this,” Smith told HuffPost.Still, Iowa’s estimated 470,000 acres of cover crops planted as of 2015 pale in comparison to the 26 million acres of statewide cropland. Though the Iowa Farm Bureau notes, accurately, that this is a 35 percent increase over the previous year, that number still represents less than 2 percent of the state’s overall cropland. This is evidence, Smith believes, that many farmers in the state don’t realize they are contributing to the problem. He anticipates that, with time, more of his colleagues will come around to the idea of conservation and see that the practices accomplish what they are designed to do.But the lawsuit, he says, could hinder that progress.“It’s kind of a slap in the face to agriculture. It does throw a little insult,” Smith said. “If they lose or the case is thrown out, farmers are going to say, well, you’ve already sued me, so what’s the big deal? I’m going to keep doing things the way I used to do them. There’s a danger in that.”For his part, Stowe is confident the utility will win, but he’s not limiting that to mean a win in the courtroom. He believes the suit, regardless of its outcome, challenges the state’s political status quo, which he says has favored agricultural interests for too long.“If we were to lose and continue to pass on this cost to our consumers, there will be a political impact,” Stowe said. “Our customer base will more clearly understand why they are paying more, so we think we win anyway. We will be the long-term winners no matter what happens in our legal case.”"
9,POLITICS,Quick Take: solid convention bounce for Clinton,"David Rothschild, ContributorEconomist at Microsoft Research",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/quick-take-solid-convention-bounce-for-clinton_us_579cfb12e4b00e7e269f66c7,"I generally write about prediction markets or, aggregation of polls and fundamental data, but since we have been running",2016-07-30,Democratic Two-Party Vote Share from Polling at Pollfish,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579cfb722a000029004f7669.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I generally write about prediction markets or, aggregation of polls and fundamental data, but since we have been running some experimental mobile-based polling and it is extremely timely, I wanted to share the results.The Pollfish survey, a weekly survey of 1,000 American voters, shows a very different trend from the general election polling of traditional surveys. Pollfish showed no Republican Convention bounce for Donald Trump and a solid Democratic Convention bounce for Hillary Clinton. In contrast, traditional polling, aggregated on Huffington Post’s Pollster, showed a bump for Trump of historically average magnitude coming out of his convention. We are still waiting for the polling from the Democratic Convention, which will come out in the next few days.There are three key things that separate our survey from traditional election polls:First, Pollfish, which is a mobile-only survey tool, uses a different mode than most polling. It is possible that people answer differently on mobile, because they are outside or because of the smaller screen. This is not to say one mode is right or wrong, but potentially different.Second, the Pollfish survey makes no attempt to adjust its sample of respondents to their probability of responding, the basis of traditional polling. Instead, we correct biases via post-sampling analytics, by modeling and post-stratifying the raw data to the expected voting population.Third, the Pollfish survey forecasts the sentiment of voters alone, instead of simultaneously estimating turnout and sentiment; thus changes in the Pollfish survey are more likely to reflect changes in sentiment more than changes in voter composition or changes in who showed up to the poll that day. Most polling first determines who the likely voters are and, in a second step, who they vote for. But, we model sentiment of likely voters in one single model, off of all Pollfish polls from 27 waves this year, with most of the emphasis on the last poll. Access to Big Data on all registered voters in the US helps us to focus on a stable space of likely voters.A fourth difference? Our method is much cheaper and faster, allowing a team of researchers on a limited budget to track respondents weekly on a variety of issues. We are confident that modeling and post-stratification, combined with the large number of responses, allow us to successfully gauge public opinion. And, it is saying that Clinton is in solid shape heading out of both conventions.This work is conducted jointly with my graduate students Tobias Konitzer and Sam Corbett-Davies, PhD candidates at Stanford University in communications and computer science, respectively."

Goldberg’s husband, Michael Winter, was born in Ramat Gan in Palestine, where his parents had fled during World War II. They relocated back to Vienna after the war, where they tried unsuccessfully to resurrect the family’s prewar clothing business, finally emigrating to Dorchester, Massachusetts, where they operated several laundry shops.“We of the Jewish faith have always supported strong women, going all the way back to Ruth and Miriam, and Deborah, the judge of Israel, for whom my parents named me,” added Goldberg, who spoke at the Massachusetts Delegate breakfast and attended an Emily’s List gathering, among other events.It was Massachusetts Senate President Stanley C.

Cynthia Stone Creem hopes that years of women fighting for various causes — working women, stay at home moms — are finally coming to fruition in this election. “My mother, Ida Stone, was a lawyer who was very active in women’s issues, and she did live to vote for me each time I ran for the Massachusetts Senate,” recalled Creem, who cosponsored a state resolution, approved last year, that condemned anti-Semitism and called for increased anti-bias and Holocaust education. Creem was also named Legislator of the Year by the Southern Poverty Law Center in 2010.”I’m a Bernie delegate, and I’m still with Bernie,” said Steve Leibowitz, a resident of Brewster, on Monday. “He’s still a candidate, there will be a roll call, and he hasn’t released anyone,” he maintained. “Obviously, you want to win, but I tend to vote for the Democratic nominee, and I will vote the party,” Leibowitz continued. “I’ve been a Democrat all my life, but in this election, I will probably focus more on local progressive candidates.”“Seeing Hillary break the glass ceiling is very meaningful to me, because it wasn’t always easy to be a lawyer, or to be in politics, in my mother’s day,” said Creem.“We Jews care passionately about economic inequality, health care, reproductive rights, education, and so many more areas of social and racial justice,” said Cindy Rowe, who is Chair of the Brookline Democratic Town Committtee and active at Temple Israel in Boston. “Anyone who cares about preserving our rights, and expanding opportunities, needs to work to elect Hillary Clinton as our next President,” she said.While in Philadelphia, Rowe was able to catch a gathering with the progressive Jewish group Bend the Arc at the Jewish Museum, and a Tuesday after-hours party sponsored by Senator Elizabeth Warren.

He made the bizarre remarks in response to an advertisement Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign that attacked him for mocking a reporter with a disability. Trump has been widely criticized for contorting his arms at a November campaign event, in an apparent attempt to mock New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski, who has a chronic joint disease that limits his arm movements. “They do the commercial, like I’m mocking a person with disability. I’m not, I’m not,” the businessman told supporters.“I spend millions a year, or millions of dollars on ramps, and get rid of the stairs and different kinds of elevators all over and I’m gonna mock? I would never do that,” he continued.“Number one, I have a good heart. Number two, I’m a smart person.”Trump made the same argument on Fox News’ “Fox and Friends” on Thursday morning. And he also cited his buildings as evidence of his fairness to people with disabilities in an interview with The Washington Post in May.His remarks imply that building ramps for handicapped people are a reflection of his personal generosity and compassion for people with disabilities. In fact, the Americans with Disabilities Act, a federal law passed in 1990, requires Trump to provide accommodations in his buildings for people with disabilities.A Trump campaign spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether the former reality TV personality meant to imply that he has gone beyond what he’s legally required to do. And as Think Progress notes, Trump was not even being completely truthful about his compliance with that law. People with disabilities have successfully sued a Trump property company and production firm in recent years for unfair treatment that violated the ADA.The controversial incident that is the subject of the Clinton campaign ad occurred when Trump ripped Kovaleski for disavowing the businessman’s interpretation of an article the journalist wrote for The Washington Post a few days after September 11, 2001 attacks. It stated that law enforcement were investigating people “allegedly seen celebrating the attacks.” But Trump had used the article in an effort to substantiate his claims that “thousands and thousands” of Arab Americans in New Jersey had cheered the terrorist event.Trump said at the time that he had no intention of mocking Kovaleski’s disability, claiming he did not even remember who the reporter was. The real estate mogul repeated that excuse on Friday night as well. Kovaleski has said that he and Trump were actually on a first-name basis in the 1980s when the reporter was regularly covering the businessman for the New York Daily News. A colleague of Kovaleski’s at the time has confirmed this account. Trump’s remarks doubling down on these implausible defenses of his behavior are all the more remarkable because of their timing ― in a week that disability rights took center stage at the Democratic National Convention.Disability rights advocates hailed Clinton’s acceptance speech on Thursday night for putting virtually unprecedented emphasis on the struggles and rights of people with disabilities.In her speech, Clinton recalled her work for the Children’s Defense Fund securing access to education for people with disabilities.“We gathered facts. We built a coalition,” Clinton said. “And our work helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities.”Anastasia Somoza, a disability rights advocate, spoke at the convention on Monday night, praising Clinton’s record and savaging Trump for his mockery of Kovaleski.“Donald Trump has shown us who he really is, and I honestly feel bad for anyone with that much hate in their heart,” she said. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S. "

Wisham fell during the pursuit and the employees tried to detain him, the statement added.Wisham stopped breathing as the workers restrained him, police allege. Authorities said the employees began life-saving measures and called for an ambulance.Authorities determined after an investigation that Wisham died of mechanical asphyxiation due to restraint. An autopsy found he had 15 broken ribs sustained during the incident. Nunez recalled the victim saying, “Let me up!” and “I can’t breathe!” according to an arrest report.A statement from Walmart issued to ABC-affiliate WFTS read:“Our hearts go out to everyone affected by these events. The status of the associates involved continues to be reviewed. We’ll continue working with law enforcement officials, as we have from the beginning, while conducting our own review.”"

So if you're worried about being able to afford good-quality healthcare on limited or fixed incomes, the solution of moving abroad can be a good one.If you need high-quality, affordable healthcare, and you can't get it where you live, you can live somewhere that better suits your needs.For many retirees, however, the calculation isn't so simple when you figure in Medicare. Right now, Medicare won't follow you abroad except in a few, limited cases. To take advantage of Medicare coverage, you must reside in the U.S. So if you want to move abroad and are at the age to qualify for Medicare, you'll need to figure out if the move will save you enough money to make it worthwhile to forgo your Medicare coverage.Judging by the thousands of retirees who've chosen to move abroad, the answer to that calculation is often ""yes.""But why should you have to make that calculation at all? Why shouldn't Medicare coverage follow you anywhere in the world, like the coverage U.S. military veterans abroad can get from the TRICARE program?  Malecon at Shore of Lake Chapala, Mexico That's a question that many U.S. expats have been asking themselves...and their elected representatives back in the States...for years.In a recent letter published in Americas Quarterly, David Truly, a professor at the Autonomous University of Guadalajara and a graduate of the University of South Carolina, asks the same question.Truly is a U.S. expat who lives in one of the most popular expat destinations in Mexico...the Lake Chapala area, just south of Guadalajara. For years now he's been studying the growth and impacts of international retirement migration.His research indicates that Baby Boomers who choose to retire abroad are being discriminated against when it comes to healthcare coverage.  Street Corner in Chapala, Mexico With a growing number of U.S. citizens choosing to live, work, and retire abroad, Truly makes the case that decoupling Medicare rights from U.S. residential requirements just makes sense. This move would recognize the changes in global immigration and retirement patterns he has observed in the half-century since Medicare was introduced...and it would benefit the U.S. government by lowering total Medicare expenditures.If retirees could use their Medicare benefits abroad, they would typically do that in markets with lower healthcare costs. And that would save the government money.Allowing U.S. expats to use their Medicare benefits in the countries abroad wouldn't affect those currently using the program in the U.S. -- but it would allow those overseas greater access to affordable healthcare AND lower the overall total expenditures of the program.The U.S. TRICARE program is already doing much the same thing. The experience and mechanisms necessary to provide Medicare healthcare benefits to U.S. citizens living abroad already exist.Decoupling Medicare benefits from U.S. residency requirements and letting U.S. expats use their Medicare wherever on the globe they happen to live seems like a win-win situation to us.This article comes to us courtesy of InternationalLiving.com, the world's leading authority on how to live, work, invest, travel, and retire better overseas.Related Articles Healthcare in the U.S. Vs Healthcare Overseas The Top Towns and Cities in Latin America for Healthy Living 4 Countries with the Best Healthcare in the World"

""That looks alright,"" you say to yourselves, settling for something that might be OK. At best. Wht not be a little adventurous and search out movies and TV shows that aren't maybe decent but actually might be good or even great? Start right here. SING STREET ($34.99 BluRay; Anchor Bay) EVERYBODY WANTS SOME!! ($39.99 BluRay; Paramount) DEMOLITION ($39.99 BluRay; 20th Century Fox) MOUNTAINS MAY DEPART ($34.95 BluRay; Kino Lorber) BELLADONNA OF SADNESS ($39.99 BluRay; Cinelicious Pics) MY GOLDEN DAYS ($26.97 DVD; Magnolia Home Entertainment)Let's kick things off with a gem: a new film from the director of Once that actually recaptures the charm of Once, mostly by not trying to duplicate Once. (I'm looking at you, Begin Again.) In this case, Sing Street is more Commitments anyway, the story of some lads who try to put together a band amidst the punkish new wave of early 1980s Ireland. A coming of age tale, a the-joy-of-making-music revelation, a romance, a comedy. A delight.Meanwhile, director Richard Linklater has really hit a new creative stride. First came his many years in the making home movie Boyhood. Now comes Everybody Wants Some!!, a ""spiritual sequel"" to his best film Dazed & Confused. That captured the last day of school in the summer of 1976. This one captures the first day of college in 1980, or more exactly, the lazy, weekend before the first day of college when people are moving into their dorms, making new friends and eagerly waiting for all the sex and drugs and excitement that college is supposed to offer. Linklater has a great ensemble here composed of guys who room together in a big sprawling house and all play on the baseball team. It's hilariously funny, casually believable, marvelously acted and unfolds with such disarming ease you really feel like it's the weekend before classes begin and you've got all the freedom in the world. Not much happens and it's just great. I loved it when I saw it and like it even more on a second viewing. I can't wait to see it again and really there's so much to say (the marvelous actors, the dialogue, the recreation of an era before smart phones and the internet) but I'll start with this: see it.Demolition is exactly the sort of movie you might just toss on because you saw it advertised and hey, it stars Jake Gyllenhaal and he's good. In fact, it never actually transcends the heavy symbolism of a suddenly widowed young man who literally apart his home and life so he can be reawakened. It helps when you're befriended by an adorable kid. Nonetheless, Gyllenhaal is such a good actor he actually deserves your support in checking him out in whatever he tackles. He's got bold taste (Broadway! art films!) and I'm always eager to see what he's done now, even if I suspect it might be a misfire.The entire career of Chinese director Jia Zhangke is one long, ""how the heck did he get THAT made"" puzzle. With Mountains May Depart he tackles decades of recent Chinese history, pointedly suggesting much has been lost in the struggle to leap to the front of capitalism. It's gorgeous, smart, quiet, beautifully acted, pure art house cinema and one has to wonder: how the heck did he get THIS made? Usually with world cinema you are just catching up with an artist already acclaimed in his homeland. But with Zhangke, we've probably seen more of his work than 99.99% of the Chinese population, more's the pity.The lost Japanese animated film Belladonna of Sadness is simply not my cup of tea and it took me a few weeks to actually watch the entire film. Definitely for adults (and not in the juvenile ""adult"" manner of Ralph Bakshi), it features a brutal rape coupled with a revenge fantasy worthy of the blaxploitation films popular at the time. I want to recognize its boldness since so much of animated film is resolutely stuck in family film and fantasy mode. It's beautifully crafted and the entire crazy history of the film is well captured in the extras. And I'm definitely going to track down its crazy good soundtrack. One for the adventurous. PS I'm not quite being fair to Bakshi, but you know what I mean.And here's another gem about boys on the cusp of being men. My Golden Days is a winner from French director Arnaud Desplechin. It's a poignant string of flashbacks involving childhood, a student trip to the USSR, life at college and most of all Esther, the one that got away. It's talky and discursive as only the French can be and filled with winning performances, led by Quentin Dolmaire as the young hero. If you're not prone to French cinema, I don't think this will win you over. But if you are, it's a must see.BATMAN V SUPERMAN ($35.99 BluRay; Warner Home Entertainment) THE BOSS ($34.98 BluRay; Universal Studios Home Entertainment) BARBERSHOP: THE NEXT CUT ($29.98 BluRay; Warner Home Video)The one aspect I really enjoyed about Batman V Superman was the one aspect everyone mocked: the super serious tone. Hey, with the darker than dark Batman films and the fact that Marvel has the market on snark cornered, I thought it was smart of DC to realize their wheelhouse is a sober serious nature. This isn't fun and games; it's the fate of the world! But everyone mocked it as pompous and now the trailer for Justice League has jokes and jabs a plenty. Oh well. I'm not surprised the movie itself was a bust since I've never really cared for the films of Zack Snyder (the campy homoeroticism of 300 aside). And I'm a little torn: the visuals are best enjoyed on the big screen (at home the editing becomes even more absurd) but its the bounteous extras that offer your best entertainment value. And don't worry about the DC universe. Between Suicide Squad and the pitch perfect trailer for Wonder Woman, they'll be just fine. Here's hoping they take their mission seriously.Oh Melissa McCarthy, how I loved you in Gilmore Girls. I'm thrilled you graciously agreed to do a cameo though bummed your character (such a key ingredient to the show's success) won't be more fully present. It's a shame you don't seem to have a lot of love for that experience since it's still FAR AND AWAY the best role of your career. You seem to be the new John Belushi, but where he went from dumb slob roles to increasingly nuanced characters you've gone in the opposite direction from Sookie to slobs. Your movies swivel back and forth from dumb and successful to dumb and not so successful. (Though I don't think a single movie has actually lost anyone money yet.) The Boss falls in the latter camp but I'm still waiting for you to remember how much fun it was to actually act as a character, rather than go for the sort of extended sketches that wouldn't even cut it on SNL. The Boss is exactly what you shouldn't be doing. Catch your breath, dive into a pile of scripts and find yourself a great supporting role in a really good film by a really good director. You've cashed in now start making some art. As for the latest Barbershop, it's definitely too little too late, but harmless fun nonetheless. What took them so long? And since they waited so long, why does it feel tossed off? A rare misstep for Ice Cube.A TOUCH OF ZEN ($39.95 BluRay; Criterion Collection) THE NEW WORLD ($39.95 BluRay; Criterion Collection)When I saw Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon for the first time, it was as pure joy for me, a thunderbolt out of the blue like Raiders Of The Lost Ark and precious few other movies. Of course, it was in debt to earlier great films (like Raiders) and it's been a pleasure to be schooled in the wuxia genre of martial arts movies. Surely at the top of list of influential forebears is A Touch Of Zen, a terrific film that also features great performances, great action of almost unparalled excitement and high drama. This Criterion edition features a newly restored print, some great background and the 180 minute version. It's essential cinema, which makes it sound like homework. It's also tremendous fun and Criterion does it proud.Director Terrence Malick has gone from enigmatically unproductive to darn near prolific. With To The Wonder and Knight Of Cups, this ever-increasing rate of production has begun to seem...unhelpful. But as recently as Tree Of Life, he's been at the top of his game. Case in point: The New World. While acclaimed, it fell between the triumphant The Thin Red Line and the marvelous Tree. But like the best playwrights and increasingly the best directors, Malick has taken advantage of BluRay releases and special editions to refine his vision. Unlike Coppola and most others, his new director's cuts have proven to actually be improvements. I found this telling of the clash between immigrants and the native peoples to be gob-smackingly good when it first came out. But that theatrical release was already different and shorter from the cut that appeared at film festivals. And then came a genuinely new draft with the Special Edition that fell somewhere in between. Happily, Criterion offers all three versions on this disc. Start with the final one that Malick approves of because it's a stunner, replete with his usual Kubrickian skill at combining visuals and music to overwhelming effect. SUPERGIRL: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON ($54.97 BluRay; Warner Home Video) TWO GUYS AND A GIRL: THE COMPLETE SERIES ($79.97 DVD; Shout! Factory) THE MAGICIANS SEASON 1 ($44.98 BluRay; Universal Studios Home Entertainment) THE 100 COMPLETE THIRD SEASON ($39.98 BluRay; Warner Archive Collection) PERSON OF INTEREST: FIFTH AND FINAL SEASON ($44.98 BluRay; Warner Home Video)Supergirl hasn't even begun yet. Sure, you've got season one in your hot little hands. But it's switching from CBS to the CW and that will probably be to the show's benefit. They never quite found the right tone and being nestled amongst the younger shows of that weblet can only encourage Supergirl to stamp itself on a character that has been around for decades but never really had a defining pop cultural version a la Christopher Reeves in Superman. At the very least, they can do a cross-over episode with Crazy Ex-Girlfriend and let Jeremy Jordan sing! Two Girls and A Girl (And a Pizza Place, but apparently we're supposed to forget about that) went four seasons and 81 episodes without ever coming even close to finding an identity, so Supergirl shouldn't feel bad if it takes them two years. Best remembered for launching Ryan Reynolds, it also gave a key early break to Nathan Fillion, not to mention Traylor Howard, who went on to be Monk's second yet lesser sidekick. Other than that...well, it really is pretty anonymous comedy, generic and forgettable yet passable entertainment if you're a huge fan of any of the actors or are flipping the channels and want to be diverted for a few minutes.The Magicians has just begun its run. Based on the novels of Lev Grossman, I have hopes for it. Not high hopes exactly. But the books initially were so excited by their twist: what if you really were a teenager who suddenly found out the fantasy world of your favorite books were real? Wouldn't you curse and want to have sex with magical creatures and basically behave like unruly teens often do, but with wands? The first book didn't really transcend the naughty appeal of watching a Harry Potter-like character take the piss out of that conceit. But by the third book, Grossman dug deeper -- if you were given access to a fantasy world a la Narnia as a child and then denied entry once you hit adulthood, well that might really and truly mess you up. Here's hoping the series can accomplish a similar trajectory. The 100 is in the middle of its run and the show about young folk stranded to die on a dystopian earth has catapulted into genuine cult hit thanks to a similar tactic. They came up with a high concept show but then took seriously the ramifications of kill or be killed and how that should impact real people. Despite a poorly thought out culling of some key characters, the show could bid for real greatness in its fourth season. Catch up.As for the just concluded Person Of Interest, it gets a little tricky. The show worked best as a procedural, letting each week's paranoid conspiracy/adventure play out with a beginning and middle and end, anchored by Michael Emerson's compelling billionaire. But everyone in TV land is convinced that only shows with arcs and complicated storylines are ""real"" art so they got more and more and more entangled in their own crazy super-plot. But THEN the show was told they were cancelled and needed to wind it up. And that gave them focus. Instead of spinning an increasingly absurd plot a la Orphan Black, they came up with an end game and barreled towards it. Sometimes, you do the wrong thing and it pays off anyway. Hmm, much like developing an all-powerful artificial intelligence that starts to develop a mind of its own....GREEN ROOM ($24.99 BluRay; Lionsgate) AFERIM! ($34.95 BluRay; Big World Pictures)The death of Anton Yelchin is tragic and here's one more reminder. He stars in Green Room, this down and dirty little B movie about a punk band who are hunted down by neo-Nazi skinheads after witnessing a murder. (And they thought critics were tough.) Yelchin is with the band, Patrick Stewart is with the thugs and the movie is a genuine pleasure: visceral, exciting, frightening and yet anchored by performances by the two leads and the rest of the cast to make the horrific situation even more unnerving. Aferim! is surely far afield from Green Room. Aferim! is a Romanian film nominated for the Bet Foreign Film Oscar by its country. Perhaps because it doesn't match the template of most recent Romanian critical darlings it was overlooked. (It's a period film and lacks many other hallmarks of what we think of when we speak about Romanian cinema.) And yet, this story is about a ""cop"" in the 1800s hired to hunt down a gypsy slave who ran away after having an affair with the wife of his ""owner."" (I could also put ""gypsy"" in quotes since this dismissive term should really be Romany. Slaves aren't known for being given polite names by their brutal captors, however.) It's harsh, plays like an old school Western (sort of) and features so much suspicion and hatred of the ""other"" (the Romany are just the start) that ultimately it does have a little more in common with Green Room after all. Both films are vastly entertaining and make much out of fear and anger that fuels daily life in a world that seems unfair, especially to the once-powerful who resent when the world tries to be a little fair to the people they once kept underfoot. Neither film made much of an impression at the box office and both are worth your time, though perhaps only Quentin Tarantino and hardcore cineastes will watch both. If either is in a genre that appeals, jump.VERA SETS 1-5 ($149.99 DVD; Acorn Media) VERA SET 6 ($59.99; Acorn Media) JACK IRISH SEASON 1 ($39.99 BluRay; Acorn Media)Does the UK feature ANY Detective Chief Inspectors who aren't a mess in their personal life but brilliant and their jobs? Brenda Blethyn stars as Vera Stanhope, who fits that mold to a t. Happily, the show is based on an ongoing series of novels by the excellent writer Ann Cleeves. That gives Vera (and Vera) more depth and specificity than usual from TV. Each season contains four feature length mysteries and to date each of the six novels has been adapted. (Cleeves will surely write more.) I still miss her first sidekick (has a later sidekick ever improved on the original?) but Kenny Doughty is doing fine work in the stead of David Leon. Cush Jumbo should be used more, but this is Blethyn's show and she does wonderful work here. This isn't a classic, but it's solid meat and potatoes crime drama of the character-based sort the British do so well.Very similarly, Australia has on tap the show Jack Irish, about a lawyer turned private investigator and debt collector. With that trajectory, obviously Jack Irish is seeing his life go in the wrong direction. Guy Pearce embodied the character created by Peter Temple with unshaven, unhappy poise. Burdened by the unsolved murder of his wife, Irish is a mess, living in Melbourne and getting by with jaunts to the race track, the pub and a woodworking shop (shades of Det. Freamon on The Wire). In three movies and now one season of six episodes, Irish invariably takes on a seemingly minor case that snowballs into something more serious. But Pearce makes the formula work and it's certainly one of the best crime shows out of Australia.PIONEERS OF AFRICAN AMERICAN CINEMA ($99.95 BluRay; Kino Lorber) THE DAUGHTER OF DAWN ($34.95 BluRay; Milestone Films)I'm worried about making these two releases sound important and educational. Both preserve nearly lost glimpses of cinematic history featuring oft-ignored or belittled minorities. The Daughter Of Dawn is a surprisingly solid silent film shot in Oklahoma and featuring an all Kiowa and Comanche cast of actors. The print is solid given its 1920 origins, the 80 minute story fine and the glimpse into a vanished way of life is palpable. The copious extras give context and pleasure to everything you see, including interviews with descendants of people who appeared in the film and see it for the first time. Even more impressive is the sprawling five disc boxed set Pioneers Of African American Cinema. No wonder Martin Scorsese is proudly touting this set with a quote on the front of it: this is an historic release. Yes, it's important and scholarly and worthy of praise. But with a dozen feature length films and more than 20 shorts and fragments, just a small sampling makes clear that it's damn entertaining. Paul Robeson is just one of the many notable names appearing in or contributing to the wide range of movies, including melodramas, westerns, comedies, musicals and more. Unlike some B movie offerings with all black casts made purely for profit by disinterested studios (the awful Harlem Rides The Range springs to mind), these are passionate artistic efforts made by artists who sacrificed a great deal to tell these stories, often zeroing in on race issues naturally ignored by Hollywood. It'll take weeks to really get a handle on everything here, but for all its landmark status it's a pleasure to report that your first real response will simply be pleasure.Thanks for reading.

And don't worry about the DC universe. Between Suicide Squad and the pitch perfect trailer for Wonder Woman, they'll be just fine. Here's hoping they take their mission seriously.Oh Melissa McCarthy, how I loved you in Gilmore Girls. I'm thrilled you graciously agreed to do a cameo though bummed your character (such a key ingredient to the show's success) won't be more fully present. It's a shame you don't seem to have a lot of love for that experience since it's still FAR AND AWAY the best role of your career. You seem to be the new John Belushi, but where he went from dumb slob roles to increasingly nuanced characters you've gone in the opposite direction from Sookie to slobs. Your movies swivel back and forth from dumb and successful to dumb and not so successful. (Though I don't think a single movie has actually lost anyone money yet.) The Boss falls in the latter camp but I'm still waiting for you to remember how much fun it was to actually act as a character, rather than go for the sort of extended sketches that wouldn't even cut it on SNL. The Boss is exactly what you shouldn't be doing. Catch your breath, dive into a pile of scripts and find yourself a great supporting role in a really good film by a really good director. You've cashed in now start making some art. As for the latest Barbershop, it's definitely too little too late, but harmless fun nonetheless. What took them so long? And since they waited so long, why does it feel tossed off? A rare misstep for Ice Cube.A TOUCH OF ZEN ($39.95 BluRay; Criterion Collection) THE NEW WORLD ($39.95 BluRay; Criterion Collection)When I saw Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon for the first time, it was as pure joy for me, a thunderbolt out of the blue like Raiders Of The Lost Ark and precious few other movies. Of course, it was in debt to earlier great films (like Raiders) and it's been a pleasure to be schooled in the wuxia genre of martial arts movies. Surely at the top of list of influential forebears is A Touch Of Zen, a terrific film that also features great performances, great action of almost unparalled excitement and high drama. This Criterion edition features a newly restored print, some great background and the 180 minute version. It's essential cinema, which makes it sound like homework. It's also tremendous fun and Criterion does it proud.Director Terrence Malick has gone from enigmatically unproductive to darn near prolific. With To The Wonder and Knight Of Cups, this ever-increasing rate of production has begun to seem...unhelpful. But as recently as Tree Of Life, he's been at the top of his game. Case in point: The New World. While acclaimed, it fell between the triumphant The Thin Red Line and the marvelous Tree. But like the best playwrights and increasingly the best directors, Malick has taken advantage of BluRay releases and special editions to refine his vision. Unlike Coppola and most others, his new director's cuts have proven to actually be improvements. I found this telling of the clash between immigrants and the native peoples to be gob-smackingly good when it first came out. But that theatrical release was already different and shorter from the cut that appeared at film festivals. And then came a genuinely new draft with the Special Edition that fell somewhere in between. Happily, Criterion offers all three versions on this disc. Start with the final one that Malick approves of because it's a stunner, replete with his usual Kubrickian skill at combining visuals and music to overwhelming effect. SUPERGIRL: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON ($54.97 BluRay; Warner Home Video) TWO GUYS AND A GIRL: THE COMPLETE SERIES ($79.97 DVD; Shout! Factory) THE MAGICIANS SEASON 1 ($44.98 BluRay; Universal Studios Home Entertainment) THE 100 COMPLETE THIRD SEASON ($39.98 BluRay; Warner Archive Collection) PERSON OF INTEREST: FIFTH AND FINAL SEASON ($44.98 BluRay; Warner Home Video)Supergirl hasn't even begun yet. Sure, you've got season one in your hot little hands. But it's switching from CBS to the CW and that will probably be to the show's benefit. They never quite found the right tone and being nestled amongst the younger shows of that weblet can only encourage Supergirl to stamp itself on a character that has been around for decades but never really had a defining pop cultural version a la Christopher Reeves in Superman. At the very least, they can do a cross-over episode with Crazy Ex-Girlfriend and let Jeremy Jordan sing! Two Girls and A Girl (And a Pizza Place, but apparently we're supposed to forget about that) went four seasons and 81 episodes without ever coming even close to finding an identity, so Supergirl shouldn't feel bad if it takes them two years. Best remembered for launching Ryan Reynolds, it also gave a key early break to Nathan Fillion, not to mention Traylor Howard, who went on to be Monk's second yet lesser sidekick. Other than that...well, it really is pretty anonymous comedy, generic and forgettable yet passable entertainment if you're a huge fan of any of the actors or are flipping the channels and want to be diverted for a few minutes.The Magicians has just begun its run. Based on the novels of Lev Grossman, I have hopes for it. Not high hopes exactly. But the books initially were so excited by their twist: what if you really were a teenager who suddenly found out the fantasy world of your favorite books were real? Wouldn't you curse and want to have sex with magical creatures and basically behave like unruly teens often do, but with wands? The first book didn't really transcend the naughty appeal of watching a Harry Potter-like character take the piss out of that conceit. But by the third book, Grossman dug deeper -- if you were given access to a fantasy world a la Narnia as a child and then denied entry once you hit adulthood, well that might really and truly mess you up. Here's hoping the series can accomplish a similar trajectory. The 100 is in the middle of its run and the show about young folk stranded to die on a dystopian earth has catapulted into genuine cult hit thanks to a similar tactic. They came up with a high concept show but then took seriously the ramifications of kill or be killed and how that should impact real people. Despite a poorly thought out culling of some key characters, the show could bid for real greatness in its fourth season. Catch up.As for the just concluded Person Of Interest, it gets a little tricky. The show worked best as a procedural, letting each week's paranoid conspiracy/adventure play out with a beginning and middle and end, anchored by Michael Emerson's compelling billionaire. But everyone in TV land is convinced that only shows with arcs and complicated storylines are ""real"" art so they got more and more and more entangled in their own crazy super-plot. But THEN the show was told they were cancelled and needed to wind it up. And that gave them focus. Instead of spinning an increasingly absurd plot a la Orphan Black, they came up with an end game and barreled towards it. Sometimes, you do the wrong thing and it pays off anyway. Hmm, much like developing an all-powerful artificial intelligence that starts to develop a mind of its own....GREEN ROOM ($24.99 BluRay; Lionsgate) AFERIM! ($34.95 BluRay; Big World Pictures)The death of Anton Yelchin is tragic and here's one more reminder. He stars in Green Room, this down and dirty little B movie about a punk band who are hunted down by neo-Nazi skinheads after witnessing a murder. (And they thought critics were tough.) Yelchin is with the band, Patrick Stewart is with the thugs and the movie is a genuine pleasure: visceral, exciting, frightening and yet anchored by performances by the two leads and the rest of the cast to make the horrific situation even more unnerving. Aferim! is surely far afield from Green Room. Aferim! is a Romanian film nominated for the Bet Foreign Film Oscar by its country. Perhaps because it doesn't match the template of most recent Romanian critical darlings it was overlooked. (It's a period film and lacks many other hallmarks of what we think of when we speak about Romanian cinema.) And yet, this story is about a ""cop"" in the 1800s hired to hunt down a gypsy slave who ran away after having an affair with the wife of his ""owner."" (I could also put ""gypsy"" in quotes since this dismissive term should really be Romany. Slaves aren't known for being given polite names by their brutal captors, however.) It's harsh, plays like an old school Western (sort of) and features so much suspicion and hatred of the ""other"" (the Romany are just the start) that ultimately it does have a little more in common with Green Room after all. Both films are vastly entertaining and make much out of fear and anger that fuels daily life in a world that seems unfair, especially to the once-powerful who resent when the world tries to be a little fair to the people they once kept underfoot. Neither film made much of an impression at the box office and both are worth your time, though perhaps only Quentin Tarantino and hardcore cineastes will watch both. If either is in a genre that appeals, jump.VERA SETS 1-5 ($149.99 DVD; Acorn Media) VERA SET 6 ($59.99; Acorn Media) JACK IRISH SEASON 1 ($39.99 BluRay; Acorn Media)Does the UK feature ANY Detective Chief Inspectors who aren't a mess in their personal life but brilliant and their jobs? Brenda Blethyn stars as Vera Stanhope, who fits that mold to a t. Happily, the show is based on an ongoing series of novels by the excellent writer Ann Cleeves. That gives Vera (and Vera) more depth and specificity than usual from TV. Each season contains four feature length mysteries and to date each of the six novels has been adapted. (Cleeves will surely write more.) I still miss her first sidekick (has a later sidekick ever improved on the original?) but Kenny Doughty is doing fine work in the stead of David Leon. Cush Jumbo should be used more, but this is Blethyn's show and she does wonderful work here. This isn't a classic, but it's solid meat and potatoes crime drama of the character-based sort the British do so well.Very similarly, Australia has on tap the show Jack Irish, about a lawyer turned private investigator and debt collector. With that trajectory, obviously Jack Irish is seeing his life go in the wrong direction. Guy Pearce embodied the character created by Peter Temple with unshaven, unhappy poise. Burdened by the unsolved murder of his wife, Irish is a mess, living in Melbourne and getting by with jaunts to the race track, the pub and a woodworking shop (shades of Det. Freamon on The Wire). In three movies and now one season of six episodes, Irish invariably takes on a seemingly minor case that snowballs into something more serious. But Pearce makes the formula work and it's certainly one of the best crime shows out of Australia.PIONEERS OF AFRICAN AMERICAN CINEMA ($99.95 BluRay; Kino Lorber) THE DAUGHTER OF DAWN ($34.95 BluRay; Milestone Films)I'm worried about making these two releases sound important and educational. Both preserve nearly lost glimpses of cinematic history featuring oft-ignored or belittled minorities. The Daughter Of Dawn is a surprisingly solid silent film shot in Oklahoma and featuring an all Kiowa and Comanche cast of actors. The print is solid given its 1920 origins, the 80 minute story fine and the glimpse into a vanished way of life is palpable. The copious extras give context and pleasure to everything you see, including interviews with descendants of people who appeared in the film and see it for the first time. Even more impressive is the sprawling five disc boxed set Pioneers Of African American Cinema. No wonder Martin Scorsese is proudly touting this set with a quote on the front of it: this is an historic release. Yes, it's important and scholarly and worthy of praise. But with a dozen feature length films and more than 20 shorts and fragments, just a small sampling makes clear that it's damn entertaining. Paul Robeson is just one of the many notable names appearing in or contributing to the wide range of movies, including melodramas, westerns, comedies, musicals and more. Unlike some B movie offerings with all black casts made purely for profit by disinterested studios (the awful Harlem Rides The Range springs to mind), these are passionate artistic efforts made by artists who sacrificed a great deal to tell these stories, often zeroing in on race issues naturally ignored by Hollywood. It'll take weeks to really get a handle on everything here, but for all its landmark status it's a pleasure to report that your first real response will simply be pleasure.Thanks for reading.

20,POLITICS,Why Khizr Khan's DNC Speech Was So Effective,"Doug Hattaway, ContributorPresident, Hattaway Communications",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-khizr-khans-dnc-speec_b_11273548.html,"Khan's speech showcased a powerful way to tell the story of Muslims in America, with examples of their contributions to and sacrifices for our country--and language that reminds people we're all on the same team.",2016-07-30,"PHILADELPHIA, PA - JULY 28: Khizr Khan addresses the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on Thursday, July 28, 2016. (Khan's son Humayun S. M. Khan, a U.S. Army soldier, was killed in Iraq. Photo by Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb822e73c000020010dbd61.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CO-AUTHORED BY ZACH LOWE, SENIOR ASSOCIATE AT HATTAWAY COMMUNICATIONSAmong the many inspirational stories shared this week at the Democratic National Convention, Khizr Khan's tribute to his son, Army Capt. Humayun Khan, stood out. The younger Khan, an American Muslim, gave his life in Iraq to save the lives of his fellow soldiers. He was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart.The speech simultaneously conveyed a father's love for his lost child and pride in his country, punctuated by a direct repudiation of Donald Trump. ""Have you ever been to Arlington Cemetery?"" Khan pointedly asked the Republican nominee, referencing the site of his son's burial. ""You will see all faiths, genders, and ethnicities. You have sacrificed nothing. And no one.""Khan's speech has since gone viral, with #KhizrKhan trending on Twitter. His powerful appeal shows how to win over fair-minded Americans bombarded by anti-Muslim fear-mongering. In the space of six minutes, Khan--a U.S. citizen who resides in Charlottesville, VA--offered a rhetorical roadmap for combating Islamophobia in the United States.First, Khan's story overcame what psychology refers to as ""cognitive dissonance,"" in which individuals simultaneously hold incompatible ideas or conflicting emotions. When thinking about Muslims, research shows that some non-Muslim Americans experience cognitive dissonance because they value the ideas of religious freedom and tolerance, but also fear terrorism and harbor a suspicion that American Muslims aren't necessarily loyal to the U.S. Khan's poignant remembrance of his son's military service obliterated the notion of disloyalty. Neutralizing doubts about the patriotism and loyalty of American Muslims creates the space for an appeal to tolerance: Anyone who puts their life on the line for our country deserves to be treated fairly. The message research and development team at Hattaway Communications created the ad below featuring American Muslims who gave the ultimate sacrifice for their country. As one person who saw the ad in a focus group put it, ""This throws the prejudice out the window."" Beyond the power of his son's story, Mr. Khan and other convention speakers also used powerful language by referring to his family as ""American Muslims"" rather than ""Muslim-Americans."" While the order of the words may seem meaningless, our work has shown that these two constructs evoke surprisingly different reactions. Focus group participants discussing this topic associated the term ""Muslim-American"" with words such as ""foreign"" and ""strict,"" and raised concerns about a perceived mistreatment of women. With the order of the words switched, however, the same people responded with phrases such as ""came to America for a better life"" and ""contribute to society.""These reactions illustrate the importance of the first word in a message, which colors the reactions to every word that follows it. This experiment also showed the power of the word ""American"" to help counter negative portrayals and perceptions of Muslims who are part of the fabric of our diverse society.Mr. Khan's speech showcased a powerful way to tell the story of Muslims in America, with examples of their contributions to and sacrifices for our country--and language that reminds people we're all on the same team. It's a powerful lesson for anyone interested in countering anti-Muslim fear-mongering--or battling prejudice against Americans of any race and background."

REUTERS/Scott Audette (L), Javier Galeano (R)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb822e92200005700dd404a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After back-to-back Republican and Democratic conventions, the stage is set for a 100-day mad dash to the November presidential contest. There were telling differences between the two events.To begin with, the conventions revealed the state of play within each party. Both Republicans and Democrats confronted insurgencies with dramatically different outcomes. On the Republican side, one of the insurgent candidates, Donald Trump, vanquished the establishment leaving the party in some disarray. Many national GOP leaders boycotted the convention and refused to endorse Trump. Those who endorsed the victor did so either because they felt they had no choice or because they retained a vague hope that should he win, their congressional leaders would be able to limit the damage that might occur in an unrestrained Trump presidency. Adding to the fractiousness of the GOP's situation, significant components of another insurgent group, prominent leaders of the religious right, also refused to endorse the nominee creating negative press with a walkout on the first day followed by a prime time rejection by Ted Cruz on day three.The Democrats fared somewhat better since their establishment candidate, Hillary Clinton, won. Because Clinton embraced a good number of her opponent's progressive proposals, Bernie Sanders' felt comfortable enough to give her a full-throated endorsement on the convention's opening night. This display of unity appeared to be enough to mollify many of Sanders' supporters, though a number of movement activists who had embraced the Sanders' cause left the convention unsatisfied. Nevertheless, the Democrats concluded their four-day meeting with the appearance of greater unity than had been found at the GOP gathering.There was another key difference between the two parties' quadrennial events. Modern conventions have been largely stripped of their political functions, reducing them to over-produced infomercials. While Trump had promised a ""blockbuster"", the Republican convention was a lack-luster affair bringing together a strange collection of minor ""celebrities"" and drew headlines for a series of unforced errors.On the first day, there was a contentious rules fight leading to a mass walk-out. This opening sour note was later eclipsed by revelations that the initially well-reviewed speech by Trump's wife had been, in part, plagiarized from a speech given by Michelle Obama, 8 years earlier. On the next night, Trump inexplicably decided to call into one of the networks to complain about an unrelated issue in the midst of an emotional speech by the mother of a victim of the embassy attack in Benghazi. Then, of course, there was the pay back speech by Ted Cruz. With most GOP luminaries not in attendance, the key Trump endorsement speeches were given by his children.In contrast, the Democrats' event was well produced and, despite moments of tension and controversy, was a nearly flawless affair. Clinton was able to receive validation and support from President Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, Vice-President Biden, her main opponent Senator Sanders, leading progressive Senator Elizabeth Warren, and most of the Democratic party's Senators and Members of Congress. In addition, there was a host of major celebrities who performed at or addressed the event.The Democrats were also able to dodge a few potentially disruptive bullets caused by concerns among Sanders' supporters that the establishment had unfairly tipped the scales of the election in favor of Clinton. The Clinton team did this by agreeing with Sanders to form a commission to write new rules for party operations and for the next election and by forcing the party's controversial chair to resign in advance of the convention.The Sanders and Clinton campaigns did compromise on the party platform with Clinton accepting more progressive positions that had been put forward by Sanders. Nevertheless some movement activists who had embraced the Sanders' campaign remained unsettled by concerns like: the absence of strong and clear opposition to unfair trade agreements; a commitment to no more war and universal health care for all; and a firmer position in defense of Palestinian rights. This resulted in a few demonstrations inside the convention and larger protests outside the hall. But while these efforts served as reminders of work that remains to be done, none ultimately disrupted the thematic orchestration of the Clinton convention.A final major differences between the two conventions were in the themes they conveyed. Trumps' insurgency has been predicated on the personality of Trump, hatred of all things Clinton, and the frustration, fear, and anger of those who have felt they are losing ground in today's economy and changing world. They resent the ""other""--Mexicans, Muslims, and groups whom they feel benefit from affirmative action programs. They fear crime, terrorism, loss of American power and prestige, and changes in the world and society that have feeling left out and adrift. Sensing this, Trump and his convention preyed on this anger and fear--focusing it on the person of Hillary Clinton. The convention was an angry affair with former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani ranting about crime and Clinton, and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie leading a shocking anti-Clinton floor chant of ""lock her up"". For his part, Trump's acceptance speech was well-crafted and well-delivered. But it was an anger-filled dark litany of the nation's ills. It was a far-reaching indictment of all that is wrong with America with his solution being to elect him with the vague assurance that he alone knows how to get it right.Clinton, on the other hand, developed a more positive message. She acknowledged that problems exist, to be sure, but she proposed specific fixes that involved bipartisan compromise, and communities working together with government to create and expand opportunities and improve the quality of life for all. It was an upbeat message conveyed not only by Clinton but by a stream of speakers--citizens from every walk of life who told of their struggles and how action had been to taken to address their needs. As political and policy events, the Democrats' convention had the clear advantage. Both parties spent considerable time in attacking the others' nominee. But Democrats were better at telling their story, presenting their candidate and their programs, and creating optimism that they had made progress in the last 8 years and would continue to make positive change in the years to come.If anything, the two conventions established was that just as the primary season has been raucous and contentious, the general election promises more of the same. It will be an election like no other. Follow @AAIUSA for more. "
22,POLITICS,An Alternate To A Binary Choice?,"Harry Shearer, ContributorYour dog's best friend",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/an-alternate-to-a-binary_b_11272076.html,"Given a binary choice between two of the most disliked (per the polls) major-party candidates this side of Zimbabwe, what is one to do?

The buried implication is that you have no other choice, that it's a binary decision. Which comes as news to cord-cutters and bundlers, OTA antenna buyers and people who find other ways to watch TV and video. The choice isn't as binary as it's made to seem.I bring all this up in the context of the current presidential campaign, in which it's equally in the interests of the two major parties to convince us that the choice in November is starkly, irremediably binary. Otherwise, it's suggested, our vote is wasted or, worse yet, electing the ""wrong,"" ""other"" candidate. The name of Ralph Nader is hissed threateningly.Another comparison comes to mind: TINA, the acronym for what the EU has told the ""periphery"" countries about their forced regimen of austerity. ""There Is No Alternative."" The Brits, however, just figured one out.That's a bit stark, but the aim of the binary choicers and the TINAists is the same: to foreclose further thought. So, in defiance of that planned foreclosure, I offer, without advocacy, a thought experiment.Newly-elected presidents like to bask in the afterglow of their ""mandate."" A larger majority gives them a rhetorical club with which to, at least during the first 18 months, batter opponents into cowed silence. Republicans always tormented Bill Clinton for having won ""only"" by a plurality in both 1992 and 1996, thanks to the meddling third-party candidacy of Ross Perot. Did it have an effect on Clinton's governing? We'll wait for his memoir to find out.But squeakers are nothing to brag about. Yeah, you won, but if it hadn't rained in the Carolinas...So, given a binary choice between two of the most disliked (per the polls) major-party candidates this side of Zimbabwe, what is one to do? Voting against one just gives a bigger mandate to the other. Not voting just depresses the overall turnout. Voting for a third, or fourth party candidate, especially in a battleground state, could help depress the ultimate winner's majority to a plurality. Especially if voters displeased with the parties' offerings, also voted angrily enough, not returning incumbents, e.g., to produce a tightly divided Congress.When the lesser of two evils can still, by the logic of the sentence itself, be regarded as kinda evil (both have proudly named, as one of their foreign-policy advisers, a certain Dr. Kissinger), a squeaker might be the best outcome available. It would encourage all the anti-Executive power gears built into our system to work at full strength, dampening the ability of the eventual winner to do his or her worst.We've heard political journalists and politicians and interest-group leaders bemoan for years the tendency toward paralysis in the federal government. This could be the year that looks like the best alternative--to borrow a Bill Clintonism, a third way in a supposedly binary universe.There could even be a slogan: ""I'm With Gridlock."""

My address today is entitled ""Our America"" and my name is Brian Levin. For almost two decades I have directed the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University in San Bernardino, a community that has endured the evil scourge of violent hatred by extremists who distorted your faith and claimed to be Muslim. But, as his holiness Mirza Masroor Ahmad explained, ""If a person does not follow a particular teaching properly whilst claiming to subscribe to it, then it is he who is in error, not the teaching."" Indeed, for over a century your community has been a shining star in our twinkling constellation of American faiths, from veterans on foreign battlefields, to scientists and medical doctors, and of course your incredibly outsized contributions to the uniquely American art form of jazz music. The Ideal of Religious Liberty Most importantly, though it is our common embrace of two core American values that brings me here today: the divinity of human life and the centrality of individual liberty, particularly in the area of religious freedom--not only for our individual lives, but our collective ones as well. To appreciate the centrality of religious liberty in Our America, one need look no further than the words of our foundational texts and those of our founding fathers. Pluralism and religious freedom transcend contemporary politics, and are critical to the moral framework that dates back to our genesis and makes America truly exceptional. Our American Constitution's Article 6 bans religious tests for any office or public trust; the first amendment prohibits the establishment of religion, as well as laws impeding the free exercise of it; and the 14th Amendment guarantees equal protection of the laws. Of the myriad accomplishments of his life, Thomas Jefferson, America's second president, who interestingly died on July 4, picked only three for the epitaph on his tombstone:Author of the Declaration of American Independence And of the Statute of Virginia for religious freedom & Father of the University of VirginiaLike our current President, Jefferson's detractors, exploited the prejudices of the time by falsely accusing him of being a secret Muslim. The words of America's first president, George Washington, over two and one quarter centuries ago to the Touro Synagogue in Newport Rhode, Island still ring true today for all of us in our America: [F]or, happily, the Government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance, requires only that they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens in giving it on all occasions their effectual support....May the children of the stock of Abraham who dwell in this land continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other inhabitants--while every one shall sit in safety under his own vine and fig tree and there shall be none to make him afraid.His Holiness, Mirza Masroor Ahmad, embraces this very ideal ""All people should have fundamental freedoms, such as religious, political, national and civil freedom.""Muslim American Heroes Yet, the extraordinary mosaic of Muslim Americans, of which you are a proud part, has produced numerous unique American heroes. One, sports legend Muhammad Ali, who we lost just this June, counseled in the months before his passing:I am a Muslim and there is nothing Islamic about killing innocent people in Paris, San Bernardino, or anywhere else in the world. True Muslims know that the ruthless violence of so called Islamic Jihadists goes against the very tenets of our religion...But perhaps Ali's greatest strength lay not in his punch, but in his faith, which inspired pacifism and tolerance: ""When you believe in God, you should believe that all people are part of one family. If you love God, you can't love only some of his children."" Just two nights ago in Philadelphia, we heard about another Muslim-American hero, U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khan. His grief stricken father, Khizr Khan while holding a copy of the Constitution, told America how Humayun lost his life in Iraq while valiantly protecting other American soldiers under his command. Mr. Khan's eloquence moved the nation, when he noted that had bans on Muslims actually been enacted, his son would never have been able to serve our country.[Video added for column only]Our Embrace of Pluralism Is A Bulwark Against Extremism These messages stand in stark contrast to the deafening cacophony of gunfire that struck my beloved community and later Orlando. While these killers severed the lives of family members from loved ones, in Our America we will simply not allow radical killers the additional harm of defeating American pluralism, by severing communities of good will from one another. This counterfeit violent hatred, which represents the most prominent terror threat since 9/11, for all its notoriety is nothing more than an apocalyptic death cult in religious giftwrap, that has both Muslims around the world, as well as Europeans and Americans in its crosshairs. At a mosque in Baltimore this spring President Obama observed: America rejects bigotry. We reject every act of hatred against people of Arab background or Muslim faith America values and welcomes peaceful people of all faiths -- Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Sikh, Hindu and many others. Every faith is practiced and protected here, because we are one country. Every immigrant can be fully and equally American because we're one country. Oh, excuse me for a second, that was President George W. Bush, speaking in my home state of California in 2002. President Obama actually said this:[Y]ou've seen too often people conflating the horrific acts of terrorism with the beliefs of an entire faith. And of course, recently, we've heard inexcusable political rhetoric against Muslim Americans that has no place in our country.....We're one American family. And when any part of our family starts to feel separate or second-class or targeted, it tears at the very fabric of our nation.Over the past year, candidates have boldly argued for, and sometimes backtracked on, temporarily banning entry to all Muslims, irrespective of who they are; shuttering mosques, registering Muslims in databases, killing relatives of terrorists, denying entry to America even to a five year old orphan refugee child, torture beyond waterboarding, as well establishing a religious test for refugee admission and the presidency. One candidate likened Muslim refugees to rabid dogs, while another proclaimed ""I think Islam hates us.""Our Center's study found that in the non-calendar month following the November 13 Paris terrorist attack, hate crimes against Muslim Americans tripled from the monthly average of the previous five years. Two criminals struck mosques in our area, an Ahmadiyya Muslim mosque in Hawthorne was vandalized, while a mosque in the Coachella Valley was set ablaze.  Liberty, In Our America, Shines on All  When contemporary terrorists attack, they make no distinction between Muslims and non-Muslims. But more importantly when God's light shines down from the stars over our American heroes in national cemeteries from Arlington, Virginia to Riverside, California, he makes no distinctions, between Muslim and non-Muslim either, and neither should we. In Our America, our religious liberty fulfills the dreams of our ancestors, but only if we work together to sustain it. My departed refugee Russian grandmother and World War II era POW father, after facing the violent scourge of anti-Semitism in Europe, were cradled by a welcoming nation that they in turn loved so very much. Now we all must work to extend the promise of Emma Lazarus' prose inscribed on the Statue of Liberty to embrace yet a new generation of Americans, who come here for the promise of religious freedom. Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me. I lift my lamp beside the golden door!My fellow Americans, and friends watching this around the world, it is such a heartfelt privilege to share the blessings of Our America with you on this special day. Salam Aleikum and God bless the United States of America."
24,RELIGION,6 Ways The GOP Fails To Be Pro-Life,"Alise D. Chaffins, ContributorWriter, speaker, musician, and defender of the Oxford comma. A...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/6-ways-the-gop-fails-to-b_b_11277412.html,"In November, I will be voting my conscience, and it will be based on a pro-life ethic.",2016-07-30,Young girl holding small block letters with message: Vote,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7aedf20000099000176db.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For my entire adult life, the standard line from Christian conservatives has been for people to vote their conscience. Groups like the American Family Association, Family Research Council, and Focus on the Family have put out voter guides each year for as long as I can remember, encouraging people to vote for the candidate who best reflected where the morals of a Christian politician should be. They have always decried the accusations of partisanship, but rather strictly about voting for the candidate who lined up with what they believed were Christian values about abortion, marriage equality, and inexplicably to me at least, gun rights and tax breaks. Vote your conscience has been in every election I've seen since I was old enough to vote in 1992, always amped up every four years when it's time to elect a president. The subtext has always been that Christians should vote Republican, but it has been a standard line.+++++I watched last week's Republican National Convention through the lens of late night talk show hosts and my Twitter and Facebook feeds. I did the same this week for much of the Democratic National Convention. I did watch Michelle Obama's powerful speech, as well as the uplifting words from Senator Cory Booker, but for the most part political rah-rah'ing isn't my idea of a good time. Catching up with America Ninja Warrior on Hulu after an evening hunting for Pokémon is far more my speed. Anger and dissension just wear me out.There was a lot to take in at the RNC, but the one that rattled around in my mind the most was when Senator Ted Cruz was booed off of the stage as it became apparent he would not endorse Donald Trump, but rather said to the crowd, ""Stand, and speak, and vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution."" This was met with roars of disapproval from the crowd in attendance.I do understand that part of the job of the convention is to rally around the party's nominee. To come together and present a united front, and the lack of an official, strong endorsement from a prime time speaker is surprising (though the speech was available to the RNC ahead of time). So I can see that some at the convention would be upset that a speaker would neglect that aspect. But barring the lack of an endorsement, the content of Cruz's speech was lifted straight from the Republican platform. Close the borders. Beware of ISIS. States' rights. Gun rights. Small government.I may disagree with most of the policies presented in Cruz's speech, but there is nothing in them that should cause a group of Republicans to boo. Only the mention that they should vote their conscience incited that reaction. Only the idea that voting your conscience might not lead you to vote in the way that stays within party lines.The truth is, I'm a single issue voter. When I vote my conscience, it looks like one thing.Voting for a candidate with a strong pro-life ethic. Which has, for most of my adult life, looked like voting for a Democrat rather than a Republican.Yes, in the area of abortion, the Democrats often fail. In order to prove the value of the woman who is pregnant, the value of the life inside of her is devalued. Too often we see life only if it is desired - if not, it becomes an embryo, fetal tissue, a parasite. Abortion is a complex issue, but when we speak of a potential human without respect, we cheapen the cry of equality, especially in the eyes of those who call themselves pro-life.But a pro-life ethic has to mean more than just where a candidate stands on abortion (though Donald Trump's stand on abortion is fairly unclear).A pro-life ethic must respect women. Donald Trump's views of women are abhorrent. If you're unable to see women as people deserving even a modicum of respect, you can't be pro-life. A pro-life ethic must listen to the voices of black men and women. The chants of All Lives Matter when confronted with the assertion that Black Lives Matter must end. Of course all lives matter. But black men and women matter as well, and much of our country's history has belied that. Even Michelle Obama's statement that she lives in a home built by slaves was met with a statement from conservative Bill O'Reilly saying, Sure, they were slaves, but it wasn't that bad. A pro-life ethic can affirm that all lives matter while also saying that yes, black lives matter. Not with comments about ""black on black crime"" or ""more white people are in jail"" or ""just listen to the police."" Instead, those of use who are not black need to shut up and listen. And then see how we can begin to change the system to make things more equal for our black brothers and sisters.A pro-life ethic must respect those with disabilities. Donald Trump has openly mocked a journalist with disabilities. I mother several children on the autism spectrum. My heart would be broken if a public leader were to deride them publicly. We cannot offer lip service to a pro-life ethic and sit by while the Republican nominee has shown contempt in his actions for those with disabilities.A pro-life ethic must encourage adoption. One of the ways that we encourage a pro-life ethic is to encourage people to adopt. The GOP platform reaffirms opposition to gay and lesbian couples adopting. My friend Sean and his husband have adopted two gorgeous boys (Sean has written about it in his best-selling book, Which One of You is the Mother?). They adopted children who were older. Children from difficult birth families. They adopted them, they love them, they parent them. Children who, if left in foster care, would have had a 45% chance of ending up homeless. Children who, if left in foster care, would have had a 75% chance of ending up in prison. Children who, because of their adoption by a gay couple, now have the chance to experience family.A pro-life ethic must look at the ways life is cut short beyond abortion. Yes, I'm talking about guns. I am not a gun owner and I didn't grow up in a house with guns, so I tend to speak very little on this issue, because I don't know much about gun laws or the way that guns even work. But when Republicans block even research about gun violence, it is difficult for me to see that as caring about life. When a group covers their ears, refusing to even have a conversation about ways we can make life safer in a world with guns, I cannot call that group pro-life.A pro-life ethic must see people, even our enemies, as people first. During his campaign, Donald Trump advocated war crimes when he suggested that the United States not only hunt down terrorists, but also ""take out their families."" He has lumped all Muslims into the category of radical, calling for a ban on all Muslims entering the United States. He has painted with the broad brush that Mexican immigrants are rapists and murderers. Donald Trump has called vast swaths of non-white ethnicities our enemies, and then challenged their humanity. If an unborn child is a person, surely even those who seek to do us harm is are people as well.In November, I will be voting my conscience, and it will be based on a pro-life ethic.I hope you will do the same."
25,BUSINESS,How Seagull Managers Make Everyone Miserable,"Dr. Travis Bradberry, ContributorAuthor of #1 bestselling book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0, and...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-seagull-managers-make_b_10665052.html,,2016-07-30,2016-06-24-1466811268-5328371-HowSeagullManagersMakeEveryoneMiserableHP.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-06-24-1466811268-5328371-HowSeagullManagersMakeEveryoneMiserableHP-thumb.jpg,"Unfortunately, we've all been there. The boss finds his staff stumped by a problem and decides it's time to step in. But, instead of taking the time to get the facts straight and work alongside his team to realize a viable solution, he swoops in squawking, dumps orders riddled with formulaic advice, and then abruptly takes off, leaving them behind to clean up the mess.Seagull managers only interact with their employees when there's a fire to put out. Even then, they move in and out so hastily--and put so little thought into their approach--that they make bad situations worse by frustrating and alienating those who need them the most.The seagull manager is an increasingly common phenomenon hovering in today's workplace. As companies flatten in response to the competitive changes created by new technology, industry regulation, and expanding global trade, they gut management layers. The remaining managers are left with more autonomy, responsibility, and more people to manage. That means they have less time and less accountability for focusing on the primary purpose of their position--managing people.While there's probably always been some seagull managers hovering inside the workplace, the recent flattening of organizations is breeding them like wildfire. It's easy to spot a seagull manager when you're on the receiving end of their airborne dumps, but the manager doing the squawking is often unaware of the negative impact of this behavior.And they aren't the only ones. In the vast majority of organizations, senior leadership is unschooled in the profound, negative impact the seagull managers hovering about their organization are having on its bottom line. The very individuals with the authority to alter the course of an organization's culture lack the facts that would impel them to do so.But the real question is not are you a seagull manager, but when are you a seagull manager? It would be wonderfully simple--albeit frightening--if we could each be categorized as the ""right"" or ""wrong"" kind of manager. It's just not that black and white.My biggest fear in writing this post is that it will be used to target ""problem"" managers, when the reality is we're all the problem. That's right. Every single one of us are seagull managers sometimes, in some situations, and with some people. The real challenge lies in understanding where your seagull tendencies get the better of you, so that you can fly higher and eradicate the negative influences of seagull behavior.Scott Adams experienced this first hand. After more than 20 years satirizing management culture through his wildly successful Dilbert comic strip, Adams agreed to roll up his sleeves and manage a restaurant he had co-owned for years from a safe distance. His foray into the rough-and-tumble world of management was a humbling one, and he was honest about his shortcomings in the real world.""I'm quite sure I've succumbed to....flying in every so often and dumping on everything,"" Adams admitted. And the title of seagull manager isn't reserved solely for those who manage others in a formal capacity. Whether you're an engineer, a seasoned manager, or a novice climbing the corporate ladder, you must spot the situations where you engage in a seagull style of management of the problems you face. The key to overcoming seagull management is to tackle challenges when they are big enough to see, yet still small enough to solve.The Virtues of Superior ManagersThrough my involvement at TalentSmart I've obtained a bird's eye view of the practices that are essential to a manager's job performance and the satisfaction of his or her staff. We've found that superior managers--those who lead their teams to the greatest levels of performance and job satisfaction--often share three critical habits.These habits, or virtues of superior managers, are the polar opposites of the three distinguishing characteristics of a seagull manager--swooping, squawking, and dumping. They're challenging to maintain on a regular basis and require emotional intelligence.1. Clear expectations. Managers who set clear expectations ensure that employee efforts are spent doing the right things the right way. This means thoroughly exploring what will be required of the employee, how their performance will be evaluated in the future, and getting agreement and commitment to work towards established goals. There is a big difference between telling someone what's expected of them and making sure that what they'll be doing is completely understood.2. Consistent communication. Consistent communication requires diligently observing what employees say and do, and speaking openly with them about their work. A manager's interaction with his or her employees delivers the resources, guidance, and recognition they need to succeed. Communication is effective when it is frequent and in a language that everyone understands.3. Powerful feedback. You can only provide powerful feedback when you pay careful attention to each employee's performance, while offering praise as frequently and emphatically as you do constructive feedback. Powerful feedback pushes your team to new heights by positively reinforcing successful endeavors and realigning efforts that become misdirected.Whereas the seagull manager creates the need to swoop in and set his team straight, the superior manager gets everyone headed in the right direction from the very beginning by ensuring that expectations are clear. Whereas the rare visit from the seagull manager results in a lot of squawking, the superior manager maintains a steady flow of communication. And where the seagull manager manages his team's performance by dumping on everybody, the superior manager keeps track of performance--ensuring that positive and negative feedback are delivered in small, digestible doses.Bringing It All TogetherIn the course of my work with organizations large and small, I've witnessed a peculiar commonality among the most successful enterprises. These companies step confidently beyond the success strategies of conventional business wisdom--brand strength, strategic leadership, technological innovation, customer service, and the like--to leverage the single greatest resource inside every company--its people.Few organizations recognize the degree to which managers are the vessels of a company's culture, and even fewer work diligently, through training and coaching programs, to ensure their vessels hold the knowledge and skills that motivate employees to perform, feel satisfied, and love their jobs.People may join companies, but they will leave bosses. No one influences an employee's morale and productivity more than his or her supervisor. It's that simple. Don't let seagull management hold you back.Have you seen any seagull managers? Please share your thoughts in the comments section below as I learn just as much from you as you do from me."

On a typical day, I couldn't find my way out of a crowded parking lot in Boise, but on this journey I drove to the ocean without a problem. I found my family of four adults, five children, and two dogs, camped side by side in an RV park across the street from the cape. My young granddaughters were happy to see me and begged me to tell them stories. My daughter handed me a glass of wine, and my son calmed my fears and told me not to worry. One child was climbing on my back and another grabbed my hands and wanted to dance in the grass. Breathing became normal again.  That evening, we created individual pizzas with dough and toppings they brought from Boise, and my son-in-law cooked them in a portable pizza oven attached to his grill. The next day, my son and son-in-law parked their pickup trucks on the beach and set up a day camp.

As I traveled through lush forests and past rolling meadows, I wondered how such a wonderful world could be so hostile and what I could do to improve the situation. Images of my happy grandchildren propelled me to keep going and focus on what really mattered.The uncomplicated authenticity of life with a loving family surpassed any grandiose scheme to change the world. I couldn't do anything about distant chaos, but I could support and cheer for my children, their spouses, and their children. I could tell stories and write blogs and books that caused people to laugh. I could turn off the news. I'm grateful that my grandchildren took care of me over two days.

Insisting on declaring our being superior to everyone else is quote another.,2016-07-30,"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton addresses the Democratic National Committee (DNC) Summer Meeting in Minneapolis, Minnesota, August 28, 2015. REUTERS/Craig Lassig",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb822f0220000ba01dd404c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Let me first try to make sure I'm not misunderstood.I am not saying that I wish the Democrats had done anything different at the convention. As many observed, the Democrats were smart to occupy the upbeat, patriotic, American-exceptionalist, morning-in-America space that Trump's GOP abandoned with its fear-mongering dark picture of the state of the nation. Those chants of ""U.S.A! U.S.A.!"" may help some Republicans and Independents, unhappy with Trump, feel comfortable turning to the Democratic Party for at least a temporary home. That's good politics, and whatever is good politics for the Democrats this year is good for America.And I am not criticizing expressions of love of country. Such love is probably a healthy thing for anyone in any country. But in particular, I am glad to say that I love America. The older I get, the more frequently I feel gratitude that my grandparents came to these shores. In part it is because I know that had they not, my ancestral line might have been cut short -- years before my birth -- in that ditch at Babi Yar, or some such place. And I've also come to appreciate my good fortune to have had the opportunities and comforts that being born in this country in these times has given me.But feeling such love and gratitude for one's country is one thing. Insisting on declaring our being superior to everyone else is quote another. While it may be good politics for speaker after speaker at the DNC to declare that we're ""the greatest nation on earth!"" the nation would be greater if the American people had less need for this kind of collective narcissism.It has been said (by a Swiss social thinker, Denis de Rougemont more than half a century ago) that patriotism isegotism, but so broadened as to become a virtue... It is accepted that every form of pride, every form of vanity, and even the most stupid boastings are legitimate and honorable so long as they are attributed to the nation in which one has taken the trouble to get born. What nobody would dare to say of his me, he has the sacred duty of saying for his us.The Republicans, of course, have just nominated someone who does dare to make such stupid boastings of his ""me."" And many of us find it a turn-off. Do you suppose that our friends in other nations find it appealing how often we Americans shout about how our nation is greater than all the others?People of psychological acumen understand that Donald Trump's endless boasts are anything but a sign of a truly secure and healthy sense of self-worth. Can it be all that good a sign about the collective state of the American psyche that we are so eager to tell the world that ""We're # 1""?Even if we are.But are we indeed the greatest nation on earth? The matter is not so easily judged: there are so many dimensions to evaluate that scoring the matter would be more complex than calculating points for the decathalon.We are indeed the greatest military power on earth-- as well we should be, spending as we do more than the next many countries combined.Our role in the world as a hegemonic power may be more benign -- or perhaps one should say less malignant -- than any of the previous dominant powers.It remains true that this nation has the world's dominant economy-- though by some calculations the Chinese economy is now bigger in aggregate, and on a per capital basis there are some other nations richer than we.Historically, the U.S. has indeed served as a beacon to the world, representing the values of liberty, and providing opportunities to those willing to work hard.But we're also number 1 of all the nations on earth in how many of our people are in prison; number 1 among the 20 major advanced nations in the rate of infant mortality; in income inequality; in the proportion of our people, especially our children, who live in poverty; in how much we spend per person on health care, while also having the most people who go without health care because of cost.But even if our claims to be the greatest are valid, we would be greater still if we as a people did not have so powerful an appetite for the narcissistic gratification of asserting our greatness.Our religious traditions teach us that a degree of humility is necessary for being able to receive some of the blessings of the spirit. Is there any reason to believe that to be less true for the collectivity of a nation than it is for us as individuals?Narcissistic needs do not come out of a healthy place. And they do not foster healthy outcomes.The Republican Party of recent years has combined two elements that might at first seem in contradiction to one another. On the one hand, the Republicans have been the ones to make a big issue out of ""American exceptionalism,"" which in their hands becomes a boast about our superiority to all others. On the other hand, they have acted -- first under the Bush presidency and then in their obstructionist role as the disloyal opposition -- as a wrecking crew upon the nation, degrading just about everything about America that has made it great.Which all points to why I wish that ""We're the greatest!"" weren't such good politics: if we collectively were less attached to our being superior, we would be more capable -- psychologically and spiritually -- of making America still better."

One case involved a woman and the other three involved men, Scott said.While health officials have yet to identify mosquitoes carrying the virus, the state has ruled out other means of transmission, including travel to another country with a Zika outbreak, and sexual contact.U.S. health officials have cautioned for months that the summer mosquito season was likely to bring local outbreaks, with Gulf Coast states such as Florida, Texas and Louisiana, on the front lines.The current Zika outbreak was first detected in Brazil last year, triggering global alarm amid evidence the virus could cause a rare birth defect in infants and other severe neurological abnormalities.Brazil has confirmed over 1,600 cases of microcephaly linked to Zika infection in pregnant women. The condition is defined by unusually small infant head size and related profound developmental problems.Zika's U.S. arrival comes with Congress in recess after failing to reach agreement over how much funding could be used to fight an outbreak. The Obama administration has requested $1.9 billion to finance research, mosquito control and other prevention efforts.(Additional reporting by Ankur Banerjee in Bengaluru; Writing by Michele Gershberg; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Bernadette Baum)"

The economy was previously reported to have grown at a 1.1 percent pace in the first quarter.Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP growth rising at a 2.6 percent rate in the last quarter.While the drop in inventories weighed on GDP growth last quarter, that is likely to provide a boost to output for the rest of the year. The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday that near-term risks to the economic outlook had “diminished.”The government also published revisions to data going back to 2013 through the first quarter of 2016. The revisions partially addressed measurement issues, which have tended to lower first-quarter GDP estimates. GDP growth in the first quarter of 2015 was revised sharply higher to a 2.0 percent rate from the previously reported 0.6 percent pace.Consumer spending was responsible for almost all of the rebound in GDP growth in the second quarter. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased at a 4.2 percent rate. That was the fastest pace since the fourth quarter of 2014.That rate of growth is probably unsustainable, but economists say a tightening labor market, rising house prices and higher savings should underpin spending for the rest of 2016. Inventory accumulation by businesses fell $8.1 billion in the second quarter, the first drop since the third quarter of 2011, down from a $40.7 billion increase in the first quarter.As a result, inventory investment subtracted 1.16 percentage points from GDP growth in the last quarter. It was the fourth straight quarter that inventories weighed on output.But the smaller inventory build is a good signal for growth in the coming quarters.Despite the lingering effects of the dollar’s rally and weak global demand, exports rose in the second quarter, helping to narrow the trade deficit. Trade added 0.23 percentage point to GDP growth."

Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.). “Congress breaking for a historic summer recess without doing its job to protect Americans from Zika is incomprehensible and unconscionable.”“The Republican Congress has left town for seven weeks having failed to provide the resources needed to protect the American people,” said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), noting that more than 5,000 Americans – including nearly 800 pregnant women – were already infected with Zika from traveling abroad. “A stronger America requires real leadership in moments of crises, yet Republicans are continuing their dangerous recklessness in the face of this public health threat.”Similarly, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) took to Twitter to demand Congress deal with the spreading mosquito-borne virus. President Barack Obama asked for $1.9 billion to fund the Zika response back in February. The Senate eventually passed a bipartisan measure in May that would have provided $1.1 billion. But that measure differed from a version taken up in the House, and Republicans ultimately modified the bill to add provisions targeting Planned Parenthood, preserving the Confederate flag, taking money from Obamacare and weakening the Clean Water Act regarding pesticides.Democrats objected to the added riders and voted against the bill just before Congress left, saying that Republicans should ditch the ideological additions and just use the original Senate bill that had gotten 89 “yes” votes. Republicans declined.Representatives for House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) did not directly answer whether they were considering bringing lawmakers back, but suggested there would be no point if Democrats would again block the Republicans’ modified bill.“We wonder if Senator Reid’s comment suggests Senate Democrats are ready to end their filibuster of the House-passed $1.1 billion package to fight Zika,” said Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong.McConnell’s spokesman, Don Stewart, also pointed to recent reports that suggest the White House has enough money to do what it needs. Earlier this year the administration agreed to transfer some $589 million from other programs to deal with Zika. But according to data provided to news outlets by Obama’s Office of Management and the Budget, at least $384 million of that remains unspent. Stewart said the White House has “not explained why they’ve been so slow in using the funding they already have.”Still, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned Friday that money is indeed urgently needed.“What could happen is ... we’ll have to delay the vaccine,” Fauci said at a forum of the Bipartisan Policy Center, according to a report in Modern Health. “So we haven’t delayed anything up to now, but if we don’t get money soon, it’s going to have a ripple effect down the pike.”Fauci declined to say what Congress should do, but argued that his efforts to take protective steps would soon be harmed.“I am preciously close to the point where I run out of money and things are going to start slowing,” Fauci said.The OMB did not respond to a request for comment on the status of the funding.Congress is not scheduled to return from its break until after Labor Day in September."
32,POLITICS,6 More State Employees Criminally Charged In Flint Water Crisis,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/flint-water-charges_us_579b6225e4b0e2e15eb5792d,"“The families of Flint will not be forgotten,” the state's attorney general said.",2016-07-29,Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette (R) might run for governor. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images),https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579b66a01200008104a542c5.jpeg?ops=crop_0_61_3228_1715%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Six more people have been charged with crimes for their role in allowing the water in Flint, Michigan to become tainted with lead, a deadly poison. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette, a Republican, announced the charges against the six state employees on Friday morning. “The families of Flint will not be forgotten,” Schuette said at a press conference Friday. “Those who committed crimes will be held accountable.”Friday’s announcement brings the total number of Flint water crisis criminal charges to nine, plus two civil suits against private companies that consulted on the city’s water situation. The people charged Friday are Nancy Peeler, Corrine Miller, Robert Scott, Liane Shekter-Smith, Patrick Cook and Adam Rosenthal, all current or former employees of either the state Department of Environmental Quality or the Department of Health and Human Services.The charges stem from the state’s failure to follow proper treatment protocols after switching the city’s water source to the Flint River in 2014. Contrary to federal regulations, state officials failed to add corrosion inhibitors to prevent the river water from leaching lead from the city’s pipes. “The result was water was poisoned and children were exposed to extremely high levels of lead which may impede their growth and development for the rest of the their lives,” Schuette said. Flint residents knew something was wrong with their water in 2014, but the state insisted it was safe. In July of 2015, Schuette alleges ― and previously released emails have suggested ― Peeler, Scott and Miller became aware of high lead levels in Flint kids’ blood, but convinced themselves seasonal variation accounted for the change. They’ve been charged with conspiracy, willful neglect of duty and misconduct in office.The charges against Shekter-Smith, Cook and Rosenthal relate to their failure to take corrective action once they knew about Flint’s water problems.Political observers believe Schuette is positioning himself to run for governor of Michigan. He spoke about the Flint water crisis at the Republican National Convention. “Pregnant moms and mothers with newborns still should not drink the water and that’s not right,” Schuette said last week. “But I will make it right, because in Michigan the system is not rigged. In Michigan we have one system of justice which means there are rules for all.”Hillary Clinton also gave Flint a shoutout when she formally accepted her presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday night. “I sweat the details of policy ― whether we’re talking about the exact level of lead in the drinking water in Flint, Michigan, the number of mental health facilities in Iowa, or the cost of your prescription drugs,” Clinton said.Flint’s water still has unsafe levels of lead, meaning water samples from more than 10 percent of homes contained above 15 parts per billion lead in the most recent round of testing. No level of lead exposure is safe ― even at low doses, the heavy metal can cause a range of problems, most notably brain damage in small children. "
33,POLITICS,"To Win, Hillary Should Be Like Bernie, New Poll Suggests",Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-poll-hillary-should-be-like-bernie_us_579ab05de4b08a8e8b5d79be,But some progressives are worried the Democratic Party sees a more fiscally conservative pitch as its ticket to the White House.,2016-07-29,Former presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) speaks at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on Monday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579ab1d92a00002d00fb386b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PHILADELPHIA ― If Hillary Clinton wants to win, she would do well to channel the populist message of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).That is the main takeaway of a new survey conducted by Democracy Corps, a Democratic-affiliated polling firm, on behalf of the Roosevelt Institute, a progressive think tank. Joseph Stiglitz, the Roosevelt Institute’s Nobel Prize-winning chief economist, and Stanley Greenberg, founder of Democracy Corps, analyzed the implications of the research at a panel discussion for attendees of the Democratic National Convention and members of the media in downtown Philadelphia on Thursday.As part of a survey of 900 voters, Democracy Corps tested two different variations of the “stronger together” message of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.One version, which the pollsters called “build on the progress,” celebrates the economic gains of the Obama presidency. It proposes policies like infrastructure investment and paid family leave to lock in those gains and ensure they are better distributed.Another version, which Democracy Corps called “rewrite the rules,” portrays an economy that is fundamentally broken and a rigged political system that prevents ordinary American voters from making changes that would improve their lives. Unlike “build on the progress,” it insists that ending the “stranglehold of big money on our politics” is effectively a prerequisite for achieving other progressive priorities. While “rewrite the rules” does not identify itself as the Sanders campaign message, it closely mirrors the Democratic presidential candidate’s primary-season pitch to disenchanted voters.They then compared the performance of the two messages to a “nationalist economic” narrative of the kind being peddled by Donald Trump. The latter message claims that the United States is being ripped off by countries around the world, as well as unauthorized immigrants, and needs a veteran of the business world to look out for American businesses and workers.Unsurprisingly, millennials, people of color and unmarried women ― all key Democratic constituencies ― strongly preferred both “stronger together” messages over the Trump-like “nationalist economic” one.But the three groups also favored the “stronger together + rewrite the rules” by a larger margin than the “stronger together + build on progress” message.Fifty-nine percent of millennials, 67 percent of minority voters and 54 percent of unmarried women viewed the “rewrite the rules” message positively. By contrast, 45 percent of millennials, 53 percent of minorities and 52 percent of unmarried women liked the “build on progress” message.Clinton’s overall margin of victory against Trump jumped 4 percentage points among all the voters surveyed after they were introduced to the “rewrite the rules” message, resulting in a 46 percent to 39 percent win. By contrast, Clinton’s margin of victory actually declined by one percentage point after survey participants heard the “build on progress” message, yielding a narrower Clinton win of 43 to 41 percent.As even Democracy Corps’ numbers suggests, there is more than one way to win an election. But the subtext of Thursday’s event is an ongoing fight between the progressive wing of the Democratic party ― exemplified by Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren ― and a more business-friendly branch dominated by elite donors.The progressive wing of the party believes that the rising income inequality and flat median income of the Obama years demonstrated that more dramatic action is needed to make the economy work for ordinary Americans. They tend to reject new trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiated by President Barack Obama; embrace deficit spending; promote policies that strengthen labor unions; and view campaign finance reform as a key component of accomplishing all of those things.Seventy-one percent of Americans believe the economy is “on the wrong track,” according to the Democracy Corps poll. “When they say things are not going well, they know what they’re talking about,” Stiglitz said on Thursday, before sharing a series of statistics to substantiate his point.“The median income of a full-time male worker is lower than it was 42 years ago,” he added. “The real wages at the bottom are roughly comparable to where they were 60 years ago.”Regardless of Clinton’s political options, Stiglitz, Greenberg and many progressives in the audience expressed a hope that she will pursue a more populist path to the White House, which they believe will create the political rationale for a progressive agenda once she is in office.Hillary Clinton’s campaign argues she has a strong message for these struggling voters. Clinton has promised to sign a bill raising the federal minimum wage to $15, increase Social Security benefits and pass a constitutional amendment repealing the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision.Clinton even told Sanders supporters that they have a role to play in her campaign and her governing agenda.Speeches by Obama, vice presidential candidate Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and others were sprinkled with references to Republicans supportive of Clinton’s campaign. After Bloomberg’s ripping speech Wednesday night, Reihan Salam, a conservative policy analyst, wrote in Slate that Democrats are increasingly a party that caters to a coalition of socially liberal and fiscally conservative members of the upper middle class, which he nicknamed the “Bloombourgeoisie” for Bloomberg.“Going forward, one can imagine a battle for the Democratic Party’s soul that will pit the Bloombourgeoisie against the Sandernistas with both factions fighting to win over working- and lower-middle-class minority voters,” Salam wrote.As Salam notes, Trump’s candidacy appears to have only accelerated an exodus of well-off, highly educated Americans from the Republican Party that was already underway. Obama won eight out of 10 of the country’s wealthiest counties in 2012. And a majority of the top 4 percent of earners ― those making $220,000 or more ― voted for Obama in 2012, marking just the third time that a majority of that cohort did not go for the Republican candidate since 1964.Obama’s electoral victories show Democrats can win nationwide with the help of Bloomberg-style fiscal conservatives, offsetting the shrinking share of the white working-class vote that Democrats now receive.Greenberg acknowledged that the growing role of ex-Republican, upper-middle-class voters in the Democratic coalition endangers the chances of the party’s progressive wing.“It gets harder and harder to have this battle,” he concluded. “That’s why we have to have it in this election.”"

The young Republican had jumped at the chance to volunteer for Nelson Rockefeller’s last-minute effort to take the nomination from Richard Nixon and attend her first political convention.“The Republican convention was my first inside look at big-time politics, and I found the week unreal and unsettling,” Clinton wrote in her 2003 memoir. The 20-year-old Rodham probably never anticipated that 48 years later, she’d be at another political convention ― this time standing on the stage at the Democratic National Convention, making history as the first woman to ever receive a major party’s presidential nomination. “Tonight, we’ve reached a milestone in our nation’s march toward a more perfect union: the first time that a major party has nominated a woman for president,” Clinton said Thursday night. “Standing here as my mother’s daughter, and my daughter’s mother, I’m so happy this day has come. I’m happy for grandmothers and little girls and everyone in between. I’m happy for boys and men, too – because when any barrier falls in America, it clears the way for everyone.”“After all, when there are no ceilings, the sky’s the limit,” she added. “So let’s keep going, until every one of the 161 million women and girls across America has the opportunity she deserves to have. But even more important than the history we make tonight, is the history we will write together in the years ahead”While more than 200 women have pursued the presidency since 1872 ― when Victoria Woodhull became the first woman to run for the highest office in the land ― no one has come as close as Clinton. Clinton presented the 2016 election as a moment of reckoning for America, a time when “powerful forces are threatening to pull us apart.”“We have to decide whether we all will work together so we all can rise together,” she said. “Our country’s motto is e pluribus unum: out of many, we are one. Will we stay true to that motto? Well, we heard Donald Trump’s answer last week at his convention. He wants to divide us ― from the rest of the world, and from each other. ““Don’t believe anyone who says, ‘I alone can fix it,’” she added. “Yes, those were actually Donald Trump’s words in Cleveland. And they should set off alarm bells for all of us.”Thursday night was an event that many women have been waiting for their whole lives, and there were plenty of tears ― both in the arena and from afar ― for the big, historic moment when Clinton came out to greet her daughter, Chelsea, onstage. Suzanne Miller, 66, from Washington, D.C., said her 92-year-old mother in central Pennsylvania was a lifelong Republican. But this spring, she changed her party registration so that she could vote for Clinton.“She’s thrilled, at 92, to be able to vote for a woman,” Miller said. “She never, ever thought she’d see this day. She is so excited and so thrilled that she changed her party after all those years.”“This is looking at the fruits of my labor for 30 years, and feeling very proud,” said Ellen Malcolm, the founder of EMILY’s List, which works to elect pro-choice Democratic women and has become one of the most powerful political action committees since its start in 1985. It’s been a long journey for Clinton. She first came to national attention as a student at Wellesley College in 1969, when her peers selected her to deliver the school’s first-ever student commencement speech. The student body president spoke for her generation, saying that although they weren’t yet in positions of power and leadership, they did have “that indispensable element of criticizing and constructive protest.” Her comments were a direct rebuke of the speech Sen. Edward Brooke (R-Mass.) had delivered right before she took the stage, as he had argued against the effectiveness and need to protest. Clinton made The New York Times, The Washington Post and Life magazine. She began to get noticed, speaking around the country.But she really began to draw attention as a political spouse ― albeit an untraditional one. Although Clinton now faces skepticism from the progressive wing of her party, she was often seen as a liberal feather-ruffler in the establishment. People didn’t like that she wanted to keep her maiden name while her husband was governor of Arkansas; it was later inconceivable to people that she would lead a health care task force as first lady.Along the way ― from her days in Arkansas to her time as first lady, from her election to the U.S. Senate to her years as secretary of state ― Clinton has, in many ways, been the case study for sexism in politics. She has faced intense scrutiny over what kind of a woman she is: her hair styles, her clothes, the sound of her voice, whether she’s likable enough. The atmosphere for women running for office has changed dramatically over the years, but they still face hurdles. Even during this election cycle, people have criticized Clinton by saying she needs to smile more and stop shouting ― despite the fact that her male challengers have never faced similar comments.And it is those struggles ― and Clinton’s endless ability to overcome them ― that have bound her supporters to her. Many of the women who have shown up to Clinton rallies and to the convention in Philadelphia say they relate to her, and that they want to see her finally come out on top. Vicki Saporta, 63, from Washington, D.C., was the first female organizer for the Teamsters union. She said she constantly struggled to be accepted by others in the movement, and that she was put through test after test after test ― only to find her male colleagues resentful when she succeeded. “I understand what it’s like to pave the way for other women and how difficult it can be to be a first ― and how much extra you have to do in order to succeed,” Saporta said.“She was the first person in the public eye, in a traditional role, in a traditional state, who didn’t say, ‘I’m sorry, but I’m going to do this.’ She just did it,” said California delegate Andrea Villa, who was covered in pro-Hillary buttons and a T-shirt that read, “Well-Behaved Women Rarely Make History.”“I’m emotional and sentimental about this because I was the first woman mayor of Ville Platte, [Louisiana,] and here I am witnessing the first woman nominee who will eventually be president of the United States,” said Jennifer Vidrine, 57.The fact that the first female nominee is also eminently qualified also makes these women proud. They stress this over and over, so that Clinton doesn’t get dismissed as just a “token” pick. After all, many of them have been accused of not being as qualified as their male counterparts ― and women still don’t make as much as men do for the same work. “I was hoping she would finally get her turn,” said Roberta Goldman from Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, who said she’s been a Clinton fan for a long time. “To me, she’s smarter than any president I’ve experienced, to be honest. ... She’s amazing! I don’t know if we’re going to get anybody else like that in a long time.”“What’s so wonderful this time, for Hillary in particular ... is the most qualified. We are going to be in such capable hands. It’s going to be so inspiring for the rest of us to be more engaged,” said Cleveland resident Terri Hamilton Brown, 54, who said she never thought she’d see a black president, let alone a black president potentially succeeded by the nation’s first female president. But Clinton’s long record of public service has also made her open to criticism that she’s part of the establishment ― something that’s especially dogging her this election, with the rise of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Her supporters consider this another damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don’t moment: Would the country choose a woman to be president if she weren’t this qualified? And how do you get qualified without being part of the system for so many years?The fact that the first female president would be part of a political family is also not surprising, since that’s how so many women broke barriers in politics.Until the 1970s, one of the most common ways for a woman to enter politics was by following her husband. According to Pew Research Center, 90 women served in the House between 1916 and 1980; 34 of them were elected to fill their husband’s seat or replaced him on the ballot after he died. This country has, traditionally, been more comfortable with female politicians when they know their husbands.Jan Cebula, a nun from Iowa who gave her age as “over 65,” sat in the very last row of the top section of the arena. The view wasn’t the best, but she said she’s overjoyed that “this is finally happening.”“I’m a little bit older. So it wasn’t an aspiration to be president when we were growing up,” Cebula said. Asked what she would have said if someone had suggested a female president when she was young, she stared blankly for a few seconds. “You know, to be real honest with you, they wouldn’t have thought of it.”Audrey Blondin, a Connecticut delegate, said she's been to four Democratic conventions and this one is ""the most emotional, exciting, energizing"" of all. Standing with a red, white and blue feather boa draped around her neck and ""dump Trump"" pins dangling from the rim of her oversized hat, Blondin recalled the glass ceilings she's hit over the years.""I graduated from high school in 1971 and my husband, who was my boyfriend at the time, went to the University of Notre Dame. I couldn't apply there because they didn't take women. I mean, to think about where I've come, from graduating from high school, to this…"" she said, trailing off.Blondin smiled and added, ""We've come a long way, baby.""Laura Bassett and Jennifer Bendery contributed reporting."

She first came to national attention as a student at Wellesley College in 1969, when her peers selected her to deliver the school’s first-ever student commencement speech. The student body president spoke for her generation, saying that although they weren’t yet in positions of power and leadership, they did have “that indispensable element of criticizing and constructive protest.” Her comments were a direct rebuke of the speech Sen. Edward Brooke (R-Mass.) had delivered right before she took the stage, as he had argued against the effectiveness and need to protest. Clinton made The New York Times, The Washington Post and Life magazine. She began to get noticed, speaking around the country.But she really began to draw attention as a political spouse ― albeit an untraditional one. Although Clinton now faces skepticism from the progressive wing of her party, she was often seen as a liberal feather-ruffler in the establishment. People didn’t like that she wanted to keep her maiden name while her husband was governor of Arkansas; it was later inconceivable to people that she would lead a health care task force as first lady.Along the way ― from her days in Arkansas to her time as first lady, from her election to the U.S. Senate to her years as secretary of state ― Clinton has, in many ways, been the case study for sexism in politics. She has faced intense scrutiny over what kind of a woman she is: her hair styles, her clothes, the sound of her voice, whether she’s likable enough. The atmosphere for women running for office has changed dramatically over the years, but they still face hurdles. Even during this election cycle, people have criticized Clinton by saying she needs to smile more and stop shouting ― despite the fact that her male challengers have never faced similar comments.And it is those struggles ― and Clinton’s endless ability to overcome them ― that have bound her supporters to her. Many of the women who have shown up to Clinton rallies and to the convention in Philadelphia say they relate to her, and that they want to see her finally come out on top. Vicki Saporta, 63, from Washington, D.C., was the first female organizer for the Teamsters union. She said she constantly struggled to be accepted by others in the movement, and that she was put through test after test after test ― only to find her male colleagues resentful when she succeeded. “I understand what it’s like to pave the way for other women and how difficult it can be to be a first ― and how much extra you have to do in order to succeed,” Saporta said.“She was the first person in the public eye, in a traditional role, in a traditional state, who didn’t say, ‘I’m sorry, but I’m going to do this.’ She just did it,” said California delegate Andrea Villa, who was covered in pro-Hillary buttons and a T-shirt that read, “Well-Behaved Women Rarely Make History.”“I’m emotional and sentimental about this because I was the first woman mayor of Ville Platte, [Louisiana,] and here I am witnessing the first woman nominee who will eventually be president of the United States,” said Jennifer Vidrine, 57.The fact that the first female nominee is also eminently qualified also makes these women proud. They stress this over and over, so that Clinton doesn’t get dismissed as just a “token” pick. After all, many of them have been accused of not being as qualified as their male counterparts ― and women still don’t make as much as men do for the same work. “I was hoping she would finally get her turn,” said Roberta Goldman from Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, who said she’s been a Clinton fan for a long time. “To me, she’s smarter than any president I’ve experienced, to be honest. ... She’s amazing! I don’t know if we’re going to get anybody else like that in a long time.”“What’s so wonderful this time, for Hillary in particular ... is the most qualified. We are going to be in such capable hands. It’s going to be so inspiring for the rest of us to be more engaged,” said Cleveland resident Terri Hamilton Brown, 54, who said she never thought she’d see a black president, let alone a black president potentially succeeded by the nation’s first female president. But Clinton’s long record of public service has also made her open to criticism that she’s part of the establishment ― something that’s especially dogging her this election, with the rise of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Her supporters consider this another damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don’t moment: Would the country choose a woman to be president if she weren’t this qualified? And how do you get qualified without being part of the system for so many years?The fact that the first female president would be part of a political family is also not surprising, since that’s how so many women broke barriers in politics.Until the 1970s, one of the most common ways for a woman to enter politics was by following her husband. According to Pew Research Center, 90 women served in the House between 1916 and 1980; 34 of them were elected to fill their husband’s seat or replaced him on the ballot after he died. This country has, traditionally, been more comfortable with female politicians when they know their husbands.Jan Cebula, a nun from Iowa who gave her age as “over 65,” sat in the very last row of the top section of the arena. The view wasn’t the best, but she said she’s overjoyed that “this is finally happening.”“I’m a little bit older. So it wasn’t an aspiration to be president when we were growing up,” Cebula said. Asked what she would have said if someone had suggested a female president when she was young, she stared blankly for a few seconds. “You know, to be real honest with you, they wouldn’t have thought of it.”Audrey Blondin, a Connecticut delegate, said she's been to four Democratic conventions and this one is ""the most emotional, exciting, energizing"" of all. Standing with a red, white and blue feather boa draped around her neck and ""dump Trump"" pins dangling from the rim of her oversized hat, Blondin recalled the glass ceilings she's hit over the years.""I graduated from high school in 1971 and my husband, who was my boyfriend at the time, went to the University of Notre Dame. I couldn't apply there because they didn't take women. I mean, to think about where I've come, from graduating from high school, to this…"" she said, trailing off.Blondin smiled and added, ""We've come a long way, baby.""Laura Bassett and Jennifer Bendery contributed reporting."
36,MEDIA,2016 Nominees Leave Conventions Without 'Protective Pool' Of Journalists,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/protective-pool-2016-nominee_us_579a628ae4b08a8e8b5d2ff6,Reporters complain that neither Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump are getting the intense pool coverage that party nominees have gotten in the past.,2016-07-29,"Trump and Clinton reporters are seeking ""protective pool"" coverage of the candidates. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579a629e2400002600b33b11.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PHILADELPHIA ― The Republican and Democratic presidential nominees will hit the campaign trail following the summer’s political conventions without the customary “protective pool” of journalists covering their daily movements. The White House Correspondents Association oversees the pools and their rotating cast of reporters who follow the president every time he leaves the White House, whether to attend a fundraiser, appear at a meeting, or play golf. Importantly, a reporter would be present to bear witness in the event of a threat against the president’s life or a history-making moment. Reporters, who share their dispatches with other members of the correspondents association, track even seemingly mundane details, from what the president wears or buys, to exactly when Air Force One lifts offs and lands. (Here’s what the reports look like.) Past presidential candidates have received this daily, even hourly, scrutiny when it becomes apparent they will be their party’s nominee, and perhaps, the next president. Then-Sen. Barack Obama’s protective pool coverage began in June 2008, and his rival, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), followed in July. Obama accepted his party’s nomination in late August and McCain in early September.The 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, received protective pool coverage in early August of that year. Though still weeks before the Republican nomination, the Los Angeles Times noted the arrangement was considered to be coming late, as reporters had been requesting the pool since Romney became the presumptive nominee months earlier.Reporters rely on the campaigns to provide logistics for pool duty, such as when the nominee is coming or going on days when there aren’t planned public events. Representatives of the White House Correspondents Association met with Donald Trump campaign officials in May, and with members of Hillary Clinton’s team earlier this month over logistics. Jeff Mason, a Reuters correspondent who is president of the correspondents association, told HuffPost his organization’s role is “to kickstart the discussion and then hand over to the campaign reporters.”There have been talks among reporters and both campaigns, but no agreements. Neither the Trump campaign nor the Clinton campaign immediately responded to requests for comment.The Trump campaign began using a press charter last week, which now allows news organizations ― at least those who are not banned by the campaign ― to follow the candidate to rallies around the country. (News outlets traditionally decide on members of the pool, which could be a stumbling block if an outlet seeking to join is currently on the Trump campaign’s blacklist.) The addition of a press plane has been helpful for reporters on the Trump beat. But a protective pool is different. A rotating protective pool reporter would fly on the same plane as Trump, just as a White House pool reporter boards Air Force One with the president. The Clinton campaign has had a pool system established for several months in which reporters rotate to cover the candidate during events that can’t accommodate the full press corps. But Clinton has no protective pool, which would include having a reporter on duty even when there aren’t planned events, as well as aboard her plane when she travels. McClatchy reporter Anita Kumar, who chairs the Clinton print pool of 17 news organizations, told HuffPost in an email that the group “expected to establish a protective print pool immediately after she had secured the nomination” on Tuesday.“We continue to work with the Clinton campaign in the hopes that we can establish a protective pool as soon as possible,” Kumar wrote. “We have stressed to the campaign that in past election cycles a protective pool was formed immediately after the candidates had secured their party’s nomination, and in some cases, before the convention.“We believe we should have at least as much access to the two candidates ― one of whom will be the next president of the United States ― as in previous election cycles, not less,” Kumar said.
