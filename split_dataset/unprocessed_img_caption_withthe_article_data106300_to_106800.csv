On a relatively quiet block, the crowd inside Bucketfeet's downtown New York City, pop-up shop, spilled out onto the street, the sounds from inside trailing behind them. Common's thought provoking lyrics punctuated the city night's soundscape as heads bobbed to his staccato flow. Joining him onstage was actor and entrepreneur, Malik Yoba, the evening's host and partner in iconic32,who offered his personal philosophy on making the world a better place, impressing upon the audience the importance of ""doing well and doing good.""iconic32 is the brainchild of Yoba, and cofounders, Sergio Morales, a successful business consultant, filmmaker and branding strategist and Steve Espaillat a longtime sports brand ambassador and youth educator. With the tagline, ""curators of progress,"" iconic32 offers both a product development studio which conceptualizes and develops socially-driven consumer products, technology and content, as well as a brand strategy consultancy that focuses on partnering with individuals, community organizations and companies/brands to develop integrated marketing platforms for consumer audiences and informing companies' current and future product pipelines. Says Morales, ""In terms of product development, our inventors, strategists, producers, writers, directors, musicians, coders and all types of crazy intelligent dream builders not only develop new product and revenue ideas, but we also design and bring the product to life in its final form--whether it's a pair of shoes, a technology platform or a pop song.""True to its mission, iconic32's launch was a convergence of art, culture and commerce, with an inspiring dose of social responsibility. Attendees were immersed in a creative, socially conscious, retail experience that included a performance by Common, walls lined with art, including the work of 14-year-old urban artist Skyler Grey, aka ""The Fresh Prince of Street Art"", (and an official iconic32 Youth Ambassador) and Bucketfeet's artist inspired footwear, presented boutique style around the colorful space. With a portion of all proceeds to be donated to the Common Ground Foundation, whose aim is to, ""use creative arts to expose youth to new opportunities,"" attendees shopped purposefully--understanding that their purchases represented their participation in creating a greater good in the world.   Interview Segment With Iconic32 partners Malik Yoba and Sergio MoralesWhat was the impetus for launching iconic32?Malik: I think it's the way the world is going...people want to contribute and make a difference. Sergio: After leaving the marketing agency world on the branding side, I felt there was a bigger opportunity to further engage consumer audiences and to discover what consumers were passionate about, not as consumers but as people. It's much deeper than categorizing people as Latinos or soccer moms or millennials...people have passions.   As a mentor, I often notice how seemingly socially conscious the millennials are when compared some other generations. What is your thinking?Sergio: Within the current landscape I saw an opportunity that was not happening...to communicate with a younger consumer set. Millennials are the future of consumerism, the future leaders of the world...the information we give them impacts the way they think and the way they behave.They have been handed a different deck than the older generations...they have information at the tip of their fingertips....they are able to talk to someone in Russia or China. This, I think, leads to more questioning and doubting of marketing messages. They are the generation who is going to figure it out. THIS IS WHY THEY ARE GENERATION DIY. Corporations have an incredible opportunity because of their vast resources to create cool campaigns and cool products and to also drive socially conscious good along the way.At iconic32 we understand, we must first reach them through their language, which tends to be the language of pop culture; sports, fashion. arts, entertainment and music. You can talk about deeper subjects like, technology, education, health care, and global warming, but you first have to break through on their ground--which is pop culture--to create a genuine relationship with them. Malik: And to this end, our respect and confidence in the millennial generation is reflected in the strong presence of young people working behind the scenes at iconic32. We are harnessing their passion and creativity in an ""each one, teach one"" manner--it's an intergenerational learning circle where everyone wins. In my background as a funds development consultant, I understand that most corporations have a community giving side, yet I would dare say that most people don't necessarily know about these charitable arms, given that they appear to be separate entities. Do you consider what you're doing at iconic32 to be a new model?Malik: 20 years ago American Express' ""Charge Against Hunger"" campaign was a model. Charges went up by 10% because people wanted to help with this issue. Yet the social good component was not necessarily part of their brand identity.At iconic32 we take it to the next level by helping young social entrepreneur companies build the social good component into their infrastructure.  Sergio: We assist corporations to increase impact of dollars they are already giving and help them to do more and get a higher return on their current investments in creating social good.Who are your partners so far?Malik: Common's foundation (The Common Ground Foundation), San Francisco 49ers player Anquan Boldin's Q81Anquan Boldin Foundation, and of course the ecommerce platform on our website www.iconic32.com.

Baloo, Leo and Shere Khan were found in a drug dealer's basement in Atlanta during a police bust, where they had been abused and kept in vile conditions. They were just cubs then and destined for a grim future when a police raid on the house saved them from an abject state of living. This was in 2001. Ever since they were taken to Noah's Ark, they have spent their days and nights together, playing together, sleeping as a pod, and even grooming each other. They rarely fight, and when they do, it's like children, never very violent, ever more than a brothers' quarrel. They are now living happy lives and will do so here until their natural death.There are plenty of other animals at the Ark, about 1,500 total, all have been rescued from various abusive situations. But the three known as BLT are really worth a visit. The unlikely friends would never ever be seen together in the wild, one or the other would be eaten or maybe even two would be devoured. Who knows which one would be the winner? All three are large and fierce, and absolutely not species-friendly.

Tunisians expressed tentative hope for the future as they lined up early Sunday to choose their first five-year parliament since they overthrew their dictator in the 2011 revolution that kicked off the Arab Spring. (AP Photo/Aimen Zine)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c9a8c922a000051034f732d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On October 23, 2011, the Tunisian people elected a Constituent Assembly in their first ever “free” elections, which were organized following the popular protests that led to the fall of the dictatorial regime of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.Three years and a new constitution later, voters were once again called to the polls on Sunday to elect members of the new parliament. With the military coup in Egypt, the chaos in Libya, the civil war in Syria, the suppressed revolts in Bahrain and even the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, Tunisia has become the “model” or the “last glimmer of hope” of the string of protests often called the “Arab Spring.”While foreign observers and journalists alike have come together to follow the crucial election, the  Huffington Post Maghreb  has created a list ten things you need to know to understand what was at stake in these elections. 1) Who are the main political forces?The Islamists and Their Potential AlliesThe Islamist party that won the 2011 elections, Ennahda, was among the favorites to win this vote. After three turbulent years and three governments, Ennahda played the card of moderation and political ""consensus"" with all the key political players, including those that collaborated with the former regime.Ettakatol and Congress for the Republic (CPR), both known as secular parties, allied themselves with Ennahda after the 2011 elections to form the governments of the “Troïka.” This alliance sparked much criticism within the parties. The parties of President Moncef Marzouki (CPR) and the President of the Constituent Assembly, Mustapha Ben Jaâfar (Ettakatol), were at risk of being sanctioned for this alliance, which some have called ""unnatural."" The Opposition to the IslamistsNida Tunis was the new party to the Tunisian political landscape and the party claimed on Monday  it had won the vote.  Created in 2012 by Béii Caïd Essebsi, the former prime minister of the transitional period, the party quickly positioned itself as the leader of the opposition to the Islamists. The party was seen as Ennahda's main competitor. Nida Tunis is notably composed of several members of the former regime of Ben Ali, including Caïd Essebsi himself, but also includes members of the left, trade unionists and former members of the opposition. The Popular Front was a coalition of the left and the extreme left. Two of its leaders, Chokri Belaïd and Mohamed Brahmi, were assassinated in 2013. They could count on a lot of sympathy ahead of the vote and were presenting themselves as a possible alternative to Ennahda and Nida Tunis, despite of their obvious fondness for the latter.There were other parties and centrist coalitions opposed to Ennahda participating in the elections, but their presence was expected to benefit Nida Tunis. Only Afek Tounes, a liberal party created after the revolution, seemed to be able to make a difference and was hoping to perform better than it did in 2011.Parties Deriving From the Former Regime and BillionairesSeveral parties were created by former ministers of Ben Ali who belonged to the RCD, fallen president's political party. They were marking their return back on the political scene, but were divided and difficult to mobilize.Other political formations were also believed to be able to weigh in on the results of the elections, such as the Free Patriotic Union (UPL), created by billionaire Slim Riahi, or even the Branch of Love, the party of businessman and London resident, Hechmi Hamdi. Twenty-six candidates elected in 2011 were from this party, surprising the large majority of observers and pollsters. 2) How will the next government be formed?With this configuration and an election method that favors a diverse representation in parliament, it was almost impossible for one party to obtain an absolute majority of seats. Therefore, alliances are necessary to form the next government. It is not out of the question that the two main adversaries, Ennahda and Nida Tunis, could ally themselves after the elections, or join with others to form a “National Union Government.”3) Will there be any women in the Assembly?Just like in 2011, half of the candidates on the list were women. However, a great majority of the heads of the lists awere men, even among the parties that opposed the Islamists. The Constituent Assembly was composed of 30 percent women. An equal female representation could be obtained in 2014.4) Will terrorism threaten the elections?Confrontations between security forces and armed groups have spiked since the elections. With the assassination of two members of the opposition just six months apart, the year 2013 saw a resurgence of violence attributed by the Tunisian authorities to the jihadist movement. Since then, the government has regularly announced the arrests of alleged terrorists. Moreover, according to the authorities, more than 2,400 Tunisians have left the country to practice jihad in Syria and Iraq.At the Algerian border, the region of Kasserine is often the setting for bloody attacks, such as ambushes and mine explosions. These attacks usually target at law enforcement agents and military personnel.According to a recent report published by the Crisis Group, these ""jihadist"" attacks are closely linked to border smuggling and the black market.In the East, authorities fear that the Libyan crisis will spill over into Tunisia via the circulation of arms and violent extremist groups. For security reasons, the government decided to forbid Libyan access into Tunisian territory during the elections.5) What were the main topics of the electoral campaign?The reestablishment of security was one of the main themes of the electoral campaign, particularly for the Islamist opposition. Attacks from armed groups and a difficult regional situation have added to the economic crisis. A consistently high unemployment rate, heavy inflation and a weak tourism industry have made concerns about the economy one of the major issues for candidates in these elections.6) An apathetic campaignAfter several years of an enduring economic crisis, an increased disinterest in electoral deadlines, as well as the distrust that is felt towards the political class, many feared a high rate of abstention.Except for a few isolated incidences, the campaign has been quite calm with a difficult start and a weak mobilization.The fears linked to security have also limited the number of open-air gatherings and has even restricted the electoral campaign in closed spaces, the media and social networking sites.  7) What has changed since 2011? The tensions between ideologies have subsided in comparison to the electoral period of the previous elections. The jihadist threat has forced the Ennahda Islamists to moderate their proposals, all while reducing the flexibility of the opposition. This resulted in the adoption of a consensual constitution that was approved by the large majority of the political class.Security challenges also favored the resurgence of an authoritarian discourse and the return of figures from the former regime.8) How have the Islamists evolved three years after the elections?The aggressive discourse against their secular opponents, a certain laxity towards the Salafi movement, as well as a general management of an occasionally chaotic power have all contributed to the weakening of the Islamist movement. The attack of the American embassy on September 14, 2012, in which the American Ambassador to Libya was killed, created a decisive turning point and later contributed to the adoption of a more moderate and consensual discourse.The two political assassinations that occurred in 2013 subsequently forced Ennahda to relinquish power in favor of a non-partisan government. These concessions, encouraged by the fate of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt after the overthrow of El Sissi, allowed Ennahda to reposition itself on the political spectrum.Today, Ennahda advocates for a broad consensus and guarantees that it does not want to govern alone in the next five to 10 years.9) Is the former regime part of the past?At 88 years old, Béji Caïd Essebsi, leader of Nida Tunis, was the favorite to win the presidential election. He held several cabinet positions under Bourguiba (a noted figure in the fight for independence and first president of the Tunisian Republic), and president of the Chamber of Deputies under Ben Ali for one year. He also held the post of temporary prime minister before the elections of the Constituent Assembly.Five other former ministers of ex-President Ben Ali also ran for the position of president, of which one party has presented lists for the parliamentary elections. 10) What else is left to do to ensure the success of the democratic process?Despite the organization of the elections, which have been judged as “free and transparent,” there are still several hurdles to get over to guarantee the success of Tunisia’s transition into democracy.Nearly four years after the revolution, Tunisia has equipped itself with a new constitution, independent constitutional entreaties and a law on transitional justice. However, multiple reforms still remain to be undertaken, notably in order for the Tunisian legislation to conform to international norms and to its own constitution.Moreover, the authority in charge of transitional justice has not yet started its work, and the people responsible for the acts of violence in the former regime have not yet been prosecuted. Reforms from the Ministry of the Interior and Ministry of Justice will also be necessary to ensure the establishment of a state of law. Besides corruption levels at an all-time high, acts of torture are regularly observed by national and international non-governmental agencies, and the guilty parties are rarely ever prosecuted.

He had been convicted in Arizona for selling drugs and he had been deported to Mexico twice.His background would have almost certainly flagged him to be expelled from the country again. But he appeared to be living quietly with his wife in a suburb of Salt Lake City until being arrested Friday, accused of going on a shooting rampage in Northern California that left two sheriff's deputies dead and a motorist seriously wounded.Investigators were trying to determine how he avoided scrutiny.The suspect said he was 34-year-old Marcelo Marquez of Salt Lake City when he was taken into custody, but his fingerprints matched biometric records of Monroy-Bracamonte in a federal database, said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Virginia Kice. He was first removed from the country in 1997 after a conviction for possession of drugs for sale in Arizona, then arrested and repatriated to Mexico again in 2001.Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones told The Sacramento Bee on Sunday that he may have lived under multiple identities and that he may have had troubles with the law under another name.""We're not convinced we have a full picture of his identity,"" Jones told the newspaper. ""Immigration has come up with one identity. We are not entirely convinced that is his only identity.""Mauro Marquez, his father-in-law, told the Los Angeles Times that he always knew him as Luis Monroy and said his son-in-law worked as a house painter. He said the couple moved to Utah a couple years after marrying about 14 years ago in Arizona.Marquez told the newspaper that and he and his wife spent a couple days around Christmas with them each year at their home in West Valley, a suburb of Salt Lake City.Janelle Marquez Monroy, 38, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and carjacking on Friday. Police said she was with her husband during most of the crime spree, which began when Sacramento County sheriff's Deputy Danny Oliver, 47, was shot in the forehead as he checked out a suspicious car in a motel parking lot.The couple allegedly led authorities on a six-hour chase that included two carjackings before their capture. One motorist who resisted surrendering his car keys was shot in the face. Two deputies who approached the couple on a road were shot with an AR-15-type assault weapon, police said. Homicide Detective Michael David Davis Jr., 42, died at a hospital.No attorneys were listed for either suspect in jail records.A search of Utah court records for Marcelo Marquez shows a history of about 10 tickets and misdemeanor traffic offenses between 2003 and 2009, which typically don't trigger a fingerprint check against immigration records. The records list one speeding ticket in 2009 and three small claims filings attempting to collect outstanding debts.Monroy-Bracamonte appears to have avoided work for government contractors or other employers that might have exposed him to extra scrutiny.Krista Sorenson of Salt Lake City said he and his brother mowed her lawn and fixed her sprinklers about four years ago, describing them as ""just super nice, decent hard-working, trying to figure out how to make a living."" They distributed handbills that said Brothers Landscaping.Hector Monroy told KXTV in Sacramento that his brother assumed another name because ""he got into some kind of trouble."" He said he gave his brother $400 early last week and, under threat, returned a bag of his brothers' weapons that he had hid.Monroy said his brother called throughout the week to demand more money and on Friday afternoon to say he was ""in the woods"" after killing a police officer and that he needed to be picked up. Monroy said his brother hung up when he refused and that he called his brother again, but he didn't pick up the phone.More than 2 million deportations have occurred under the watch of President Barack Obama, whose administration has laid out three priorities for people to be deported: Anyone who poses a public safety threat; anyone with a serious immigration history; and recent border crossers. Monroy-Bracamonte would appear to be a prime candidate on the first two counts.Peter Nunez, a former U.S. attorney in San Diego and chairman of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for tighter immigration policies, said the incident exposes shortcomings in border security and interior enforcement. He questioned how the suspect was apparently able to assume another identify.""It's symptomatic of the entire system,"" he said.But Dan Kowalski, an Austin, Texas, immigration attorney and editor of Bender's Immigration Bulletin, said such violent outbursts are difficult to predict.""Short of locking down the border and deporting everyone and not letting anyone in in the future, even as a tourist to go to Disneyland, that's the only solution, and that's not really a solution,"" he said.___Associated Press writer Scott Smith in Fresno, California, and Lindsay Whitehurst in Salt Lake City contributed to this report.
