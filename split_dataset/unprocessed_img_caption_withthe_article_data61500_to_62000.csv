They left one behind.Two men blew themselves up in the airport's departure hall and the third ran off, leaving the heaviest explosive device which security services later detonated.After the taxi driver called police to relate the tale, they found a large nail bomb in the apartment in the borough of Schaerbeek and defused it. Police had no comment on the report.""What would have happened if all the explosive devices found in the Schaerbeek search had been taken to Zaventem?"" DH asked."

""This Is What the Truth Feels Like,"" which was released on Friday, is Stefani's first solo album in a decade. In an interview with The New York Times, the 46-year-old discussed how the album was her way of dealing with the pain of splitting up with her partner of 13 years, musician Gavin Rossdale.She said she endured ""six months of hell"" trying to come to terms with the breakup, during which she stayed in her house and ""prayed and prayed and prayed and prayed.""Stefani, who was raised Catholic, said that going back to the studio to write was a spiritual experience. She said that she sees making music out of her sorrow as ""God's plan"" for her life.""I know that it's weird to talk about spirituality publicly, because it's such a personal thing, and I know that some people, it offends them,"" Stefani told The New York Times. ""But I can say my own journey, and what I believe and what I feel and what I’ve seen, the miracles I’ve seen -- it's quite real for me. It was right there in the room. It was magic, and everybody felt the magic of this music being made. It was so pure.""For more of the interview, head over to The New York Times."

The model is featured on Bey's merchandise website rocking different looks while in a wheelchair. Not to mention she's also front and center when you enter the site. Though modeling for Beyoncé is quite a milestone, Mercado is no stranger to the fashion industry -- in fact, she's pretty darn accomplished. She signed with IMG Models last year and has starred in a 2014 Diesel campaign as well as advertisements for Nordstrom among other modeling jobs. She's also a fashion blogger and an outspoken activist for more diversity and representation in the industry. Ultimately, she hopes to change perceptions and work toward more inclusivity in fashion.“Working with IMG, my goal is to make it so that I am not the model in the wheelchair and I’m just the model,” Mercado told Vogue last year. ""I want the people who were hesitant in pursuing fashion because of the way that people might perceive them to know there is a place for them.”"

His mother, Bronwyn Leeks, told Buzzfeed that Cooper has always wanted to model and had a positive experience at the shoot.“He still couldn’t really believe he was in the catalog!” she told Buzzfeed. “He was so excited to see himself represent Kmart and represent kids who have a disability. He is very proud of who he is including the fact he has cerebral palsy.”Though she and her son are brimming with pride, they also just want Cooper to be seen as any other kid.“Right now it’s a big deal that mainstream media is finally including children with varying abilities,” Leeks told The Mighty. “One day it won’t be a big deal, it will be the norm. For now I want them to see a child looking forward to Easter who happens to use a walker because he happens to have a disability."

10,SPORTS,Linsanity Returned For A Night And I Couldn't Be Happier,Justin Block,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeremy-lin-linsanity-nelly-spurs_us_56f1576de4b09bf44a9e7427,"Nelly couldn’t be, either.",2016-03-22,"The new, defining image of Linsanity never looked so ""Hot in Herre.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56f15d261e00008700704f54.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"So far this NBA season, Charlotte Hornets point guard Jeremy Lin has received far more attention for his nightly outrageous hairstyles than his overall play. Four years removed from Linsanity, it's the silly stuff that now gets Lin headlines these days, even as he has quietly settled in as an effective backcourt partner off the bench to Kemba Walker. But on Monday night, Lin was back in the headlines for reasons that have nothing to do with his hair, and Walker, the Hornets' franchise player and recently named Eastern Conference Player of the Week, took a back seat. Lin put together 29 points, 7 rebounds and 2 assists, leading the way during the Hornets' shocking 91-88 comeback win over the San Antonio Spurs.The Hornets fell behind in the game by a seemingly unsurmountable margin right out of the gate. The Spurs, who boast the NBA's best defense and highest point differential -- yes, even higher than the Warriors -- held the Hornets to seven points during the first quarter, which was the lowest-scoring first quarter for a team this NBA season. Up by 23, the Spurs' victory seemed assured: The team had never blown a 23-point lead in the Tim Duncan Era, and were 22-0 all-time when leading by at least 20 points after the first quarter, according to ESPN Stats & Info. Historical probability, however, is no match for those rare moments when Linsanity returns. Lin, barreling to the hoop with his signature sneaky strength and quickness, also flashed a mid-range touch and clutch 3-point stroke -- two areas of his game he's never been lauded for. Seeking to shut down the pesky, surprise threat, the Spurs eventually switched reigning Defensive Player of the Year Kawhi Leonard onto Lin. Still, he proved to be too quick in mind and body for Leonard and center LaMarcus Aldridge on this clutch Kobe Bryant-like step-back jumper:The Spurs never regained the lead after that shot. Of his 29 total points off the bench, Lin's 15 fourth-quarter points were one fewer than the entire Spurs team scored in the fourth, and were the second most fourth-quarter points in his career. He accomplished his best fourth-quarter points -- 16 -- when, you guessed it, he was a New York Knicks rockstar in 2012.For a night, Linsanity was back, baby. Charlotte Hornets minority owner Nelly, who hasn't had much to be excited about since Kelly Rowland gave him her number in the ""Dilemma"" video, sucked up some Linsanity with an all-time great NBA post-game photobomb.But as an Asian-American sportswriter who shamelessly admits to owning a Jeremy Lin Fathead, the latest reprise of Linsanity was a personal highlight of the NBA season. After all, since leaving the Knicks, Lin's found unwanted homes in Houston and Los Angeles, and has posed with fans for pictures only to overhear them laughing about how much he sucks. Life as a Lin fan hasn't been much fun, and is occasionally intertwined with racism. Last summer, I decided to wear my Knicks No. 17 Lin jersey in public for the first time since Lin left New York in the summer of 2012. That day, my family took a trip down to the Jersey Shore. A group of immature white teenagers in an open-air Jeep made me regret that choice. Standing on a corner across from the boardwalk, they drove by shouting racial epithets at me -- the usual mock Chinese language nonsense. My Lin jersey had made me a target for bigotry. As someone who was fortunate enough to go to college in New York during Linsanity and even attend his breakout game, Lin's play during those short two months remains the happiest time of my life as a sports fan. Usually, normally hapless Knicks fans' joy comes in bursts -- a big win here, a clutch moment there -- but this was two months of uninterrupted, prideful bliss. Every one of his games served as a referendum on how I, as an Asian man, related to basketball. And every time, we came out stronger. So even if it was for a night, it was refreshing to see the entire league congeal around Lin. I hope those kids in that Jeep saw Lin's highlights, saw how his outstanding play obscures race, and realized how wrong they were. Because in the face of bigotry in sports, getting buckets and winning trumps all, for better and worse."

The ""Bachelor"" stars stopped by AOL and The Huffington Post's New York office last week for an AOL BUILD interview with HuffPost's Leigh Blickley. Afterward, Ben and Lauren sat down for a chat with Claire Fallon and Emma Gray, the hosts of HuffPost's ""Bachelor"" podcast, ""Here To Make Friends,"" to discuss Lauren's upcoming move to Denver, the real source of Leah's mysterious black eye and which franchise buzzwords they are ready to ditch for good. (Because two-and-a-half months of talking about your ""amazing journey"" and why everywhere is ""the best place to fall in love"" can get pretty exhausting.)Ben told us he is done calling things ""incredible"" after watching the show back.""I’ve tried so hard not to say 'incredible' because I said it so much in the show,"" he said. ""[Also], 'Guys.' I would walk into the rose ceremony and be like, 'All right, guys.'""For Lauren, the buzzword she's ready to stay away from post-finale is ""surreal"" -- and for a truly sweet reason. ""I kept using that word to describe the experience, and it really is surreal, but I don’t want things to be surreal,"" she said. ""I want to just start normal life and be like, OK, this is REAL life.""Apparently the couple is still torn on ""journey,"" because what else are they supposed to call the truly bizarre experience they had, an experience which led to love and has been watched by millions of people on national TV?As Ben explained:There’s not a great word for it. There’s the ""journey,"" there’s an ""experience,"" because the show isn’t really what we’re doing, right? The show is a byproduct of what we’ve actually done. So you’re doing this whole thing and what do you call it? Is it an experience? I don’t know the right word and everyone says ""journey"" and I’m like, ""I’m not doing that."" So, I don’t know what to call the segment of life when you’re actually living this.Enjoy the full interview with Ben and Lauren -- in which Ben agrees to validate ""Here To Make Friends"" -- by listening to the podcast:Do people love “The Bachelor,” “The Bachelorette” and “Bachelor in Paradise,” or do they love to hate these shows? It’s unclear. But here at “Here To Make Friends,” we both love and love to hate them — and we love to snarkily dissect each episode in vivid detail. Podcast edited by Nick Offenberg."

Circuit, where he is chief judge and has served for nearly 20 years. Instead, his chair on the three-judge panel was empty.As a courtesy, another highly respected judge who has been in the news in recent weeks stepped up to explain what was going on.""Thanks, and before we proceed, I'll just announce for the parties that Judge Tatel will consider these cases based on ... the recording of oral argument,"" said Judge Sri Srinivasan, who took over the hearing for Garland and had to explain that Garland's replacement, Judge David Tatel, also didn't show up.The case was no small thing, either: The judges were supposed to consider an appeal over a long-running fight between the American Civil Liberties Union and the Obama administration over its decision not to release thousands of previously undisclosed pages of the so-called Senate torture report.Garland's surprise nomination to the Supreme Court, announced the day before, had him making the rounds on Capitol Hill. That Garland and Srinivasan were to share the bench on such a monumental week for the future of confirmation politics is one of the vicissitudes of Washington. In the end, only one got the nod for the job.It's almost certain Garland's time in the spotlight will be an exercise in futility. Time and again, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) have said that they won't even consider holding hearings for the president's pick.McConnell must be terrified of the prospect of Garland knocking on his Senate office door and cameras catching the spectacle. The process is something of a ritual; it's perhaps the only time in our constitutional order where the separation of powers isn’t so separate, and the federal branches are supposed to meet and pose for photos.The day of the nomination, McConnell spared Garland the trouble of a visit and gave him a pre-emptive call instead. On Sunday, McConnell hunkered down again and reiterated that he's not going to move forward with ""confirming a judge to the Supreme Court under this president,"" not even in a post-election lame-duck session.While Garland made his visits, the D.C. Circuit still had work to do. And without him around, the court was forced -- by an order of its own -- to remove him from the panel and put in the replacement that would hear Thursday's cases. If only empty seats on the Supreme Court were so easy to fill.Srinivasan, now the second-most senior judge on the panel, handled the hearing with poise. He was really invested in the legality of releasing the Senate torture report. Not the executive summary the public learned about in December 2014, but the full 6,963-page report the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence transmitted to the White House, the CIA and other federal agencies with a stake in its contents -- a damning account of the failures of the Bush administration in its capture, interrogation and abuse of detainees in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks.""The issue in this case is whether the agencies have met their burden of showing that the Senate Intelligence Committee's final report of its investigation into the CIA's torture program is not an agency record subject to the Freedom of Information Act,"" Hina Shamsi, a lawyer and director of the ACLU's National Security Project, told the court. Since this law doesn't apply to the Senate, her organization really wants the D.C. Circuit to treat the report -- based on its transmission to the federal government -- as an agency record. Tough argument. The case, which has a lengthy history, is important but very technical, maybe even a little bit boring. It's precisely the bread and butter of the D.C. Circuit, which hears more cases involving government transparency than probably all other federal appellate courts combined.Srinivasan was into it. And for a moment, he seemed to be eating from the ACLU lawyer's hand. He listened and nodded intently. He consulted the legal briefs before him. He poured himself some water from a pitcher on the bench. Maybe he sensed that there was at least one reporter in the room who was more interested in his performance during the hearing than the specifics of the case.His first question didn't disappoint.""So can I ask you a conceptual question that's related to the account that you're giving us?"" said Srinivasan, before delving into a methodical probing of dates and facts and statutory language that sounded less like a question and more like a half-minute-long soliloquy -- way too long for any human who covers courts to take down word for word.This was Srinivasan in his element. If he was sad that he didn't get the nod to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court, he certainly didn't show it. Like Garland, he was one of five judges on President Barack Obama's short list to fill the empty seat. And by and large, he was a favorite to get the gig -- of longtime court observers, advocacy groups and even the betting markets. A poll by SCOTUSblog, the go-to source for all things Supreme Court, had him handily beating the other four presumptive nominees: Srinivasan was first with 53 percent of the vote; Garland dead last with 7 percent. The selection of Garland stunned nearly everyone who thought the president would go for broke. Of Obama's five candidates, all but Garland were relatively young and either women or minorities. All had impressive credentials and personal stories to their names. Had the president gone with anyone other than Garland, the Supreme Court, for the first time in history, could've been made up of a majority who weren't white men. So for the third and last time of his presidency -- after becoming the first president to appoint two women to the high court, including Sonia Sotomayor, the first Latina justice -- Obama chose not to make history.Srinivasan, in particular, was a compelling choice not just for his impeccable résumé, but also his background as an Indian-born immigrant with a Hindu upbringing, his formative years in Kansas, and his slow but steady rise through the echelons of the legal establishment.After obtaining a bachelor's, a master's and a law degree from Stanford University, Srinivasan clerked for two Ronald Reagan-appointed judges -- an appellate judge in the 4th Circuit and Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor while she was still on the high court.Ahead of his confirmation to the D.C. Circuit in 2013, Srinivasan received effusive support from a bipartisan who's who of former solicitors general spanning several administrations -- advocates who represented the federal government before the Supreme Court and other appellate courts.""Sri has a first-rate intellect, an open-minded approach to the law, a strong work ethic, and an unimpeachable character,"" read a letter to the Senate signed by 12 luminaries including Ted Olson and Paul Clement, two Republican stars who were top lawyers in the George W. Bush administration.""Sri is one of the best appellate lawyers in the country,"" the lawyers added. By the time the Senate confirmed him 97-0 to the D.C. Circuit, Srinivasan became a virtual shoo-in for the next Democratic appointment to the Supreme Court. The D.C. Circuit, for better or for worse, is widely viewed as a sort of pipeline to the high court. In the same courtroom where Srinivasan heard the ACLU case, a portrait of a young Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg hung from the wall. Scalia, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Clarence Thomas have also served there.The D.C. Circuit matters not because it hears the issues people care about. You're not likely to catch major constitutional showdowns on abortion, affirmative action or same-sex marriage there. Instead, the court matters because its cases -- largely focused on the functioning of the federal government and its agencies -- will eventually find their way to the Supreme Court. When that happens, the cases will tell us, more or less, if the executive acted within its constitutional authority or otherwise obeyed Congress. As such, the D.C. Circuit is the ultimate referee for inter-branch power fights.The hearing over the Senate torture report was illustrative.""Of course these documents we've described ... are congressional records subject to our control,"" said Srinivasan, describing how the Senate characterized the report prior to sending it to the CIA and other federal agencies. He seemed sympathetic to the government's argument against release of the report.That's the kind of case the D.C. Circuit -- that Garland or Srinivasan -- lives and breathes. All things being equal, the only thing that separates the two is their age and ethnicity. Length of service on the court didn't seem to matter. SCOTUSblog's publisher, Tom Goldstein, essentially came to the same conclusion when assessing their records: Neither judge has a hard-and-fast judicial philosophy -- which is to say, neither is a raging liberal that could embolden Senate Republicans.So why would Obama go with Garland, the least exciting choice on his list? In an interview with NPR's Nina Totenberg, he didn't fully answer the question, opting instead for defending his overall record of judicial appointments -- which he said ""reflects the country"" and is ""unmatched"" for its diversity.""In this case, Merrick Garland is the best person for the job,"" he said, while pointing to the two women he's appointed to the Supreme Court, Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.But earlier in the same interview, Obama seemed to suggest he chose Garland for more than just his credentials -- that Garland is uniquely prepared to face what is shaping up to be a watershed moment in the history of Supreme Court confirmation battles. Obama, amid the coming drama, doesn't want the court to become an extension of politics.""He is at a stage in his career where, given his confidence in his record, given the reputation that he's built in the legal community, that he is prepared, I think, to take on whatever unfair or unjust or wildly exaggerated claims that may be made by those who are just opposed to any nominee that I might make,"" Obama said. ""Because he thinks it's important.""Slate's Dahlia Lithwick, herself a Srinivasan fan and an expert on the Supreme Court, suggested that perhaps Obama's choice of Garland was an act of grace toward the Asian-American judge -- that his name might have driven Senate Republicans to demand to see his birth certificate, or Donald Trump to call for his placement on a terror watch list. So to avoid all of that, the president went with the safer choice.""That bar fight, sadly, is what awaits Merrick Garland,"" she wrote. ""He and Obama may be the last men in America who still believe that the courts can be better and do better than the politics of nihilism and doom."""

16,BUSINESS,Why Levi's Is Giving Away Its Trade Secrets,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/levis-water_us_56f15f91e4b09bf44a9e79ee,The company is sharing its water-saving strategies with rivals.,2016-03-22,Levi's is celebrating World Water Day by giving away its secrets for saving water when producing its jeans.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56f17c021e00009500710fd2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Levi Strauss & Co. is giving away its special sauce.The blue-jeans behemoth said Tuesday that it plans to reveal its strategies for reducing water use by 96 percent when making denim, so the tactics can be adopted by competitors across the industry. The announcement came on World Water Day, the holiday designated 23 years ago by the United Nations for celebrating the availability of fresh water. “Water is a critical resource for our business, the planet and people around the globe, but usable supply is becoming increasingly scarce,” Michael Kobori, vice president of sustainability at Levi's, said in a statement. “We’ve long been committed to being water stewards, but realize more needs to be done. We’re setting competition aside and encouraging others to utilize these open source tools.”Levi's introduced its suite of 21 water-saving methods in 2011, including strategies like buying only sustainable cotton and using less water when finishing and washing denim. Since then, the company has conserved more than 1 billion liters of water. If its techniques were to become industry standard, Levi's estimates they could save 50 billion liters by 2020. ""Making the jeans we wear is a very thirsty business,"" Brooke Barton, water program director at the nonprofit sustainability group Ceres, told The Huffington Post on Tuesday. ""Levi's commitment to open source this technology means that others in the apparel sector have no excuse but to step up their game.""Levi's, whose CEO Chip Bergh famously eschews washing his jeans, said Tuesday that it plans to double-down on its sustainability efforts by 2020, the year many companies have set for overhauls in their supply chains and environmental policies.By then, the company aims to source 100 percent of its cotton from farms certified by the nonprofit Better Cotton Initiative or from recycled material. Up to 80 percent of all Levi's products will be made with water-saving techniques, trademarked under its WaterThe Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals FoundationThe idea of allowing competitors behind the curtain in hopes of fostering higher industry standards isn't new.As far back as the 1960s, Swedish automaker Volvo invented the three-point seat belt and promptly gave away the design to other manufacturers to make all cars safer -- not just its own. More recently, in 2010, Nike released a tool featuring many of its environmental design techniques, for free use by other clothing manufacturers. Three years later, the company folded the tool into a free app called Making that draws data from the Nike Materials Sustainability Index.In June 2014, Tesla pledged not to sue anyone who used the electric carmaker's patented technology ""in good faith,"" in hopes of cultivating a bigger industry for rechargeable vehicles. The argument was that copycat companies would expand the market, and the rising tide would raise all ships.Levi's move is less about increasing competition and more about sharing strategies it's already developed. It's a refreshing perspective in a time of water crises. "

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56f1b3dd150000ad000b2e28.jpeg?cache=YCVU5Rey5g&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The male powers that be in tennis have been on the offensive this week against the positive perception and monetary status of women in the sport.First, Indian Wells CEO Raymond Moore said that female players should be grateful to Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal for carrying the sport. Then, soon after, world No. 1 Novak Djokovic said that male tennis players should fight for more money, essentially shooting down equal pay among the sexes. Lucky for fans of gender equality, Serena Williams isn't backing down.“It's disappointing,"" Williams said on Tuesday in response to Djokovic's comments. ""If I have a daughter who plays tennis and also have a son that plays tennis, I wouldn’t say that my son deserves more because he is a man. If they both started at 3 years old I would say they both deserve the same amount of money.""On Sunday, Williams slammed Moore for his misogynistic quotes on how female tennis players should ""go down every night on [their] knees"" for the contributions males have made to their male-dominated sport. Moore has since resigned, but his comments made a crack in tennis' long-running debate over equal pay, which Djokovic burst through in his response to Moore on Monday.While Djokovic said female tennis players deserve ""respect and admiration"" in their fight for equal pay, which has been successfully instituted in all four tennis majors since 2007, he questioned the whole concept, too.""On the other hand, I think that our men's tennis world, ATP world, should fight for more because the stats are showing that we have much more spectators on the men's tennis matches. I think that's one of the reasons why maybe we should get awarded more,"" he said. Djokovic then followed by speaking in absolutes, saying that prize money ""has to be fairly distributed"" according to ""data and stats available upon who attracts more attention, spectators, who sells more tickets."" Has Djokovic forgotten how Williams has been at the center of their sport's conversation for the better part of the last decade? Lest we forget, the 2015 U.S. Open women's final sold out before the men's because of the possibility of Williams achieving another Serena Slam. Semantics aside, equal pay for equal work is a right which tennis has managed to achieve even as public policy lags behind. Speaking to reporters in Miami ahead of Thursday's Miami Open, Williams' scathing response to Djokovic posed an earnest question to the men's champion: How would you explain yourself to your children?“I have been playing since the age of 2 and it would be shocking to say my son would deserve more than my daughter. It is irrelevant. Novak is entitled to his opinion but if he has a daughter -- I think he has a son right now -- he should talk to her and tell her how his son deserves more money because he is a boy,"" she said. “It all boils down to that. I would never put a sex against another sex. I think it’s unfair to compare, we have had so many great women champions and players who have brought such great vision to the sport. There have been great men players too, but women’s tennis is the biggest sport for women -- period.""Slay, Queen Serena. Slay. "

The court awarded them nearly $3 million in damages.But the company challenged the award before the high court, claiming the workers had improperly relied on a statistical average of the time they spent changing into and out of their protective gear -- and arguing that they never should've been allowed to sue collectively in the first place.In a 6-2 ruling, the Supreme Court rejected Tyson's arguments and said that workers who sue as a class may rely on this kind of ""statistical"" or ""representative evidence"" on a case-by-case basis, especially if an individual worker suing alone lacks the means to prove how he or she was shorted on pay.""If the sample could have sustained a reasonable jury finding as to hours worked in each employee’s individual action, that sample is a permissible means of establishing the employees' hours worked in a class action,"" wrote Justice Anthony Kennedy, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and the court's liberal wing.This is especially true, Kennedy explained, when employers are careless in their record keeping and there's no way for workers to prove definitively how much time they've been underpaid for.An employee ""has carried out his burden if he proves that he has in fact performed work for which he was improperly compensated and if he produces sufficient evidence to show the amount and extent of that work as a matter of just and reasonable inference,"" Kennedy wrote, citing a 70-year-old precedent that allowed for similar calculations for unpaid wages.Deepening their newfound conservative alliance, Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented together. (There's good reason to believe the late Justice Antonin Scalia would have joined his conservative colleagues: He wrote the 2011 decision in Wal-mart Stores v. Dukes, which significantly rolled back class-action rights and which Tyson relied on to make its case.)Thomas agreed with Tyson's argument that the plaintiffs hadn't proved enough commonality between them to sue the company as a class. In particular, he reasoned that the more than 3,000 workers involved in the Tyson case would have all spent different amounts of time putting on and taking off their gear for work. That variability between workers, Thomas wrote, ""created an unacceptable risk"" for Tyson in defending itself.Scott Michelman, an attorney for the workers, said he had feared the case could ""sound the death knell for class actions,"" giving the court an opportunity to further restrict plaintiffs' ability to join together in big lawsuits. The Walmart case, for example, made it harder to bring class-action suits under federal anti-discrimination law.""This is an outstanding result for ordinary Americans' ability to hold corporate actors accountable,"" Michelman said. ""It's an important reaffirmation of the right of workers, consumers and others to band together in a class-action and enforce rights they might not otherwise be able to enforce.""The plaintiffs in the Tyson case are a good example of the kind of vulnerable workers who can benefit from class-action lawsuits. Low-level meatpacking jobs are dangerous and typically low-paying, and they tend to be filled by immigrant workers without better options. As individuals, they may not have the resources to pursue expensive wage theft litigation, but lawyers are far more likely to represent them if they can sue as a class.Cristian Farias reported from New York; Dave Jamieson reported from Washington."

He is scheduled to depart for Buenos Aires, Argentina, later in the afternoon, becoming the first U.S. president to visit Argentina in more than two decades. In an interview with Fox News, before Obama made his first remarks on the situation Tuesday, Republican presidential candidate and Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) said the president ought to return to Washington to organize the government's response to the attacks.“What I hope he’d say is he’s leaving Cuba, he’s heading back to the White House, he's going to begin to organize meetings with leaders around the world, and at the same time getting us in the position where we can send teams of people to Europe and begin to dig in in terms of what we need to do to address the vulnerabilities we have,"" he said.Rep.

21,POLITICS,Donald Trump Has Spent Less Than Any Other Primary Front-Runner,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-campaign-spending_us_56f172e6e4b03a640a6bcda2,Thanks to social media and nonstop cable news coverage.,2016-03-22,Donald Trump is the cheapest presidential primary front-runner in recent history.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56f173a51500002a000b2d76.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Never before has a presidential candidate spent so little to win so much. According to Federal Election Commission records, billionaire eccentric Donald Trump has spent less than any other presidential primary front-runner in the past 16 years.Through the end of February, Trump spent $33 million while winning 19 contests and racking up 680 delegates, the most of any candidate for the Republican presidential nomination. After adjusting for inflation, Trump’s total spending is lower than every other major party front-runner since leading candidates refused public financing during the primary elections in 2000.The next lowest spender was the Democratic Party’s 2000 presidential nominee, Al Gore, when he spent $46 million at the same point in the election. Then the sitting vice president, Gore’s primary campaign was far less competitive than the current race for the Republican nomination. He won each of the first 20 primaries and caucuses and his opponent, Sen. Bill Bradley (N.J.), dropped out of the race on March 10 of that year.President Barack Obama holds the record for the most spent in a contested primary through February with $174 million in 2008. George W. Bush’s 2000 run was second with $88 million spent through February.Presidential Primary Front-Runner Spending Through February Election YearTrump has been able to get away with spending so little money thanks to the obsessive coverage his bid has received from cable and network news and his broad following on social media. According to The New York Times, Trump has received $1.9 billion worth of earned media, which includes coverage of the candidate on television and social media, and in newspapers and magazines. That is more than twice the amount of earned media Democratic Party front-runner Hillary Clinton has received and more than six times the amount received by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), the second-biggest earner of free media among Republicans.In October, Trump told Fox News that he wasn't spending money on ads because of all the free airtime they gave him.""I had earmarked till this point in a budget about $20 million,"" Trump told Fox host Neil Cavuto. ""I've spent zero on advertising because you and Fox and all of the others, I won't mention names, but every other network, I mean they cover me a lot, to put it mildly. And in covering me, it's almost like if I put ads in on top of the program, it would be too much. It would be too much Trump.""His campaign has begun paying for ads in recent months. He spent $11 million on placed media through February, his top campaign expense. That is still remarkably lower than his top competitors for the nomination, especially considering their support from allied super PACs.Trump’s successful frugality, however, may not transfer to the general election, where he will need to mobilize far more than just 35 percent of Republican primary voters. So far, he has mostly self-funded his campaign with $25 million in personal loans. It is unlikely that he can personally contribute or loan his campaign hundreds of millions of dollars to match likely Democratic nominee Clinton (or even Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont).Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."
22,POLITICS,It’s Time For Presidential Candidates To Talk About The New Housing Crisis,Kate Abbey-Lambertz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/presidential-candidates-affordable-housing-crisis_us_56eff13ee4b09bf44a9dc943,"It's a key economic issue, but good luck hearing about it at a debate.",2016-03-22,"The affordable housing crisis is affecting millions of Americans, but candidates have rarely addressed the issue during the election season. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586c014f1500002e00e9e34e.jpeg?cache=DIP8ps8HOK&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the fall, seven presidential candidates showed up at a New Hampshire housing summit to hear about the affordable housing crisis affecting millions of Americans, and organizers deemed the event a success. But all seven have dropped out of the race, and there has been little acknowledgement of housing issues since.Homeownership declined to a record low following the foreclosure crisis, and there are 9 million more renters now than there were a decade ago. Rent prices continue to go up, pushing homeownership further out of reach for some. Nearly half of renters are “cost-burdened,” meaning they spend more than 30 percent of their income on rent. Cost burdens are increasingly affecting middle-class families.The struggle to find a decent place to live is integral to the economic issues candidates highlight, but it has hardly been mentioned this election cycle.The October event in New Hampshire was sponsored by the J. Ronald Terwilliger Foundation for Housing America’s Families, a bipartisan nonprofit founded last year to end that silence. Board members include former Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.) and Henry Cisneros, who was secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development under President Bill Clinton. The foundation has met with candidates and their teams to push them to tackle the housing crisis, said foundation president Pamela Patenaude. “Our number one goal is to elevate housing into the national policy dialogue and to educate the candidates about the need to address housing as a domestic policy issue that's often forgotten during presidential campaigns,” Patenaude said. Matthew Desmond, a Harvard University sociologist whose research on eviction shows how housing struggles push low-income families further into poverty, said the “good news” is that candidates on both sides of the aisle are talking about inequality.“Work is central to this problem, but it’s only part of the solution,” Desmond said. “I’d like candidates to recognize that the lack of affordable housing, the extreme rent-burden low-income families are facing, is a wellspring for all sorts of social problems, from residential instability, to kids not being able to finish school, health and depression issues, moving into bad neighborhoods -- housing is central to the story, and I think that we need a very bold and robust housing platform that matches the size and scale of the problem.”“We can’t fix poverty in America without fixing housing,” he added. Some attention was drawn to the issue at a Democratic town hall in Las Vegas last month, when Hillary Clinton fielded a question about Hispanic Americans struggling to own homes after the recession.“I want us to move in any way we can in the federal government to help relieve the burden of already existing homeowners,” she said. “Secondly, we want to provide more help so that more homeowners, Hispanic homeowners, African-American homeowners, those who want to be, have access to better credit, and better support.”Clinton is the only candidate who has issued a specific housing plan, Patenaude said.The candidate's economic agenda aimed at poor and minority communities calls for a $25 billion investment in housing. She lists several programs to expand access to homeownership and address the ""skyrocketing rise of rental costs."" Urban planner Robert Silverman, from the State University of New York at Buffalo, praised Clinton's platform for linking housing with employment and education.You can find clips of Democratic challenger Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) talking about the burden of high rents for poor families or highlighting the ongoing consequences of the foreclosure crisis in a campaign ad. Patenaude noted that even though Sanders hasn't issued policy suggestions, he has a solid background in affordable housing, going back to his time as mayor of Burlington, Vermont, in the 1980s. In Congress, he has pushed for a national housing trust fund and supported housing assistance programs. Republican candidates have said little, if anything at all, about affordable housing. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) hasn't addressed the issue head-on, but his policy proposals would affect housing: His plan to eliminate HUD would pose a risk to critical housing assistance programs.Candidates' inattention could be a missed opportunity, public policy professor and Terwilliger Foundation board member Raphael Bostic wrote in January: The federal government has tremendous influence over housing policy, from tax incentives to HUD programs to oversight of the secondary market. The presidential candidates face a choice. They can view these policies as tools and craft an affordable, sustainable housing strategy that heals some of the deepest rifts in our economy and our society. Or they can bury their head in the sand and ignore the centerpiece of our middle-class wealth and the beating heart of our banking system.There's some evidence that voters would prefer the former. In a telephone poll of 820 New Hampshire residents, conducted for the foundation by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center last fall, 75 percent said presidential candidates should put some focus on housing affordability, and 35 percent said they would be more likely to vote for a candidate with a housing plan.Patenaude said the foundation has tried to submit questions about affordable housing for each debate, and while she's disappointed they've struck out so far, she’s optimistic about the possibility of having their questions addressed during the general election. The organization is still meeting with candidates and drafting specific policy recommendations to present at each party's convention.“If we can get the candidates to talk about it during the campaign season, then that’s a guarantee that they have to address it when they get elected,” she said._____Kate Abbey-Lambertz covers sustainable cities, housing and inequality.

Behind the scenes, however, the number had been shopped around to multiple artists, including one Britney Spears. According to producer Dorian Moore, the track was deemed too ""urban"" for the pop princess, E! Online reports, so Brit's team took a hard pass. Enter Aguilera, whose ""Ain't No Other Man"" 1940s aesthetic paired perfectly with the vision for the song's music video. Few have heard the original Spears version of ""Tilt Ya Head Back,"" lost in the archives of pop stars' unreleased demos ... until now.

Although a government reconstruction agency was appointed in December, the government has been slow in its rebuilding efforts. It still has not provided displaced individuals with aid or given guidelines as to how to rebuild destroyed homes and structures.The prince also traveled to Patan on Sunday and visited the city’s Golden Temple.

The trips are part of a five-day tour to celebrate 200 years of joint relations between the Himalayan nation and Britain. It is a trip the prince has been especially eager to take ever since he served side-by-side with Nepalese soldiers, or Gurkhas, in Afghanistan in 2007-08, BBC reports.In order to pay special tribute to Gurkhas, Harry also trekked to the village of Leurani to have dinner with an 86-year-old Gurkha widow and spent the night as the guest of a Gurkha family, The Telegraph reported.

World Water Development Report 2016 said.""There is a direct effect on jobs worldwide if there are disruptions in water supply through natural causes, such as droughts, or if water doesn't get to communities because of infrastructure problems,"" said Richard Connor, the report's editor-in-chief.Research has shown investment in small-scale projects providing access to safe water and basic sanitation in Africa could offer a return equivalent to almost 5 percent of the continent's economic output, the report said.In the United States, every $1 million invested in the country's water supply and treatment infrastructure generates between 10 and 20 additional jobs, according to the report.""Whether it's a water treatment facility or a system to bring water to fields to irrigate, you're not just funding that project,"" Connor told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.""You're creating a multiplier effect: jobs are being created because water becomes available.""Fleur Anderson, global head of campaigns at charity Water Aid, said the high cost of water in many developing countries also affects jobs and economic choices.In Papua New Guinea, for example, poor people have to spend 54 percent of their day's earnings to buy 50 litres of water, the amount the World Health Organization says a person needs every day for domestic use and to maintain health and hygiene.This compares with as little as 0.1 percent of the income of someone earning the minimum wage in Britain.""It means countries are not getting the economic benefits of their working population because people are spending so much of their money on water,"" Anderson said.WATER UNDER PRESSUREDemand for water is expected to increase by 2050 as the world's population is forecast to grow by one-third to more than 9 billion, according to the United Nations.This in turn will lead to a 70 percent increase in demand for food, putting more pressure on water through farming, which is already the biggest consumer of water.As climate change contributes to rising sea levels and extreme weather, at least one in four people will live in a country with chronic or recurring shortages of fresh water by 2050, the United Nations estimates, making it more important to focus on expanding rainwater harvesting and recycling wastewater.Connor said funding for projects was still often based on ""investment in pumps and pipes"" rather than a more holistic view, taking into account water's key role in building a sustainable economy as part of the new global development goals.More investment in renewable energy such as solar and wind, which use very little water, is also crucial in reducing demand for water, Connor said.
