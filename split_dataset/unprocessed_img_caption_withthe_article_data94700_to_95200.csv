Global Ebola awareness often turns to fear. Whenever a fatal disease minus a cure arrives on the scene and covered by media, fear becomes a natural side effect. Often where there is fear, there is also the shadow of hope. Ebola is still killing many in the country of West Africa, especially in Sierra Leone region. For many, there's a desperate daily struggle to survive. According to the World Health Organization, the death toll from the outbreak (mostly confined to West Africa) rose to 7,905, following 317 fatalities last recorded on December 24, 2014. The number of worldwide known cases, including fatalities, totals 20,206. Vaccine scientists and medical experts are working day and night to find the right immunization, and cure for Ebola, but it still hasn't happened.    via The GuardianThere an array of non-governmental organizations that have joined forces to fight this horrific illness including Develop Africa, Unicef, AmeriCares, American Red Cross, Global Giving, Project C.U.R.E., and Save The Children. It was a great honor to attend the ""Stop Ebola and Build for the Future"" concert, held at the United Nations Headquarters (the United Nations Foundation is a leading proponent in the fight against Ebola). The event was hosted by Bravo's ""Real Housewives of Beverly Hills"" and ""Vanderpump Rules"" Reality TV star. author, restauranteur, and philanthropist, Lisa Vanderpump. Vanderpump, who recently became California's Woman of the Year by the State Assembly, said of the people who survive the Ebola disease, ""Instead of being praised and celebrated for overcoming this terrible disease...

Grace can be received. Grace is knowing: Don't make it worse. When things are difficult, no action is required. Waiting is the beginning of grace. Restraint is the beginning of grace. Grace has the word race in it. And sometimes you can move very quickly when you are filled with grace. The way a car seems to drive better if it has more fuel. You know you have reserves. You can go without thinking about it. Grace. Go with grace.When you say grace before a meal you say you understand that you and the food are one. There is no separation between you and the food. Or you and anything else. There is no separateness. Separation is illusion. Moving with that knowledge is moving with grace.Grace is subtle. When you receive, honor receiving. When you give, honor receiving. Court grace by being open and willing and prepared to receive. Be prepared for grace by believing that grace may come to find you. Be prepared for grace to suddenly dance out of the dark forest of a punishing day and into your life. Like a ballerina dancing out from the inky wings and leaping off stage and into your lap. But remember you have to buy a ticket to that ballet. Or at least accept your friend's plus one.Grace is putting other people first. But not putting yourself second. Putting yourself at 0. Isness. Not positive. Not negative. The fulcrum. That steadiness holds grace.Grace is yes. Grace is looking at a blank page and having no fear.Grace is the courage to desire deeply with no attachment to results. Watch those who have grace. Watch them and pray that their grace seeps in through your open eyes, melting down into your heart, rooting there like a perennial, ready to bloom again and again.Grace doesn't care for the mean. Stay away from mean. Grace shies away from resentment. But grace is forgiving and will come back later. When you are done. If you are done. Be done. For now.Grace is for now. A cheerleader for now. Grace whispers in your ear. I'm leaving soon so love me now, love me well, I may stay a little longer. Feed me, I might stay for that.Grace loves to be shared. Grace is the fountain of youth.Never be proud of grace. Never be ashamed. Sometimes you have a moment of grace and you think oh that's nice. That's not nice, that's grace. When the lights are all green and people are smiling and the call came in and you did a kindness and it felt so wonderful and the shirt fits right and in your heart you understand how the universe works and you don't care that you can't put it into words. This is grace. And it happens more if you know it is grace while it is happening.Grace is profound. And when you have grace, found is what you are. Lost you are when grace seems far. Grace can leave but be nearby. Try to keep a space for grace and there grace will come, more and more often. Until you can close your eyes and feel it happen. For you are ready to receive. Receive and share. This is the instruction I received on grace."

It occurred to me as I watched my daughter stare out of our window at the trees and streets that surround our apartment, that Santo Domingo is the first home my children will know and the place that will construct their little minds the way my hometown did me. So when she says flor, it is the purple flowers growing in our window box that she is thinking about. It will be those flowers, whose name I don't know, that are her first understanding of what flowers are. Mine were daisies. And in that moment of clarity, the international floodgates open and I start to think about all of the other ways my kids will grow up differently than I did.It's an interesting thing as a parent because so much of what I imagined doing as a parent involved the life I knew when I was a child. The life I built in my mind for the children I would one day have was constructed upon the foundation of the life I grew up with, it was an assumption, an assumption that my kids would grow up the same as me. It's sounds silly but I gave no weight to location or how it could change everything when we moved abroad; I didn't think about how differently my kids would grow up based on where in the world we were planted; one being no better than the other but rather an opportunity to see things differently and understand that we don't all live the same, that sometimes the more we have the less we see and sometimes the less we have, the better we understand what matters.The thicker grass of Dominican Republic is so fat and strong that it actually feels like it can hold your weight, quite unlike the skinny blades of New Jersey grass that were soft under my bare feet as a child. When they are asked to draw a picture of a tree, they will draw the ladylike palm trees that curve and dance in the breeze will be what my children know as trees, not the bushy pines and full elms that wallpapered the street outside my window. Those will be as foreign to them as the coconut trees are to me.I never imagined my kids would learn to ride waves because I rode sleds. Being beach bums in New Jersey only existed from Memorial Day Weekend to Labor Day Weekend while building snowmen have a much longer shelf life. There, we waited for snow to cancel next day's classes (pajamas inside out and fingers crossed). Here, we hope for a hurricane. My kids might grow to be the most amazing drivers because driving here is unlike driving anywhere else in the world. All five senses on high alert: eyes open and looking in every direction, ears at attention listening to a warning beep signaling I'm coming so move out of the way. Hands firmly grasping the wheel, palm hovering over the horn - just in case - no slouching or Detroit leaning. Be alert. The busy, traffic jammed streets and the horns beeping like birds chirping in the suburbs will be background music to their little ears. But...the melodic way the avocado guy sings his avocados for sale, every morning, will also be a comforting tune. Like the sound of a lawn mower outside my window in my NJ summers reminding me to not waste the day away, the familiar song sung by the same Dominican voice at the same time each day like a set alarm is a reminder too, a delicious reminder that we are living on an island. ""Agua-CAAA-te."" If ever there was a way to bottle a sound, I'd bottle that one. Because of this place, my kids will think that supermarkets are unnecessary because you could buy half of what you need from your car window for a few pesos: mangoes, avocados, bananas, loofah sponges, sunglasses, nuts, balloons, cell phone accessories, calling cards, multiplication fact posters, garbage bags, ceiling fan dusters, puppies. Puppies? Yes, puppies. I have twice seen a man holding puppies for sale on Avenida 27. Lucky for Husband, I didn't have enough effectivo (cash) on me. But... they will know that coconut water isn't sold in juice boxes at wholesale at Costco. Instead they will drink fresh coconut water from an actual coconut that they just watched the coconut guy chop open with a machete for them in two swipes of near fatal precision. Fish will be caught straight from the ocean that they are swimming in, grilled to perfection and served with a side of tostones to their rustic picnic table on the local beach for less than a Kids' Meal. And guavas? Well they can just pick one off the tree outside our apartment.They will know that not all dogs are as loved as the ones in our home and that many dogs make their home in the street and struggle every day to find food and shelter. They'll know the same of many kids too. Kids who don't go to school because they are washing windshields for a dime. Kids who seem too young to be alone on a busy city street and who, too, are wondering where they will find their next meal. But... my kids will know how lucky they are because they'll witness daily that not all people are lucky to have what they have. They won't be able to turn a blind eye to how unbalanced the world could be and they'll question why they are lucky and others aren't and realize the answer is as simple as being born. I hope that they'll look at their closet full of shoes and their water heater and air conditioned bedroom and see that it is a luxury. Here, horses wander the streets. So do chickens and roosters. A lizard the size of my small pinky dropped out of my cupboard last night and I only yelped a little. Life is slower, days are longer, and the evening breeze lifts the salt from the ocean water and carries it to the tip of your nose for you to smell the ocean air. And... I'd be lying if I said I didn't miss the East Coast hustle, the shorter days of winter's arrival giving me the nod of approval to hibernate and do nothing, and the evening air that smells of chimneys burning wood, warming up the cozy families that live inside. My kids are growing up Dominican. In the future they might grow up Argentinian or Croatian or Chilean and with us as their anchor, I'd like to believe they're growing up New Jerseyan too. And I hope that one day their purple-flowered, daisy-infused minds will see that the world is one big place full of many different childhoods. None better than the one they lived."

Having a sense of humor about any of this can be difficult for people that age, because they lived in an era when everyone believed that utopia was just around the drug-fueled corner. Unfortunately, no amount of singing and swaying to the music made that utopia materialize.If you believed that you were about to be drafted to fight in Vietnam, you might have had good reason to ""love the one you're with"" instead of taking the time to fall in love with someone. But for other people, such as your boyfriend for example, ""love the one you're with"" didn't work out so well for him if he wasn't the one you were with that night. ""Turn on, tune in and drop out"" might have worked for Timothy Leary, but it wasn't a good retirement plan for people who do not enjoy eating Ramen noodles and living in a tent in the woods in their old age. Apparently for Timothy Leary, at any rate, it was also possible to author dozens of books and reap tons of money while also turning on, tuning in and dropping out. He just forgot to let everyone else know. ""All you need is love"" might have been true when you lived with your parents and didn't have rent and utilities to pay. Eventually, it became helpful to have an income, access to health care, a car to drive and maybe enough discretionary income for a meal in a restaurant. So all you need is love and a paying job, to be more accurate.Jim Morrison delved deeper into the sage wisdom of the era. He claimed that ""There can't be any large scale revolution until there's a personal revolution, on an individual level. It's got to happen inside first."" But then he died young. So much for the revolution.Ken Kesey noted that ""You're either on the bus or off the bus."" Master of the obvious, that guy. But we know what went on in that bus and if it was still going on today, the bus would be a hybrid and the LSD would be organic and there would be no smoking allowed.""One pill makes you larger, and one pill makes you small."" Jefferson Airplane had no idea how rampant the pill popping would become. Today, there's a pill for every real or imaginary thing that ails you. Pills for little boys who don't act like quiet little girls in school. Pills for middle-aged people who have just realized their childhood dreams are not going to come true. Pills for folks who hate their doughy midsections. And some of the most powerful pills make you want to take more and more of them which really only pleases the shareholders of the company that manufactured them.The songs of the Grateful Dead were full of bad advice about how a friend of the devil could be your friend too and something or other about boxes of rain, but the truth is I never really understood any song they ever wrote. Janis Joplin, on the other hand, was less obtuse. ""If someone comes along, he's gonna give you love and affection, I'd say get it while you can."" Not exactly advice any of us would tell our daughters but then again, Janis didn't have children.""Make love, not war"" was sage advice from the Woodstock era even though some folks discovered years later that the two were not mutually exclusive. ""Give peace a chance"" was a keeper, however. We should resurrect that one."

Between contributing to multiple benefit events, purchasing corporate sponsorships or simply attending shows, the personal involvement of Grand Rapids, Michigan citizenry is instinctively broad. Monday's Wanda Sykes performance demonstrated an even wider contextual embrace, attracting a diverse, supportive and downright exuberant audience to the 2400-capacity DeVos Performance Hall.The red-hot crowd adored opener Keith Robinson, who in his designated role as ""the trailer before the movie"" and ""that pickle on the side of the sandwich,"" addressed Bill Cosby, stricter gun control and manufactured Internet outrage. Crowd work with a front-row volunteer resulted in the donning of a white LaughFest tee; his was the rare warm-up spot earning a prompt standing ovation. Sykes immediately praised festival non-profit Gilda's Club, founded in honor of late Saturday Night Live original castmember Gilda Radner. ""This is a special place for me because I am a breast cancer survivor,"" said the Curb Your Enthusiasm and New Adventures of Old Christine vet. A double mastectomy followed her diagnosis, itself prompted by breast-reduction surgery. ""I would take my bra off and people would think Law & Order was coming on."" Trading easy punchlines for more circuitous commentary, Sykes eased into subtle dissections of racial equality by relating recent stays at both a haunted Virginia hotel and remodeled Boston prison. (Observations concerning Paula Deen and Duck Dynasty proved far more candid.) Midway through an impressive hour and 25 minutes, she took a more immediate and personal angle, explaining, ""I'm a black woman married to this French lady, and I've got two white babies. I'm a minority in my own home!"" From the photos on the walls (""This must be how the Obamas feel walking around..."") to the poorly-timed viewing of 12 Years a Slave and The Help, her sense of personal identity has been subsumed in favor of a non-traditional family unit. Admitted Sykes, ""There is nothing creepier than walking up and seeing two little white kids standing at the foot of your bed.""Having turned 51 over the weekend, there were also frank admissions of sporadic incontinence and ending up on the floor after leaping out of bed too quickly. And while, as she put it, ""Pussy makes you crazy!"" marshaling her into foreign territory of snowboarding and paying off student loans, preserving and strengthening the romantic relationship at the core remains a clear priority.""I love you, Wanda!"" a woman shouted from the balcony. ""I love you, too!"" Sykes replied, prompting the latest in a lengthy series of applause breaks up to and including one for the sound techs correcting a bout of monitor static. She may have been known in the past as a controversial trailblazer, but career longevity and personal fulfillment now trump marketing flash. The standing ovation Sykes received at 10 p.m. on the dot celebrated not shock, but affinity. Family, growing older and gaining perspective: Comedy doesn't get more universal."

To face that truth is also our burden. After all, each of us has been the bystander, the reasonable person who just happens not to hear, not to speak, not to see those people, the invisible ones, those who live on the other side of the border. - Karen Connelly, The Lizard CageIt was a little over two weeks ago that Marlo entered Atwood Hall, here in Lexington federal prison. Nearly all the women here are nonviolent offenders. When I first saw Marlo, her eyes seemed glued to the tiled floors as she shuffled along hallways. I guessed her age to be 25 or so. A few days later, she came to a choir rehearsal. She was still shy, but she looked up and offered a quiet smile when she joined the soprano section. The next time our choir gathered, Marlo raised her hand before we ended our rehearsal. ""I got something to say,"" she said, as she stood. ""When I first came here, I can tell all of you now, I was terrified. Just plain terrified. I have 70 months, and I felt so scared."" The intake process for this, her introduction to the prison system, had badly frightened her, but before sundown that same day, a second intake process had occurred, with several inmates finding her, reassuring her, and getting her beyond that first panic. During my four stints in U.S. federal prisons, I've witnessed long-term inmates' unconquerably humane response when a newcomer arrives. An unscripted choreography occurs and the new prisoner finds that other women will help her through the trauma of adjustment to being locked up for many months or years. Halfway through a three-month sentence myself, I'm saddened to realize that I'll very likely adapt to an outside world for which these women, and prisoners throughout the U.S. prison system, are often completely invisible. U.S. state and federal prison populations have risen, since 1988, from 600,000 to an estimated 1,600,000 in 2012. This trend shows inhumane behavior on the part of lawmakers and myriads of employees who benefit from the so-called ""criminal justice"" system. But our entire society bears responsibility for what now can aptly be labeled a ""prison-industrial complex."" Constructing prisons and filling prisons with people who posed little or no threat to our security didn't happen secretively, without our consent. We watched, mesmerized perhaps, and allowed ourselves to become a country with the world's largest prison system. A friend from home recently sent me encouraging news of Illinois Governor Rauner's initiative to address the problems in some of the United States' most brutally overcrowded prisons. A Chicago Tribune article from several weeks ago notes that Rauner plans to reduce the state's prison population by 25 percent over the next ten years, establishing the reduction as a goal through executive order. The article, by columnist Eric Zorn, cites a widely-cited recent report by the Vera Institute of Justice that says ""nearly 75 percent of the population of both sentenced offenders and pretrial detainees are in jail for nonviolent offenses like traffic, property, drug or public order violations."" Skyrocketing costs of incarceration have finally convinced some lawmakers to work toward ""reducing prison populations."" Yesterday, I read a long report about how the California Department of Corrections has responded to a court-ordered demand that the state reduce the numbers of people locked up in California state prisons. The order was first issued in 2009 by a three-judge panel. The state appealed the order, but in 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld it, ordering the state of California to comply by 2013. The California government sought and was granted two extensions. As of now, the order insists that California must reduce its prison population, by 2016, to ""no more than 137.5 percent of the design capacity"" of its state prisons. Whatever plans Gov. Rauner's committee proposes for Illinois, the notoriously incarceration-minded Illinois state legislature is likely to put up just as vigorous a fight. Meanwhile the California report discusses ""cost-effective measures,"" ""recidivism reduction results,"" ""rehabilitative programming"" and ""programming slots"" at ""in-state contract facilities."" The language, highly impersonal, suggests warehousing. I wonder if zookeepers might be more attentive to the individuality of the beings they cage. Trapped in a cruel and uncaring system, women here in Atwood Hall reliably find humane ways to cope. Among many signs of daily generosity, one of my favorites is the practice of ""window shopping."" Women place extra items they can spare in the window sills nearest the stairwells. A new prisoner can find new fresh socks, a warm knit cap, books, magazines, pitchers -- items that quickly disappear and are soon replenished.Perhaps we'll begin to see a trend toward finding humane ways to cope with seemingly intractable problems in today's criminal justice system. The U.S. Supreme Court's insistence that the State of California must release many thousands of prisoners signals a trend in which, as Gov. Rauner's order recognizes, ""States across the country have enacted bi-partisan, data driven and evidence based reforms that have reduced the use of incarceration and its costs while protecting and improving public safety."" Zorn notes that the Mac Arthur Foundation recently granted $75 million for a 5 year ""Safety and Justice Challenge"" meant ""to reduce over-incarceration by changing the way America thinks about its prisons and jails.""I can't imagine a figure too high to pay, in dollars or in human work hours, to effectively challenge the way U.S. people think about safety and justice. In describing a class that he taught in a New Jersey maximum-security prison, Chris Hedges wrote: The mass incarceration of primarily poor people of color, people who seldom have access to adequate legal defense and who are often kept behind bars for years for nonviolent crimes or for crimes they did not commit, is one of the most shameful mass injustices committed in the United States. The 28 men in my class have cumulatively spent 515 years in prison. Some of their sentences are utterly disproportionate to the crimes of which they are accused. Most are not even close to finishing their sentences or coming before a parole board, which rarely grants first-time applicants their liberty. Many of them are in for life. One of my students was arrested at the age of 14 for a crime that strong evidence suggests he did not commit. He will not be eligible for parole until he is 70. He never had a chance in court and because he cannot afford a private attorney he has no chance now of challenging the grotesque sentence handed to him as a child.Here in Atwood Hall, guards and administrators know that they imprison humane, caring, generous and talented women, people not very different from their own relatives, friends and co-workers. Where are the ""bad sisters"" that could ever justify the punishment of isolating women like Marlo from their children and other loved ones for long and wearying years? I imagine that many BOP guards admire, as I do, the courage and fortitude of the women facing long sentences here. Do they wonder, sometimes, what courage would be required, in their own lives, to stop working as enforcers of the prison system? Or do they perhaps wish, sometimes, that the general public could muster up the will to stop voting for the prison system?There is a cynical quote which a cynical friend of mine likes to quote to me, from the philosopher David Hume: ""A prisoner who has neither money nor interest, discovers the impossibility of his escape, as well when he considers the obstinacy of the gaoler, as the walls and bars with which he is surrounded; and, in all attempts for his freedom, chooses rather to work upon the stone and iron of the one, than upon the inflexible nature of the other."" It's the cliché of the prisoner attempting escape: the prisoner sees more hope tunneling out through bricks than appealing to the stone-faced jailer. But who are the jailers? These prisons were built, and filled, in our name -- in the name of making us ""safer"". More guards, more lawyers, judges, wardens, marshals, probation officers and court personnel would be hired even if the present ones resigned. Meanwhile the creative work to create real security, real community in the face of social dislocation and crime, would still need to be done. We, the broader public, must be the jailers. Sometimes we seem to be a stone rolling down the path of least resistance. But we're not stone. We can choose not to be jailers, and choose, instead, to be ever more inflexible in our resistance to injustice and to hatred born of fear. I'm here among women, some of whom, I've been told, are supposed to be ""hardened criminals."" Fellow activists incarcerated in men's prisons likewise concur that the system is futile, merciless and wrongheaded. Our jailers, I'm convinced, can see this. Men like Governor Rauner, it seems, can see it, or his advisers can. Where are the inflexible ones keeping women like Marlo isolated from and lost to the world, trembling for their future for the next five years? I would like to make an appeal to you, and to myself two months from now when I've left here and once more rejoined the polite society of these women's ""inflexible jailers."" I choose to believe that we can be moved and these women can escape. I am writing this, as many have written and will write, to see if we're easier to move than iron and stone.Kathy Kelly, co-coordinator of Voices for Creative Nonviolence (info@vcnv.org), is in federal prison for participation in an anti-drone protest.

In the book, they initially disguise their mother's experiences as those of a teen named Marie, before later revealing her true identity: She began to envy the girl who tried to control her weight through what turned out to be a destructive eating disorder. Not realizing how dangerous it was, Marie thought it might work for her, and soon her obsession to stay thin started controlling her life. Michelle was both a gymnast and a cheerleader, but still found it difficult to stay as slim as she'd like. The 47-year-old told People her eating disorder began when she was 14, believing it was the answer to her problems. According to Michelle, meeting husband Jim Bob when she was 16 years old helped her stop the dangerous habit, because she felt like she had to share her secret with him. ""I shared this struggle with him and he said he would help me and help keep me accountable,"" she said. ""Every time I was struggling, I would tell him,"" she says. ""It was a hard time for me. But it was at that point in our relationship, it built a solid foundation for us. There are tough things in life you walk through together."" She added, ""He told me to call him anytime. I just know that I would be tempted and I would have the crazy thought that I wanted to throw up, not hold onto the calories. Thank God it didn't go on longer than it did or I could have done horrible damage to my body."" While Michelle hasn't been quite so open about the eating disorder she's now recovered from, the mother of 19 has spoken about her issues with weight and body image before.“Jim Bob has never put me down for my body. He has never mocked me for my mommy tummy,” she told ""Today Show"" last year. “He is one of my biggest encouragers.”"
11,POLITICS,"Two Years Later, White House Still Hitting Roadblocks In Effort To Move Drone Program Out Of CIA Control",Ali Watkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-drone-cia_n_6817858.html,,2015-03-10,"FILE - In this Jan. 31, 2010 file photo, an unmanned U.S. Predator drone flies over Kandahar Air Field, southern Afghanistan, on a moon-lit night. A U.N. expert on Friday, Oct. 18, 2013 called on the United States to reveal the number of civilians it believes have been killed by American drone strikes targeting Islamic militants. U.N. Special Rapporteur Ben Emmerson said that preliminary information gathered for a new report indicated more than 450 civilians may have been killed by drone strikes in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Yemen, but more work needs to be done to confirm the figures.(AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ec9a200000f90101d992.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- In a May 2013 speech at the National Defense University, President Barack Obama offered a rare glimpse into upcoming changes to one of the U.S.’s most closely held covert operations: the ongoing drone strike campaign in the Middle East. Cryptically, he suggested, the White House would start moving to transfer control of the nation’s targeted killing program from the CIA to the Department of Defense.  Obama's discreet reference underscored earlier news reports of a draft presidential directive that would initiate this change. But despite the flurry of chatter that followed the president's speech, U.S. officials cautioned that the process of transferring the operationally clunky drone program to the Pentagon “was not something that would happen overnight.”The thinking behind the shift made enough sense. The CIA was never intended to deal lethal blows -- its charter is primarily as an intelligence collector, not a paramilitary organization. Transparency-wise, the move would bring the controversial drone program out of the shadows, since targeted killings are covert operations when carried out by the CIA. And it could help the Obama administration improve public perceptions of its military offensives: After all, it's much easier to tout a successful drone strike when you're allowed to discuss the operation. Nearly two years later, the administration has had ample time to make its moves -- but there’s been little success in shifting control of the operation to the Pentagon, though not for the White House's lack of trying. Rather, officials and lawmakers tell The Huffington Post that the plans have been largely stymied by skeptical lawmakers, operational difficulties and the competing egos of the two most macho shops in town: the CIA and the Pentagon’s elite Joint Special Operations Command, both of whom think they’re better suited to pull the drone trigger.  And with no substantial move in either direction, the controversial, still largely secret drone program is left hanging in oversight limbo.The White House says its intention to transition the program hasn’t changed.“The President has explained his belief that we must be more transparent about both the basis of our counterterrorism actions and the manner in which they are carried out, whether they are drone strikes or training partners,” Ned Price, a spokesman for the National Security Council, told HuffPost last week. “Because of this, he has indicated that he will increasingly turn to our military to take the lead and provide information to the public about our efforts. We continue to work diligently toward this goal.”One U.S. official familiar with the White House’s plans suggested that moving the program too quickly could leave gaps in the administration's ongoing counterterror campaign. “We are moving deliberately to ensure our security,” the official said.But lawmakers aren’t buying the stated reasons for delay, and Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) recently said he intends to probe the White House on the matter.  “They’re backing away from it. It’s very clear that they are not pursuing what they said was their objective,” McCain told HuffPost, adding that he believes the CIA should get out of the business of killing people. “We’re going to be having hearings and demanding information as to what they want to do.”The Senate Armed Services Committee declined to add to McCain’s comments.The drone program, in many ways, has become a hallmark of the Obama administration's foreign policy, juxtaposing surgical precision with a broader counterterror strategy that has seen little closure or resolution over the administration's six years in office. The Obama White House has relied far more on the remote killers than its predecessor, using both the JSOC and CIA drone programs to wage its war on terror in the Middle East.The combination of covert action by the CIA and overt action by the Defense Department has been beneficial for the administration: It provides a way for the White House to distance itself from the controversial targeted killings. But the arrangement is a double-edged sword: While the White House can publicize the success of its JSOC strikes, which are overt operations, it can't do the same with successful CIA operations, since they are covert and cannot be publicly acknowledged. (Of course, for the same reason, JSOC's failures make their way into the public eye more easily, too.)Operationally, the separation has additional complications. Covert and overt programs have different sets of rules: JSOC's overt strikes have to abide by international law and are subject to internal Defense Department standards, while the CIA's institutional hierarchies and transparency standards have historically been less rigid. The agency's covert actions can remain secret, and are largely subject to the whims of the White House.  Geographic boundaries are another concern. Both JSOC and the CIA have conducted strikes in Yemen and Somalia, but the split ownership has complicated geographic drone jurisdiction in the past. For example, in 2013, an errant JSOC strike in Yemen hit a wedding convoy, killing twelve. In response, Yemen's then-stable government -- which, under former President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, had previously backed the drone program -- temporarily withdrew its blessing for the military-run strikes. The CIA, though, was allowed to continue going after al Qaeda targets in the country.Yet the agency's strikes haven't always been clean, either. In fact, the Obama administration's inaugural covert strike -- which decimated a house in a Pakistani village in 2009 -- was disastrous, striking the house of a tribal elder instead of the intended Taliban hideout and killing five, including two children.The CIA declined to comment for this story.  Mounting concern over the program, underscored by reports that innocent civilians were becoming collateral damage, prompted reconsideration of how the operation was run. This concern led to the White House’s plans to fully transition the drone program to the military, though even early-stage talks suggested the shift would be more of an integration than a clear-cut transition.  Certain lawmakers, though, weren’t thrilled. In January 2014, in the quiet corners of the congressional appropriations committees, panel members tacked a classified annex onto a must-pass omnibus spending measure restricting the administration's ability to make the shift.   But the annex was inserted largely unbeknownst to the rest of Capitol Hill. Some in Congress, including McCain, then the ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, were furious that the move had happened behind closed doors, and railed against the CIA's temporary victory in the drone tug-of-war.  That fight isn’t over, though it’s certainly quieted over the past year. A new bill from Rep. Michael Burgess (R-Texas) that's floating around the House signals that the White House's drone plans haven't fallen off Congress' radar. The proposal, according to the congressman's office, would strip the CIA of its ability to conduct strikes and override the provision in the omnibus restricting the drone switch. The intention is to reinvigorate an effort that it seems the White House has been forced to put on pause.  “We get the impression [the White House] is OK with the status quo,” Burgess said.  Talk of the switch inspires some jostle in the halls of Congress: The drone operation is one of the nation’s most tightly held programs, and its oversight is coveted. The secretive Senate Intelligence Committee is more than happy to keep overseeing the program behind its closed doors.On one hand, moving the program under Pentagon control would likely mean more public light is shed on the drone strikes themselves. But with that added transparency could come an oversight trade-off. While officials cannot publicly acknowledge the CIA’s targeted strikes, lawmakers and experts argue that the intelligence committees' oversight of the covert arm of the program has been second to none. The oversight may be secret, but that doesn’t mean it's soft.“A lack of public knowledge about intelligence oversight doesn't mean a lack of oversight. The members can be quite aggressive, even behind closed doors,” said Mieke Eoyang, a former staffer on both the House Intelligence and Armed Services Committees and current director of the National Security Program at the think tank Third Way.Under former Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), staff made frequent trips out to the CIA's headquarters to review drone strike videos and study the process that led up to an approved covert strike. The visits made lawmakers confident that the agency side of the program was run tightly and allowed as little collateral damage as possible: Feinstein maintains that she has firm confidence in the viability of the CIA-run strikes.And while some transparency advocates have voiced concern about leaving drone oversight to new chairman Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), a staunch CIA advocate, one U.S. official familiar with the intelligence committee said the program is actually high up on Burr's priority list.  Under Burr's watch, the official said, the plan is to increase staff and committee oversight of the drone program. The new chair continues to send staff to the CIA to examine videos and strike packages, and has put plans in motion to conduct more oversight from the ground in countries where the covert program is run.The official requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of committee matters.The concern, though, is that congressional oversight isn’t a consistent variable. New chairs come and go, and get to dictate committee agendas. While oversight of the CIA is largely subject to the whims of intelligence committee leaders, internal checks are stronger within the Defense Department itself. So rather than rely on congressional panel chairs, Eoyang says, the safer option would be to run the operation through whichever institution values oversight more -- and the CIA has, historically, disliked being watched.“The level of congressional oversight is dependent on two things, the culture of the relationship between the agencies and the committees, and the interest of the chair,” said Eoyang. “The intelligence community’s relationship with the intelligence committees has been more volatile and at times has resembled hostile litigation.”On the other hand, she noted that the Pentagon ""has a strong culture of oversight, and a largely respectful, cooperative and productive relationship with its oversight committees.” While the Senate Intelligence Committee may be mostly in sync about keeping the drone triggers in the hands of the CIA, it’s not a united front in both chambers. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, has made no secret of his support for military-only drone strikes. Using the same rhetoric employed by many others who support a shift to Pentagon control, Schiff argues the CIA's job is clear: to collect and analyze intelligence, not to kill people. ""I continue to believe it is in the best interests of the intelligence community to primarily focus on its core mission of collection and analysis, and will continue to advocate for reforms that would better permit it to do so,"" he told HuffPost in a statement.  But central to the debate over whether the proposed shift should go forward is another question that Washington refuses to answer definitively: Who runs drone strikes more effectively, the CIA or JSOC?  Lawmakers familiar with the program's oversight have lauded the meticulous care that goes into constructing a CIA drone strike, including analysis, targeting and special care to make sure civilians don’t become a part of the equation. JSOC often isn't as careful, some say, noting that the Defense Department is responsible for some of the program’s more public failings, including the 2013 strike that hit the Yemeni wedding convoy.  Part of this possible discrepancy is that due to institutional differences, the CIA and Pentagon staff the operations differently. Whereas agency personnel have spent years refining their tactics, the Defense Department is more cyclical -- personnel tend to put in a few years and then rotate off to a different assignment.Asked to address concerns about the Pentagon’s drone program, a defense official said, ""The professionals who support the remotely piloted vehicle program are extremely skilled and competent, functioning in a managed operational cycle that accounts for mission requirements and professional development.""  But regardless of which agency is holding the joystick, the debate over drones is still unsettled in the human rights community, which has long suggested that neither the CIA nor JSOC is careful enough.  “I have spent too much time with people at the sharp end of a Hellfire missile to think that we ought to give a damn,” said Cori Crider, a lawyer who heads the counterterrorism team at Reprieve, a UK-based human rights organization. “Neither JSOC nor the CIA are especially transparent or accountable.”"

Despite all this, I have one simple message to share: Kids don't kill relationships; adults do.I say this knowing full well that tomorrow, yet another study will probably be published suggesting that that kids decrease marital satisfaction.I've read all the research. I know it looks grim, but to my mind, we're all far too ready to accept this conclusion. Some of these early studies were riddled with problems, including small absolute changes in satisfaction (say, 2 points out of 50), vagaries in the measurement of ""satisfaction,"" and finally, oversized graphs that seemed designed to exaggerate the point. Sadly, all those flaws didn't stop the press -- or the public -- from eagerly embracing the conclusion that having kids ranks right up there with STDs when it comes to maintaining a happy relationship.In reality, each of these studies also suffers from the fatal flaw of all field research: correlation is not the same as causation.Simply put, marital satisfaction may well drop as much as 50-90 percent after having kids, but even that stark, downward trend can never be conclusively linked to having kids, alone. It's always possible that having children is correlated with some third (or fourth or fifth) variable that deals that fatal blow to a marriage. No amount of statistical wizardry can ever eliminate this problem; it's the inevitable downside of field research.Couples vs Kids: Round TwoAdmittedly, recent studies have far fewer flaws, but there's one that the authors still haven't managed to eliminate: some couples become happier once they have children, and, to date, they haven't received nearly enough attention. Maybe it's time we studied them.Given the much cited 50 percent divorce rate, and the strong correlation between a couple's adjustment and satisfaction before and after kids, we could just as easily look at the data and reach a different conclusion altogether: Many couples aren't very good at building and maintaining a relationship, and maybe kids just speed an already doomed couple towards marital demise. The stresses of every day life place an enormous strain on even the best-equipped couples' capacity to cope. Adding childcare to the list of duties is bound to strain them even further. In my own practice, those who weather the kid-storm tend to differ from those who are swept away in one important respect: the couples who seem happiest after children have worked hard to improve themselves.So here's my whole new spin on the bad rep kids have in marital satisfaction studies. In the movie As Good as it Gets, Jack Nicholson, as the caustic Melvin Udall, complements his love interest with the following proclamation: ""You make me want to be a better man."" Allow me to paraphrase Mr. Udall: Kids can make us want to be better people.Many of my clients have embraced parenthood as an opportunity to grow. Determined to avoid the mistakes of their own parents, they examine themselves with renewed vigor: how can I learn to handle anger better before my child is born? Maybe I should look more closely at my anxiety now. Can you recommend any good parenting books?Not surprisingly, in my own practice, these are precisely the people whose marriages seem to improve after kids. Everyone -- especially our partner -- is bound to benefit from our quest to be a better person. Sadly, most troubled couples never get to explore this kind of thinking. Their heads are too crowded with messages that their relationship pitched off a cliff as soon as they left the delivery room.One reason I think we're so quick to accept the gloomy outlook in the research is that we already believe kids kill relationships. Before having kids, we live with the terror of lost freedom -- by which we usually mean the freedom to stay up late watching movies or escape for a weekend without having to give any notice. Never mind the fact that very few couples actually have time to exercise these freedoms before having kids. Somehow children get blamed for the lack of spontaneity that wasn't even there to begin with. As parents, we're all too quick to project our dissatisfaction onto the experience of raising kids. We start asking little of life (often well before kids come along), and then feel deeply disappointed that life hasn't got as much to offer. The few couples who get it right end up as the exceptions to the rule -- glossed over by science, and regarded by the rest of us with the same mixture of suspicion and fear we feel when we spot the neighbor who always seems to have a smile plastered across his or her face.Maybe there's another way. Rather than resigning yourself to the dissatisfaction predicted in the longitudinal studies, you could, like some I've people seen over the years, decide to embrace children as an opportunity for self-growth. You could use building a family as a chance to feel closer.Here's just a sampling of the ways I've watched couples grow closer after kids -- the cliff notes, if you will. Five Ways to Stay Close after Kids1) Jump at the chance to be with each other. When your schedule becomes squeezed by parenting demands, a carpe diem mentality can add a playfulness and excitement to intimate life that you weren't challenged to try out before kids.2) Take a good hard look at yourself. Could you learn to be more flexible? Or a better listener? If you're open to learning new behaviors and attitudes, your kids will benefit -- and so will your partner.3) Embrace the changes brought by kids. I learned to start viewing ""going to the beach"" as ""going to the beach with kids"" -- a slower, more meandering version of my kid-free beach days, but one that involved lots of games and breaks from packing. My wife and I both benefited by giving up our attachment to the old version. If you fight the change, you can count on tension with your partner. If you embrace it, you can start seeing things in a whole new way.4) Use quiet times with kids as a chance to bond. Few moments provide the depth of satisfaction and emotional bonding of laying together, soaking up the bliss of a sweet, family moment. Sit close to your partner. Touch each other when you have the chance. This is family intimacy. It can only add to your relationship.5) Celebrate when the day is over. My wife and I started a ritual of toasting at the end of the day: ""We made it,"" we'd say; ""the kids are alive and asleep. Ahhhh."" We'd share the highs and lows. Parenting is a shared adventure, full of self-discovery and rich rewards. If you don't take the time to talk about it, you're nurturing distance and missing out --and then you end up as a statistic in a study.Are you one of the couples who grew closer after kids?

I found her to be thoughtful, sincere, and an awesome talent. I reviewed that album and a previous show on this page. Since then, I've watched her career continue to blossom, receiving accolades world wide, picking up many new fans and providing an example for empowerment and women's rights everywhere she goes. It has been a joy to behold. Last night she performed at The Painted Bride Art Center in Philadelphia -- my hometown. It was another stunning performance, this time with her excellent band using more spare arrangements, allowing her voice to soar with the most firm yet gentle support. I welcomed the chance to catch up with her and see where her career has gone since last we'd spoken, and she was again gracious with her time. The following responses have been edited for length and clarity.When last we spoke, your album, The Lagos Music Salon, had just been released and you were in the crowd at another musician's performance. That was about 8 months ago. How has your life changed since then? With this being your second album, how has the experience been different? Ever since the album's release, I've been given so many wonderful opportunities to share my music with both new audiences and long-time supporters. I'm so very grateful for all of that, but not sure that I would say that my life has ""changed"" per se; only that I've been able to reach more and do more through my creative practice. I would like to believe every artist is interested in more expansive 'dreaming and doing' - it's a beautiful thing when there are clear markers of that along the journey. This is actually my fourth album, but my first on a major label. Obviously there is a certain type of social and cultural capital that accompanies that and which can open doors to even more visibility and career growth. More than anything, I feel fortunate to be counted among a long list of artists I respect deeply on the label's catalogue. As we'd discussed before, much of that album was inspired by the time that you'd spent in Nigeria, and you've also had travels in Africa recently. Can you explain your continuing connection with the continent, and how it affects your artistry? How were you received abroad this time?The majority of my very large extended family live in East Africa, so my connection to the continent is deeply personal. Since I grew up mostly in Illinois, however, I became curious about my definition of ""home"" at a very young age. My work, therefore, seems to always be in pursuit of the cultural space between both here and there; as I really do feel equally African and American. I will say, though, that I feel more inspired on the African continent than anywhere else on this planet. I think that has something to do with the knowing that we have so many stories that have yet to be told - stories that give a more balanced and whole picture of who Africans are and can be in today's world. It's such an exciting time on the continent, no matter what industry you are in, and I love when I have the chance to plug into that energy and inspiration. Hopefully 'The Lagos Music Salon' album has helped audiences reimagine the humanity of Lagos or any other modern African city.My recent trip was wonderful. I spent 6 weeks traveling through South Africa, Uganda and Rwanda. My time in East Africa was purely recreational and all about catching up with family. In Johannesburg and Cape Town, however, I was working: performing, doing lots of press, and shooting a new music video. South Africa has a deep musical history and love of jazz. I love how passionate and open-minded their audiences are. After performing there a few times, I've been able to connect with a really loving and growing fanbase there who really support what I'm trying to do. It's definitely a country where, as an artist, I feel most at home. I'll be heading back this spring and can't wait! One of the things that stands out in your music is the way that you weave topical messages in with, for lack of a better descriptor, adult contemporary sensibilities. To what degree is that a part of your process?Ha! I can't help but laugh a bit at ""adult contemporary sensibilities."" Whatever the sensibilities or aesthetic one hears in my music, it's not something I necessarily set out to do. My music making is an organic process. No matter what the subject matter of the song, I try to honor all of my musical influences - whether they be jazz, hip-hop, afrobeat, soul, or (dare I say it to) something that sounds both adult and contemporary. At the end of the day, I'm really just trying to tell stories and frame them as best I can.You're at a point in your career now where you are starting to repeat appearances in certain cities. How does it feel, for instance, returning to Philadelphia, albeit in a new venue?It always feels great to come back to a city and have the chance to reconnect with and hopefully grow your audience in each place. As a New Yorker, Philly feels like the next door neighbor that I never get to spend much time with or get to know very well, so I am really excited to spend more time there and in other East Coast cities on this tour. Having witnessed your performances a few times now, I know how well you communicate specific and regional ideas into a common experience. The song, ""Ginger Me Slowly"" is one such example, which means to make one feel spicy and sweet. This is also your newest video release. Can you explain some of the ideas behind that production? How do you like making videos in comparison to making music?Well, I haven't made a lot of music videos, but it's an entirely different process than making music. Mostly, I just love having the chance to think about and create a new performance of a song through a different medium and new creative dimension. I wanted the video for ""Ginger Me Slowly"" to have feel both intimate and artful. I also wanted to do it in a way that made one think about how nuance hides in minimalism. The song ""Ginger Me Slowly"" is about dreaming of a big and expressive kind of love, but it's also about learning to appreciate the simple yet meaningful declarations of that love. When choosing a treatment, I decided to go with South African director Kyle Lewis because it seemed to evoke all of those things. Hopefully audiences see that too!What was most surprising about your tour thus far?I love the surprises that sit inside of my band's improvisation every time we get on stage. Even though we've performed the music countless times, they continue to inspire and push me in ways that make the songs feel like a nightly chance to rediscover something new in my own voice and the very stories I'm trying to tell.It's probably too early for fans to be expecting a new album, but have you made any plans yet for how you may approach your next project?Well, I recently collaborated with Lebanese-French trumpeter Ibrahim Maalouf on a song cycle about the role of women during the Arab Spring Movement. We premiered the music at the Kennedy Center last May and really love the music so we're hoping to record it in the not-so-distant future. I've also just begun working on a jazz opera about the late South African singer and political activist Miriam Makeba. I'm not sure if and when that will become an album, but I'm looking forward to sharing more about that as it unfolds.Somi continues to tour, with upcoming dates in New York, Boston, Vancouver and returning to the continent of Africa to perform at the Harare International Festival of the Arts. Her latest music video, ""Ginger Me Slowly"" makes it's debut here."

Women are by far the most competitive of the genders. No, we may not lay awake, strategizing our softball play-by-play the night before a big game, or demand an arm wrestling match to prove that we are in fact the strongest woman in the room (trust me, we have our ways), but we are more competitive than any group of men you'll ever meet.As women, we're programmed to simultaneously take on, and handle a lot at once. Some call this multitasking, or juggling balls in the air. I call it a cluster-fuck, same thing. And as we age, and mature we become masters of this fine art. As a young woman I recall doing various paid jobs that required running errands for odds and ends, completing a to-do list a mile long for my boss, or managing multiple office projects at one time. I was good at it, really good. But it felt like second nature, not a skill. Like I said, I felt programmed for this. And as I grew close to many of my girlfriends, I finally understood, this wasn't a ""me"" thing, it was a ""woman"" thing. We were all running around with our heads cut off, trying to get as much done as we could in as short amount of time as humanly possible. It was like a constant race, and while we weren't competing with each other in those instances, we were most definitely competing with ourselves. I've been known to be hard on myself for doing something less than perfect, especially if I had done it perfectly in the past. Why must I always live up to the standard I unconsciously set for myself way back when? --Because, I'm a woman.Now, put that same woman out in a social scene and pressure her to find a partner. Because let's face it, she won't be this youthful forever and her eggs are only getting older, right? That's just another expectation that almost every woman feels necessary to check off her own to-do list. Find a partner, get pregnant, and then figure it out.Her peers and friends will become her competitors once she begins comparing herself to them for a man, or a paycheck, as a wife, or mother of the year. This will inevitably happen. We are human, and as women we are socially pressured to meet unrealistic expectations for our family and ourselves. So when we see others doing better than us, or more than us, we become jealous, defensive, competitive.Who will find a partner faster? Who will get the bigger engagement ring? Who will have the larger wedding? Who will be the ""happiest?""The pressure can be unbearable, but we plow through for the good of the whole, whatever that whole may be. But now we're stressed and exhausted, and we haven't even had our first child yet.And even trying to conceive a child has taken on its own social, cultural and political role in this world. It's almost become taboo and inappropriate to talk about. Those of us who've had children are criticized for not understanding the struggle of infertility. Those of us who had a hard time conceiving but were successful in the end are offended by the fertile-myrtles of the world, but still chastised by the ones who have yet to conceive. And those of us who still haven't been able to have one baby after years of trying everything in our power, feel hurt and are scrambling to find the meaning in it all. We feel empty, left out, misunderstood and completely flipped on our heads. But can I share something with you that applies to every single circumstance each woman will experience regarding having children? The reality is NEVER what we expected. It's a far cry from the dream. As young girls, fantasizing about our future, we began compounding expectation upon expectation onto ourselves. This thing called ""motherhood"" for those who are blessed enough to have children is NOT cute, or even mostly fun. It's SO much harder. This thing called ""trying to conceive"" for those who are struggling and reeling with the feeling of failure; the reality of infertility is SO much harder to deal with than anyone could imagine. This wasn't the plan. It's not fair. And yet among these sub-cultures of women, we are still competing.Who has more children? Who breastfeeds? Who feeds their children organic meals ONLY? Who has their kids in the best schools? Who's still the ""happiest?""By the time we've had our first, second, or third child, we are so depleted with failed expectations that we've left no room for forgiveness of ourselves, or each other.We've made life incredibly hard and will continue to do so by passing down the tradition of high expectations and maintaining high stress levels to our children. Because what we have been taught and continue to exemplify is the notion that if you're not stressed to the max or surpassing unrealistic expectations, than you're just not doing enough. This is our modern-day woman's mentality.I've never met more competitive natured beings than that of women. We're told to be a sisterhood, but instead we're ""frenemies."" We're told to build each other up, but instead we tear each other down. We're competing with each other and ourselves. When will we give each other a break? When will we give ourselves a break? Some days I wish I could have the simple mind of a man. Yes, I said it. Simple-minded, and I don't mean that in a negative tone. I mean it for exactly what it is. In most men's minds, things are simpler, easier, and less stressful. I long for that feeling.But I am a woman. That's not how I'm programmed. So what now? Well, now I look in the mirror and ask the hard questions. I separate the important from the unimportant; the real from the fake; the benefit of the doubt from the judgments, the love from the darkness. And I make a choice.It doesn't mean I won't be the same woman I was before with a competitive nature to boot, but I might be an improved, insightful, more aware version. Offering up a hand to the woman next to me, struggling, stressed out and expecting more from herself than what's fair. And in that moment I hope I'll lend my strength and my lessons to her. To help her, not compete with her.Because there is a difference.Originally published by Appetite for Honesty by Alison Chrun"

The day is also heart-warming to Sonny Grosso, a retired NYPD officer who became the youngest first grade detective on the force. For example, there's the annual Parade up 5th Ave, featuring NYPD officers in their finest uniforms, as well as stirring music from the Pipes and Drums of the Emerald Society of the NYPD. Sonny suggests that ""if you can't be roused by this pipe band, hello, check your pulse!"" Pipes and Drums band at St. Patrick's Day ParadeIt also brings back memories of Sonny's partner for many years on the police force, Det. Eddie Egan -- ""God rest his soul"" -- who with his bravery, bluster and blarney was the very essence of being Irish-American. Grosso, who grew up in Italian Harlem before his family moved to an Irish neighborhood, says that experience taught him an invaluable lesson about ""getting along with others."" To this day, Grosso's favorite movie is the Irish-themed John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara flick, The Quiet Man -- his second favorite is the Italian-themed The Godfather, on which he was a technical consultant to director Francis Ford Coppola.Historically, Irish-Americans have been a major factor in law and enforcement. At the turn of the 20th century, five out of six NYPD officers were Irish born immigrants or of Irish descent. As late as the 50s and 60s, when Grosso joined the force, 40% were Irish Americans. Even today, you can hear Irish brogues being spoken alongside Italian-American officers. But back to Egan and Grosso who proudly marched together in the St. Patrick's Day Parade. Calling the late Egan the bravest officer he ever met, Grosso describes their unique relationship when they would annually lead the NYPD with the most drug arrests, including the famous French Connection heroin case, the biggest drug bust in U.S.A. history:It's what the movies would call a bromance today. We were like a husband and wife -- we'd spend hours on end on stakeout, eating stale pizza and drinking cold coffee. Sometimes I wanted to kill the guy, and sometimes I wanted to kiss him. Egan was probably the most fearless officer I ever saw. There was never any standing back with him. He was a character, way out there but a great cop and very effective.Being Irish, Eddie's larger than life personality always liked to be on show. For example, he loved going undercover in wild disguises. In the first scene from The French Connection, the 5-time Oscar winning movie about Egan and Grosso's real-life exploits, Gene Hackman playing Egan's character (Popeye Doyle) is dressed as a drug-busting Santa. Sonny says Egan mastered disguises such as a deaf mute, hotdog vendor, a priest, and many others. Egan even hilariously got dressed up in drag, sometimes.  Sonny Grosso outside NYPD HQOne story from Grosso's upcoming memoir, Harlem to Hollywood: My Real to Reel Life, is about them going undercover to bust a happening dance club called the Palladium, where VIPs and celebrities would go to party and do illegal drugs:Egan could never dance Spanish but that didn't stop him dancing with the girls. All he could do was the Twist and he did it to any kind of music playing. If it was a Conga, he'd still dance the Twist. On this night, he said he'd meet me there and sure enough he came 'dressed' as a sailor! Several customers at the bar near me see him and say, 'There's that prick Egan.' They saw right through his disguise, I mean who the hell wears a sailor's suit at a hot dance club? The disguise lasted about a quarter of a second. But there's the luck that Egan and I had in a lot of things we did. All the people who were selling drugs moved to the other side of the dance hall because they knew where Egan was and they didn't want to be anywhere near him. So we sent all our undercover people to the other side where the dealers were. We effectively centralized them into one spot where they were easier to arrest.Tough as nails Det.

Danny led one of the most captivating lives in the latter half of the 20th century. At age 19, he dropped out of Harvard Law and falls in with the Warhol crowd. Edie Sedgwick is his roommate for two months. He accidentally applies to a ""pop"" magazine job and is whisked away into the world of pop music circa 1966. In his first issue as Managing Editor at Datebook Magazine, Danny publishes John Lennon's ""we're more popular than Jesus"" remarks on the front cover.

Her grandmother insisted! Like many, I had read about Danny Fields in Please Kill Me, No One Here Gets Out Alive, Edie; but thought it was impossible that this was the same guy traversing all these cool/elite scenes. Warhol wanted to ""tape Danny's life story,"" but would pass away just weeks later after writing that in his diary. In a brief email exchange Greil Marcus told me he ""only knew of Danny Fields by myth."" I'm beyond elated to have had the chance to uncover the story of rock 'n' roll's most mysterious punk.What was the best discovery during filmmaking?I literally have the keys to the apartment and crash on the couch as so many have done-- Iggy Pop, Jann Wenner, Joey Ramone. Going through Danny's archives for three years it got to a point where the jaw-drops started to hurt my face. I started to get unphased by all the greatness. Photographs, letters, flyers, taped phone conversations starting at '68 oh my! There's a reason why it was a no-brainer for the Yale Beinecke Library to acquire the archive. The best discovery was the tape of Lou Reed listening to the Ramones for the first time. Danny didn't know he had it. Just incredible to hear the rock 'n' roll torch being passed from one New York avant-savant to the next.

What matters is what you LIKE and why you like it. Artists, performers or anyone fabulous needs reassurance of their fabulousity. We're all so fragile.

And I asked them what difference their well-intended actions really make. First off, you might want to know who these do-gooders are. One is Veronica Kyle of Faith in Place in Chicago, who links stories of African-American migration to migration of the monarch butterfly, and inspires folks to plant milkweed in public spaces to ""welcome home"" the butterflies. Another is Robert Hughes, who for 20 years has spurred people in his native eastern Pennsylvania coalfields to plant trees along stream corridors, clean up illegally dumped trash, create community gardens at historic mining sites, restore trout fisheries, and otherwise reclaim communities impacted by coal mining and poverty. Anandi Premlall came down to our workshop from New York City, where she initiated efforts to convert a 3.5 mile disused rail line to what someday will be The QueensWay linear park and cultural greenway. And representing the Maryland Coastal Bays Program, Carrie Samis shared her work with Coastal Stewards -- youth, primarily from communities of color -- who plant native grasses to recreate ""soft shorelines"" that absorb run-off and protect beaches. Because these and others assembled in Annapolis care for nature and community, my Cornell University colleague Keith Tidball and I call them ""civic ecology stewards."" And we call their actions ""civic ecology practices.""  Rendering of The QueensWay. Image courtesy of WXY and Dland. To help understand what these actions mean beyond one community garden, one section along a stream or coastline, or one urban trail, I also invited university researchers to the workshop. I asked the stewards and the researchers to answer the question: Given the scale of the environmental and social problems we face, what difference do small restoration projects make? Here are some of the answers they came up with.Brandeis University sociologist Carmen Sirianni sees civic ecology practices as part of a larger civic renewal movement. He noted that the coalitions of stewardship organizations working together on watershed and other restoration projects build participants' civic capacity to engage in additional civic actions. And through forming partnerships with larger non-profits and government agencies, these efforts can influence local and sometimes regional or even national environmental policy. U.S. Forest Service social scientist Erika Svendsen researches how city-wide coalitions of stewardship organizations exchange ideas and resources through dynamic social networks. She has discovered that some organizations engaged in civic ecology practice -- like Greening of Detroit -- are particularly important nodes in these networks. They serve as ""bridging organizations"" bringing together groups working at different scales and in different places. They also serve as ""brokers,"" helping civil society, business, and government to hammer out agreements on use of open space in cities and elsewhere.Looking forward, Drew University professor of sociology of religion and environmental studies, Laurel Kearns, asked us not to forget the power of religious organizations engaged in civic ecology practices. Religions have shared value systems that incorporate justice, caring for one's neighbor, and caring for God's creation. Those who attend church, synagogues, temples and mosques may also share in practices around gardening and food, health and healing, and simply volunteering. And they often have the trust and social ties -- the social capital -- that is so needed for people to commit to collective action. Because of their critical role in ""delivering"" civic ecology practices, professor Kearns refers to religious organizations as the environmental stewardship movement's ""midwives.""And after listening to the stories of the civic ecology stewards, Emory University Professor of Environmental Sciences Lance Gunderson had this to say about the larger implications of their work. ""Ideas drive policy. Politicians follow ideas."" (And to prove Professor Gunderson's point, Senator Barbara Mikulski recently tweeted about the Maryland Coastal Stewards: ""Be sure to remind them that the @CoastalStewards have a champion on The Hill!"").Are small acts of caring for nature and community the answer to the larger social and environmental problems we face? No. But we don't know the answer. Civic ecology practices are one among many needed experiments. Such experiments -- or social innovations that arise from the ground up -- gain in importance when we don't know how to do things right. Because in integrating caring for community and nature, these and other ""do-gooder"" civic ecology stewards are, as Spike Lee said, ""Doing the right thing."""
22,BUSINESS,Has Instant Messaging Become More Annoying Than Email? 5 Steps for More Productive Pinging,"Karen Frankola, ContributorCommunications and change management consultant, author",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/has-instant-messaging-become-more-annoying-than-email-5-steps-for-more-productive-pinging_b_6815700.html,Instant messaging is probably the type of workplace communication that we put the least amount of thought into. But approaching it more mindfully will help improve the productivity of both you and your colleagues and ease the frustrations that come from mismatched communications.,2015-03-10,"Four business people working on laptop computers, close-up on hands",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb31cf22000003000001ff0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Fifteen years ago, I was asked to introduce instant messaging (IM) and other electronic collaboration tools to NBC's owned-and-operated television stations. Email was widely used at the time, but some station managers felt typing was beneath them. They would ask their secretaries to print out the emails they received so they could dictate their replies. How was I supposed to get these Mad Men dinosaurs to see the benefits of instant messaging?My first real success came when sales assistants at one station started messaging their bosses about who was calling in on another line. The sales numbers went up and soon other stations started using the tool.Instant messaging can aid workplace productivity -- a 2008 Ohio State University study found workers who used instant messaging reported less interruptions than colleagues who did not. But as the use of instant messaging grows, I worry that it's becoming even more disruptive than email.Since my time at NBC, I have worked or consulted for 10 different organizations, each with a different communications culture. But it seems that instant messaging is becoming the communications tool of choice for many large companies. Ask yourself -- how many work emails do you write on a typical day compared to the number of messages you send to your colleagues?Every day, I see countless examples of instant messaging not being used effectively. Using IM thoughtlessly can drive your co-workers crazy and make it more difficult to get the information you need. Here are five strategies for pinging more effectively.1. State your status and respect the status of others. I love when my colleagues are transparent about their IM status. They're not afraid to say they're unavailable because they're out running an errand or snowed under with a project. But unfortunately, at many companies, it's considered slacking if you're not instantly available for 10 or 12 hours a day. So people just show themselves as constantly available except when they're in meetings. Whenever possible, put yourself on ""do not disturb"" or ""on deadline"" or ""thinking!"" when you don't want to be interrupted. If you're lucky enough to work at a company that values you according to results rather than time spent in front of a screen, tell your colleagues when you're not actually working.And of course, don't ping people if they describe themselves as unavailable. I have had more than one supervisor pay absolutely no attention to my ""do not disturb,"" but most colleagues will honor your request if you don't use it constantly.2. If it's likely you'll need to exchange more than three or four messages, consider another communications tool. How many times have you gotten sucked into an IM exchange that lasts 10 or 15 minutes? You try to keep working in between the interruptions, but it's nearly impossible. The next time you want to contact a colleague, don't automatically ping them -- think about which tool is best for your needs.Use email if your communication is detailed, involves more than one topic, includes several recipients, if it's important to keep a record of it, and/or if it's likely to be forwarded. Or perhaps you actually need to talk to someone. Send an instant message asking if the person is available for a phone call or even a face-to-face visit. And if you've gotten yourself into a long-winded IM exchange, don't be afraid to ask if you can switch to a phone call.Don't forget about ""pull"" communications, which are much less disruptive that ""push"" communications like email and instant messaging. Do you really have to send a weekly status report to your project team or can you just post it on a collaboration site where they can ""pull"" the information they need?3. Ask teammates how they like to use instant messaging.  When I worked at Deloitte, the graphic artists on our team loved to IM all day long. But the writers found it much more disruptive. I strongly believe every workplace would be much more productive if we asked our teammates what their communication preferences are. For example, my preferred workplace communication tool is email because I turn off the automatic notification and try to check it between tasks, rather than constantly responding.Of course, if one of your teammates uses IM almost exclusively, you already know that's his preference. But what if your preference is email? Have a conversation about it. Tell your colleague why you prefer other tools and perhaps he might start using them with you.I have found that people who don't consider themselves strong writers or are communicating in a second language often prefer IM. They don't have to worry about grammar, spelling or sentence construction. If this seems to be the case, you could tell your colleague that you prefer emails for matters that don't require an immediate response, and his writing doesn't need to be any more polished than an instant message.4. If you have a short question or request, include it in your initial instant message. It's supposed to be good IM etiquette to make your initial message along the lines of ""Hi there"" or ""Hey?"" The idea is that you're knocking on a person's door rather than barging in. But I find empty messages annoying. The initial IM takes my attention away from whatever I'm doing, regardless of whether I respond or not. I have to waste time reading a message that conveys no information, then I have to write back some kind of acknowledgement, and then I have to wait for the person to type out what she wants. If she had just sent me her question in the first place, I could have quickly responded, instead of waiting for her to get her thoughts together.Some people may skip their request in the initial IM out of politeness, but I think many do it because they don't want to waste their time in case I'm not available. Start writing your request in your initial email to close colleagues and ask them to do the same. I guarantee this will save you both time and frustration. 5. Make the most of your system's features. Instant message technology is evolving rapidly. You are probably able to easily invite more colleagues into the conversation, share your screen or switch to a phone call. Making your chat more robust will often improve it. If you don't know all the features of your company's IM system, spend an hour or two studying it, and then coach your colleagues.Instant messaging is probably the type of workplace communication that we put the least amount of thought into. But approaching it more mindfully will help improve the productivity of both you and your colleagues and ease the frustrations that come from mismatched communications."
