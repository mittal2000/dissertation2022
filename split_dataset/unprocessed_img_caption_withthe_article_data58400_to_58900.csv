0,POLITICS,Lots Of Republicans Think Denying Trump The Nomination Would Be Unfair,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lots-of-republicans-think-denying-trump-the-nomination-would-be-unfair_us_572021b9e4b01a5ebde3f513,GOP voters want the candidate with the most votes to win.,2016-04-27,"Republican U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump shows the delegates list for the Pennsylvania state primary election during a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, on Monday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/572023661900002e0056c4e1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump's sweep of five state primaries Tuesday night wasn't enough for him to actually clinch the nomination. But it was enough for him to declare himself the GOP's ""presumptive nominee,"" and it may be more than sufficient to convince Republican voters that, as the party's clear front-runner, he deserves to be its standard-bearer.Trump remains as gleefully divisive a figure as ever. But in a primary dominated by voters who feel disenfranchised and betrayed by their party, it's hard to envision anything more likely to engender backlash than Republican leaders deciding to nominate someone who's won fewer votes than Trump -- or none at all -- based on the vagaries of delegate math.About two-thirds of Connecticut and Maryland primary voters think that the candidate who gets the most votes should win the nomination, even if that candidate fails to reach the 1,237-delegate majority needed to win outright, according to preliminary exit polls. Seventy percent of primary voters in Pennsylvania feel the same. ""If there's a chance that Trump goes in with the most, and Cruz comes out with the nomination, I don't think that's fair,"" one Pittsburgh voter said to wide agreement last week in a focus group of Republican women. ""I would feel totally misled,"" another chimed in. ""I would not even want to participate. What is the point of us going to vote, exactly?""Trump nodded to that argument in his victory speech Tuesday night. ""You know what's going to happen?"" he said, imagining a scenario in which he's not the nominee. ""Those people, at a minimum, are going to be very upset, very angry. But at a minimum, they are just not going to vote.""The sense that the leading candidate should win the nomination isn't solely a self-serving argument from his supporters. In Wisconsin, where Cruz scored a significant victory, voters said by a 12-point margin that the leading candidate, rather than the ""best candidate,"" should get the nod. Nationwide, Republican voters say by a 50-point margin that it would be bad for the party to choose an alternate nominee. Many Republicans believe Trump is the best candidate, if only by the process of elimination. A March HuffPost/YouGov poll found that more than 40 percent of Republican voters would be dissatisfied or angry to see Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Ohio Gov. John Kasich or another candidate picked as the nominee. While Cruz garnered the least resistance, a majority of his party now views both him and Kasich as establishment candidates, a label they don't mean as a compliment.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

Did you get on your knees daily? Do his eyes close like doors? Are you a slave to the back of his hand?"" before adding, ""Am I talking about your husband or your father?""The music mogul decided to clear the air by sharing whether he thought his eldest daughter's references on the album were about him on Monday night’s episode of Sirius XM’s ""Make It Plain"" radio show.""I don't know, but I don’t think so.

So she's never been a slave to the back of my hand, because I didn't believe in that,"" he said before host Mark Thompson clarified that the singer was directing the question to her mother.""There’s no way we can get in the mind of Beyoncé. Only Beyoncé can answer specifically who she was talking to. If we say, she was talking, yes or no, it would just be speculation. And so, I'd rather not get into speculation.

I could only speak of being a proud father.""Knowles went on to express his enthusiasm as a parent by declaring that she ""pushed the envelope of creativity"" on the HBO special. He added that he was happy that she had brought awareness to a number of issues including Black Lives Matter, marital discord and the many challenges people often face within the black community.When asked by Thompson if he'd spoken to the Grammy Award winner since the video's release, Knowles gave the following response:""The media would have you think I've never spoke to Beyoncé. But as you can see in the documentary, me and Blue Ivy was playing,"" he said. ""I'm a grownup. I'm 64 years old. It doesn't bother me what people say about me. I know the facts.

No, I have not spoken to Beyoncé this week, but do I talk to her, do I see her, yes.”Listen to Mathew Knowles’ Sirius XM interview in its entirety below."

Seaman(Reuters Health) - People who occasionally work night shifts may be at a slightly increased risk of heart disease, according to a new study.Nurses in the study who worked at least three nights per month were more likely to develop heart problems over the next 24 years than nurses who stuck to daytime shifts.""I think it’s an important message because it’s a potentially modifiable risk factor,"" said lead author Celine Vetter, of Harvard Medical School andBrigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.For the new study, Vetter and her colleagues used data from more than 189,000 women. About 40 percent were participating in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), which began in 1988. The others were in NHS2, which began in 1989.The women entered the studies between the ages of 25 and 55. At the start, none of them had coronary heart disease, which is when the arteries that carry blood to heart muscle become narrowed or blocked.NHS participants were only asked once about their history of working night shifts, but NHS2 participants were asked about their night shifts every two years.During the follow-up period, there were 7,303 cases of coronary heart disease problems - like heart attacks, chest pain and bypass surgeries - in the NHS study and 3,519 cases in the NHS2.Overall, the risk went up with the number of years women spent covering night shifts, the researchers report in JAMA.Compared to the risk for nurses in NHS2 who didn't work night shifts, the risk of coronary heart disease was 12 percent higher in nurses who worked night shifts for less than five years, 19 percent higher in those who worked night shifts for five to nine years, and 27 percent higher in nurses who worked nights for at least 10 years.But the risk of coronary heart disease came back down as women quit working night shifts or retired, the researchers found.For example, women in NHS with at least 10 years of rotating night shifts had a 27 percent increased risk of coronary heart disease during the first half of the follow-up period, but only a 10 percent increased risk during the second half of the follow-up period.The study can't explain the association, but Vetter said it could be related to increased inflammation in the body and social disruption. She also said the findings may apply to people who work early morning shifts since they have to get up during the night.Once researchers have more data, Vetter said, they will be able to design healthy work schedules.""Hopefully we can design schedules that are healthier for the individual,"" she said.SOURCE: http://bit.ly/1T2XrW0 JAMA, online April 26, 2016."

Joe Sestak in the Pennsylvania Democratic primary to determine who will challenge Republican Pat Toomey for his Senate seat in November.McGinty, who served as chief of staff to Gov. Tom Wolf (D), received a rare endorsement from President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, who do not usually proclaim sides in Democratic races. Biden campaigned with McGinty in Philadelphia this week.McGinty also defeated John Fetterman, the mayor of Braddock, Pennsylvania, who faced off with the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee during his campaign.The DSCC and Emily's List spent heavily in the race, investing at least $4 million to back McGinty, who spent an additional $3 million of her own money. Sestak spent $3 million in the race, while Fetterman spent around $600,000.Polls had McGinty closing the gap amid all that spending, after Sestak had led most of the way. The last public polls had them tied, with Fetterman trailing far behind.Democrats see Toomey's seat as one they can pick up in November.McGinty wound up winning with 43 percent of the vote, against 33 percent for Sestak and 19 percent for Fetterman, despite the large spending advantage.Fetterman noted the money disparity in conceding the contest.""I refuse to accept the premise that fundraising is the most important qualification for running and holding office,"" Fetterman said. ""Politics should be a competition of ideas and experience. Instead it’s become the world’s most dysfunctional telethon.""While McGinty will carry the party's banner in the fall, Fetterman took heart in out-performing the polls and the party's financial advantage.""We have started a progressive movement here in Pennsylvania. It’s not going away. We’re not going away. This isn’t over. This is not how our story ends,"" he said.This Story was updated to include final results and comments from Fetterman.Michael McAuliff contributed reporting."

Alex Parker, a planetary astronomer at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, told National Geographic that when he glimpsed the object during an analysis of Hubble observations back in April 2015, he assumed it wasn't the first time someone had spied the moonlet.Instead, Parker quickly learned he'd discovered a moon 1,300 times fainter than its host dwarf planet. As Hubble notes in its announcement, several previous visual sweeps of MK2 showed a lonely mass, one of several dwarf planets located in the Kuiper Belt -- a region of icy bodies beyond Neptune's orbit. The team of scientists ultimately observed MK2 thanks to Hubble's ""unique ability to see faint objects near bright ones,"" it said.""It is a very exciting discovery!"" Parker, who led the image analysis for the observations, told The Associated Press. ""It means that Makemake is no longer the odd-one-out in the moon-hosting Kuiper Belt dwarf planet club.""Makemake, named after the god of fertility in the Rapa Nui mythology of Easter Island, is 870 miles wide and takes roughly 310 Earth-years to circle the sun. In comparison, the newly discovered moon has a diameter of about 100 miles.Parker said in a statement that the discovery will provide researchers ""an opportunity to study Makemake in far greater detail,"" perhaps answering questions about the mass, origin and evolution of the dwarf-planet system."

Dozens of these corporations also had a hand in electing the very Republican majority that passed the legislation they now abhor.At least 45 corporations denouncing North Carolina’s anti-LGBT law have contributed to a group called the Republican State Leadership Committee. The group, which can receive direct corporate contributions, works to elect Republican state legislatures across the country. It played a big part in helping to elect North Carolina’s legislative majority in 2010 and has pumped at least $1.6 million into the state’s legislative elections from 2010 through 2015.Dozens more corporations contributed indirectly to these electoral efforts through their contributions to trade associations -- like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce or the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America -- that donated to the RSLC.The RSLC, formed in 2002 to elect Republicans at the state level, was invigorated in 2010 by the leadership of former Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie. He nationalized the group’s fundraising base with a goal of flipping state legislatures so that his party could control the congressional redistricting process. Gillespie’s strategy took advantage of the new campaign finance rules created by the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision earlier that year allowing the group to funnel corporate funds into state races.The effort was a massive success. Republicans flipped 21 chambers and won complete control of 25 state legislatures in 2010. The party’s dominance at the state level continues today. In 2014, the RSLC helped to flip another nine chambers to Republican control.In North Carolina, the RSLC sent $1.25 million to a group called Real Jobs NC in 2010. This spending was instrumental in electing the state’s current Republican majority.This success has not only opened up an outpouring of pro-business legislation across the country gutting labor rights, preventing increases in the minimum wage, undermining environmental regulation and protecting corporate profits, but also launched a proliferation of anti-LGBT legislation both introduced and passed through legislatures.“Companies make a great deal today about corporate citizenship, about being good citizens, about following their values and the thing is, they don’t in their spending,” said Bruce Freed, president of the Center for Political Accountability, a nonprofit advocating for greater corporate transparency.The 45 corporations that sent money to the RSLC and also voiced opposition to the laws the legislators that money helped elect include some of the biggest names in corporate America. They include Citigroup, General Electric, Monsanto, Hewlett-Packard, Google, Wells Fargo, Yahoo, Microsoft, Bank of America and Cisco Systems. Many more fund trade associations that give money to the RSLC.Over 30 of the companies that contributed to the RSLC also signed on to a letter sent to North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) opposing the anti-LGBT law. The letter was organized by the LGBT rights groups Human Rights Campaign and Equality NC.“Discrimination is wrong, and we believe it has no place in North Carolina or anywhere in our country,” the letter reads. “As companies that pride ourselves on being inclusive and welcoming to all, we strongly urge you and the leadership of North Carolina’s legislature to repeal this law in the upcoming legislative session.”Companies with executives who signed the letter and also contributed to the RSLC include Google, Yahoo, Uber, Lyft, Pandora, Citigroup, Microsoft, eBay, General Electric, Oracle, Time Warner Cable, American Express and Twitter.In addition to speaking out on North Carolina's anti-LGBT law, many of these companies have also vocally opposed similar legislation in Georgia, Missouri, South Dakota and Tennessee.Those companies that oppose the legislation and also made past or recent contributions to the RSLC gave a variety of responses when asked about the apparent conflict. Some explained they needed to donate to political groups to protect their own interests while others fairly noted that their contributions to the RSLC were actually directed to non-legislative elections.A statement from Time Warner Cable, which contributed $310,175 to the RSLC since 2009, said, “As a highly regulated business, we support a variety of political candidates that we believe will promote a level playing field and protect TWC from burdensome, unnecessary regulation. As for North Carolina’s HB2 law and legislation similar to it, we find that they are not only bad for business but also run counter to our core values of diversity and inclusion. That is why we have added our voice to the many others who agree it should be repealed.”“As a global company, it’s imperative that we have strong relationships with elected officials that span party-lines, as they work with us to create positive business outcomes around the world,” said a statement from Hewlett-Packard, which has donated $428,365 to the RSLC since 2009. “We stand firmly by our opposition to HB2 and by our non-discrimination policy.”Cisco Systems, which gave $50,000 to the RSLC in September, says that the company “has maintained memberships in associations for many years. Our involvement has never been about any specific party or candidate. We use our memberships to educate members on issues of importance to the tech industry and we request our funds be directed towards non-political purposes.”Some of the companies explained that their contributions were earmarked to be spent on attorney general races and not on legislative elections. Until 2014, the RSLC contained within it the Republican Attorneys General Association. The two groups split in 2014 and many of the companies that had been contributing to RAGA through the RSLC ceased their contributions to the latter.Lowe’s Companies stated that their contributions went to RAGA and not RSLC. The company also added in a statement that it takes ""a holistic look rather than at single issues” when determining which candidates and organizations to support.Facebook, Capital One and Yelp all also said that their contributions to RSLC were actually to RAGA. Their contributions to RSLC ceased once RAGA split off to be its own entity.And then some companies stated that their contributions were not meant to be converted into political expenditures. Instead, they offered in-kind donations or contributed to the RSLC’s administrative account.The $3,514 donated to the RSLC by Uber was in the form of an in-kind contribution of travel for conferences. “While we will not always agree with every policymaker on every issue, Uber will continue to engage with leaders on both sides of the aisle about how to best to connect riders and drivers and move the on-demand economy forward,” a corporate statement read.Citigroup states that its approximately $940,000 in contributions to the RSLC went to the group’s administrative account and were not to be used for electoral purposes.""We are proud of our track record, which includes standing with groups like the Human Rights Campaign to oppose House Bill 2,"" Citigroup spokesman Kamran Mumtaz said in a statement. ""The Citi PAC has not made any contributions this cycle to members of the North Carolina state legislature.""For at least one company, North Carolina’s anti-LGBT legislation is a cause to re-examine which groups it should be funding.According to a Microsoft spokesman, “We weigh a number of factors in making political contribution decisions, and will consider this and other issues in making future contribution decisions.”"

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina greet each other after Fiorina endorsed Cruz at a campaign rally in Miami, March 9, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5720ea6a160000e90031cd5e.jpeg?cache=KKR8Uo36vu&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Presidential hopeful Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) intends to name former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina as his vice presidential running mate if he succeeds in winning the GOP nomination, multiple sources reported Wednesday.Cruz's move is seen as a last-minute gambit in hopes of shaking up the race and blocking front-runner Donald Trump, who easily swept five primary states across the Northeast on Tuesday.Fiorina, who herself ran for president as a Republican earlier this cycle before suspending her campaign and endorsing Cruz, has been a visible surrogate for the Texas conservative on the campaign trail. She has targeted former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential front-runner, often trotting out topics, like former President Bill Clinton's extramarital affairs, that Cruz himself has not mentioned.Fiorina was spotted in Indianapolis on Wednesday, hours before a scheduled Cruz campaign rally there.Cruz campaign manager Jeff Roe earlier this week sought to snuff out speculation about a possible vice presidential pick, tweeting that the campaign had simply ""narrowed"" things down to a short list. Cruz followed suit, stating that his campaign had just begun the process of vetting potential candidates. A serious vetting process, however, involves months of work to properly scrutinize a candidate's history and background in preparation for the general election.Gary Aminoff, a member of Cruz's California ""leadership team,"" tweeted on Wednesday that the senator was tapping Fiorina as his running mate. Josh McElveen, political director at WMUR, a New Hampshire news organization, also tweeted Wednesday that ""sources confirm"" Cruz intends to run alongside Fiorina if he gets the party's nod. Politico reported the information shortly after.The timing of the news, a day after more resounding primary victories for Trump, suggests a last-ditch effort to wrest the narrative from the real estate mogul ahead of the Indiana primary. The May 3 contest is seen as one of the final opportunities to deny Trump the delegates he needs to secure the nomination.It remains to be seen whether Fiorina, a California businesswoman who already failed once to win over GOP primary voters, can tip the scales enough for Cruz to dominate in Indiana and secure most or all of its 57 delegates. Trump has committed major resources and campaign staff there, reflecting the significance of the primary. A recent CBS/YouGov poll showed Trump leading Cruz by five points, 40 percent to 35 percent. Fiorina, who has never held public office, badly lost in 2010 to Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) in a Senate race after a barrage of negative press due to her role at the helm of tech giant HP, from which she was fired in 2005. During her tenure at the company, HP laid off nearly 30,000 employees and stock prices fell some 42 percent.Last year, while still a candidate for the GOP nomination, Fiorina sparred with Trump after he mocked her physical appearance. She has also gone after Trump for mocking a reporter with a congenital joint condition.Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, expressed skepticism about Fiorina's ability to sway votes for Cruz.""While she made some waves early in the campaign, Fiorina never developed a strong following that would give an electoral boost to the Cruz campaign,"" Murray said in a statement Wednesday, noting Fiorina's low favorability ratings.“This pick is an attempt to mute Trump’s appeal to voters who want a political outsider, but it is unlikely to have much impact,"" he went on. ""Republican voters already have an outsider candidate they like. This will help Cruz dominate a couple of news cycles before next week’s make-or-break primary in Indiana, but it is likely to have a limited impact on swaying voters or, more importantly, convention delegates.”UPDATE: 5:00 p.m. -- Cruz formally announced his selection of Fiorina at the Indianapolis rally on Wednesday.""After a great deal of time and thought, after a great deal of consideration and prayer, I have come to the conclusion that If I am nominated to be president of the United States, I will run on a ticket with my vice presidential nominee, Carly Fiorina,"" the senator said.He went on to praise Fiorina for her principles, her business record and her Texas upbringing.Fiorina, in turn, lauded Cruz as a ""constitutional conservative who has made enemies in both parties standing up to the bipartisan corruption in Washington."" She also attacked her running mate's foes, saying: ""Hillary Clinton has made her millions selling access and influence from inside the system. Donald Trump made billions buying people like Hillary Clinton. They're not going to challenge the system -- they are the system.""The businesswoman even made an attempt to brighten Cruz's image by singing to Cruz's daughters from the stage and attesting that the senator was a ""heckuva lot of fun."" This story has been updated with Murray's remarks and information about Cruz and Fiorina's announcement."

Chris Van Hollen, long considered a rising star, won Maryland’s Democratic Senate primary on Tuesday.In the heavily blue state, the 57-year-old congressman is expected to triumph again in November, taking over the Senate seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D).Van Hollen and his House colleague Rep. Donna Edwards dominated the crowded primary race, one of the most heated Democratic contests in the nation. Emily's List, which endorsed Edwards, accused Van Hollen of going after its donors. Even the White House stepped in at one point and demanded that a gun control ad from a super PAC supporting Edwards be taken down, calling it ""misleading.""With few differences between the two front-runners, the contest became a clash of personalities. Edwards was cast as a grassroots progressive who would been just the second African-American woman ever to serve in the U.S. Senate. But Van Hollen was the more experienced legislator who had the backing of the Democratic establishment. He raised significantly more money than Edwards during the campaign.Van Hollen paid his dues in Maryland’s state capital before ascending the ranks in Washington’s Democratic leadership. He served four years in the Maryland House of Delegates and eight years in the Maryland Senate, and then he was elected to the U.S. House in 2002.He has been a close ally of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who appointed Van Hollen to recruit Democratic candidates in 2006 and lead House campaign efforts for the next two elections. Currently, he is the Democrats' top member on the Budget Committee.In March, The Washington Post endorsed Van Hollen, calling him ""pragmatic, detail-oriented, agile” and a “bona fide budget expert.”Heading into Tuesday’s primary, Van Hollen was leading Edwards by 11.5 points, according to HuffPost Pollster, which averages the publicly available polling in the race. On Monday, former Maryland governor and Democratic presidential candidate Martin O’Malley endorsed Van Hollen in an email to his supporters, praising Van Hollen as a leader on issues such as education, the environment and gun control.The seventh-term congressman represents Maryland’s 8th District, which extends from affluent Montgomery County directly north of Washington to the Pennsylvania border.Maryland hasn’t elected a Republican to the U.S. Senate since 1980, although the state has chosen two GOP governors in the 21st century."
10,POLITICS,Convicted Gov. Bob McDonnell May Just Convince The Supreme Court He's Innocent,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bob-mcdonnell-supreme-court_us_571face5e4b0b49df6a945e8,The former Virginia governor's appeal could redefine the rules of government corruption.,2016-04-27,Justice Stephen Breyer played a lead role in trying to define limits of anti-corruption laws in the case of former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57210a3a1900002e0056c610.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Rarely, if ever, does a felon appealing his federal conviction get to set foot inside the U.S. Supreme Court.Bob McDonnell, the former governor of Virginia, broke that general rule on Wednesday as he sat in the courtroom for oral arguments in a case that could not only reverse his multiple convictions on corruption charges, but also redefine what counts as government corruption under federal law.Luck has been on his side since the outset of his appeal. And now, even without the late Justice Antonin Scalia on the bench, McDonnell may be able to convince a majority of the justices that he didn't do anything wrong -- and that he shouldn't spend two years in prison for accepting lavish gifts and loans from a businessman while he was governor. This and other acts, his lawyer argued, is conduct that politicians engage in on a daily basis. Should the government get to punish every single instance of it?""Every day of the week, politicians write letters on behalf of citizens,"" said a concerned Justice Stephen Breyer. He took the lead in searching for a bright line between the kind of conduct that qualifies as true corruption and the kind that doesn't.Are those everyday acts by politicians, as a whole, ""a crime?"" Breyer asked, naturally informed by his lifetime of experience in all three branches of the federal government. ""My goodness.""Breyer, and maybe the court as a whole, may have an interest in issuing an opinion as narrow as possible -- one that upholds the government's power to prosecute actual corruption, but also one that brings clarity to the law as written, which seems to cast a wide net over acts that in McDonnell's view are ordinary politics.Because the McDonnell case involves the interpretation of federal anti-corruption laws, which use the word ""official acts,"" the Supreme Court's chief role is determining exactly what that means. If the court comes up with too broad a reading of that phrase, prosecutors could have virtually limitless power to go after even mundane activities -- like a lawmaker who makes a phone call on behalf of her constituent, or an official who arranges a meeting with donors to hear their concerns. But too narrow an interpretation may render the law toothless and make it harder to go after subtler but no less egregious acts of corruption.The justices pondered long and hard at what constitutes an illegal ""quid pro quo"" -- donations and courtesies people extend to elected officials in exchange for political favors. Is it the size of the ""quid"" that matters for prosecutors or the ""quo"" that politicians offer in return?""What's the lower limit, in the government's opinion, for the quid?"" asked Breyer. He wondered if $10,000, or perhaps ""an evening of trout fishing,"" might be sufficient for the kind of gift that might lead to a criminal prosecution. Justice Samuel Alito, for his part, noted that ""gaining access by making campaign contributions is an everyday occurrence,"" which indeed may be ""a bad thing."" But this, he said, is ""very widespread,"" suggesting that in itself it may not be criminal.Chief Justice John Roberts pointed to a legal brief filed by a broad coalition of government lawyers under both Republican and Democratic presidents, all of whom sided with McDonnell and cautioned against the pitfalls of an expansive definition of ""official acts"" -- which they said might ""cripple"" elected officials' role in a representative democracy.""I think it's extraordinary that those people agree on anything,"" Roberts mused, to laughter from the courtroom. ""To agree on something as sensitive as this and to be willing to put their names on something that says this ­­cannot be prosecuted conduct -- I think it's extraordinary.""McDonnell's acts didn't involve campaign donations in the traditional sense. Instead, what he and his wife, Maureen, received were lavish gifts, dinners and shopping sprees from Jonnie Williams, a pharmaceutical impresario who wanted to seek research assistance and approval from the state for his company's dietary supplements.The federal government's lawyer, Michael Dreeben, argued that Williams' niceties -- and the governor's tactics -- in turn led to a subsequent indictment and public trial where a jury duly convicted him.Justice Sonia Sotomayor, putting McDonnell's acts in stark terms, pointed to evidence that there were public servants at Virginia research institutions who ""felt pressured"" by the governor's involvement with Williams and his business interests. ""They were honorable people, obviously,"" Sotomayor said. ""But the point is, what do we do with the fact that they perceived that he was trying to influence them?""She was one of the few justices who seemed sympathetic to the government's side. Her colleagues, by and large, appeared to go the other way.""Where can we find, in your view, the definition of an 'official act?'"" asked Justice Anthony Kennedy, later adding that he failed to see ""the limiting principle"" for the government's theory for carrying out these prosecutions.Breyer seemed troubled by the implication that the government wants to remove all limitations on the ""quo"" side -- what officials do -- and what that may mean for future prosecutions.""My problem is the criminal law as the weapon to cure"" dishonest behavior, Breyer said. He warned that stretching the law's reach will mean that ""political figures will not know what they're supposed to do and what they're not supposed to do.""The Constitution, in principle, guards against laws that are too vague. But Breyer also worried about another fundamental constitutional problem: an unbound Department of Justice as “the ultimate arbiter of how public officials are behaving in the United States — state, local, and national.”""Now, suddenly, to give that kind of power to a criminal prosecutor, who is virtually uncontrollable, is dangerous in the separation of powers,"" he said.At a time when the Supreme Court is caught in the crossfire of politics over the confirmation battle to replace Scalia, maybe its members will heed Breyer's words and find a way to rule as sensibly as possible -- while understanding that the public doesn't take kindly to politicians who abuse the power of their office.A decision in McDonnell v. United States is expected sometime before the end of June."

Views of the sensitive pages rapidly fell back to 2.2 million a month in the next two months and later dipped under 2.0 million before stabilizing below 2.5 million 14 months later, Penney found.The traffic dropped even more to topics that survey respondents deemed especially privacy-sensitive. Viewership of a presumably “safer” group of articles about U.S. government security forces decreased much less in the same period.Penney's results, subjected to peer-review, offer a deeper dive into an issue investigated by previous researchers, including some who found a 5.0 percent drop in Google searches for sensitive terms immediately after June 2013. Other surveys have found sharply increased use of privacy-protecting Web browsers and communications tools.Penney’s work may provide fodder for technology companies and others arguing for greater restraint and disclosure about intelligence-gathering. Chilling effects are notoriously difficult to document and so have limited impact on laws and court rulings.More immediately, the research could aid a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of Wikipedia’s nonprofit parent organization and other groups against the NSA and the Justice Department.The year-old suit argues that intelligence collection from backbone Internet traffic carriers violated the Fourth Amendment ban on unreasonable searches."
12,POLITICS,This Town Denied It Had A Lead Problem. Now The EPA's Telling It To Give Out Bottled Water.,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/galesburg-illinois-lead-water_us_5720cabfe4b0b49df6a9b703,"Galesburg, Illinois, is one of many towns where lead pipes are contaminating the drinking water.",2016-04-27,"In this photo from March 9, 2016, rain falls on one of the homes where recent testing revealed lead levels far above the federal action level in Galesburg, Illinois. (AP Photo/Seth Perlman)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The mayor of Galesburg, Illinois, has insisted that his town doesn't have a problem with lead pipes like the one in Flint, Michigan, that's prompted national outcry for the past six months. Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.) spoke out about Galesburg's lead levels following Associated Press reports about high levels of the dangerous poison both in Galesburg's water and its children's blood. Mayor John Pritchard didn't appreciate what Bustos was doing.“I am certain that Congresswoman Bustos is convinced that she’s acting on behalf of us here, but we’re not Flint, Michigan,” Pritchard said last week. Unfortunately for Galesburg, any town with lead pipes can have lead-contaminated drinking water, just like Flint. Galesburg, a city of 30,000 in western Illinois, has thousands of lead pipes.Now, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is urging Galesburg to provide bottled water and filters to any homes where tap water samples exceeded the federal lead standard of 15 parts per billion. On Tuesday, Bustos' office released an April 20 letter from an EPA official detailing the need for bottled water and more public information about the risks of lead exposure from water. ""I see that as calling for immediate action,"" Bustos told HuffPost in an interview. ""U.S. EPA has asked the state of Illinois to work with Galesburg to quickly address the city’s lead in drinking water problem,"" an EPA spokesman said in an email. On Wednesday, the city of Galesburg said on its website it would comply with the EPA's recommendations to provide free water testing and filters. The agency's firm response suggests it is willing to be more aggressive than it was during the Flint water crisis. As evidence of Flint's water problems mounted last year, the agency shied away from public statements that might have contradicted assurances from local authorities that the water was safe.  Pritchard didn't respond to multiple requests for an interview. In a story noting that high lead levels are common in municipalities across the country, the AP reported earlier this month that Galesburg has exceeded the federal lead standard in 22 out of 30 sampling periods since 1992, shortly after new federal rules took effect. Last year, 10 percent of water samples taken from Galesburg homes had more than 22 parts per billion lead. If more than 10 precent of homes are above the federal standard of 15 parts per billion, local agencies are supposed to fix the problem and inform residents of the potential danger.The deadly poison is turning up in kids' blood, too. More than 14 percent of children tested for lead in Knox county had elevated blood lead levels in 2014, state data show. It's not clear if Galesburg's water is driving the data; testing hasn't been done to determine whether the blood lead owes to drinking water instead of paint or dust, which are more common sources of exposure. Galesburg's water issues aren't unusual, since anywhere from 6 to 10 million American homes across the country get water from lead service lines. Rather than replacing the risky pipes, national policy is to treat the water with chemicals that form a protective coating on the inside of the pipes, something Galesburg is doing.In a Saturday op-ed, Pritchard said the city has strived to provide public notice of all water issues and that it has remained in compliance with federal drinking water standards for lead. It's an assurance leaders in many other cities have offered in the wake of Flint. The only problem with it is that Flint, too, had been in compliance with federal drinking water standards for lead. After the AP's reporting brought new attention to Galesburg's lead issues, Bustos met with city leaders, published an op-ed and contacted the EPA. But she's come to think of lead water pipes as a national problem, not just a Flint or Galesburg one. ""Knowing that lead and water should never go together, they absolutely should not be in the same place at the same time, and especially when the end result is that it goes into a human being's body -- we've got to address this at a national level,"" Bustos said.This story has been updated to reflect Galesburg's Wednesday announcement and to include comment from the EPA."

Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump and Ohio Gov. John Kasich spoke out against the provisions. Major businesses pulled out of the state, entertainers have canceled shows and the NBA is considering moving the 2017 All-Star Game out of Charlotte.On April 25, just over a month after North Carolina Gov.

Prior to the vote, committee members were sent another letter in support of the bill. This letter came from Phillip Ellender, president of Koch Public Sector, the official lobbying and PR arm of the Koch brothers.PREVIOUSLY:WASHINGTON -- Republicans in Congress are trying to decrease the already scant amount of disclosure for politically-active nonprofits -- known as dark money groups. The legislative effort is unsurprisingly supported by the main political arm of the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch.Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.) is expected to introduce a bill in the Ways and Means Committee that would eliminate the requirement for nonprofits to make a non-public disclosure of their donors to the IRS when they file their annual tax forms. The donor disclosures -- known as the Schedule B report -- are not released to the public, but the list of donation amounts with the donor names redacted are released.The bill is supported by Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, the dark money donor hub run by the Koch brothers. The Kochs operate a vast political empire that mostly operates through nonprofit organizations that do not disclose their donations.“This bill is an important first step toward reaffirming Americans’ right to free speech while protecting them from threats and intimidation because of their personal beliefs,” Mark Holden, Freedom Partners chairman and lead lobbyist for Koch Industries, said in a statement.Roskam’s legislation comes amid a court case involving the donor list of another Koch brothers outfit, Americans for Prosperity Foundation. California attorney general Kamala Harris had sought the donor list of the organization for non-public review to ensure that it was abiding by California laws. A federal court, however, agreed on April 21 with Americans for Prosperity Foundation’s argument that this was a violation of its First Amendment rights.Campaign finance reform and transparency proponents issued a letter calling on members of the Ways and Means Committee to oppose Roskam’s bill. Those backing the letter include Brennan Center for Justice, Campaign Legal Center, Common Cause, CREW, Democracy 21, Public Citizen, Sunlight Foundation and Rootstrikers.“Eliminating the existing requirement for disclosure to the IRS of donations to 501(c)(4) “social welfare” groups would open the door wide for secret, unaccountable money from foreign governments, foreign corporations and foreign individuals to be illegally laundered into federal elections through 501(c)(4) groups,” the letter reads."

And you know what they say about men with small hands.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5720d4021900002d0056c575.jpeg?ops=crop_0_63_3000_1697%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump previewed his general election attacks against Hillary Clinton on Tuesday night, accusing the Democratic hopeful of playing up her gender in order to win. ""If Hillary Clinton were a man, I don't think she'd get 5 percent of the vote,"" Trump said at a New York press conference after winning five states. ""The only thing she's got going is the woman's card, and the beautiful thing is, women don't like her. And look how well I did with women tonight.""Actually, the vast majority of women don't like Trump -- a fact already giving Republicans heartburn as they deal with the possibility that he will be their nominee in the general election. A recent Gallup poll found that 7 in 10 women have an unfavorable view of him. Clinton meanwhile, retains her strong appeal to women voters. The ""woman's card"" also isn't the powerful weapon that Trump is making it out to be. After all, in the history of the United States, there have been no female presidents -- despite the fact that women are a majority of the population. ""Any time a woman is in the race for the presidency, the woman card is on the table,"" said Ellen Fitzpatrick, a historian who wrote the book The Highest Glass Ceiling: Women's Quest for the American Presidency. ""It's just a question of whether it plays high or low -- and for most of American history, it's played low.""What's more powerful is the Man Card. No one talks about it, because it's considered normal and expected for presidents to possess attributes traditionally associated with masculinity: strength, toughness, virility, athleticism and a certain cool charisma. The country even likes its presidents tall, which men more often are. ""The American presidency is different, in a sense, from the heads of states in some other nations we might compare ourselves to, in that it does involve the commander-in-chief role. And that, I think, historically has always been a very difficult barrier for women to get over,"" Fitzpatrick said.The vast majority of presidents have served in the military. Some of them were renowned military leaders -- such as Ulysses Grant and Dwight Eisenhower -- in positions that weren't even open to women. Geraldine Ferraro, the first female vice presidential candidate of a major American political party, had to confront doubts about whether she was as tough as a man when it came to foreign policy. In 1984, journalist Marvin Kalb asked her on ""Meet the Press"" whether she could ""push the nuclear button"" if she had to. ""I can do whatever is necessary in order to protect the security of this country,"" Ferraro replied. Kalb then asked her whether the reason she was selected as Walter Mondale's running mate was because of her gender. ""That’s a double-edged sword, so that -- I don't know. I don't know, if I were not a woman, if I would be judged in the same way on my candidacy, whether or not I would be asked questions like 'Are you strong enough to push the button?' or that type,"" Ferraro replied. Fitzpatrick said Clinton seems to have overcome many of the doubts the public had about previous female candidates. ""Clinton seems to have the opposite problem with some members of the Democratic Party, who see her as too hawkish,"" Fitzpatrick said. ""And then, of course, there are her critics in the Republican Party, who argue that she's incompetent -- that certainly seems to be the implication of her term as secretary of state, the Benghazi issue. They're claiming that she put national security at risk.""“There is some notion that women don’t know anything about defense,"" said former Rep. Pat Schroeder (D-Colo.), who explored a presidential run in 1987, during a press call last year on women and the presidency. ""But if you're a male, you just instantly do -- even though people forget even [former Vice President Dick] Cheney had five draft deferments and never served. But he was considered perfectly adequate for defense secretary.""Schroeder also says the public has a certain expectation about what a president should look like, and women have had a tough time living up to it. “All of us could advise men on what to wear,"" Schroeder said. ""If you want to look busy, you either take off your tie, loosen your collar, roll up your shirtsleeves, run down some steps, have a phone in your ear.""""There’s no similar kind of uniform for women,"" she added. ""And we tend to either look like unmade beds or look like a model. Trying to find out how a woman looks like she’s working hard through these very important visuals is just not something that there’s a real formula for."" Clinton's team responded to Trump's ""woman's card"" comments in a fundraising email on Wednesday, warning that more sexist attacks are likely on the way.""Hillary Clinton has won more than 12 million votes -- that's 2 million more than Trump -- because she has the best vision for this country, the chops to get the job done, and an incredible team fighting alongside her,"" Deputy Communications Director Christina Reynolds wrote. ""But Trump's unpredictable, often dangerous rhetoric has created a volatile atmosphere in this race that requires us to be even more prepared than before.""Although Trump thinks Clinton owes her success to her gender, perhaps a better question is where he would be if he weren't a man.

And he played the saxophone, which was considered a very cool instrument in the 1990s. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_0_6_3000_1805%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump previewed his general election attacks against Hillary Clinton on Tuesday night, accusing the Democratic hopeful of playing up her gender in order to win. ""If Hillary Clinton were a man, I don't think she'd get 5 percent of the vote,"" Trump said at a New York press conference after winning five states. ""The only thing she's got going is the woman's card, and the beautiful thing is, women don't like her. And look how well I did with women tonight.""Actually, the vast majority of women don't like Trump -- a fact already giving Republicans heartburn as they deal with the possibility that he will be their nominee in the general election. A recent Gallup poll found that 7 in 10 women have an unfavorable view of him. Clinton meanwhile, retains her strong appeal to women voters. The ""woman's card"" also isn't the powerful weapon that Trump is making it out to be. After all, in the history of the United States, there have been no female presidents -- despite the fact that women are a majority of the population. ""Any time a woman is in the race for the presidency, the woman card is on the table,"" said Ellen Fitzpatrick, a historian who wrote the book The Highest Glass Ceiling: Women's Quest for the American Presidency. ""It's just a question of whether it plays high or low -- and for most of American history, it's played low.""What's more powerful is the Man Card. No one talks about it, because it's considered normal and expected for presidents to possess attributes traditionally associated with masculinity: strength, toughness, virility, athleticism and a certain cool charisma. The country even likes its presidents tall, which men more often are. ""The American presidency is different, in a sense, from the heads of states in some other nations we might compare ourselves to, in that it does involve the commander-in-chief role. And that, I think, historically has always been a very difficult barrier for women to get over,"" Fitzpatrick said.The vast majority of presidents have served in the military. Some of them were renowned military leaders -- such as Ulysses Grant and Dwight Eisenhower -- in positions that weren't even open to women. Geraldine Ferraro, the first female vice presidential candidate of a major American political party, had to confront doubts about whether she was as tough as a man when it came to foreign policy. In 1984, journalist Marvin Kalb asked her on ""Meet the Press"" whether she could ""push the nuclear button"" if she had to. ""I can do whatever is necessary in order to protect the security of this country,"" Ferraro replied. Kalb then asked her whether the reason she was selected as Walter Mondale's running mate was because of her gender. ""That’s a double-edged sword, so that -- I don't know. I don't know, if I were not a woman, if I would be judged in the same way on my candidacy, whether or not I would be asked questions like 'Are you strong enough to push the button?' or that type,"" Ferraro replied. Fitzpatrick said Clinton seems to have overcome many of the doubts the public had about previous female candidates. ""Clinton seems to have the opposite problem with some members of the Democratic Party, who see her as too hawkish,"" Fitzpatrick said. ""And then, of course, there are her critics in the Republican Party, who argue that she's incompetent -- that certainly seems to be the implication of her term as secretary of state, the Benghazi issue. They're claiming that she put national security at risk.""“There is some notion that women don’t know anything about defense,"" said former Rep. Pat Schroeder (D-Colo.), who explored a presidential run in 1987, during a press call last year on women and the presidency. ""But if you're a male, you just instantly do -- even though people forget even [former Vice President Dick] Cheney had five draft deferments and never served. But he was considered perfectly adequate for defense secretary.""Schroeder also says the public has a certain expectation about what a president should look like, and women have had a tough time living up to it. “All of us could advise men on what to wear,"" Schroeder said. ""If you want to look busy, you either take off your tie, loosen your collar, roll up your shirtsleeves, run down some steps, have a phone in your ear.""""There’s no similar kind of uniform for women,"" she added. ""And we tend to either look like unmade beds or look like a model. Trying to find out how a woman looks like she’s working hard through these very important visuals is just not something that there’s a real formula for."" Clinton's team responded to Trump's ""woman's card"" comments in a fundraising email on Wednesday, warning that more sexist attacks are likely on the way.""Hillary Clinton has won more than 12 million votes -- that's 2 million more than Trump -- because she has the best vision for this country, the chops to get the job done, and an incredible team fighting alongside her,"" Deputy Communications Director Christina Reynolds wrote. ""But Trump's unpredictable, often dangerous rhetoric has created a volatile atmosphere in this race that requires us to be even more prepared than before.""Although Trump thinks Clinton owes her success to her gender, perhaps a better question is where he would be if he weren't a man. For starters, he'd probably be far less wealthy, since women still make only 79 cents for every dollar a man earns."

The current mayor is not seeking re-election after widespread criticism of how she managed the unrest. Thirteen people threw their hats into the ring for Tuesday’s Democratic mayoral primary -- the main contest in this heavily Democratic city. On Feb. 3, DeRay Mckesson joined the race. As a candidate, Mckesson had some points in his favor. He’s a nationally known advocate against police violence who rose to prominence with the Black Lives Matter movement. At 30, he’s a seasoned voice for younger voters’ dissatisfaction. He grew up in Baltimore. And his many Twitter followers stood strongly behind his bid for the city’s top job. The love he received online, however, did not translate into votes. Despite participating in mayoral forums, knocking on doors, doing multiple interviews and making a huge social media push, Mckesson walked away with just 2 percent of the vote on Tuesday night.Mckesson came into the race with national prestige, but that wasn’t what the voters wanted. Here’s why he lost on Tuesday. When The Huffington Post chatted with Mckesson early in his campaign about how he intended to build his relationship with the voters, he pointed to his resume. The Teach For America alum said he was a community organizer in Baltimore as a teenager, worked with nonprofits in the city and served on the Maryland Advisory Board on After-School Opportunity Programs. After he finished college, Mckesson opened an after-school center in the city before becoming the special assistant for human capital in the Baltimore school system in 2012. “My work in Baltimore is long. I’ve had a lot of results,” he said. Yet that history didn’t come with much local name recognition. Kurt Schmoke, who was mayor of Baltimore from 1987 to 1999, has moderated two mayoral forums this election cycle. When he asked people in the audience -- who tended to be older than the average Twitter user -- about Mckesson, he found that no one was quite sure who the guy was. “He’s far better known outside of the city than he is with local voters,” Schmoke said. “About every voter that I’ve talked to about this kind of scratched their head about the national interest in the Mckesson campaign.” When a Baltimore Sun reporter asked former Mayor Sheila Dixon about Mckesson, her initial response was telling. Dixon, who was running for her old job, said she had never heard of him. Some saw this as Dixon being out of touch, given Mckesson’s massive Twitter following and prominence in the media. Others, however, saw the real problem. “To announce a campaign when folks don’t know [you] or know what you’ve done in their community makes your campaign kind of a long shot,” Schmoke said.Still, Mckesson wasn’t the only new kid in the contest, as John Bullock, an assistant professor of political science at Towson University, pointed out. Because there was no incumbent in the race, Bullock said it attracted “a whole host of people who are not really engaged in politics in the past.” One way to beef up your name recognition, according to Schmoke, is with basic grassroots campaigning. Knock on doors, participate in community forums. But lesser-known candidates have to go a step further. The latest crop of mayoral contenders tackled this in different ways. Venture capitalist David Warnock spent money on TV advertising, while others sent out mailers. Mckesson leaned on his strongest asset -- social media. But many voters in Baltimore don’t use Twitter or even have Internet access, and only 2 percent of Mckesson’s Twitter followers live in the city. Voters in the city’s Democratic primary traditionally tend to be older and thus less likely to follow social media closely. It’s not as if Mckesson was the only candidate who might appeal to younger voters either. Schmoke pointed to lawyer Elizabeth Embry, who has a better-known track record of service in the community. Mckesson seemed to understand he had a hill to climb. He recruited his Twitter followers to call voters and launched “30 Days for 30,000,” during which his goal was to reach 30,000 voters by phone or in person before early primary voting began on April 14. He also aimed to contact another 30,000 afterward. What he couldn’t overcome was the extent to which his efforts to become mayor would be overshadowed by his national status as an activist. “Connecting to the events of last April, some will remember him for that activism for good or for bad,” Bullock said. Judging from online commentary and multiple HuffPost interviews, many in Baltimore never believed that Mckesson, who was born in the city, was truly committed to working there. Local activists, those who had been laboring in Charm City’s trenches, were notably wary.“If he was serious about it, why didn’t he do a search in the community and see if the community even wanted him to run?” said local advocate Duane Davis. “How come he didn’t talk to … the community in which you wanna represent? He just threw his hat in the ring to cause chaos and get attention.” Kwame Rose, a prominent Baltimore activist, recalled how McKesson identified himself during the protests that followed Gray’s death. “He would say he’s a Ferguson protester and his fight isn’t for Baltimore. Is it weird? I think it is,” Rose said. “For him not to have interacted with people involved in the movement from Baltimore City, I think that's very problematic.”Dayvon Love, director of public policy for Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle, suggested that Mckesson’s skill set wasn’t well developed for local battles.“It’s easy to show up at a demonstration at the height of a big mainstream media spectacle. It’s another thing to get people to turn out to go to [an event] on a Thursday during the day,” Love said. “Those are just different kinds of organizing. The former is more of like the microwave activism. It doesn’t require the infrastructure building … having to actually knock on doors, canvass, go to PTAs, go to schools, go to rec centers, go to churches -- and to really build relationships that way.”Moreover, some Baltimoreans worried that Mckesson’s high-profile presence might draw unwelcome national interest to their local political scene.“I hope that his entrance will shift the conversation around the mayoral race from broad platitudes to specific discussions on racial justice and police brutality,” David Pontious of City Blocc, a student grassroots organization, said before the primary. “I am concerned, though, about the potential amount of non-Baltimore money and voices in this election. We don't need to be condescended to by activists or people who don't live or vote here. No, thanks.”Certainly, Mckesson raised a significant amount of money in a short time. In the first 12 hours after he officially entered the race, he raised over $30,000 online, immediately outpacing many of his opponents across all parties. Overall, Mckesson raised more than $265,000. But most of his donors were not from Baltimore. Mckesson said his national exposure made him a better candidate for mayor.“It exposed me to, in a way, other places ... [how to] identify and address challenges and think about solutions in innovative ways,” he told HuffPost. In announcing his bid, he had similarly talked about “being aggressively innovative” on Baltimore’s issues. “Much of that is my exposure to other places and my deep experience here in the city,” he said.Another mark against Mckesson was how late he launched his campaign -- he waited until the filing deadline. Some saw in this a lack of sincere enthusiasm for the task ahead.“He put in at the last hour, at the last possible moment,” said Davis, the local activist.By contrast, Maryland state Sen. Catherine Pugh, who won Tuesday’s Democratic mayoral primary, launched her campaign in September 2015. Dixon, who came in second, began her campaign in July 2015. Jumping into the race with less than three months to go before the primary didn’t give Mckesson much time to overcome people’s concerns, grow his name recognition or build up the necessary relationships with voters and local thought leaders.The chances of anyone running a successful campaign in little more than 80 days were slim to none, professor Bullock said. As a candidate running on ideas rather than long experience, Mckesson also faced a problem differentiating his proposals from those of his fellow candidates. As Bullock noted, many of the candidates mentioned the need for police reform in their platforms. Pugh made police reform the cornerstone of her campaign, along with lowering property taxes in heavily blighted neighborhoods. Dixon, like Mckesson, ran on the promise to reduce crime in the community and bump the minimum wage up to $15 an hour. “It wouldn’t be anything new brought to the table in those areas by [Mckesson],” Bullock said. “The only thing that might be different is bringing the hashtag or bringing that slogan of Black Lives Matter. But all the candidates here do agree that black lives do matter.”National fame and lots of Twitter followers just weren’t enough to clear all Mckesson’s hurdles.“Quite frankly,"" Bullock said, ""Those people who know you nationally can’t vote in Baltimore.""

19,POLITICS,House Democrats Push Back On Obama Plan To Cut Drug Prices,Ryan Grim and Jeffrey Young,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-democrats-hhs-drug-prices_us_5720e639e4b0b49df6a9c93f,A fight over drug prices is entering a new phase.,2016-04-27,House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is grappling with a lobbying campaign aimed at keeping drug prices high.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5720eb2c2200002900254abe.jpeg?cache=SGeItgD8uY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- A group of House Democrats is organizing an effort that could slow down an Obama administration plan to reduce drug prices, according to a letter obtained by The Huffington Post.The Department of Health and Human Services is working toward finalizing a new rule that would experiment with ending the financial incentive doctors have for prescribing some extremely expensive medications. The rule has been well-received among some patient advocates, but congressional Democrats have been largely silent, while the pharmaceutical industry and medical community have waged an aggressive campaign to stop it.The campaign is bearing fruit. The letter from House Democrats, according to Drew Hammill, a spokesman for House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), was made necessary because Big Pharma and oncologist lobbyists had pushed many Democrats to the brink of signing a much more aggressive Republican letter. The letter expresses concerns with the proposed rule, but doesn't call for it to be withdrawn.""Members are outlining their concerns, but this letter is in furtherance of getting an effective rule in place under the current timeline. This in no way is an effort to slow down or undermine the administration's efforts,"" Hammill told HuffPost after this story published.On Wednesday, Hammill said: ""A number of members have expressed concern about the scope and size of this initiative while recognizing problems with current payment rules. Leader Pelosi hopes that CMS will continue to actively engage members and advocacy organizations as the particulars of this test are finalized.""Hammill said Pelosi is urging members to sign the letter, which is being circulated by Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.).The Democratic letter gives HHS the opportunity to quickly answer the questions and move forward with the rule, while the GOP missive aims to stop it cold. All of the tussling takes place amid the implicit threat to attach a rider to legislation that would block the rule. If Republicans think they can do so without much Democratic opposition, there's little to stop them. Pelosi's alternate letter can be seen as an attempt to show there is division between the parties in how frightened they respectively are of the powerful lobbies at work here.Pelosi encouraged her caucus to get behind the Neal letter to fend off the GOP attack. In fact, Pelosi’s office even helped with the letter: Democrats forgot to scrub their data from the document before circulating it, and an inspection of its properties reveals that it was last handled by a health policy fellow in Pelosi’s office.The Republican letter simply asks for HHS to withdraw its new rule, citing ""deep concerns."" Pushing an alternate letter is a strategy Pelosi has employed effectively before. When the administration wanted to issue a rule insisting that brokers have a fiduciary duty to clients, Republicans were in full-throated opposition, and Pelosi created a rival outlet for Democrats to go on record with their concerns. The rule went forward and a vote against it later on Thursday is expected to gather little Democratic support.The Medicare drugs proposal is part of a larger push by the White House to tackle prescription drug costs, which are rising rapidly even as costs in other parts of the health care system have grown more slowly in recent years. The administration is limited in what it can do to ameliorate drug spending without new legislation, but convened a forum at the White House in November to air the issue and has issued a slate of smaller reforms.Any effort targeting the pharmaceutical industry and a segment of the medical community's wallets is bound to attract staunch opposition, as this Medicare plan has. The proposal launched a fierce lobbying battle, with drug makers, cancer doctors and some patient groups charging that the plan to shift the financial incentives to provide more expensive drugs, higher doses of the medicines or both would be harmful to patients and interfere with clinical decisions by health care providers.Congressional Quarterly recently reported that ""the pharmaceutical industry is spending record sums in Washington, amid rising congressional and regulatory interest in high drug prices,"" noting that its spending in the first quarter of 2016 outpaced everything since 2010, the height of lobbying over Obamacare.The pharmaceutical industry also is fighting back against a set of cost-cutting proposals released this month by the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing, a coalition that includes the lobbying arms of the hospital and health insurance industries, physician societies, the seniors' advocacy group AARP and large companies such as Walmart.The rationale for the proposed regulation is that the current system not only can overpay for these drugs, but can encourage physicians to use medicines that are the most profitable to their practices instead of most appropriate for patients. The independent Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, which advises Congress on policy, has cautioned about these incentives and urged lawmakers to update the way these drug prices are set.The change would affect medicines administered by doctors in a medical setting, not drugs purchased at pharmacies and taken by patients, and those costs are covered by Medicare Part B, the portion of the program that pays for doctor visits and similar services. Medicare spends about $20 billion a year on these medications, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.Under a formula created during the George W. Bush administration, physicians who purchase these medicines for use in their offices are paid the ""average sales price"" of the drugs plus an additional 6 percent. The Obama administration wants to reduce the markup to 2.5 percent plus a fee of $16.80 per day. The regulation also would call for experiments with other payment methods, including linking the amount doctors get to how well the medicine works to treat patients' illnesses.As one senior House Democratic aide put it in an email:Basically the old system was really good for doctors -- they got paid more if they prescribed really expensive drugs because they got a percentage of the cost of the drug. So guess what they did? It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure that out. We’ve been trying to solve this problem for awhile and the spike in drug costs has made it even more urgent. The administration certainly went big and bold with this proposal but many people think it will be dialed back somewhat in the final version. Only a few specialties will really lose out, the others will actually benefit. But those specialists are the ones who have been making tons of $ on a broken system. Is it their fault the system is broken? Of course not. Is it their fault that drug costs have gone up so much? No, but you didn’t see them complaining too much either.Kevin Griffis, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, told HuffPost comments from Congress along with other public comments would be considered before the proposal is finalized.“Americans from all walks of life have felt the impact of the high cost of prescription drugs, and it continues to be a prime driver of spending across the health care system,"" he said in a statement. ""The administration's Part B proposal seeks to deliver better value for consumers and Medicare, while ensuring that doctors and patients continue to have access to life-saving drugs. That's why the proposal enjoys support from a diverse set of voices -- from AARP to the American Academy of Family Physicians to the former head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under George W. Bush.""Jonathan Cohn contributed reporting.This post has been updated with more response from Pelosi's office, comment from the Department of Health and Human Services and a Democratic aide, and more details on pharmaceutical industry lobbying."

Fey was joined at the event by Ron Howard, Bernadette Peters and Melissa Joan Hart and a host of Broadway stars on the red carpet. Fey recently confirmed that she and her composer husband were working on the ""Mean Girls"" musical together, though she joked that the production is still ""years away"" from being completed.Though she and Richmond have been together since 2001, we're always a little shocked to see Fey without her other life partner, Amy Poehler.

Based on the book by Alex Haley, the new ""Roots"" will chronicle several generations of Haley's family, beginning with the harrowing story Kunta Kinte, a Gambian man sold into slavery around 1767. Far grittier than the original 1977 ""Roots,"" the new mini-series stars the virtually unknown actor Malachi Kirby in the role that made Levar Burton famous, Kunta Kinte. At a special preview screening of the new series during the Tribeca Film Festival on April 21, Kirby spoke candidly about the overwhelming task of taking on the iconic Kunta Kinte role, which began, he said, with not trying to recreate Levar Burton's performance. ""I did research on the culture, tradition... But in terms of the actual journey that Kunta Kinte goes on, to be honest, I had no idea how to prepare for that. I still don't,"" Kirby said after the screening.""To be honest, my main form of preparation was prayer. There were so many enslaved people that didn't even make it off the boat, let alone live and have children. I was thinking, what was it that gave them the strength to survive? And what I found was that it was his spirit. His spirit and his knowledge of self.""And it's the knowledge of self that Kirby most hopes viewers, especially young black men like himself, take away from the ""Roots"" reboot. For Kirby, the key message of ""Roots"" is ""that our history does not begin at slavery.""""That is the main message that I would like the young black man to get from this,"" he said. ""To be proud of his ancestry. To not feel that it's a negative thing to be African. And to also understand that those people who were enslaved were not weak. Those were strong people. And they survived.""Night 1 of the four-part ""Roots"" mini-series premieres on May 30 on A&E, Lifetime, and History. "
24,BUSINESS,Cleveland Is Prepping For Clashes Between Police And Protesters At GOP Convention,Shane Ferro,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cleveland-police-insurance-gop-convention_us_57210affe4b0b49df6a9ef09,The city is so worried it is looking to insure against civil rights violations.,2016-04-27,"Protesters gather at a downtown intersection as a Cleveland Police officer looks on following a not guilty verdict for Cleveland police officer Michael Brelo on manslaughter charges, in Cleveland on May 23, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57210cc6160000e90031cdbc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"At the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City, the NYPD arrested 1,800 protesters in mass arrests. Ten years later, the city of New York came to an agreement with two groups of the protesters, settling for a record total of $18 million. The New York case was an extreme example of something that is unfortunately treated as inevitable: large events giving way to protests, mistreated protesters, and, ultimately, large lawsuits for civil rights violations. The great thing about foreseeable risks? You can buy insurance for them. The city of Cleveland, which will host the Republican National Convention this July, will spend $1.5 million on an insurance broker to find a policy which covers potential lawsuits related to police conduct for the event, according to Cleveland.com. The website is calling it “protest insurance” -- although more technically it’s known as law enforcement professional liability insurance.“There’s such a huge range of things that can happen when you have that many people with so many different viewpoints together in a city,” said Christine Link, the executive director of the Ohio ACLU. She noted Cleveland is expecting between 50,000 and 75,000 extra people in its downtown area during the upcoming convention. This convention is no run-of-the-mill event, either. Currently, no GOP primary candidate has secured enough delegates to sail through the nomination process, and there is such resistance to Donald Trump’s candidacy within the party that there’s lots of talk about a potential contested convention. That means not only will there be the protesters you normally see at any political event, but there could be protesters from separate factions of the Republican Party itself.The contested Democratic convention in 1968 led to rioting, and, in turn, police violence against both violent and peaceful protesters. Meanwhile, the city of Cleveland is no stranger to police misconduct lawsuits. Just this week it reached a $6 million lawsuit settlement with the family of Tamir Rice, who was shot by police while playing in a park with a toy gun in November 2014.“The best thing a police department can do is train their people appropriately,” said Link. But even the best training doesn’t guarantee every officer will behave perfectly. For that risk, there is insurance. “Nerves are on edge because of the possibility of a contested convention,” Robert Hartwig, the president of the Insurance Information Institute, told The Huffington Post. “It could cause tempers to flare on the parts of various parties. Any good risk management program is now contemplating that possibility.”A spokesperson for the city of Cleveland emailed HuffPost a statement that said the city hired an insurance broker “to assist the City in identifying and procuring law enforcement professional liability and related insurance.” The statement also said it will be paid for through a federal grant. According to Cleveland.com, the city will get a “$50 million federal security grant.” Aon, the specialized insurance company that is brokering insurance for the city of Cleveland, declined a request to comment for this article, noting that it does not comment on issues related to current clients.This kind of insurance -- plus similar policies to protect the city against liability from terrorism and various other ways that people might get hurt -- is pretty standard when a city hosts a large event, according to Hartwig. “It’s standard operation procedure for venues and organizers to develop a sophisticated risk management program,” he said.However, insuring against police misconduct does present a certain dilemma: It means the police go into the event protected against liability for their actions, a problem known as moral hazard. It means they might be less wary of the consequences of their actions than they would have been if they were on the hook financially. “One of the problems that we encounter when we sue the police for violation of constitutional rights is that very often they are indemnified,” said Arthur Eisenberg, the legal director at the New York Civil Liberties Union, who helped the 2004 RNC protesters reach the $18 million settlement with New York City. “Any damages that a court may order may well be paid by their employer or an insurance company.""On the other hand, we live with this kind of moral hazard every day. People don’t necessarily set out to wreck their cars just because they have car insurance, or leave their apartments unlocked because they have renters’ insurance. In fact, insurance can have the opposite effect: encouraging us to be careful so our premiums won't go up.St. Paul, which hosted the 2008 Republican convention, took out a $1.1 million policy from AIG to cover law enforcement actions against protesters, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune. So far, only $175,000 in settlements have been reported. CORRECTION: A previous version of this post incorrectly said the city of Cleveland had purchased insurance for the convention. The city has an insurance broker, but has not yet purchased a policy."

The White House said Wednesday in a Medium post that the president's visit was planned in response to a letter he received from 8-year-old Flint resident Mari Copeny, who wrote to the president saying she wanted to meet his wife. Obama praised Copeny for traveling to Washington with her family for a congressional hearing with Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) last month. In a letter to Copeny, Obama said he was proud of her for speaking out. ""That’s why I want you to be the first to know that I’m coming to visit Flint on May 4th,"" the president wrote. ""I want to make sure people like you and your family are receiving the help you need and deserve.""Flint's water has had dangerous lead levels since April 2014, when Snyder's administration oversaw the city's switch to the Flint River as its water source. State regulators told the city not to treat the water with anti-corrosion chemicals that could have prevented lead from leaching out of pipes made from the heavy metal. Lead can cause permanent brain damage in children and a wide variety of other health problems. Paint and dust are the most common sources of exposure, but millions of homes across the country get water from lead pipes, which can be just as dangerous if the local utility doesn't treat the water correctly. Snyder's government admitted the lead contamination in October after researchers showed the water change corresponded with an increase in blood lead levels among Flint children. In January, the Obama administration declared an emergency in Flint and pledged $80 million in assistance for the state to make low-cost loans to municipalities with water infrastructure issues. “Our children should not have to be worried about the water that they’re drinking in American cities,"" Obama said at the time. ""That’s not something that we should accept.”Snyder told the Detroit News Wednesday that he probably won't join Obama in Flint.“I’ve got a pretty full schedule next week,"" he said. ""That’s not currently a day I’m scheduled to be in Flint."""

Despite widespread condemnation from LGBT advocacy groups and medical organizations, Gov. Bill Haslam (R) signed the bill into law on Wednesday, according to The Associated Press. He had previously said he wanted to meet with counselors and therapists on both sides of the issue and deliberated over whether to sign the bill until the final deadline.The GOP-sponsored religious freedom bill, widely interpreted as a means of discriminating against LGBT individuals, passed both chambers of the state legislature earlier this month. Originally, the legislation had stated that counselors and therapists could turn away patients based on ""sincerely held beliefs,"" but the state House then broadened the phrasing to ""sincerely held principles.""Opponents of the bill fear that the new wording could lead to other forms of discrimination, as the bill does not clearly define what legal grounds mental health professionals can or cannot use to restrict patients.“There’s no litigation on what those ‘principles’ are,” state Sen. Jeff Yarbro (D) said earlier this month.In justifying his decision to sign the bill, Haslam told The Tennessean that ""I was concerned about the legislation -- the connotations,"" but ultimately authorized it because it does not allow mental health professionals to turn away any patient who is experiencing an emergency. It also mandates that if they refuse to see a patient on personal grounds, they must refer that patient to another professional.According to the American Counseling Association, a professional group that called the measure an ""unprecedented attack,"" Tennessee is the only state with such a law. It violates the group’s code of ethics, which delineates that mental health professionals cannot refuse to serve patients based on “personally held values, attitudes, beliefs and behaviors.""The ACLU of Tennessee condemned Haslam's decision, describing it as ""yet another attack on the LGBT community in the wake of marriage equality.""""This measure is rooted in the dangerous misconception that religion can be used as a free pass to discriminate,"" the group said in a statement Wednesday. ""Allowing counselors to treat some potential clients differently from others based on their personal beliefs defies professional standards and could cause significant harm to vulnerable people.""UPDATE: April 28 -- To protest the law, the American Counseling Association, which is scheduled to hold its annual conference in Nashville next year, may move it elsewhere, the group announced Thursday. In addition, Washington state's secretary of state, Kim Wyman (R), said she and her staff will not attend this summer's meeting of the National Association of Secretaries of State in Nashville, in part because of the law.

The service has consistently failed to protect the northern long-eared bat as it needs and deserves under the law. This is just the latest in that string of failures,"" said Mollie Matteson, senior scientist with the Center for Biological Diversity.The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service last year listed northern long-eared bats as threatened because of white-nose syndrome, which has killed more than six million bats in North America since it was first documented in New York nearly a decade ago.Last month, white-nose syndrome – so called because of the fungal residue on the muzzles of ailing bats – was for the first time confirmed in the western United States with the finding of an infected bat in Washington, bringing to 32 the number of states affected by the disease.Caving enthusiasts have strongly opposed moves to restrict access to caves across the U.S. West, many on public land, where the bats hibernate."

The U.S auto safety regulator is also seeking information, while Japanese authorities have raided one of its research and development facilities.Mitsubishi said the committee of external experts will report the results of its investigation in three months.The automaker has said that it had been compiling data for fuel economy tests using U.S. standards, where higher-speed, highway driving is common, rather than Japanese standards, which are set to reflect driving in the city, where the need to stop more often means more fuel is used.The company said on Tuesday that it had been submitting non-compliant data to Japan's transport ministry since 1991. Mitsubishi had previously only said such non-compliance went back to at least 2002.The transport ministry announced earlier in the day that it had set up a task force to examine how other automakers submit fuel economy data. Last week it ordered other domestic automakers to submit fuel economy test data by May 18.The misconduct has revived memories of a scandal more than 15 years ago in which Mitsubishi admitted to systematically covering up customer complaints for more than 20 years, bringing the company close to collapse.Back then, it was helped by a bailout from other Mitsubishi Group companies. But now senior officials at other Mitsubishi firms say would be difficult"" for them to help the car maker as they face their own financial squeeze, as well as calls to put shareholder returns above ties with the former Mitsubishi business empire.On Tuesday, Mitsubishi Motors shares ended down nearly 10 percent."

In this regard, our vice presidents have assembled a glowing track record of sustained excellence.Who will be the next man or woman to add their name to this legend? This is a matter that the media has suddenly begun to take up in earnest, perhaps sensing that this year's primary elections are now more or less decided, and it's time to now move to the next chapter of the story of this election -- the one in which the media ponders what's at stake in the choosing of a running mate in a race to find out which pundit can overthink it the most.Over the weekend, The New York Times reported that the Clinton campaign had ""begun extensive discussions"" about her running mate.

Elizabeth Warren, former Massachusetts Gov.r Deval Patrick, and Obama administration Labor Secretary Thomas Perez, who worked for the late Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy.As the media will make much of Clinton's need to appeal to working-class white men (and people with more limited connections to Massachusetts), many of the people named are also white guys: Virginia Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, and Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown.In case you were wondering, yes, Clinton would be open to running with another woman on the ticket. One can easily imagine that this might be the sort of thing that the media could get a little overexcited about, and not necessarily to good purposes. A distant early warning of how that might be received came over the weekend, when former Obama communications director Anita Dunn was asked if Hillary Clinton really could pick another woman as her vice president, as if there was some legal obstacle preventing this arrangement. Dunn replied, ""There is some precedent for having a running mate of the same gender."" Bu-bu-bu-but, penises?According to The Washington Post's Robert Costa and Philip Rucker, the veep-game is afoot in GOP circles as well. The campaigns of John Kasich and Ted Cruz have apparently already begun their vetting processes, which seems pretty premature, when you consider the delegate count in that race. They report that the man atop the delegate count, Donald Trump, has given the matter some ""serious thought,"" but has not made it a focus of his campaign, which seems pretty tardy, when you consider the delegate -- you get the idea.The results of Trump's vice-presidential ministrations are going to be of enormous interest, given the fact that he has a) cast himself as an outsider-basher of the establishment and yet b) desperately needs some insider-establishment type to explain to him basic things, like what a president does, and how Congress works. At the moment, Trump is still getting up to speed on what a ""delegate"" is, so it's understandable that he's lagging in the Veepstakes. Trump's vice-presidential pick will also be a person of interest, in that once Trump discovers that the presidency is a low-prestige job that involves constant criticism, unending demands, and the congenital inability to get Congress to agree to the executive branch vision, there's a good chance he'll just quit, leaving his running mate with the bag.But I have to give Trump some credit: I've never heard a president talk about what's at stake in the choosing of a vice president with greater realism. As The Washington Post reports:Trump, who said he wants to pick an experienced political leader, may calculate that he needs a bridge to mainstream Republicans who see his candidacy as radioactive.Besides demonstrating that they can draw breath and circulate blood, that's literally all a vice president brings a ticket -- a surfeit of institutional knowledge and, hopefully, a past free of scandal. There are literally no further advantages a vice-presidential prospect can bring to the ticket.Unfortunately for all of us, the Veepstakes is essentially a long-winded exercise in determining how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. If we are at the beginning stage of the Running Of The Running Mates, that means we have a staggering number of hours to endure, in which prospective candidates are hefted for demographic advantages and probed for home-state benefits.Can the right candidate deliver a larger share of voters from a swing state? Could a certain candidate help maximize turnout from some voting bloc? We are at the precipice of these possibilities being picked to death by pundits eager to battle their colleagues in their traditional game of Sunday morning panel one-upsmanship.So let's head all of that off at the pass. The home state of the vice-presidential pick? Their ethnicity? Their gender? Their religion? None of that matters. That needle won't jump. You can stop fretting about it.Over at The Washington Post's Monkey Cage blog, Christopher J. Devine and Kyle C. Kopko break out all the relevant research on the matter of vice-presidential prestidigitation, and their overarching conclusion is that it more or less fails to amount to a hill of beans, provided that the presidential candidate remembers to literally not choose an actual hill of beans as their partner-in-crime. (Which, to be honest, is too bad. I for one would vastly prefer to hear what Hill Of Beans has to say about the state of contemporary politics and its preferred policy platform than I would, say ... Carly Fiorina.)Does the right vice-presidential candidate offer the ticket a home-state advantage? According to Devine and Kopko, in some limited instances, when the vice-presidential pick ""comes from a relatively less populous state and has served that state for many years as an elected official,"" it can. This benefit is then immediately offset by the fact that ""less-populous states have very few electoral votes, thus making them unlikely to flip the outcome in the Electoral College.""Other than that, the home-state benefit is straight-up tugging at ghosts: ""No matter the empirical method,"" they write, ""we consistently find that the vice- presidential home state advantage is, statistically speaking, zero.""What about the idea that diversity on the ticket might bring a greater share of some demographic subgroup's favor on Election Day? There, the science is incomplete, as there are no real-world examples of a major party selecting a Latino (or an African-American, or an Asian-American) as their vice-presidential candidate. But in analyzing ""the performance of some other would-be breakthrough candidates"" -- such as Geraldine Ferraro, Sarah Palin, and Joe Lieberman -- the relevant political science indicates that these choices result in some positive feelings toward these picks from voters who share their demographic identity.But that's as far as it goes. Per Devine and Kopko:But again, more positive feelings toward the running mate do not necessarily translate into more votes. Controlling for a range of relevant covariates (such as age, income, party identification), gender is not a statistically significant predictor of vote choice in 1984 or 2008. Nor is Catholic identification in 1972, 1984, 2008 or 2012. The one exception is in 2000, when Jewish voters were significantly more likely to vote for the Gore/Lieberman ticket. But in a subsequent pooled analysis of presidential vote choice, Jewish respondents to the ANES proved to be significantly more likely to vote for the Democratic candidate in each presidential election since 1960. Further analysis shows that Jews didn’t feel more warmly toward Lieberman than toward the average Democratic running mate. So it’s not clear that Lieberman’s candidacy actually brought more Jewish votes to the 2000 Democratic ticket.So, that's a dead end as well.Recently, the U.S. News and World Report's Susan Milligan reported on the work of a ""bipartisan team of veteran campaign managers and political historians,"" who took up the task of evaluating how to pick the perfect vice president for the Bipartisan Policy Center. The way Milligan distills these experts' ideal process into a series of steps basically boils down to this:Take a deep breath, and come up with some names.Based upon Milligan's reporting, the impaneled experts didn't have anything to say about whether it's necessary to find the right guy to help you swing Wisconsin, or the pick that's got the magic touch to bringing out, say, more Asian-Pacific islanders to the polls. The process of picking a vice president is nothing more than a brutal, medieval endoscopy into the personal and political lives of people with whom you might spend the most important years of your political career. Hopefully, you find someone who survives that process, after which, you can simply just be hopeful that you, too, survive.Still, this idea that the right vice-presidential pick might confer some sort of hidden electoral advantage -- like they're some walking political cheat-code -- is a compelling story. And it's understandable why a campaign would like to indulge in this sort of stagecraft. After all, what the selection is really all about is finding someone to fill a rather macabre political role who doesn't load down the ticket with a bunch of dreadful liabilities. At the end of that process, you don't want to have to talk about the intensity or the intrusiveness of the vetting process. So, hey, instead, come up with a fun story about how your running mate is someone who has hidden, ineffable strengths. Maybe such spin is silly. Still, like I said from the outset, this system has worked beautifully: All of our vice presidents have successfully performed the task of remaining a living, breathing vessel of human consciousness, and none have revealed themselves to be the Zodiac Killer, not even Spiro Agnew, although it was pretty touch-and-go there for a while.~~~~~Jason Linkins edits “Eat The Press” for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost politics podcast “So, That Happened.” Subscribe here, and listen to the latest episode below."

After being attacked on social media by the Beyhive for being the woman in Bey's track ""Sorry"" (from her visual album ""Lemonade""), the fashion designer addressed the gossip in a statement to People magazine. ""I want to put the speculation and rumors to rest. My Instagram post was meant to be fun and lighthearted, it was misunderstood as something other than that,"" she said. ""There is no validity to the idea that the song references me personally. There is no truth to the rumors.""""Consequently, online haters have targeted me and my daughters in a hurtful and scary manner, including physical threats. As a mother -- and I know many mothers would agree -- I feel that bullying in any form is harmful and unacceptable,"" she added. ""I would hope that the media sees the real issue here -- the issue of cyber bullying -- and how it should not be tolerated by anyone."" After Yoncé seemingly accused her husband of cheating throughout ""Lemonade"" -- notably in ""Sorry"" with the lyrics ""He only want me when I'm not there / He better call Becky with the good hair"" -- Roy shared a photo on Instagram with the words ""good hair don't care"" in the caption.Fans saw that as a sign that the designer was definitely ""Becky with the good hair,"" and they went on the offensive, leaving hoards of bee emojis and hateful words in the comments. They even did the same to her daughters' accounts. Things got so bad Roy made her account private. Meanwhile, Jay, the man involved in the whole rumored scandal, basically got off scot-free (save for some hilarious memes). The fashion designer addressed the backlash in a series of tweets over the weekend, saying she respects “love, marriages, families and strength” and doesn't tolerate bullying. On Monday, Roy canceled her appearance at a New York event citing a ""personal emergency,"" but was spotted arriving at her home in Los Angeles. Beyoncé has yet to address any of the rumors herself, but judging by the fact that she rarely does interviews, we doubt she will. "
31,BUSINESS,Wall Street Is Losing Confidence In Exxon Mobil,Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/exxon-mobil-debt-downgraded_us_571fbc7be4b0b49df6a95956,Low oil prices strike again.,2016-04-26,Standard & Poor's has downgraded Exxon Mobil's debt.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/571fced72200003600254976.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Falling oil prices have gutted the American shale boom and pushed the Saudis to try to kick their oil addiction. And now Exxon Mobil's debt has been downgraded by Standard & Poor's for the first time since 1930.The company had held the rating agency's highest AAA credit rating for each of the past 86 years. Exxon's debt is now rated AA+ by the agency, the second-highest rating.The only two remaining triple-A-rated U.S. companies are Johnson & Johnson and Microsoft.Exxon's very strong AA+ rating means its debt is still investment grade and there's no indication that Exxon is in any danger of being unable to repay its loans: The company made more than $16 billion last year.The worry with Exxon, S&P wrote in its downgrade note, is that the company took on debt so it spent billions investing in new projects and using dividends and stock buybacks to send money to shareholders when the price of oil was high.Now, as oil prices have collapsed -- down 60 percent in the last two years -- Exxon's financial health has wavered. Revenue in 2014 was over $411 billion. In 2015, it fell to $269 billion. And those rosy-seeming profit numbers are in fact part of that same negative trend: Profits were down 50 percent in 2015. As a result, Exxon has been forced to cut the money it spends on new oil projects. In February, Exxon was put on notice by S&P that it might be downgraded.""Nothing has changed in terms of the company’s financial philosophy or prudent management of its balance sheet,"" company spokesman Scott Silvestri told HuffPost in a statement. ""The corporation’s financial strength supports consistent strategy execution and our long-term approach to investing through a full range of commodity cycles."""
32,POLITICS,GOP Senate Candidate Says Obama’s Supreme Court Pick Deserves A Vote,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/david-jolly-supreme-court-nominee_us_571f65aee4b01a5ebde32fb5,"It's the Senate's job to act on nominees, says David Jolly.",2016-04-26,Rep. David Jolly (R-Fla.) isn't exactly on message with Senate Republican leaders.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/571f65d81900002e0056c35f.jpeg?ops=crop_6_126_2994_1783%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Rep. David Jolly (R-Fla.), who's vying for a Senate seat in November, broke from his party's messaging on Monday night and said Republicans should act on President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee this year.""I do think he should have a hearing and I would like to see a vote,"" Jolly said in a debate with one of his Democratic opponents, Rep. Alan Grayson.The Florida lawmaker also said if he were in the Senate now, he would meet with Obama's pick, Merrick Garland. ""Of course,"" he said.It might not sound like a bold statement, but Jolly's comments come as several GOP senators are refusing to even sit down with Obama's nominee. That's because Republican leaders have settled on a strategy of denying Garland any attention and punting the Supreme Court nomination until 2017, when Obama is gone. Their hope is that a Republican will be in the White House by then and will pick a nominee more to their liking.But their hard-line stance -- one that breaks from Senate precedent on moving Supreme Court nominees -- puts the party's vulnerable senators in a tough spot. It's no coincidence that many of the Republicans who have met with Garland are also in tight re-election races. Some, like Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Penn.), have seen their poll numbers go down over the Supreme Court blockade.Garland, a relatively moderate nominee, would fill the vacancy on the court left by Antonin Scalia, who died in February.To be sure, Jolly didn't say he'd vote for Garland. He said he'd vote against him, and cited concerns with his judicial record on the Second Amendment and labor unions. Nonetheless, he said the Senate's job is to give nominees hearings and votes, and they should be doing it with Garland's nomination.""That's actually the proper exercise of the Senate's Article I authority,"" he said.A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) did not immediately return a request for comment."
