Echoing that sentiment Resilience GPS author, Eileen McDargh, writes that ""resilience is elasticity.""Yet it usually takes a moment-by-moment self-reminder to recognize that we can use each hardship to become more resilient. In fact this is our path towards building mental toughness, as both Greitens, and former counter-intelligence FBI agent, LaRae Quy, have discovered. Fitting the Pieces of Your Life TogetherTo support you on your path towards greater mental toughness, Greitins share this with me: If I sat down in your living room and placed a giant bag of jigsaw puzzle pieces on a table in front of you and asked you to put all of the pieces together, what's the first thing you'd ask for? First you'd probably ask for a reason. 'Why are you askin' me to do a puzzle?' But if for the moment you accept that you're going to do the puzzle, what would you ask for? I'm guessing you'd ask for a picture. You'd want to know how all of the pieces come together. You'd want to know what you're trying to make.Here's the thing: Life only hands you pieces. You have to figure out how to put them together. Your life doesn't come with a picture of what it's supposed to look like on the box. You have to -- you get to -- choose that picture for yourself. And you choose it by looking for a model of a life well lived. In my chapter, ""Mastering Pain"", I write that you can't really master pain -- pain comes and goes -- some of it we choose and some of it we don't. You can, however, work on mastering yourself. You can build mental toughness in the same way that you build physical strength or moral courage -- through practice. What's tough is that while the world is replete with thousands of diet books and thousands more books on physical exercise, there are few guides to how we build mental toughness. I can't do justice to all that has to be practiced here, but consider just these five practices:1. Write down what you are afraid of. Writing down your fears puts them in front of you. Fear does its worst work when it knocks around in your mind, hiding in the hollows of your thoughts, waiting to breed with panic, insecurity, and uncertainty. When you write down what you are afraid of, you can begin to gain control of and face your fear.2. Segment. Learn how to break big challenges down into small pieces. Then attack the pieces.3. Mentally Rehearse. Just as you can physically practice and rehearse, you can also mentally rehearse. Done well, you build strength and clarity. Done well, you will not be overcome by events, no matter how difficult, because you've thought through hardship ahead of time.4. Self-Talk. We all talk to ourselves. You may not speak your thoughts out loud or share them with others, but there is always a conversation in your head about your environment and, most important, about yourself. You can't shut this conversation off. The best you can do is to turn it in your favor. There are times when our self-talk becomes destructive. I screwed up. I'm stupid. I don't deserve to be here. Everyone thinks like this occasionally, but repetitive negative inner monologues can be destructive. Gain control of the conversation in your own head, and direct it to help you achieve worthy goals. 5. Breathe.  Breathing, like blinking, is one of the few processes in your body that is both voluntary and involuntary. By taking control of your breathing, you can -- this is a crude analogy -- pull a lever on a lot of your other involuntary systems. By learning how to breathe, you learn how to begin to link the mental and the physical. You learn how to start taking responsibility for something very small and very simple, and you build a foundation of practice that will make you stronger.Make Better Choices by Becoming More Situationally AwareTo become more capable of deep and clear thinking in a situation according to Will Guild, one of Greitin's former military commanders, ask yourself four questions: 1. Why am I here? 2. What's going on around me? 3. What am I going to do about it? 4. How will my actions affect others?To complement this checklist I suggest that you use ""reverse engineering"" as a second step: What is my top goal for myself and for the others involved? That step makes it easier to answer those last two questions.Earn a Purposeful Life With OthersThe pull of purpose, the desire to feel needed in the world -- however we fulfill that desire -- is a very powerful force in human life... But you do have to recognize that the drive to live well and purposefully isn't some grim, ugly, teeth-gritting duty. On the contrary, 'it's a very good feeling.' It really is happiness,writes Greitins. We flourish when we become what we are capable of becoming.Why Regularly Doing Nothing Is The Best Thing To DoThe Romans were master of builders of things: of digging things out of the ground, of moving things from one end of the Continent to the other, of building towering forts and long walls, stacking thing upon thing...But there's a danger in thinking of reality this way. There is more to our lives than making, buying, building, owning, doing, working,writes Greitins who notes that the Romans thought the Jews were lazy for taking a whole day off every week, a Sabbath from doing. Yet we need sacred moments, regardless of the rituals of a religion or sports fan or other focus of our attention and allegiance. ''I heartily agree with Greitens that our meaning and equanimity with which we face life may come from finding and keeping the holy space in time that God has created and commanded humankind to keep."" I would add that even if you do not believe in God, you can experience moments of luminosity. You can feel a state of grace in creating that non-doing, sacred space. And regularly sharing tranquil times with others can strengthen your resiliency ""muscle"" -- and theirs."

3,FIFTY,3 Secrets I'm Ashamed To Tell My Kids About My Teenage Years,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/secrets-im-ashamed-to-tell-me-kids_n_6800520.html,,2015-03-10,Mature man with his son sitting on a couch and gossiping,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/60d1eb9628000015286fa93e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Adults think they remember what it's like to be a young person, but the reality is: they don't. Times change hard and fast, and what people in their 30s/40s/50s recall as ""youth"" has been extinct for a long time now. Sh*t gets harder, not easier.Remember sock hops and muscle cars and drive-in movies? Hell no, you don't remember that stuff. Because it's ancient. People who remember The Doors on Ed Sullivan or even Nirvana on Saturday Night Live, they have no idea what it's like to be a teenager today. It's simply the way life works: Parents think they have a clue, and in turn, think their teens are wrong for thinking they don't have a clue. The truth? When it comes to most aspects of being a young adult, parents mostly have no idea what's going on.So in that vein, I thought it'd be cool to look back on my own teenage years and talk about things I feel a little ashamed to telling my own three kids about someday. On one hand, I want to portray myself as a dad who ""gets it."" I was hoping the stuff I'm about to reveal might somehow be helpful to my own kids in years to come as they begin stumbling their way through the mad maze of being a teenager. But in the end, I have to laugh because my youth was a joke compared to kids today. I had it easy, man. And what was considered ""wild and crazy"" back when I was 16, well, those things seem pretty innocuous now. For example:1. I smoked a lot of cigarettes.Oh, behold the filthy habit. Go ahead, snarl and curse. In my teenage years, cigarettes seeped into teenage consciousness the same way getting excited about someone scoring wine coolers and hiding them in a cardboard box in the woods behind the mall did.I started smoking when I was 14 or 15. I'm not proud of it. I've quit a few times since I had kids, but in the end I've always found my way back to the little b*stards (the smokes, not the kids.) Smoking's bad; everyone knows that. It's bad for your health and, even worse, it's bad for your damn image. People tend to look at smokers like they're crackheads. They smugly walk by them, thinking to themselves, ""Stay away from me, please! Please don't ask me for $1.77 for the bus ride back to Weehawken.""But smokers don't care. Screw you. I started smoking cigarettes because I wanted to feel cool about myself. I was a husky, long-haired quiet type/not on any sports teams/no real girlfriends except one my senior year who only liked me after my younger, better-looking brother showed disinterest. I was into Johnny Cash and Springsteen when other kids were into Top 40 and the birth of hip-hop. I was kind of gross-looking. I had fat braces.Of f*cking course I started smoking cigarettes! Cigarettes made me feel like I could finally identify with people. I fell in with the smoking crowd. We smoked outside the lunch room. We smoked in the forest. We smoked and we talked and we bonded and we understood each other as we lit each other's smokes. Adults would look at us and frown and we felt massive and badass.I plan to make sure my kids understand that smoking cigs is the worst, that it will stunt their growth and kill them quickly and make their peckers shrivel up into a wad of Sunday morning bacon. But if they do somehow end up smoking, one thing's for sure: I won't spazz out on them. I'll probably steal their smokes and smoke them with a glass of chianti on the backporch some night. But I'll never shame them. Because there's bigger things to worry about.2. I lost my virginity fairly early.I lost my virginity to my super-hot 30-year-old 9th grade music teacher one November afternoon after she asked me to stay after school because she wanted to talk about Motorhead with me after she saw me wearing a Motorhead t-shirt that I bought at Sam Goody's. We did it all over her desk and on the student desks and we even ended up doing it standing up, like a synchronized sex waltz, as we both headed out to her car in the parking lot after two hours of heavy sh*t.Okay, that's a lie. Just a fantasy, I'm afraid. Got you all revved up though, huh? Ha! Nice.I had a little sex in high school. Nothing major, mind you (remember, I was not a very sexy young man) and thank goodness nobody got pregnant. But like pretty much every teenage boy whose entire physical system is built upon a foundation of lust (and the yearning desire to get off as many times a day as humanly possible) I did a little dance/made a little love. And who cares? Teens are programmed biologically to want to experience life. They're programmed to shove their faces in the gushing river of existence and let it drown their skulls with the intense feeling of being alive.I hope my kids avoid having sex when the time comes. I'll tell them how much can go wrong and that they need to associate sex with love and respect and not with a stolen bottle of Canadian Club and someone's vacationing parent's California King bed. But I know the deal. I've got three kids who will all be teens at the same time someday. At least one of them's gonna get freaky. At the end of the day, I just really want them to be safe and to treat the other person with dignity and class.Being a teen is weird. Sex as a teen is even weirder. Parents who mishandle this topic and freak out about this very normal stage of life, well, they usually end up messing a lot of stuff up. Mind you, I'm not endorsing the sex I had as a high school meatball. (God save that sweet, sweet angel who must've damn near died at the sight of me.) But it wasn't the worst thing I've ever experienced. And as far as teenagers go—and maybe I'm way off the mark here —I'd rather deal with condoms than semi-automatic weapons any day.3. I was a pretty big into ""Bob Marley Cassettes"" (if you know what I mean).I use the term ""Bob Marley Cassette"" here instead of certain other words, as not to have an adverse effect on my career. But the main reason is I like saying ""Bob Marley Cassette"" instead of w**d or p*t or gr*ss.I can't remember who came up with the term; I think I muttered it to my friends as we walked around in the wilderness staring at rabbit tracks in the snow while other teenagers were having sex, but I can't remember. I was baked, dude. But here's the thing: Kids these days are in a lot of trouble. They're surrounded by other kids who are losing their way, minute by minute, victims of a world where the pressure to be hot and cool and successful and self-confident has reached a fever pitch. (We can probably thank the Internet for most of that, but that's another story.) I look back at my Bob Marley Cassette years as pretty great years. Yes, I fried some brain cells, BUT I also grew other new brain cells—very creative ones, actually—that spurred me on to pretty cool things. Things like garage bands and intense friendships and seeing a black bear cub in every single tree in the mountains of Pennsylvania one night that to this day, I have a distinct love affair with black bear cubs.Let's get real: Kids are going to experiment. I don't want mine to come anywhere near the insane modern dragon that is meth or the old cannonball around your neck that is coke. Even the LSD that runs in their veins from when you and I were the ones probably taking it, I don't want my kids anywhere near that wack sh*t, okay? Do I want my kids all up in Bob Marley Cassettes? Hell no. But it wouldn't make me weep or freak out, either. I probably won't spazz if my kids ever find out that I was a young, brace-faced, chubby, anti-hero in high school who happened to really enjoy his Bob Marley Cassettes.Everything in its time and place, mama.Everything in its time and place, daddy-o.Read more from YourTango: 3 ways to like yourself more 4 reasons to marry an emotionally complex man Watch out world: I'm newly divorced and off my meds"
4,WOMEN,3 Women's Health Issues Every Thinking Man (and Woman!) Should Know About,"Kate Grant, ContributorCEO, Fistula Foundation",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/3-womens-health-issues-ev_b_6813858.html,"As women break barriers and crack glass ceilings in countries like the U.S., in much of the developing world, women and girls still face staggering challenges to their health and well-being. This week seems like the right day to recognize three of them.",2015-03-10,2015-03-06-1425618627-9075856-GonieandKateGrant.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-06-1425618627-9075856-GonieandKateGrant-thumb.jpg,"March 8th, 2015 was International Women's Day. It's the 104th time the day has been celebrated. As women break barriers and crack glass ceilings in countries like the U.S., in much of the developing world, women and girls still face staggering challenges to their health and well-being. This week seems like the right day to recognize three of them. Child Marriage: Did you know that one in three girls in the developing world marries before she turns 18? Too often these early marriages happen without a girl's consent, depriving her of the chance to finish school and often resulting in her becoming a mother before she is physically and emotionally ready. This can result in birth injuries, such as obstetric fistula, and worse, maternal death. Childbirth is among the leading causes of death among girls 15 - 19.Obstetric Fistula: This childbirth injury is caused by prolonged obstructed labor, which leaves a young woman or girl incontinent and too often a social outcast. Poverty is at the root of this tragic, but preventable, problem that is most of the time treatable with surgery. There are at least one million women with untreated fistula who are leading lives of depravation, misery and isolation simply for trying to bring a child into the world. Here's a young woman I met, Goni, at age 15. She was married at 13, quickly became pregnant and delivered a stillborn baby at 14, and developed an obstetric fistula during delivery.  Location: Gondar University Hospital, Ethiopia after surgery to repair Goni's fistula.Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) /Female Genital Cutting (FGC):  You may have already heard about this practice, where female external genitalia are removed often with a razor or sharp knife, usually without anesthesia or proper medical attention. Though the practice has no medical benefit, it can lead to significant health problems; it is widespread in countries in Africa and Asia. UNICEF estimates over 130 million women and girls have had FGM/FGC performed on their young bodies, the vast majority while they were still girls, under 15 years of age.Each of these difficult problems - child marriage, obstetric fistula and FGM/FGC have something important in common: they largely impact poor women and girls who too often do not have the power to stop them. But the good news is that there is work being done right now to combat each of them, so that at some point each may be history rather than a heartbreaking reality. Here are a few quick ideas of things you can do with this information:1. Learn More: Child Marriage: Wikipedia is helpful. Or check out Girls Not Brides, a path-breaking global campaign that is creating a worldwide movement to end child marriage. There's lots of great information on their website. (Full disclosure: Fistula Foundation is one of the 400 groups that are part of their network.)Obstetric Fistula: Again, Wikipedia is helpful. I'm particularly partial to the Fistula Foundation website. Check out also, the Global Fistula Map, developed by Direct Relief, Fistula Foundation and the UNFPA's Campaign to End Fistula.FGM/FGC: The Wikipedia information provides a good overview. The World Health Organization has information that's helpful, too. Want to be inspired? Read more about two women who I revere: Molly Melching and Edna Adan, both working on opposite sides of the African continent to empower communities to end FGM/FGC. (Full disclosure: Fistula Foundation, where I work, has funded both of these women's work.)2. Tell a Friend:  E-mail this post to a thoughtful guy - or gal - you know - a friend, your brother/sister, your dad/mom, your son/daughter, your uncle/aunt. The first step to changing the world for women and girls is creating awareness of what needs to be changed. You can take that simple but important step by sharing this with someone you know."
5,WOMEN,"Now That International Women's Day Is Over, What We Need Is More International Women!","Gail Becker, ContributorFounder and CEO, CAULIPOWER",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/now-that-international-womens-day-is-over-what-we-need-is-more-international-women_b_6834472.html,"Is it because women aren't being considered for the international assignments, or because they aren't taking them?",2015-03-10,Office lady is using tablet with city view from windows at background,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb601962600002d0182df4c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This post first appeared on Edelman.com.""Is this fair to the children?"" ""You should wait until kids are older."" ""I wish I had the balls to do what you do.""Those were just some of the reactions Heidi Eusebio, a friend and colleague, heard when she decided to move across countries and continents with her husband and children (ages 4 and 7) for a terrific job opportunity. ""On one end I was seen as a role model and called a 'hero' by women around me,"" recalls Heidi. ""On the other end, I was seen as selfish and almost like a villain.""The only thing criminal about the experience outlined above are the type of reactions she received and the still relative unease surrounding women on international assignments in today's global economy. A managing director of strategy at a management consultancy calls international experience a crucial differentiator for current and future leaders: ""Our clients increasingly operate seamlessly across borders. Our people need to be able to do the same.""Further to the point, PwC's* Developing Tomorrow's Leaders report finds that 69 percent of female Millennials would like to work outside of their home country during their career and 63 percent of female Millennials feel international experience is critical to furthering their career. Yet only 20 percent of current international assignees are female. That's particularly impactful, given PwC's prediction that the number of workers who will take on global assignments will rise by 50 percent over the next decade.That leaves many of us wondering, ""Why?"" Is it because women aren't being considered for the international assignments, or because they aren't taking them?In a report titled Misconceptions About Women in the Global Arena Keep Their Numbers Low, the research firm Catalyst tried to find those answers by interviewing more than 1,000 women and men, including current and former expatriates, their spouses, frequent flyers and human resources executives. Survey respondents believed that women are not as ""internationally mobile"" as men, yet 80 percent of women expatriates (working abroad) have never turned down a relocation, compared to 71 percent of men. Some respondents believed clients outside the U.S. are not as comfortable doing business with women as they are with men. Yet, 76 percent of expatriate women said being a woman had a positive or neutral impact on their effectiveness overseas.In order to increase the percentage of women in these roles, Catalyst and others recommend that companies implement formal policies and programs that offer women global assignments throughout their career; improve employment support for dual-career couples; offer mentoring and networking support while abroad; value alternatives to relocation; and assist expatriates on transitioning back to the U.S.According to Diversity, Inc., here are nine things that companies can do to encourage women to take positions abroad:1. Provide a peer support system for women to help keep your top performers in the workforce.And I'll add a tenth: make international assignments a stated and very public priority for the bottom line of your business. If you're not in a position to do so, then raise the issue with those who are.Taking on an international assignment is a big decision for anyone to be sure. Women not only need the support of their employers and colleagues, but also from their partners, spouses, friends and families. As Sheryl Sandberg says, we need to #LeanInTogether to support women in pursuing their career ambitions, no matter where in the world it takes them.As for Heidi, she and her family are all thriving on their international journey.

6,POLITICS,Supreme Court To Review How Florida Doles Out The Death Penalty,Kim Bellware,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/florida-death-penalty-supreme-court_n_6834380.html,,2015-03-10,Facade of US Supreme court in Washington DC on sunny day,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ecd4200000f90101d9a6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The U.S. Supreme Court announced Monday that it will review how Florida decides which convicted criminals are eligible for the death sentence. Florida law limits the power of the jury in that decision, arguably in violation of an earlier high court ruling.The justices agreed to hear an appeal from Timothy Lee Hurst, who was sentenced to death in 2000 for killing Cynthia Harrison, his co-worker at a Popeye's restaurant in Pensacola, Florida. In its order, the high court said it would weigh the Florida law under the Sixth Amendment (which secures the right to a fair trial) and the Eighth Amendment (which bans cruel and unusual punishment) in light of its 2002 decision in Ring v. Arizona. In that earlier ruling, the court had held that it was the role of the jury, not the judge, to determine whether the ""aggravating factors"" needed to apply the death penalty exist in a particular case. In Hurst's case, the jury voted 7-5 that he was eligible for the death penalty, according to U.S. News & World Report. In 1998, he had stabbed and slashed Harrison with a box cutter at least 60 times before leaving her in a freezer and making off with cash from the safe. Under Florida's sentencing rules, the jury's broad recommendation then went to a judge, who determined the specific factors that made Hurst eligible for a death sentence. That sentence and the means by which it was reached were upheld by the Florida Supreme Court.Before the U.S. Supreme Court, lawyers for Hurst argue that he is mentally disabled as a result of fetal alcohol syndrome and that this fact was not given adequate consideration during his sentencing. Hurst, who was 19 at the time of the murder, was found to have a full-scale IQ of 69, according to his appeal. (The Supreme Court had also ruled in 2002 that executing people with mental disabilities is unconstitutional.) Hofstra University law professor Eric Freedman told U.S. News that the Florida Supreme Court's failure to abide by Ring v. Arizona ""has long been a conspicuous flaw in the Florida system.""The Supreme Court will consider Hurst v. Florida in its next term, which begins in October. This spring, the justices will hear oral arguments in another death penalty case regarding the constitutionality of Oklahoma's lethal injection protocol."

A giant, 150-foot roll of bubble wrap may not be your idea of an environmentally friendly product, but over at Walmart.com this one-pound ball of plastic now boasts a special ""Sustainability Leaders"" badge. It's one of more than 3,000 products tagged with this new green label, which Walmart executives unveiled last week, together with a web portal where shoppers can find these items. Dozens of news accounts hailed the giant retailer's move as a significant step toward clearing up the confusion and misleading information that often greets consumers trying to make ecologically responsible choices. ""The world's largest retailer took a major and important step toward helping all of us shop more smartly,"" declared corporate sustainability consultant Andrew Winston in Harvard Business Review. Triple Pundit concurred: ""It's about to get a lot easier for Walmart.com shoppers to make the responsible choice.""Actually, a green-minded online shopper is likely to find Walmart's new badge confusing, murky, and downright misleading. I searched the bubble wrap's product page high and low for its secret sauce, the invisible feature that makes it a smarter choice amid the many seemingly less harmful packing options available, but found no explanation. It turns out that the key to this mystery lies in a remarkable disclaimer tucked into the middle of the home page of Walmart's sustainability shopping portal: ""The Sustainability Leaders badge does not make representations about the environmental or social impact of an individual product.""Well then. Once again Walmart has engineered an appealing media story about itself as a green innovator that has little to do with reality. Here's how the retailer's new badge works: Walmart awards the label to products made by companies that it deems to be sustainability leaders in particular product categories, such as plastic toys or dairy foods. Those that win the label get to use it on all of their products in that category, regardless of how harmful or toxic some items might be. To decide which of its suppliers are ""leaders,"" Walmart sends them a survey with about a dozen questions. Neither the questions nor the responses are public. The only thing we know is that the questions were developed by the Sustainability Consortium, a collaboration funded by about 100 big-name companies and groups, including many of the world's largest retail and consumer products brands. Launched with a seed grant from Walmart, the consortium is managed by the University of Arkansas and Arizona State University, both of which have deep financial ties to the company. Since 2009, the Walton family, the billionaire clan that owns more than half of Walmart, has donated at least $49 million to these two universities. In addition to developing the surveys, the consortium has also produced fact sheets ostensibly designed to empower Walmart shoppers with usable information. I dug into several of these -- including the one on plastic products, which I thought might shed some light on the bubble wrap question -- only to find uselessly generic statements punctuated periodically by a disconcerting phrase. For example: ""Manufacturers should educate consumers about proper disposal [of plastic products] and participate in programs to recover end-of-life plastic for recycling into new products or use as a fuel source."" A fuel source? The Sustainability Leaders badge is straight out of Walmart's ten-year-old greenwashing playbook: Announce an initiative that the media is sure to (mis)interpret as a game-changer and then quietly fail to deliver anything close to the promise. Indeed, we've been around this particular block before. In 2009, Walmart declared that it would, within five years, produce an environmental grade for every product on its shelves. News outlets ate it up. ""Wal-Mart Stores is on a mission,"" the New York Times reported. ""The idea is to create a universal rating system that scores products based on how environmentally and socially sustainable they are over the course of their lives. Consider it the green equivalent to nutrition labels."" Six years have now gone by and no such rating system has materialized. None of Walmart's green initiatives have generated as much sustained public relations mileage as its oft-repeated pledge, first made a decade ago, to switch its U.S. stores to 100 percent renewable power. Today only three percent of Walmart's U.S. electricity comes from its renewable energy projects and purchases, according to the EPA. Meanwhile, more than 40 percent of its power comes from coal, according to an analysis by the Institute for Local Self-Reliance (my organization). In the wake of last November's massive protests at Walmart stores nationwide -- during which environmentalists joined workers in calling the company out -- Walmart executives now seem to be trying to pivot away from earlier promises. Last week, at the event unveiling the Sustainability Leaders badge, CEO Doug McMillon said Walmart was moving to the ""next phase"" of sustainability. McMillon bragged that the company had already reached one-quarter renewable energy. That's a misleading number. It's a global figure that includes renewable power Walmart is pulling from the grid in countries like Canada (hydropower) and Brazil (hydropower and biomass). Here in the U.S., where coal-generated power is cheap, Walmart remains deeply committed to dirty energy and lags many other retailers in investing in solar and wind. Walmart's new green labels are more of the same -- a way to keep the public conversation about the company's impact confined within its own narrow terms, all the while obscuring the deep problems at the heart of Walmart's business model. As Walmart has grown, so too has the scale of our consumption. Each year, we go through more televisions and tee-shirts, blenders and desk chairs, than ever before, as big-box retailers undermine product quality and move an ever larger volume of shoddy goods from factory to store to house to landfill. Just two weeks ago, Walmart told its suppliers they would have to find ways to cut costs even further, a directive that almost invariably entails cutting corners -- exploiting workers, dumping toxins in waterways, making goods that won't hold up. It's an imperative directly at odds with sustainability. But never mind all that; I know where you can buy an eco-friendly roll of bubble wrap, cheap._____Stacy Mitchell is co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance.

There are so many things I wish I had known when I first fell on that patch of ice, landing directly on my skull. The sound of the ""thud"" is something I will never be able to clear from my head. It is my scar, my reminder of how quickly life can change. I knew from the excruciating pain I was experiencing at the impact point on my head that it was bad, real bad. But I had no idea how my life was about to change.I consider myself fortunate to have found a Doctor right away who specializes in head injuries and concussions. However, there are still many things I feel he could have done differently to prepare me for the unexpected roller coaster that I was just getting onto. I hadn't even buckled the proverbial seatbelt yet in terms of what I was about to experience.I remember the first day pretty vividly. I fell at about 8 a.m. and was at the doctor's office by 10 a.m. He checked me over and stated that I a severe concussion and had also torn a few muscles in my neck, throat, and chest. Oddly, I didn't feel any pain other than the piercing knife stabbing into my skull. It hadn't even occurred to me yet that I had other physical injuries. It was actually almost two full days before the pain set in, and then it felt like I had been run over by a truck.I noticed many cognitive deficiencies right away the first day I fell. I was told that this was ""normal"" and I should start to see improvement in 6-8 weeks. So as I neared the end of the eighth week I was starting to panic. ""What's wrong with me? Why am I not getting better? Is there something seriously wrong?"" I was experiencing a lot of confusion, and I was having a lot of trouble finding the word I was looking for, and you could hear in my speech that I was taking longer to complete sentences than I should. My doctor finally sent me to a neurologist at this point, who ordered an MRI to rule out anything severe. It wasn't until this point that anyone started talking about TBI. Even then, I was told it could take a few months to improve, and then not until the six-month mark that I was told it could even take up to a year or longer.What I wish more than anything was that my doctors had been more forthcoming with me. I understand that every brain injury is different, and not everyone will suffer the same symptoms and time frames. However, in hindsight, it is pretty clear to me that 6-8 weeks isn't a realistic timeline. I have no doubt in my doctor's abilities, and I know he was trying to do me a ""favor"" by telling me I'd be fine in no time. But the truth is, I think he was damaging my recovery efforts by doing so. I wish I had been sent to occupational therapy right away. The neurologist brought it up, but nothing ever came of it. I wasn't in a proper state of mind to advocate for my health in the way that I normally would. I didn't have a caregiver or spouse living with me that could advocate either. I was alone in my journey.When I reached the six-month mark of my recovery, I started experiencing more dizzy and balance issues than I had been having previously. I started having anxiety because I didn't know what was wrong with me, I was worried that I should be getting better because that is what the Doctor had said. I was thrown into a very dark, lonely place. I was starting to become depressed, something that I wasn't familiar with. I knew I was depressed, yet I didn't know what to do about it. I had no one in my support system to turn to. I felt very isolated and alone.This cycle of despair went on for about three or four months before I had a complete and total panic attack. I honestly thought I was having a heart attack. My heart was racing, my body felt like it was floating, I wanted to cry and scream, but I had no idea why. Fortunately a dear friend was home and helped me calm down. She knew what was happening, as she had experienced panic attacks before herself. I was left feeling shaken and scared. ""What is wrong with me?"" I kept thinking.The next day I spoke to my doctor about what had happened. He assured me that this was ""normal"" and part of the recovery process. He was expecting it, as he knew that it would eventually happen to me, and was surprised it had taken me this long to have one. This was yet another thing I wish I had known about, it would have saved me from the deep sense of fear I had been feeling during the panic attack. Fortunately since that night, I have not had another attack. I have occasions where I feel the anxiety creeping up, but I am now able to fight it off with deep breathing and meditation. It has been 13 months since my fall, and I am just NOW starting physical therapy for my injuries and occupational therapy for my cognitive issues. I feel like I am late to the party, that I should have been here months ago. Late is better than never, but I have never been one to be fashionably late. There are so many other things I wish I had known in the beginning, the list could go on and on. I realize that our doctors can't predict the future or know exactly what is happening inside our brains. Again, I feel blessed to have found a doctor right away that understood concussions and TBI. My wish is that more doctors would begin to understand the true complexity of TBI, no matter how seemingly innocent the injury appears at first. Patients and caregivers value and appreciate knowing the ""worse case scenario"" so that they have something to strive for (not being ""worse case"") and can feel like a warrior when they come out on top!Read my other blogs on The Huffington Post: ""Life With a Traumatic Brain Injury"" ""Life With a TBI: March is National Brain Injury Awareness Month"" ""5 Things Every TBI Survivor Wants you to Understand""Please join my Facebook Tribe if you are a survivor, caretaker, or loved one!"

I saw it performed recently and felt instantly inspired to dive back into the world of competitive dancing. On a whim, I signed up to compete in an international Latin ballroom dancing exhibition in May. I've certainly got a lot of work to do to transform myself into a contender - not only physically but also mentally. And, as the co-owner of a technology and business performance consulting firm, I don't have a lot of time to do it.Business and dancing seem like two pretty different animals, don't they? But, they really have more in common than you realize. It can not only help you transform your happiness in the workplace, but focus your mind to recognize patterns and then identify and pursue relevant opportunities. When coaching executive clients, I walk them through the ""steps"" I follow as I prepare to perform and compete, such as sharpening my mental focus, increasing alertness, calling upon my memory, and recognizing patterns. Patterns are around us every day and every moment. The key is to open your mind and recognize them. Here are six steps to fall into the rhythm of optimizing pattern recognition and achieving an enhanced sense of fulfillment in your career.1. Be Mindful Explore deeply, reconnect to your core purpose, and accept that you're going through a state of renewal and transformation in an effort to revitalize and evolve yourself, your partners (employees, customers, resources, etc.), your business, and your community. Once you're mindful of your reason for taking a leap into a new venture, you can step forward into the dance of movement, enhancement, and empowerment.For example, as I prepare I break down a new dance routine, I focus on the foundational level first -- working from the ground then slowly moving up. I first start with my feet, then the legs, hips, chest, arms, and up to my head. Even if I am working on a familiar routine, it's crucial to always circle back to the foundation. By taking an iterative approach of constant improvement, we recognize new patterns of movement or music that can lead to the next big step.2. Communicate, Connect and Balance As with ballroom dancing, business takes two (or more) to tango. Be mindful of your partner's thought process - what influences them, what direction are they used to traveling, why do they follow certain dance step patterns. It's crucial to communicate and connect with each other. Observe and be conscious of your partner's behavior. For example, if your partner is repeatedly getting sick or having trouble managing time -- stop and assess what's going on. To learn about your own patterns of behavior, you may need to stop and examine someone else's. Then, observe patterns in your own behavior. It doesn't have to be a major discovery. It could be something small, like noticing that you tend to have more energy to practice in the mornings than in the afternoons. Try to spend some time each day in reflective thought looking for patterns and observing your habits. From there, tweak your behavior based on your findings. If you make this a regular practice, it will readily come to you. This activity will then shift from your conscious mind to your subconscious mind, which is the goal.Connection and balance is also about life management. Focus on nutrition, stress management, time management, as it's very important to live in balance. You can't say yes to everything. Sometimes you need to say no and focus on what is important. By connecting with yourself, you will find that you connect better with others.True focus requires balance. If you're looking to elevate your dancing (at work or at home) to the next level, you must do what is required to bring things into focus, acting on patterns observed by listening to yourself and your partners.3. Step Out of Your Own Way in Order to Open Your Mind to Change My dance partner, Dmitry Savchenko, shared with me why dance coaches are so important. The student may have a gut feeling that a certain move is not working, but isn't exactly sure why. That's when an outside expert is needed to serve as a guide who can see the total picture and offer a path to a solution. In order to truly develop a better routine, dancers must learn to step out of their own way and get out of their head. This is when patterns can be recognized - when you are open to change and move out of your own way. Dmitry continued, ""many times I see people trying to correct the actual movements, when it's the preparation for it that leads up to the figures that are causing the issue to start with. This becomes a very interesting discovery process noticing the patterns. That's why you need to spend equal time in preparation and in execution.""4. Visualize Your Performance The persona you create for yourself can have a very powerful impact on how the judges (or your colleagues and superiors) see you. Dream about what is possible. Clearly visualize your ideal image, style and desired characteristics and work towards those goals. Identify what you see as patterns of success, and think about what from that appeals to you. Having a can-do attitude attracts possibilities and opportunities, and draws people to you. Often times, people with a strong, charismatic presence are those that have trained their brains to notice patterns and opportunities, perhaps unconsciously, through repeated focus and awareness. Think of some of your favorite celebrities, and focus on the qualities they exude. As a dancer, I love Shakira. Her hips definitely don't lie, and her confidence and independence are traits that I emulate. Challenge and push yourself, but realize that small changes and tweaks can also have big impacts.5. Evaluate -- Call Upon Your Mastermind IntelligenceIt's all about perception. Once you identify what drives your dance performance, your business, services or products, it's time to see how others see you. Customers' buying decisions are based upon their perception of the best value available. Value is comprised of service, quality and price. Note that it's ""perceived value"" that counts. You have a great deal of control over that perception; in how you and your employees present your company in person, advertising, correspondence and brochures, and what you deliver in product or services. If you clearly understand your company's technical and marketing strengths relative to your competitors, you can deliver a consistent and powerful message. A key success factor is to periodically test to see how your customers' perceptions have evolved - to always know what they really think about your firm.Train your brain to scan for possibilities brought on by external changes. As we discussed, constant repetition will create an unconscious habit so that eventually you will be doing this without even being aware of it. Start by taking notice of what has changed outside of your business. Is there a pattern to this activity?When I compete, how I feel about my performance is very important. But, do you know what's more important? What the judges think about my performance? It's no different in business.6. Stop Focusing on What Your Next Move Should Be Everything we've discussed up until this point is very cerebral and purpose-driven. Now, I'm going to tell you that you must also do the opposite at times in order to have a truly brilliant performance. Our brains use past information and experiences to try to predict what will happen next. By automatically relying on these assumptions and predictions, we may be blinded to possibilities and outcomes that we've not yet experienced. If we lean too heavily on the tendency to do what we've always done and close our eyes to new stimuli in the environment (an uneven floor, a broken shoe) then we will stumble and fall. But, if we're tuned in and alert to the fact that our minds are often on autopilot, we can train ourselves to be open to new patterns and adapt to our ever-changing environments.The only way to see how you'll do in a new situation is to get out ""On the Floor,"" just like Jennifer Lopez and Pitbull sang in their 2014 song. That's where you can uncover and discover what potential lies within you.It is important to stay grounded, stable, balanced and connected to the rhythm of the dance. Empower your memory and welcome the recognition of patterns so you can investigate the pathways that will transform your business. By following these six steps to recognize patterns of opportunities and challenges, you'll be able to capture, interpret, relate, and transform. Even if you're not the best dancer at first, by having the willingness to start small, you just might stumble onto something wonderful."

Let us also observe The Daily Beast investigate Facebook messages between a Columbia University woman and the student on her campus she has publicly accused of rape. Why is it that when it comes to violence against women, the conversation always turns to questions about why she stayed or continued to say ""I love you"" or why she did what she did. It's the same old story of focusing all the attention on the victim and if she has the ""credibility"" to accuse. Unfortunately, these are the types of feature stories that have recently been emerging on powerful media platforms in response to campus rape accusations. At best, this is a sorely missed opportunity. At worst, the media may be perpetuating the norms that cause the violence it's covering. An intense media narrative about campus sexual assault could be a powerful tool for culture change, to prevent the shamefully high percentage of young women raped while at college. But not just any media narrative will do. Rather than keeping the spotlight on factors that perpetuate violence year after year, the media conversation has veered into the same victim-shaming ditch we have been trying to climb out of for generations. Such misdirected conversations coupled with old, toxic norms about gender and violence have continued to perpetuate a conversation about rape that does little to stop the epidemic. Rolling Stone's initial walk-back of its coverage of an alleged gang rape at the University of Virginia last fall fed the very stereotypes that have halted real progress for decades. As long as we continue to need to tell sensationalist, victim-focused stories to propel a conversation about violence against women, our progress will be sporadic.The real opportunity is to examine the cultural cues that keep violence deeply imbedded in our nation's traditions so that we can make violence against women unacceptable. Sorority members at the University of Virginia exemplified this well when they recently protested a request by national sorority leadership that they stay sequestered from parties to ensure their safety. The students asked why not address the underlying factors that make campus parties unsafe, rather than make women once again responsible for whether or not she is raped? It's a common sense reaction, but was received with great confusion by the national leadership. This flare up is a classic example of the blinders we often put on about rape.Violence against women is learned, not innate or inevitable. It's everyone's problem and everyone's responsibility to solve, and we urgently need to insist on keeping our focus on challenging the culture of violence that perpetuates values almost none of us want to embrace. Men and boys can be leaders of change and partners in ending violence against women. Imagine what might happen if we point the magnifying glass in another direction, toward the root causes of violence: gender inequality and toxic gender norms that encourage men to behave violently to ""perform masculinity,"" and encourage women to tolerate abusive relationships in order to ""perform femininity"" (not to mention the economic reasons many women have to stay due to broader socioeconomic inequality.)Campus life is only one arena where violence is rampant. Sexual assault among young women not living on a campus is still largely in the shadows. Women are facing so much abuse online that they're leaving these spaces in droves (but even that excellent piece in the Washington Post did not explore why men harass so collectively and viciously, and how that can be stopped.What if we heard more stories about men taking responsibility for their hurtful actions in the media? Or helped audiences see the deeply entrenched ways that the culture of violence lives among us? What if we collectively focused our efforts on encouraging interruptions to daily acts of violence, including street and online harassment? What if we worked directly with fraternities to ensure their new pledges embrace cultural norms that reject gender bias and violence, from sexist jokes to rape? When women and men, bystanders and communities, stand up against violence, we make spaces safe for women and families everywhere.As long as we're asking why she stayed or what was she wearing, we will never ask why he committed this crime and what in our culture enabled him. The answers to those questions are the only ones that will solve this problem once and for all."

But in a bizarre twist, Ronald McDonald and friends are suing the city. On March 10, they'll be in a federal courtroom, complaining that the new minimum wage violates a constitutional provision that was written to protect newly-freed slaves after the Civil War. Most people can't survive on Washington's current statewide minimum wage of $9.47, let alone the federal minimum wage of $7.25. Even if the sophisticated crew-scheduling software let you work 40 hours a week at $9.47 for every single week of the year, you wouldn't clear $20,000. In the end, 52 percent of fast food workers end up on public assistance. You'll find similar stories for other minimum wage workers, such as hotel maids and nursing home assistants.That's why the Seattle City Council spent months studying the idea of raising the city's minimum wage. To be sure, some business leaders made economic arguments against raising the minimum wage. Others agreed with workers that a higher minimum wage would actually benefit business overall, or at least were willing to negotiate. The city council heard the arguments on both sides, evaluated their merits, sweated over the details, and ultimately voted to pass a minimum wage ordinance, which the city's mayor then signed into law.That should be the end of the story. But, as too often happens these days, corporate trial lawyers have brought expensive litigation to try to stop the law from going into effect. The International Franchise Association, with assistance from the National Restaurant Association and other industry trade groups, is claiming that the law is not just bad for their bottom line, but actually violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.That amendment was passed in 1866 to ensure equal rights for the freed slaves, and it says that no state may ""deny to any person ... the equal protection of the laws."" According to the Hamburglar, treating a franchised business differently from a local business violates this Equal Protection Clause.But what about the equal protection rights of the people who work in these businesses? Our historical research has found that the drafters of the Fourteenth Amendment were very interested in employer-employee relations, and in particular, whether workers could earn ""fair, living wages."" That phrase doesn't come from some union organizer or activist in Seattle: it comes from Senator Jacob Howard, a staunch Republican who was the Fourteenth Amendment's Senate floor manager back in 1866, and whose statements on the concerns motivating the Fourteenth Amendment are a little more important than the legal opinions of Grimace and Captain Crook. And during the Congressional hearings documented in the official report of the committee that proposed the amendment, Senator Howard asked over and over whether employers would pay ""fair, living wages."" Of course, a living wage wasn't the only concern behind the Fourteenth Amendment. But, unlike protection of the franchised business model, it was definitely part of the overall goals. Given how important the idea of ""fair, living wages"" was to the authors of the Fourteenth Amendment, it's shameful for the McNugget Buddies to claim that the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause should protect them, rather than real human workers with families to feed. But it's not surprising. Ever since the Fourteenth Amendment was passed, corporate lawyers have tried to leverage it into a racket to strike down laws like Seattle's. In 1938, a frustrated Supreme Court justice complained that ""of the cases in [the] Court in which the Fourteenth Amendment was applied during the first fifty years after its adoption, less than one-half of 1 percent invoked it in protection of the negro race, and more than 50 percent asked that its benefits be extended to corporations."" Just this past year, we've seen the Equal Protection Clause invoked on behalf of coal companies and multinational agribusiness conglomerates. And now, the Fry Kids. Meanwhile, the actual workers who are now slaving away for poverty wages -- the restaurant cooks, hotel maids, janitors, and others -- are suffering. While in days past many of these workers were teenagers looking for extra spending money, today most of them are adults, often with children. And they're all struggling to survive without ""fair, living wages."" We need to put a stop to this dangerous constitutional argument. The businesses had their opportunity to make their case to the city, and they lost. They shouldn't be allowed to run to court carrying in the banner of the Fourteenth Amendment. As President Lincoln famously said, government should be ""of the people, by the people, [and] for the people."" And Mayor McCheese doesn't get a veto."

There was controversial Christian historian David Barton scoffing that Islam's influence could be seen mainly in the role followers of Muhammad played in the slave trade and the Barbary Wars, while South Carolina Congressman Jeff Duncan wondered if the president's ""Jakarta elementary education"" might be responsible for his view of the past. An editor of a Catholic newspaper put doubts about the president's historical literacy plainly when he asked, ""Is he high?""But it's not up for argument that this majority Christian nation has a spiritual history much more diverse than usually supposed. As Obama's critics have noted, there were, of course, no Muslims among the Founding Fathers. Thomas Jefferson and John Adams both owned copies of the Quran, but they may have been as unaware of Muslims living in the young United States as David Barton and Jeff Duncan are today.Muslims' presence here is affirmed in documents dated more than a century before religious liberty became the law of the land, as in a Virginia statute of 1682 which referred to ""negroes, moores, molatoes, and others, born of and in heathenish, idollatrous, pagan, and Mahometan parentage and country"" who ""heretofore and hereafter may be purchased, procured, or otherwise obteigned, as slaves.""The number of Muslims brought to this predominantly Christian land would have equalled the populations of many religious groups in 18th century America. In fact, men and women with connections to Islam in the newly independent United States would have rivaled the memberships of Methodist or Roman Catholic churches, and far exceeded the number of Jews. No one would challenge the notion that these other faiths ""have been woven into the fabric of our country,"" so why has the presence of Muslims in early America been forgotten? In part because the role of religion in the origins of slavery has been replaced in popular memory with later distinctions made according to race. Some of the original slavery laws actually were more concerned with the content of forced laborers' beliefs than with the color of their skin. From the perspective of Europeans of the time, the reason for this was clear: Belief could spread in a way that color could not. Even in 1685, a Spanish law stated, ""The introduction of Mohammedan slaves into America is forbidden on account of the danger which lies in their intercourse with the Indians."" Religious difference was regarded as highly contagious, and thus dangerous.In the English colonies of North America to which we more often trace our nation's history, slave owners originally assumed Christians should not be slaves. Christian servants might work for a predetermined period under slave-like indenture, but the duration of their servitude was limited by definition. Non­-Christians, on the other hand, could be trapped in bondage for life.This arrangement soon proved untenable, however. If slavery was defined in relation to belief, conversion would become a potential path to freedom. Only after a Virginia law of 1667 guaranteed that baptism would not ""alter the condition of the person as to his bondage or freedom,"" did English settlers declare that all enslaved men and women ""brought or imported into this country, either by sea or land, whether Negroes, Moors, Mollattoes or Indians... shall be converted to the Christian faith.""The motivation for this was as much a matter of control as a genuine desire to spread the gospel. Praising the ""beneficial effects of religious instruction"" on the enslaved, one slaveholder later wrote, ""those who have grown up under such instruction are more honest, truthful, moral... and devoted to their owners' interests than those who have not enjoyed the same advantages."" Given this history, it's no surprise that the place of Islam in the nation's past should make so many so uncomfortable. It was actively eradicated and replaced by the religious tradition with which the majority of Americans identify today. Muslims were indeed here from the beginning, but the beliefs and practices they brought with them only rarely endured. Their experiences serve as a reminder that every faith woven into the fabric of our country has been made up of strands both light and dark.Image: Portrait of the enslaved Muslim Yarrow Mamout by Charles Willson Peale (1819), via Wikimedia."

Religious rights are protected under a law called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.The Notre Dame case was the only appeals court decision on that issue that pre-dated the Hobby Lobby ruling.The compromise allows the groups to certify they are opting out, which then forces insurers to pick up the tab.Notre Dame says the certification process still essentially forces the groups to authorize the coverage for its employees, even if they are not technically paying for it. Religious institutions are exempt from the contraception coverage requirement.The case is Notre Dame v. Burwell, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 14-392.

(Photo by Jon Furniss Photography/Invision/AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4a935240000310097a6a9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last fall, CBS announced that Tony Award-winner James Corden would take over “The Late Late Show,” replacing Craig Ferguson. Corden is best known for his roles in “Into the Woods,” ""Begin Again"" and for his award-winning performance in the play “One Man, Two Guvnors,” which was a West End and Broadway hit.But that's not the typical CV for a late night American talk show host. CBS Entertainment chairwoman Nina Tassler told The New York Times, “The identity and the quality of the host informs the kind of show you’re going to do. Once we knew that James was our guy, the format was going to be developed and derived from who James is.” That sounds like a whole lot of pressure. But his lack of experience in the hosting world, mixed with his anonymity within American culture, might just prove to be a blessing.“There's a freedom to it,” he said in an interview with The Huffington Post. “You really have an opportunity to come with no baggage and speak to people and say this is us, this is our show, and we would love for you to spend the last hour of your day here. We are going to try our best to make you smile.”But it’s a double-edged sword, he continued. “The bad side is how do you get them there to hear that message? We can only do so much to get people to tune in. From what I can see, the television habits of people in America is all about the lead-in.” Fortunately, Corden has two of those, at least during this first year. His “Late Late Show” starts on March 23, two months before David Letterman steps away from ""The Late Show""; come fall, Corden will directly follow Stephen Colbert’s new show on CBS. Corden recently said that he wants his show to be like “Stephen Colbert’s younger brother with ADHD,” but told us that they don’t even know what Colbert's show will be like just yet.“I don’t know if Stephen knows yet. I think it’s our job to make it feel like two hours of television,” he said. “So Stephen is going to make his show and we’ll mold ours after we see what that is. I think we have to give people a reason to stick with us. But I’m talking like I have a clue -- I have no idea what I’m talking about!”Corden is horribly likable. He is warm and welcoming. He takes off his sneakers before curling up on his sofa for our interview. He wears jeans and a T-shirt. He has two other pairs of shoes lined up side by side at the foot of his desk -- a pair of sneakers and a pair of shiny, formal black dress shoes. His laugh is like hitting the jackpot, every time. In some ways, he feels like a younger, cheerier Ricky Gervais. His office is bare and looks like he just got there. A Tom Ford gift bag rests on top of a dresser, next to a lit candle and a fancy box of Dom Pérignon champagne. In fact, there are so many candles lit in the office that it has started to smell like a working log cabin. “I am going to do something with this room,” he said emphatically. But right now it's crunch time to get the show up and running this month. Even sleep has taken a back seat. ""There’s been no time for naps,"" Corden said.Next door (just a brisk walk past the CBS helipad), the set to his future is being built. Dozens upon dozens of crew members hammer, saw, shift lights and tweak the Hollywood Hills backdrop that Corden will sit in front of each night. His request for a working bar has been granted and already put in place. Corden joins the late-night scene during a crucial time of change. Letterman and Jon Stewart are stepping down, Colbert is embarking upon a new era as “himself,” Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers are rolling in ratings and fellow Brit, John Oliver -- whom Corden calls “fiercely bright"" -- is making every executive at HBO practically giddy.But aside from a joke about his weight from Letterman, it appears that the days of late-night feuds are over. Corden says Meyers was the first person to congratulate him on his new job and that they email regularly about their favorite soccer team. “He is the nicest man on the planet,” Corden said. “I don’t even know if that’s our competition really. I think our competition is people falling asleep.” The show airs at 12:35 a.m. (a time so late that Corden’s own father practically went into shock when he heard the news) and Corden knows that it will be an uphill battle.“I’m here in Los Angeles now and I have lived in New York before, and you can feel when you’re in these places that this is ‘America.’ But I’m aware that it isn’t. How do I reach the kid or the couple or the grandparents in Ohio or Nebraska? How do I talk to them?” he asked. “The truth is, that’s just going to take time. The nature of these shows is that they are bred on familiarity. You’re checking in with someone you know and like,"" Corden said. ""Which is why, almost always, when people launch these shows, they do not get good reviews.”When asked if he’s prepared for that, Corden said, “100 percent. How do you review it? It’s like cooking a steak for 30 seconds and then eating it and saying, ‘Uh, this isn’t ready.’ This is going to evolve.”Corden believes they could spend a full year prepping for the show, but will inevitably learn more in their first two weeks of doing it. He is shockingly calm and open minded. In Variety’s cover story, he alluded to good nerves versus bad nerves and just hoping that the good nerves show up. And it’s not like he’s never performed before. He’s just never hosted. During the run of “One Man, Two Guvnors,” he remembers feeling like the whole play sat on his shoulders. “I got into some crazy superstitions. Oh my god, it was too much,” he said. “I had to put my socks on in a certain order. I couldn’t start getting dressed until the band started playing. I had to wait until a particular moment to walk out of the room and then do a special little dance. My wife would just be like, ‘What are you doing?’”He asked a sports psychologist about it at a party and was told that his behavior was all about eliminating doubt. It’s quite common with professional athletes, too. “Because however much you do it, it’s always alien,” Corden said. “It’s an alien thing to say I’m going to try and run this 100 meters faster than these guys. This is not normal.”In many ways, Corden must feel like a bit of an alien being dropped into Hollywood. During the morning our interview took place, his gigantic billboard was raised over CBS studios at rush hour. He stood on a crane with a bullhorn shouting down at pedestrians, “Hi. I am James Corden.”He moved to Los Angeles with his wife and two young children only two months ago. “I’m enjoying it very much,” he said, playing with his wedding band on his finger. “It’s funny -- I feel like I can see how life could be. But that’s so reliant on this working out!”Expect a fierce first week of the show. They have confirmed guests Tom Hanks, Kerry Washington, Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart. “I’m not afraid of any of them,” he said. “I never feel afraid. Should I be afraid? I don’t feel like I should.”“The Late Late Show with James Corden” premieres March 23 on CBS."

But it is unclear whether Abe will repeat the ""heartfelt apology"" and reference to ""colonial rule and aggression"" in that statement.In a speech at the start of her first visit to Japan since 2008, Merkel referred to a 1985 speech by the late German president Richard von Weizsaecker in which he called the end of World War Two in Europe a ""day of liberation"" and said those who closed their eyes to the past were ""blind to the present.""Asked how Germany was able to reconcile with its one-time enemies after the war, Merkel said: ""Without big gestures by our neighbors that would not have been possible ... But there was the acceptance in Germany to call things by their name.""Feuds over wartime history as well as territorial rows over disputed islands and geopolitical rivalry have frayed Tokyo's ties with Seoul and Beijing in recent years. Sino-Japanese relations have thawed a little since Abe met Chinese leader Xi Jinping last November but ties with Seoul remain frosty.Some scholars say that while Japan bears part of the blame for East Asia's inability to lay the ghosts of the war to rest because its conservative politicians often cast doubt on the sincerity of past apologies, China and South Korea also keep tensions alive because history can be a useful political and diplomatic card.

The term was first popularized by Halbert L. Dunn, M.D., who used the phrase high level wellness in the 1950s.In my experience, wellness isn't something that just happens once and you're done.

I think a lot about my own, my families friends and clients most optimum state. I explore what leads them to their own Highest Level of functioning. Since wellness is a conscious, evolving process of reaching our fullest potentials it is an ever-changing process. Wellness practitioners directly engage this process. We get you to health. But thats just the beginning. We go far beyond that and decode the sometimes hidden, swirly, nonlinear, super individual road-map of wellness for each person. We are experts at reading signs. At cracking the code on what wellness is exactly for you. We support people in walking the path to their fully actualized selves.Sure, some of us are a little ""woo woo.""But do we work? You betcha.Yes, people like me, wellness practitioners, might use words like ""soul evolution,"" ""purpose,"" ""spirit"" and ""highest being"" every day. And yes, we absolutely mean them. If I'm any example we experience these things constantly.We work with clients on far more than just health. We work on harmony and even enlightenment.   Good wellness practitioners don't ignore trauma and suffering. In my experience, we are able to work with oppression, suffering, injustice and their effects on the soul often even faster to bust through blocks and heal than more traditional methods. For many of us, a destiny and desire to support others achieve their unique wellness is part of our own evolution and contribute to our sense of fulfillment and happiness. I'm committing to my own wellness manifesto: to living, feeling and sharing wellness daily. I take this way of life and calling seriously. Ask me how I am doing: ""I'm well, thank you."" I'll reply.And I'll mean it.I'm in my highest integrity when I'm being well daily and holding that possibility out for others.

What will it be like when we are?When did we first experience wellness, and if we haven't yet what are we going to do to get there?Who might help us on our path?What is our heart calling for us to do?Let's get clear about how well we will feel and how we'll journey there.When we are ready to commit to ourselves and our wellness we'll know and the bliss will follow.Wishing you infinite wellness and beyond."

I think a lot about my own, my families friends and clients most optimum state. I explore what leads them to their own Highest Level of functioning. Since wellness is a conscious, evolving process of reaching our fullest potentials it is an ever-changing process. Wellness practitioners directly engage this process. We get you to health. But thats just the beginning. We go far beyond that and decode the sometimes hidden, swirly, nonlinear, super individual road-map of wellness for each person. We are experts at reading signs. At cracking the code on what wellness is exactly for you. We support people in walking the path to their fully actualized selves.Sure, some of us are a little ""woo woo.""But do we work? You betcha.Yes, people like me, wellness practitioners, might use words like ""soul evolution,"" ""purpose,"" ""spirit"" and ""highest being"" every day. And yes, we absolutely mean them. If I'm any example we experience these things constantly.We work with clients on far more than just health. We work on harmony and even enlightenment.   Good wellness practitioners don't ignore trauma and suffering. In my experience, we are able to work with oppression, suffering, injustice and their effects on the soul often even faster to bust through blocks and heal than more traditional methods. For many of us, a destiny and desire to support others achieve their unique wellness is part of our own evolution and contribute to our sense of fulfillment and happiness. I'm committing to my own wellness manifesto: to living, feeling and sharing wellness daily. I take this way of life and calling seriously. Ask me how I am doing: ""I'm well, thank you."" I'll reply.And I'll mean it.I'm in my highest integrity when I'm being well daily and holding that possibility out for others. So here are a few wellness questions for reflection:Where's our wellness at now?What was life like before we were well?Or if we aren't yet... What will it be like when we are?When did we first experience wellness, and if we haven't yet what are we going to do to get there?Who might help us on our path?What is our heart calling for us to do?Let's get clear about how well we will feel and how we'll journey there.When we are ready to commit to ourselves and our wellness we'll know and the bliss will follow.Wishing you infinite wellness and beyond."

It would also bolster Socialist President Francois Hollande's image as a social reformer after a hotly contested move to legalize gay marriage in 2012.Jean Leonetti, a center-right lawmaker and doctor who authored the law, told Reuters the bill would allow patients with ""hours or days to live"" to request to be placed under general anesthetic right through to the moment they die.""The patient has to be at the end of their life and suffering despite the treatment given,"" Leonetti said.""When these elements are present, I (the doctor) am obliged to start sedation that is deep and continues until death.""Such a request would effectively let patients set their own death in motion, as the state of deep sleep is irreversible. But proponents say it stops short of assisted suicide and differs from euthanasia in that the time of death cannot be determined.Currently, doctors in France can suspend treatment under some circumstances for patients who ask for it, provided they provide palliative care to reduce suffering, similar to other European countries.In Europe only Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland allow euthanasia, with doctors actively assisting patients seeking death. In the United States, Oregon, Washington and Vermont allow doctor-assisted suicide.French law has evolved little since a 2005 reform setting out when doctors could decide to suspend treatment, despite Hollande voicing support for authorizing euthanasia during his 2012 presidential campaign.But the debate returned to the fore last year with the case of Vincent Lambert, a young man who fell into a deep coma after a car crash and whose family members have clashed in French and European courts over whether or not treatment should be pursued.""(Sedation) is not a universal response to suffering at the end of life,"" said Stephane Mercier, head of the palliative care unit at Paul-Brousse hospital in Paris, adding that doctors were already equipped to ensure minimal suffering at the end of life.But pro-euthanasia campaigners said the bill does not go far enough.""Everyone says there is no suffering but nobody has ever been in that position (near death),"" said Jean-Luc Romero, head of the Right to Die in Dignity association.

(Photo by Nicole Craine/WireImage)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae07dd2000009900ff3012.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On March 7 2015, the 50th anniversary of Selma, the president recounted the awe-inspiring story of what happened in Alabama in 1965: Despite their seeming powerlessness, African-Americans and their allies engaged in nonviolent protest that compelled a nation to live up to its principles; they looked white supremacist terror in the face and marched on to freedom.To his credit, the president gracefully walked the line between honoring this American triumph and also acknowledging the painful continuities between then and now, from Selma to Ferguson. But traditionally, this core narrative of American triumph is the story that we want to tell about Selma and about our nation. It's the grade school version, with a clear beginning, middle and end, the one that many Americans still carry with them. Things were terrible; people protested; now things are better. The problem with this narrative is not that it is not true, but rather in the way we tell it, the loud crescendo that stresses the ending and thus offers comforting reassurance that America's ugly dance with racism is over. The conclusiveness of the narrative suggests that African-American history is a linear progression from bondage to freedom and more importantly that race relations and the circumstances of black people's lives are always steadily improving. But racial history in the United States has been far from linear. Instead, it has been a dizzying kaleidoscope of ever-shifting ideas and practices that grow more complex with each decade. In his speech, the president mentioned that a reporter asked him if the Ferguson report meant that little had changed between 1965 and now, and in response he indicated that while he understood the question, he objected to the idea that little had changed. There is, however, a fundamental problem with the question, the way that it condenses racial history, American history, to an either/or outcome. Change, even change for the better, can be accompanied by constancy, difference with similarity, and transformation with repetition. One need only look at the town of Selma, Alabama today to see this strange amalgamation of past and present. Selma is more than a symbol of American triumph and an inspiration for social protest. It is a living town, and this new Selma is still wrestling, albeit in different ways, with the same white supremacist ideologies that divided it in 1965. If we are going to tell the story of Selma's past as proof of the enduring American spirit, then we also have to tell and own the story of its present struggle with white supremacy.Last year, the City Council of Selma voted in support of a monument to Nathan Bedford Forrest, best known as a Confederate General and an early organizer of the Ku Klux Klan. The story of the memorial began in 2000 when a group calling itself the Friends of Forrest erected a monument in his honor in downtown Selma. When the monument attracted protesters, the Selma City Council had the statue moved to a cemetery. But in 2012, the general's head mysteriously went missing. Construction began on a new monument, and protesters gathered again. This time the City Council voted to halt the project, but they found themselves facing a costly lawsuit. Last year, the Selma City Council voted not only to allow the construction to continue but to pay $100,000 to the construction company and donate one acre of land for the memorial site. The racial breakdown of the vote is telling and puzzling at once. All of the four opposing votes were cast by black city council members. All three of the white members of the council supported the monument. But it took the votes of two additional members, both of whom were black, to make the monument happen. And so Selma, the heart of the Civil Rights movement, a city that is 80 percent black, with a majority black City Council, and where 1/3 of the population is below the poverty line will pay for a one acre site honoring a KKK grand wizard. Many will look at this strange juxtaposition and blame it on the backwardness of the South, the narrow minds of the white poor, dusty rural ignorance. But that explanation is far too easy. Yes, the South is a veritable mausoleum of the confederacy, with well-tended statues, plaques, and busts, littering the landscape. Even a few schools and state parks have born the names of KKK leaders. But these sites are hardly confined to the South. James W. Loewen argues that since the people who put up monuments and markers are usually ""pillars of the white community... Americans still live and work in a landscape of white supremacy... all across America."" One need only take a brief walk through the U.S. Capitol's Statuary Hall, which is not only overwhelmingly white and male, but is also a who's who of white supremacy in the U.S., to understand how Loewen's words apply to the nation, not just the South. Thus, while the irony of the situation in Selma might seem shocking, this duality -- like slavery in a nation built on the principles of freedom -- is also so very American. Ours is a nation of great contradictions. Consider that President Obama, the nation's first black president, joined anniversary marchers at Pettus Bridge, which is named for a KKK grand dragon. As he made his way across, he was less than two miles from the site of the Nathan Bedford Forrest Memorial. Today's Selma is both old and new at once. The white people who supported the monument probably do not wear their sheets at night and ride around setting things on fire, and the two African-American council members who voted for it did not do so under the threat of a bullwhip. It is a new day. But we should not fool ourselves into relegating the past to the past, just yet. When we see crowded archival photos of angry white faces, surrounding black bodies soaked in spittle and blood from Boston to Birmingham, we prefer to see these moments as frozen in another time and resurrect them only occasionally for educational purposes. But if great Civil Rights leaders, such as John Lewis are still alive and well, so are many of the people who viciously attacked protesters in 1965. The 15-year controversy over the Nathan Bedford Forrest memorial reminds us that those people are not all dead and more importantly neither are their ideas. Instead, those ideologies play out on new terms, on old ground, with old and new actors. It is difficult to even speculate on any of the five supporting council members' reasons -- beliefs, heritage, politics, a costly lawsuit and backlash from a white supremacist group. Who knows? Nonetheless, the end result is clear: If protesters won a battle against white supremacy in Selma in 1965, then they lost one in Selma in 2014. The speed train from slavery to freedom hit a mighty bump. The history of race in United States continues to be a twisted and thorny path, where we are all always in danger of getting lost. Consider, for example, that while there has been no shortage of critics of the film, Selma, who have leapt to defend the legacy of President Lyndon B. Johnson, hardly anyone seems to be equally rattled by the fact that Pettus Bridge is still named for a KKK grand wizard, just as it was in 1965. We should not let this disgrace be our inheritance. If we want to protect our national legacy, let's change the name of Pettus Bridge. Name it for those who risked their lives to cross it. Let's take back the meaning of Selma again."
26,POLITICS,Quit Playing Politics With the Health of Children,"Bruce Lesley, ContributorPresident, First Focus & First Focus Campaign for Children",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/quit-playing-politics-wit_b_6818682.html,"A CHIP extension bill should not result in children losing health insurance coverage and being left worse off. Congress should, at the very least, ""do no harm"" and oppose any package that would result in children losing health coverage or being left worse off in their state.",2015-03-09,2015-03-06-1425668251-442227-WakelyCHIPACAComparison.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-06-1425668251-442227-WakelyCHIPACAComparison-thumb.png,"Having worked in the Senate and House for over a decade, it is tragic is witness the inability of Members of Congress to forge bipartisan compromises to move our nation forward. Even worse, as the recent debacle over funding of the Department of Homeland Security demonstrates, Congress has a difficult time even getting members of the same party to reach agreement on a fundamental act that is necessary to fund our nation's homeland security.In a recent National Journal article, members of Congress expressed lament about the dysfunction that has prevented Congress from getting much accomplished. However, there is a path that they can take and is staring them in the face. For example, Congress could begin that process by finding common ground on a few important issues of importance to our nation's children, including the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and education. Earlier this year, former House Republican Majority Leader Eric Cantor talked about how the Congress should move beyond gridlock by keeping in mind that over eight million children will be born over the next two years. As he wrote, ""The future of those 8,053,000 little boys and girls deserve to have the two years of this Congress focused on them and not the next election.""Of course, a focus on children will require that Democrats and Republicans actually talk to one another. For example, failure to work on a bipartisan basis in the House resulted in the bill having to be pulled off the House floor because it didn't have the votes to pass due to splits within the Republican Party on it. And, even if it were to voted out of the House, the legislation stands no chance of being passed in the Senate or signed into law by President Obama.Fortunately, Republican Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander and Democratic Ranking Member Patty Murray have chosen a different path and are engaged in bipartisan negotiations to move an education package forward to modify the failed No Child Left Behind law. And, with respect to child health, over 1,500 organizations from across the country have called upon Congress to extend CHIP for four years, and our nation's governors, on a bipartisan basis, have called for CHIP's extension while highlighting the long-time success of the federal-state program. They recognize that, in tandem with Medicaid, that CHIP has successfully cut the nation's uninsured rate in half and has improved the health and well-being of millions of children over the last 18 years. Bipartisan conversations on Capitol Hill have begun on this as well.Unfortunately, there are the forces swirling around Washington, D.C., that just cannot avoid playing politics with the lives of children. For example, Grace-Marie Turner, president of the Galen Institute, wrote an opinion piece on February 27, 2015, for Forbes entitled ""The Next ACA (Affordable Care Act) Battle: Extending The Children's Health Insurance Program."" Although she notes that there is strong bipartisan support ""to continue funding CHIP,"" she, unfortunately, calls for cutting hundreds of thousands of children off of coverage and proclaims that the ""CHIP reauthorization is a battle worth fighting because it is a harbinger of things to come with future ACA battles.""There are some incredibly ironic things about Turner's proposals. First of all, she lauds that ""Republicans also want to put the 'S' for State back in SCHIP (rather than CHIP) to emphasize the state nature of the program and give states more flexibility in managing the program."" Second, it is important to note that Turner is strongly opposed to the ACA or Obama Care. She has written dozens of articles that are highly critical of the ACA or Obama Care. So, she likes state flexibility and dislikes Obama Care, right?The answer is ""yes,"" but shockingly, she proposes to restrict state flexibility in CHIP and to, thereby, expand Obama Care in her opinion piece. For example, she touts the idea of capping eligibility and coverage that states have used to vary their eligibility and coverage levels for children. This proposal would restrict state flexibility and slash federal support to states for covering certain children in 27 states (Alabama, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin) and the District of Columbia.She points out that states like New York covers children up to a higher level of poverty than North Dakota, but that is exactly what has always been a strength of CHIP, as it allows states to adjust their programs to meet the needs of their children, the differences in the cost of living or health care states between states, etc.If the federal government were to impose eligibility limits upon states in this fashion, it would create a financial incentive for states to drop health coverage for hundreds of thousands of children in working families -- many of whom would lose coverage altogether because a number of them would be ineligible for subsidies in the exchange because of the so-called ""family glitch.""That is unacceptable, as it would move our nation in the wrong direction on children's health. A CHIP extension bill should not result in children losing health insurance coverage and being left worse off. Congress should, at the very least, ""do no harm"" and oppose any package that would result in children losing health coverage or being left worse off in their state.In an attempt to dismiss the negative implications this proposal would have on children's health coverage, Turner argues that we should not worry too much because many of the children losing CHIP ""would be eligible for subsidized coverage through the health insurance exchanges."" It is ironic that Turner, who is an avowed opponent of ObamaCare, is now arguing we should move some children from CHIP coverage to the Affordable Care Act or ObamaCare.But for the children that would be moved out of CHIP, she acknowledges that, if they avoid the ""family glitch"" and are enrolled in the ACA, they would be placed ""in policies on the exchanges which often have sky-high deductibles."" Again, this would be harmful to children, as children across the country would be left worse off in terms of higher cost, reduced benefits, and weaker provider networks. The following chart highlights some of those differences.It is surprising that an avowed opponent of Obama Care would be encouraging the movement of hundreds of thousands of additional children into that coverage. On the other hand, she may just be urging that of those children should lose coverage altogether because, 24 hours earlier on February 26th, Turner wrote another article for Forbes arguing that the Supreme Court should rule in the court's case, King v. Burwell, that federal subsidies should only be allowed for those people enrolled through state exchanges, which are in operation in less than half of the states, and not those enrolled in the federal exchange.In short, if you cap or limit and create incentives for states to drop children from CHIP, many would lose coverage entirely due to the combination of the ""family glitch,"" or the very arbitrary consequence of whether or not the state operates their own exchange in the ACA. This would be disastrous for children and their families, and not something that a CHIP extension should encourage or risk.Turner also touts the idea of allowing children to be placed on 12-month waiting lists before they can receive CHIP coverage. However, for a child with cancer, asthma or in need of eyeglasses, they simply cannot wait 12 months to obtain much needed and possibly life-saving health coverage. These children would either be left uninsured or might temporarily enroll in the ACA. Having children lose coverage or find themselves placed in weaker coverage, while also forcing kids to be churned from one plan to another is anything but good for the health of children.What may be even worse is that, because pregnant women are also covered by CHIP, a 12-month waiting period for pregnant women to enroll and receive prenatal care is simply nonsensical. Leaving pregnant women without prenatal care coverage would led to an increase in negative birth outcomes and increased infant and maternal mortality. We simply must not gamble with the health of our nation's children or conclude, as Turner does, that ""CHIP reauthorization is a battle worth fighting because it is a harbinger of things to come with future ACA battles."" In fact, the opposite is true. Congress should not mess with success, as CHIP has been extremely effectively in dramatically cutting the number of uninsured children in this country. It is also, by definition, pediatric-specific, has strong public support, and delivers high-quality health care. For example, in a recent 2014 Satisfaction Survey of Iowa parents whose children were enrolled in ""hawk-i"" (Iowa's CHIP program), an astounding 93.7 percent expressed satisfaction with the care received and less than one percent (or 0.7 percent) expressed dissatisfaction with the care their children received.Consequently, Congress should reject any and all efforts to mess with or play politics with the health of our nation's children. Rather, Congress should take this opportunity to end gridlock and make real progress in protecting the health of our nation's children by, first and foremost, ensuring that children are not left worse off. A clean extension of CHIP is the answer.And frankly, that is the real battle worth fighting for -- a battle to protect our children's health."

Fashion Week, and while I have had opportunities to go, the scheduling Gods have just never been with me on this one. The second best thing to being there is to live vicariously through Tommy Lei of My Belonging. He describes himself as a Styleteller, and I love his style stories. He was born in Hong Kong but is based in L.A., although he is a globetrotter and often comes to N.Y.C. Definitely more fashion-forward than I am, he inspires me to be bold and step out of my self-imposed fashion boundaries once in a while.Here are his stories from Fashion Week. 1. What is your background and how did you get to be a ""regular"" at Fashion Week? My name is Tommy Lei, the Styleteller behind MYBELONGING -- a high-fashion menswear and personal lifestyle site with an emphasis on intimate dining experiences and travel. I initially started it as an outlet to provide more meaning towards investment items in relation to personal style and identity -- hence the name MYBELONGING. That's how I pretty much came to be a regular at New York Fashion Week the past three (now four) seasons.  Courtesy of Tommy Lei2. Tell me about your trip from L.A. to N.Y.C. -- red eye? No red eye? What airline do you like? What are your tips for traveling in style? And where do you like to stay in N.Y.C.? I typically prefer non-red eye flights, because I want to feel rested on an actual bed in preparation for the busy days ahead. Virgin America is definitely my airline of choice; Delta and JetBlue are a close second. It's so crucial to invest in stylish but functional travel gear, especially when you travel often. My go-to brands this time around are Ghurka (high-end), Bric's (luxe) and Kao Pao Shu (modern) -- all great bags depending on your budget. In terms of accommodations, I prefer boutique hotels that offer world-class service with stunning interiors yet still deliver an intimate, cozy experience. That's why I went with the Sofitel NYC for my stay. It completely exceeded my expectations on every level. 3. Who are you most excited to see during Fashion Week? I was most excited to see Perry Ellis (they just named Michael Maccari as their new creative director). The past two seasons has indicated the brand's ascent to its former glory. And this season was no different -- the clothes that came down the runway were incredibly tailored and possessed enough depth for any sartorial personality.4. Who did you discover you love that you did not know about? Landeros by Andres Michel Landeros, an N.Y.C.-based designer who is a Parsons grad. His FW15 collection completely took my breath away. It was dark, mysterious and broody but with a visceral elegance punctuated by sensuous textures and silhouettes. Simply sublime.5. What do you hate about Fashion Week?I'll be completely frank here: The timing of the shows. It's either too early, or wedged in between too many other shows/appointments. And, in light of this current season, I'd also add Uber's surge pricing onto this list. 6. What did you wear this week? Quite similar to what I had worn last season: My fashion week default brands are mostly Acne Studios, KTZ, G-Star RAW, Saint Laurent and Tom Ford.  Accessories-wise, I wore a backpack from Ghurka, a Kao Pao Shu clutch and Lura sunglasses.  7. What is the thinking process behind your outfits? It's quite simple actually -- I go with my gut instinct. I believe a lot of people will tell you that they get inspired by magazine and style icons; I sincerely believe the most authentic personal style comes from those unplanned, spontaneous moments that reflect your mood and how you want to present yourself to the world. It doesn't have to be expensive or a replica of a how-to style column to look good. Always choose to listen to your inner voice and let it come from the heart. 8. What's the best thing about being a fashion blogger in today's digital landscape? First and foremost, our most loyal group of readers and audiences -- we wouldn't be here without them. The next best thing would be the camaraderie amongst fellow bloggers and tastemakers -- there is an immediate feeling of acceptance and understanding in the community that makes fashion more accessible than ever before. On top of that, it is truly amazing working first-hand with brands that you've always admired by providing constructive feedback in a receptive and collaborative way.

So what does this teach us about branding?When you visit the Arby's twitter page, you notice that they pretty much only post about their food, and not even with especially flattering food photography. They do have a humorous, youthful voice that they use to comment on all things Arby's food-related, but the parody account certainly has a larger presence that garners a larger response. It's a good lesson in taking a big marketing risk. Sure, Nihilist Arby's didn't have anything to lose, but look at all they gained. Another great example of this is the Denny's account. Their voice is borderline absurdist and they've earned a large, cult-like following because of it. They took a huge risk and their audience ate it up (pun intended). It helps to vary your posting content. If you own a bakery, don't solely post pictures of your baked goods. Add some variety by posting bakery-related articles, recipes, jokes, videos you like, etc. Of course you're expected to mostly post about your business, but a little variety helps to break things up and keep your audience interested. Additionally, sometimes it pays in big ways to take marketing risks. Choosing a huge presence of a voice that is catered to your business and its audience is a good risk to take. Just be sure to do your research before deciding on how your business will speak. Look at your target markets- how do they speak? How do the other businesses they follow speak? Do your homework, create a large presence, and speak loud and proud."
