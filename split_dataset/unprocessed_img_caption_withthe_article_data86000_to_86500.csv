This is my family's story of surviving genocide and becoming Americans.By SreyReath Kuy, DPM and SreyRam Kuy, MDThis article originally appeared in Salon.com on June 19, 2015. ""A woman with the heart of a tiger"": My mother risked everything to flee from the Khmer Rouge with her children.This June 20th is World Refugee Day, which was established in 2000 by the United Nations General Assembly to remember people displaced by conflict or persecution. Refugees span the entire globe; Africans trying to cross the Mediterranean, Syrians fleeing ISIS into Turkey and Greece, and the Rohingya escaping Myanmar. This is a story that repeats itself over and over again as genocide and systemic persecution drive the swelling mass of refugees. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates there are more than 60 million refugees around the world, half of whom are women and children. This is the highest number of refugees since World War II.Reading about the plight of refugees, it's easy for the suffering millions to meld together into a faceless mass. That's why I want to place one human face on the 60 million refugees. I want to share the story of my mother. My mother isn't just a refugee or a survivor of genocide. She is a woman with the heart of a tiger.My mom was a school teacher, living in Phnom Penh when the Khmer Rouge took over Cambodia on April 17, 1975. For the next several years she hid her identity, as Pol Pot ordered the execution of all educated people during the Cambodian Genocide known as the Killing Fields. Those who weren't shot or tortured to death were forced into slave labor in the rice fields. My mom struggled to stay alive, being taken to be interrogated by communist leaders multiple times. She fought to feed her two young children and her elderly mother, foraging in tiger infested jungles for food. An estimated two million Cambodians died from execution, torture, starvation or disease.After four years, the Khmer Rouge were overthrown. Though now free, we had absolutely nothing except the rags on our backs. Our home in Phnom Penh had been demolished. The entire infrastructure of the country had been razed to the ground; there were no schools, hospitals or banks. We lived in daily fear that the Khmer Rouge would come back.My mom made the difficult decision to escape from Cambodia with her children, in search of safety, freedom and a better life. We crossed jungles littered with land mines to escape across the border and crawled under barbed wire fences to get into Khao-i-Dang refugee camp.When Khao-i-Dang first opened in November 1979, nearly 5,000 Cambodians scrambled across the border, desperate to escape the devastation of the Khmer Rouge. By December 1979, there were already 85,000 Cambodian refugees living in the camp. By January 1980 the camp was closed to any further entry. However, the closed entry to Khao-i-Dang did not deter people from trying to get in. Since the Khmer Rouge were overthrown, 750,000 Cambodians tried to flee the country. Only a fraction made it across the border alive; thousands died attempting to cross the land mines that lined the border. They were desperate to escape, afraid that the Khmer Rouge would come back into power, and they saw no end in sight to the starvation. They had nothing left to live for in their homeland. They knew that if they eventually made it behind the walls of the refugee camp, there was a chance they might be able to obtain visas to go live elsewhere. This was a hope they clung too, even if it meant risking their life to get there. At its peak, the population of Khao-i-Dang swelled to 160,000 refugees.Weeks after arriving in the camp, my family and I woke to the sound of a loud explosion. Screaming erupted outside our tent. Shouts of panic and pounding feet resonated through the air. My mom quickly reached for my sister and me, shielding us with her body. Before we had another chance to move, a second RPG explosive tore through the roof and landed next to our cot. An errant border patrol shell had hit the tent. My mom screamed, and then lost consciousness. My sister and I started crying as we looked at our bloodied, unconscious mother.By protecting her children, my mom sustained most of the blast. Her shirt and sarong were soaked with blood. My left ear was partially torn off, dangling by a strip of bloody scalp. My sister's right arm was bleeding, where the shrapnel wounded her.Red Cross volunteers carried us to the camp hospital. As the trauma patients started arriving en masse, the place became chaotic. The volunteer staff rushed around, trying to triage the critically wounded. They had to prioritize who were most likely to survive and treat those first.Medical staff cut off my mom's bloody clothes to evaluate the full extent of her injuries. The blast had torn through her abdominal wall, leaving a bloody crater in her belly. Her skin was pale and clammy, as her body started going into hemorrhagic shock. Her injuries were deemed unsurvivable, and her stretcher was pushed to the side with the rest of the fatalities. A volunteer Red Cross surgeon operated on me, stopping the bleeding from my scalp and sewing my ear back in place. To the side, my mom was still bleeding, fading in and out of consciousness. Finally, the hectic pace slowed down and the clamor subsided. One of the nurses working in the triage room heard a moan from a stretcher on the side. She pulled back the blood soaked sheet, and saw an ashen, grey face. With the fierce heart of a tiger, my mom mustered every ounce of strength she had and whispered in Khmer. It was barely audible, but the nurse could hear the mumbling, and realized she was still alive. They took her to the operating room where the surgeon performed an emergency laparotomy and saved her life. After recovering from our injuries, we spent a year and a half in limbo, living in four different Cambodian refugee camps. During these years we waited anxiously, hoping to come to America. Our visa application had been denied over and over. Many families were being sent back to Cambodia. We were terrified of returning. One day, we received the incredible news that we had been sponsored to the United States by a Christian Missionary group.We arrived in the US destitute, haunted by the memories of the Killing Fields, and unable to speak the language. My mom rebuilt a new life, taking any job she could find. She scrubbed toilets at Good Samaritan Hospital during the day, cleaned doctors' houses at night, and on the weekends we worked in the fields alongside Mexican migrant farm workers picking berries and vegetables to earn extra money. It was not easy, but we were safe and we were free. That was all that mattered.Today, I'm a surgeon myself, taking care of our nation's veterans. My sister works as a podiatrist, caring for underserved patients with diabetic foot problems. We are so grateful to be alive, and that we were given refuge in this land of freedom. This is my family's story as refugees, as genocide survivors and as Americans. This Saturday we remember the world's refugees, but this is a reality that 60 million people live with daily.

3,BLACK VOICES,Black And Living Under The Confederate Flag,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/charleston-confederate-flag_n_7624760.html,,2015-06-19,"Annie Chambers Caddell stands outside her home in Summerville, S.C., on Thursday, Oct. 14, 2010. The Confederate flag behind her has raised concern in her predominantly black neighborhood, and neighbors plan a protest march. (AP Photo/Bruce Smith)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae0e122600003600811d16.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SUMMERVILLE, S.C. -- Annie Caddell proudly flies the Confederate flag in her front yard here in the Charleston suburbs. She maintains a cache of spare flags on her front porch, replacing the one on her white flagpole every few months, after it gets tattered. A visitor to her home -- if the ""no trespassing"" sign doesn't turn him back -- is greeted near the door by a green, imitation street sign that reads ""Confederate Circle.""Caddell said she'll die before her stars and bars stop blowing in the wind. ""Would you let your family history die like that? I don’t think so,"" Caddell, who's ""pushing 56,"" said. ""That’s tantamount to treason in my family. You just don’t do that.""Her neighbors know to take her at her word.Caddell, who is white, lives in a historically black neighborhood called Brownsville, surrounded by African-American neighbors. She became a source of controversy after she moved here several years ago and made her full-staff statement. As the Charleston Post and Courier reported in a series of stories at the time, outraged residents mounted an emotional campaign aimed at forcing her to remove the flag. They marched. They petitioned. They enlisted the NAACP. With the cooperation of Caddell's adjacent neighbors, they even erected wooden fences along both sides of her house, aimed at restricting the view. The flag only went higher. The South may have lost the war, but Caddell won her flag battle. Despite the outcry, the town determined there was nothing it could do legally to compel her to remove it, and many African-American residents agreed it was her right to fly it. Caddell, who describes herself as a Republican with tea party leanings, said her affection for the flag stems not just from her personal history, but from a mistrust of the federal government. Nearly five years later, she said everyone has long since moved on from the quarrel over her yard. ""It's all calmed down. Nobody's aggravated with me anymore,"" Caddell told The Huffington Post in an interview on her porch. ""They understand it's not a racial thing with me, which I'm very thankful for, because it never was.""Things have certainly calmed down, but Caddell shouldn't be so sure that the aggravation has dissipated. ""Blown over? Nothing's blown over,"" said Rollins Edwards, 93, who lives two doors from Caddell and served as the first African-American member of the Dorchester County council. ""We don't want nothing to remind us of slavery in the morning. To look over there at that flag, I don't like it.""People come by here and stare in disbelief that that flag is flying in this neighborhood,"" Rollins, a World War II veteran, added.The Confederate flag is famously divisive in South Carolina, with many white people calling it a proud badge of Southern heritage, and many African-Americans deeming it a shameful symbol of slavery and plunder. The flag used to fly atop the state capitol; after a heated battle more than a decade ago, it was removed from the capitol dome and made to fly at a Confederate memorial on statehouse grounds instead. According to a poll commissioned last year by The State newspaper of South Carolina, feelings about the state's sanctioning of the flag unsurprisingly fall along racial lines, with a majority of whites saying it should remain, and a majority of blacks saying it should be removed. ""Overall, 61 percent of South Carolinians said the flag should continue to fly where it is, while 33 percent say it should not,"" the paper's survey found.Wednesday's racially motivated massacre of nine African-Americans at Emanuel AME Church in downtown Charleston has reignited the debate over flying the rebel flag at the statehouse. Photos of Dylann Roof, the confessed shooter, show him wearing apartheid symbols and leaning against a car with an ornamental license plate bearing tribute to the Confederate states. (After the slaughter, the state flag and U.S. flag at the statehouse were lowered to half-staff in mourning; the Confederate flag, which cannot be moved without decree from the legislature, remained at full-staff.)Some of the state's Republican politicians have appeared uncomfortable with the issue since the Emanuel murders. Gov. Nikki Haley (R) has previously said there is no need to remove the flag, though on Friday she said she hopes the ensuing debate will have ""thoughtful words to be exchanged."" Sen. Lindsey Graham, who's making a run for the GOP presidential nomination, said, ""It works here, that's what the Statehouse agreed to do. You could probably visit other places in the country near some symbol that doesn't quite strike you right."" Asked about the controversy Friday, White House spokesman Eric Schultz said, ""The president has said before he believes the Confederate flag belongs in a museum, and that’s still his position.""Caddell's neighbor Edwards marched at the statehouse years ago to have the flag removed. He bristles that the symbol of the Confederacy now seems to fly ""more prominently"" at the seat of state government than it used to. Although not a common sight in his own neighborhood, it isn't unusual to spot the rebel flag rumbling past on a pickup truck in Edwards' area. There's even a retail shop nearby that specializes in Confederate signage: Dixie Outfitters, which has the tagline ""Southern Heritage.""A man and woman working at Dixie Outfitters on Friday politely declined to discuss the statehouse debate. ""We don't do interviews,"" the man said. ""It never works out.""But, referencing the statehouse flag, the woman couldn't help but add, ""It ain't coming down.""On that matter, many African-Americans in Brownsville seem to agree, saying the politics are not on their side.""It's America, man. I don't have no say-so,"" said Brandon Haynes. ""Regular everyday people, you can't stop that.""Although they wince at the flag in Caddell's front yard, many of her neighbors agree that it should be within her rights to fly any flag she wants on her own property. What they struggle to understand is the assertion that the flag is a symbol of proud heritage, given the legacy of slavery.""It doesn't represent me,"" said Fred Ellington, 67, who lives three doors from Caddell and is African-American. ""What it represents is what happened to our people back in the day. If they want to represent murder, rape, slavery, I don't let that bother me. They're gonna do what they wanna do anyway. It's been going on ever since the beginning of this country, hatred. I don't have to mess with that lady. I haven't never said nothing since she moved here."" ""You can call it heritage all you want it. It's a symbol of hate,"" said Edwards' wife, Juanita. Like everyone else HuffPost spoke to on the matter, Caddell herself didn't believe the flag at the statehouse would be coming down anytime soon. She said she felt it never should have been moved from the dome in the first place.""We should never trade our history for anything,"" she said. ""If you can't be proud of where you come from, you're in a sad state of affairs.""As for her own flag, ""People just want something to talk about, I guess,"" she said."

They stressed that ""guns are not brought into the world to commit this kind of crime,"" and restated their familiar position: ""Guns do not shoot flags; people shoot flags."" A local NRA representative, Scotty Wooten, acknowledged grudgingly that ""the perpetrator had some skill with a rifle."" Apparently the sniper dispatched the flag with only two shots, one of which went straight through the body of the padlock.""Yeah, well that boy may be some kind of sniper, but he ain't no American Sniper,"" said Myron ""Alma"" Butts, a local gun dealer, who fought tears as he gazed up at the injured flagpole.Editor's note: In case you missed it, this post is probably satire."

He did not need to worry that he would be asked to leave or made to feel unwelcome. Indeed he could expect that he would be embraced as a visitor to this sanctuary. He stayed a while. And then, while in the comfort and security of their spiritual hospitality, he gunned nine men and women down, reportedly while spouting a racial justification for his actions. I have heard and read a lot of speculation today: ""Dylann Roof is disturbed."" ""Dylann Roof is deranged."" ""Dylann Roof is evil.""It may not seem important to some, but as a lawyer who frequently asks judges and prosecutors to consider the mental health dimensions of criminal conduct, I feel there is something distressingly lax about these armchair pronouncements. Because I practice criminal defense, I generally avoid making public comments about criminal cases that arise in my hometown. But something is so different about this. Something that threatens to obscure one pressing issue in our community and in our country by conflating it with another. Something that as a white, nearly lifelong resident of Charleston, I feel obligated to say in defiance of my usual self-censorship.While they may and often do dwell together, hatred and mental illness are not the same. Hatred is not a mood disorder. Hatred is not a condition for which we are biologically marked. Hatred cannot be pharmaceutically mediated. Whether a mental health condition played a role in what happened here last night will, undoubtedly, be explored by experts qualified to diagnose and explore the contours of such illness. And if Dylann Roof suffered from a treatable mental illness that played a role in what happened here in Charleston last night, we should rightly demand again and again and again until those demands are met for improvements in our country's mental health infrastructure and creative solutions to keep guns out of the hands of people too ill to responsibly own them.But we must look deeper.We are all experts in the simple emotional calculus needed to spot hatred in our midst. We need no specialized training to observe in the equation where one white man stands in a position of armed power to assassinate nine black men and women in a spiritual sanctuary that the moral operation is hatred.Hatred is inert violence. Hatred can be taught and learned. Hatred can be communicated in silent gestures and symbols, by signs over the water fountain, by flags waving in the wind, by quiet dismissal and by frantic shrieking. Hatred can run tiny rivulets or rushing waters through the bedrock of a person's character. And we are all susceptible to its intrusions.For so many years, our country tolerated, even embraced, hatred in the form of racial bigotry. We have turned some of the sharpest of those corners. But we do ourselves and our children a disservice if we pretend that we have explored all the dangerous outlets in which hatred continues to live and be bred. And we do ourselves and our children a disservice if we refuse to acknowledge that the long shadows of those sharpest corners continue to shut out much of the light for the communities who have been relegated to those shadows over decades and centuries.It cannot be enough that we decry the violence of one man's gun. We must root hatred out in ourselves, we must inoculate our children, and we must be vigilant in protecting our neighbors as we would ourselves or our children."

Thus far candidates seem to believe that whomever delivers the right populist message stands the best chance to reach the Oval Office. Whether addressed through stories of the candidate's humble origins or lofty ideals, their conversations are beginning to be about how to set the economic stage for greater prosperity for all of our citizens. This is a promising trend. Americans, especially Blacks and Latinos, face numerous and varied barriers to lasting wealth, let alone prosperity. Our system is reaching the breaking point. And it doesn't have to be this way. We are in the midst of an era of unprecedented economic opportunity that has yet to be addressed by the presidential candidates. No moment has offered more opportunity for more people to gain wealth and enjoy prosperity than the emergence of today's Innovation Economy. More than any other economic era, the Innovation Economy exemplifies three vital, economic opportunity-generating characteristics:• It's democratic: Providing unparalleled access to information. • It's egalitarian: Opportunities are based on ""gray matter"" rather than owning the means of production, i.e., land, factories, etc.  • It's meritocratic: Advancement is determined by ability rather than incumbent economic class or wealth.In these respects, the Innovation Economy is an improvement upon earlier economies. Although it is hardly perfect, compared to previous major economic eras -- e.g., the agrarian economy, with wealth based on land ownership; and the industrial economy, with wealth based on controlling the means of manufacturing - the present Innovation Economy era offers substantially more and different opportunities waiting to be realized. Despite the fact that America leads the most democratic, egalitarian and meritocratic economy in known history, underserved Americans (i.e. women, Blacks and Latinos) face innumerable barriers to meaningfully contribute to the Innovation Economy. These barriers inhibit their ability to derive equitable shares of empowering jobs and wealth and stifle their successful competition in The New Age of Innovation -- all of which weakens our national economic competitiveness. It does not help that thus far our presidential contenders have kept our economic conversation mired in personal history or weak policy proposals based on a bygone era. We need our leaders to bring new, bold policy frameworks to leverage the Innovation Economy to achieve inclusive prosperity and improve our economic competitiveness. We need a new national movement. Where the Innovation Economy expands opportunity beyond previous eras, Inclusive Competitiveness expands opportunity within the Innovation Economy. Inclusive Competitiveness is a framework by which we can capitalize on the full potential of underserved Americans to help fuel our nation's next generation economic vitality in a way that is more inclusive and durable. Focused on new community economic narratives and education, organizational and leadership imperatives, the emerging Inclusive Competitiveness Movement promises to build dual pipelines of performance and productivity - creating more high value intrapreneurial employees and higher growth entrepreneurial enterprises from diverse communities, that in turn can help to increase America's global economic competitiveness. We need a leader to step forward and propose a new policy framework for national prosperity in the 21st century. Our past has seen great strides from both Democrat and Republican presidents to advance our national infrastructure and improve the quality of life for all Americans. Our next president needs to reinvest directly in the economically lowest performing segments of our nation, igniting new public will and meaningful efforts to strengthen our country overall through a far broader and more inclusive prosperity. Inclusive Competitiveness is not only a framework for that reinvestment, but one with a built in roadmap to success.The Foundations of Inclusive Competitiveness provide the specific policy framework that would help to fuel needed movement in these directions:• Inculcation of a New Community Economic Narrative: The absence of a salient economic narrative focused on preparing underserved communities to successfully compete in the Innovation Economy is palpable. More robust efforts are needed to advance new economic imperatives, incentives and narratives to connect people and communities in need to the nation's leading economic competitiveness opportunities.  • Encouragement of New Education Leadership: Low STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts and math) education attainment and proficiency of underserved Americans significantly contribute to low productivity in regional innovation ecosystems and, ultimately, in the Innovation Economy. New leadership from K-12 through higher education institutions should be encouraged to increase the pipeline of underserved high school and college students in STEAM.  • Promotion of New Organizational Leadership: A diverse set of leadership organizations provide direct services in our communities, often with a focus on areas such as community economic development, education, employment, health care, and social services. Promotion of new organizational leadership is required to complement incumbent services with new strategies, capacities and capabilities to link underserved Americans to the country's Innovation Economy priority areas.  • Support for New Regional Economic Competiveness Research, Model Development and Prioritization: Without an emphasis on Inclusive Competitiveness in the planning phases of regional, state and national Innovation Economy development, emerging economic opportunity challenges can become nearly insurmountable. New and complementary Innovation Economy research, model development and prioritization needs to be conducted to achieve more widespread and inclusive growth and development. National economic competitiveness depends on it.  • Adoption of New Policies, Processes and Practices: Creative policy, process and practice advancements across a diverse set of regional, state and national stakeholders - including business and community nonprofit organizations, technology innovators and economic development organizations, colleges and universities, and government and philanthropic institutions - are required to activate and sustain an Inclusive Competitiveness Movement. Innovating incumbent strategies through the adoption of new, interdisciplinary approaches can yield specific findings and scalable and replicable ways to improve the economic performance and productivity of underserved Americans. Through these types of strategies, we can do much more as a nation to intentionally position all of our people as contributors to America's next generation economic vitality and global competitiveness. Failure to move in these directions merely invites more of what we have seen in recent years--which is not much--when it comes to shared prosperity and real opportunity for upward mobility across our nation's growing racial and class divides. --This article is the second in a series of three articles Johnathan M.

In a fascinating interview with FoodDive's David Oliver, Hamilton argued that Americans have lost their interest in cutting back on their caloric intake. ""Americans are just simply not dieting anymore,"" Hamilton told Oliver. As evidence of this idea, Oliver pointed to NPD Group surveys showing that the share of Americans who say they are dieting has plummeted to 20 percent after hitting a high of 33 percent in 1991. To be clear, Hamilton does not say that Americans have given up on trying to eat healthily. They've just shifted their focus to standards of healthfulness beyond calorie counting. They care far more about avoiding ingredients that are perceived as ""unhealthy"" or ""unnatural."" Nearly a third of all Americans, for example, are trying to avoid gluten, and 57 percent say that they prefer to buy foods free of GMOs. They've also become notably interested in eating more protein. There are a couple different ways you could look at this trend. On the one hand, yo-yo dieting has been linked to a host of harmful consequences, both physical and psychological. And experts such as Michael Pollan have often warned that focusing on calories can be reductive and self-defeating. They argue that a smarter path to health is to think more holistically about the foods we eat and to emphasize whole, natural foods instead of chemical-laden ""diet foods."" Including Lean Cuisine frozen meals!Yet it's not clear that Americans are actually following the advice of people like Pollan. Many Americans, after all, seldom cook food from scratch. And they still eat far less vegetables than they ought. So if Americans aren't acting on their shifting health preferences by cooking more broccoli, what are they doing? They're asking packaged food companies like Nestle and restaurant chains like Taco Bell to remove artificial ingredients and gluten from their products. They're calling for mandatory labels on foods containing GMOs. They're demanding dairy-free ice creams. They're eating Greek yogurt. All other things being equal, that's fine. But it can be problematic if Americans equate healthy eating with the avoidance of stigmatized ingredients, because little scientific evidence supports the idea that ingesting GMOs and artificial flavorings is harmful to human health, that gluten is bad for people without celiac disease or gluten intolerance or that we're not eating enough protein -- while a great deal of scientific evidence supports the idea that eating too many calories can make you gain weight, and that being too heavy endangers your health.CORRECTION: This post originally referred to the author of the FoodDive interview with Jeff Hamilton as David Owens.

9,RELIGION,Why Is This Happening to Me?,"Catherine Nagle, ContributorWife, Mother, Grandmother, Homemaker, Writer, Author",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-is-this-happening-to-_b_7619594.html,It's very refreshing to know that mindfulness has grown over the years and has entered the mainstream today as one of the many ways of demonstrating prayer.,2015-06-19,2015-06-19-1434707905-6597548-sWOMANTHINKINGsmall.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-19-1434707905-6597548-sWOMANTHINKINGsmall-thumb.jpg,"  Goodness gracious, I thought you realized by now.... nothing has to happen. This is paradise. - Mike Dooley     It's very refreshing to know that mindfulness has grown over the years and has entered the mainstream today as one of the many ways of demonstrating prayer. Every method of prayer and meditation we put into practice quiets our minds, guards our hearts, and allows miracles to take place in our lives through the laws of attraction. Whether we are praying with familiar traditional prayers learned early in life or have chosen affirmations and mantras, visualizing or emptying our minds, all of these methods bring us to the present awareness of breath and heartbeat that opens the door to grace no matter where we are. What's most significant when we commune with the divine for intercession is not to waver, doubt, or turn away from our desire or request. If we know ""Thy will be done"" is already greater for us than what we ask for and leave the details in His hand all will be well. The other point is to always remain in a constant state of gratitude, mindful of our thoughts and feelings; focusing only on those that bring you joy brings results. What works for me is to practice prayer and meditation by reflecting on a certain scripture; but you can reflect on your own tradition, religion, or whichever new thought practices feel right for you because only you know the vibration that echoes through your own heart.  Having had religious teachings to fall back on while meditating really helps. Prayer enriches us; when we meditate on abundance, we get results; both are keys to the stillness that create action in our lives. I believe it's necessary to go over the golden rule to recognize the hidden signs that might be behind our silly ego requests. It's important to also understand that all religions have teaching that help us making the best choices and encourage us. In the end, this is how we might all reach each other and expand our practices of prayer and meditation to enrich all of our lives.  Below is a true account of my own breakthrough in realizing that we already have it made when we follow through with faith-filled actions. I continue with my purest intentions through dedicating prayers along with meditation and the combination truly enhances my life.  What Is The Real Secret?   I can now understand that we made it through tough times by trusting in God, and I could not have done it without Him. I was living what some call ""the secret,"" but at that time I didn't know the explanation for, or have a full understanding of, the law of attraction. The concept has recently gained so much attention from the book and movie The Secret. But whatever anyone calls them, I knew these concepts came from God. I knew that through trusting in the words of the Bible, which tell of God's promise and of the life of Jesus, that miracles were possible through unshakable faith. All of these messages came to me through the Scriptures, but it wasn't until later that I learned these principles were no different from the laws of nature, and were as absolute and could be counted on to work just as surely as the laws of gravity.  When we silently pray for whatever it is we need‒whether it's love, peace, joy, compassion, courage, helpfulness, support, forgiveness, gratitude, blessings, and patience, which are all the virtues at the foundation of true prosperity‒then all the material things of the world that we need will come to us. For every good thing we do for others brings us abundance for ourselves. But to have this abundance, we must give to others the very thing we need for ourselves.  Why does this work? Because when we give, we feel as though we are rich and blessed. We feel abundant. And this leads us to be even more generous and giving, which makes us feel even more abundant. We are all born with God's perfect love within us, which guides us on our journey to every good thing we need. And each time we respond to this love by sharing it with others, we are filled with even more. This means that the more we give, the more we will be able to give. It is a universal law: To those who have, more will be given.  Looking back, I see how I managed to attract healing and abundance by practicing gratitude and love. What is harder for most of us to accept and understand is our own role in attracting difficulty and sorrow. Most of us are blind to the ways we perpetuate hardship by focusing on it too much. And each time I asked, ""Why is this happening to me?"" I only saw more of the same. When we keep asking why we're suffering, we are attracting the sorrows in our lives with our predominant thoughts and feelings. If we want to experience joy, we have to focus on joy rather than being sad, which only brings us more sorrow.About Catherine Nagle: Catherine grew up in Philadelphia with 16 brothers and sisters, reared by loving, old school Italian parents.

10,POLITICS,Why the South Carolina Church Rampage Represents a Terrorist Threat Worse Than ISIS,"H. A. Goodman, ContributorColumnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimo...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-dylann-roofs-south-ca_b_7620980.html,"If ISIS had killed 547 Americans in 2013, we'd have sent tens of thousands of Americans back to Iraq, so why do we simply shrug our shoulders at hundreds of murders that aren't linked to a terrorist group?",2015-06-19,"Charleston, S.C., shooting suspect Dylann Storm Roof is escorted from the Cleveland County Courthouse in Shelby, N.C., Thursday, June 18, 2015. Roof is a suspect in the shooting of several people Wednesday night at the historic The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. (AP Photo/Chuck Burton)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb900f325000094003a5ff6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As Lilly Workneh eloquently stated regarding the massacre at Charleston's Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, ""by definition, it was a domestic act of terrorism and the gunman, a terrorist."" In fact, Workneh's assessment isn't only entirely accurate, but also represents an overlooked aspect of terrorism in 2015. While all of America hears about ISIS on a daily basis, the reality is that ISIS is a far greater threat to the citizens of Iraq than to the citizens of South Carolina or any other state in the U.S. Furthermore, while the State Department and others have lists of foreign terrorist organizations, no list exists to classify people like Dylann Roof.If Roof were linked to ISIS, would this have made a difference to the families of murdered worshipers? Would our nation be at greater risk? Would we have sent even more troops off to Iraq?No, there won't be color coded terror alerts before the next mass shooting, nor will there be discussion about how to destroy hate crimes in the manner that endless time and energy has been devoted to destroying ISIS and similar groups. The murder of nine worshipers at a historically black church wasn't only a hate crime, it was also an example of terror that can strike at any moment in America; without the attention given to terrorist groups based in the Middle East. Since we don't know how many Dylann Roof's exist in America, and since mass shootings and other forms of random violence take place all the time in the U.S., Wednesday's murderous rampage represents a threat that can't be assessed in a traditional manner. In reality, the threat of random violence from a deranged shooter is a far greater threat than ISIS, or any other terrorist group. During Bush's last four years in office, Iraq witnessed 19,535 terrorist attacks where 122,596 people were either ""killed, injured, or kidnapped"" according to the U.S. Department of State. In 2014, the Iraq Body Count lists a total of 17,144 people killed by violence in Iraq, and in 2015, 7,403 people have already died as a result of the bloodshed. No doubt, ISIS and other terrorist organizations are genocidal groups that have caused a great deal of bloodshed in Iraq and Syria, however these groups focus their madness primarily within the confines of the Middle East. Terror in the U.S. happens, and while Fox News and conservatives like neatly defined classifications, Wednesday's terror attack in South Carolina should fit into their definition of terrorism. Likewise, the Tsarnaev brothers had no ties to any terrorist organization during the Boston Marathon bombing, yet society focuses incessantly on how foreign terrorist groups will end up causing havoc in the U.S. Sadly, we don't need anyone to bring terror into the country; between the number of people who could snap at any moment and random acts like mass shootings, we're already ""fighting them over here."" Americans, and primarily the African-American community in the case of Charleston's church rampage and other attacks, experience terror and violence from threats that aren't sensationalized by the media. First, blacks experience the most hate crime. In terms of aggregate numbers, a Washington Post piece titled The ugly truth about hate crimes lists some staggering statistics:FBI hate crime data show that more than 50 out of every 1 million black citizens was the victim of a racially motivated hate crime in 2012, the highest among any racial group.How many times has Fox shown a terror alert pertaining to hate crimes in America committed ""between 200,000 and 300,000 annually""?As for mass shootings, this kind of terror takes place with frightening regularity in the U.S., without the calls for sending troops abroad or conservatives focusing on a particular religion as the culprit. A Los Angeles Times article titled It's not just a perception: Mass shootings have become more frequent, illustrates that random violence and terror (or terrorism, according to Vox's definition) have increased in regularity:Mass shootings like the one in Charleston have become more common in the U.S. since 2011.If a foreign terrorist group were responsible for a mass shooting every 64 days in America, how would Congress react and what would the reaction be from Fox News?Another article from The Washington Post titled 11 essential facts about guns and mass shootings in the United States lists some even more startling figures:Shooting sprees are not rare in the United States.Therefore, when was the last time the 547 people killed from mass shootings in 2013 were referred to as victims of terrorism? Breitbart.com rightfully labeled the Charleston murderer as ""pure evil,"" therefore aren't the murderers of these 547 victims also pure evil? True, many definitions of terrorism have a political component to them, however mass murder is mass murder: the death of innocent human beings shouldn't be confined to a politically motivated definition. If ISIS had killed 547 Americans in 2013, we'd have sent tens of thousands of Americans back to Iraq, so why do we simply shrug our shoulders at hundreds of murders that aren't linked to a terrorist group?As I wrote last year, if ISIS had committed the 11 school shootings since Sandy Hook, Congress would have declared war. This doesn't mean ISIS and others aren't a threat to the U.S.; they are a genuine terrorist threat worthy of addressing by America and other nations. However, Americans live with the threat of terror daily, but not from terrorists driving pickup trucks with machine gun turrets. Dylan Roof sat for one hour in the Charleston church before venting against African-Americans and killing nine people. What Fox News, conservative politicians worried about the next terror threat, and all other Americans concerned with terrorism should address is the threat associated with a random act of violence. While African-Americans face the most hate crimes in the U.S., random violence and other hate crimes in America could also target anyone. In 2014, a gunman targeted Jewish community centers in Kansas, but killed three Christians. ISIS, like al-Qaeda in Iraq before it, will eventually wither away and become replaced by another terror organization in Iraq and the Middle East. The next Dylan Roof won't be a threat until he or she becomes a terrorist and decides to kill Americans, simply to fulfill whatever it is that motivates this person to commit a mass shooting. Although there often times isn't a political component to mass shootings, it's terrorism; to call it any other word ignores the reality of the thousands of Americans who've died over the years. Sadly, we don't have to wait to ""fight them over here,""  we have terrorists in America today, we just don't know when they'll strike and their presence is invisible to law enforcement, American society, and our political culture."

Church in Charleston, South Carolina on Wednesday night killing nine worshippers, including its pastor, Reverend Clementa Pinckney, he struck at the very heart of black America. Established by Reverend Richard Allen, a former slave and Methodist preacher, the A.M.E. is the oldest black denomination in the country. Its roots lie in one of the first black religious and mutual help societies, the Free African Society founded by Philadelphia blacks in 1787. Like other independent churches and societies founded by newly free African Americans, it has a proud history of black protest and community activism. In 1792, Allen and Reverend Absalom Jones, led a walkout at St. George's Methodist Church in Philadelphia. They had dared to pray in the front pews reserved for whites rather than in the segregated gallery constructed for blacks. Zealous church authorities had interrupted their prayers and forced them to rise to their feet. As the story goes, this unseemly incident was the impetus for the founding of independent black churches. In 1794, with black contributions and donations from the British abolitionist Granville Sharp, President George Washington, and the Pennsylvania Abolition Society, Jones's African Episcopal Church of St. Thomas opened its doors, boasting over four hundred members. Founded the same year, Allen's Mother Bethel Methodist Church was incorporated in 1796. Later Allen composed an ""African Supplement"" to proclaim his church's autonomy. In 1816, he issued a call to all black Methodists in the surrounding area. Delegates from Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland, including Moses Brown from Charleston, South Carolina met and founded the African Methodist Episcopal Church in 1816, and Allen became its first bishop. AME churches soon spread north, west and even to the south acquiring a large congregation in Charleston, South Carolina in the midst of one of the largest slave societies in the United States. In 1818, Reverend Brown, replicating Allen's and Jones' actions, led a walkout of black members from the Methodist church protesting the treatment of black burial grounds by whites and established the AME church in Charleston with four thousand members. Right from the start, the AME, like other independent black churches, gave birth to antislavery protest. Allen and Jones were authors of early abolitionist pamphlets and petitions. Their ""An Address to Those Who Keep Slaves and Uphold the Practice,"" reminded whites that slavery is ""hateful... in the sight of God"" and that ""God himself was the first pleader of the cause of the slaves."" The most potent challenge to slavery came from the AME church in Charleston. One of its founders and class leaders, Denmark Vesey, a literate black carpenter who had bought his freedom after winning a lottery, was implicated in a slave conspiracy scare in 1822. State authorities had harassed church members and used the conspiracy as an excuse to destroy the church. Its' ministers, Brown and Reverend Henry Drayton were forced to leave South Carolina. Brown became the second bishop of the AME on Allen's death. Black Charlestonians rebuilt their church until the city outlawed independent black churches in 1834. In a fitting coda, Robert Vesey, Denmark Vesey's son, helped rebuild the Charleston church in 1865, after the Civil War and emancipation. It was renamed Emanuel AME church, a name that it carries until today.During the Civil Rights movement, the Emanuel AME Church of Charleston continued to be the site of black protest. In 1969, the South Carolina National Guard arrested the church's pastor and nine hundred others at a demonstration for hospital workers led by Coretta Scott King. The black church lay at the organizational base of the mass movement for black rights and equality in the south. With good reason, white supremacists and segregationist have targeted it, most infamously in the 1963 Birmingham church bombing that killed four young black girls. A resurgence of black church burnings in the south in the 1990s led the Justice Department to launch a civil rights investigation and civil rights activists volunteered to rebuild them. This latest attack on a black church is all too reminiscent of this tragic history.Just a year ago, the city of Charleston finally honored Denmark Vesey with a statue after years of controversy when some conservative commentators labeled him a ""terrorist."" One might well paraphrase the great black abolitionist, Frederick Douglass, who asked, ""Pray, tell me who is the barbarian here?"" during the height of lynching in the post-Civil War South. On the 150th anniversary of Juneteenth or June 19, the day many of the enslaved celebrated as the day of emancipation, one might ask, Pray, who is the terrorist here?"

""Anything less and we are losing money.""Argentina appears on an inexorable, slow-motion drive towards an economic crash landing. Annual inflation tops 25 percent, and the spread between the official exchange rate (8.78 pesos to the US dollar) and the ""blue"" market rate (roughly 12 to the US dollar) reflects underwhelming confidence in the currency. Watch ""The Crossroads Argentina"" here While comparisons to Venezuela are overblown, Argentines have faced shortages on certain staple goods such as tampons.A U.S. $2.3 billion loan -- part of an US$11 billion package -- from China offers short-term respite for foreign reserves that had dipped below U.S. $30 billion. But this represents little ammunition, especially as the country risks the prospect of a major payout, to un-restructured bond holdouts which even conservative estimates place at US$7.5 billion.Argentina also faces mounting fiscal pressure, but La Casa Rosada is likely to increase spending in this election year. Officially in default and still unable to access traditional sources of international credit, Buenos Aires will paper over any fiscal cracks in 2015 by printing pesos, which will only further stoke inflation.Unable to run for a third term and already facing decreasing public support, President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has little incentive to address major economic challenges in her final months in office. She will likely leave the hard choices for the next government.Argentina has arrived at a crossroads. The general election slated for October 2015 offers an opportunity to reform, but addressing underlying problems may require more than just a change at the top. Watch ""The Debt Crisis"" hereThe Incomplete RecoveryArgentina forged its economic policy of the last 15 years in the chaos of a 2001 crisis, which left nearly half its population below the poverty line, and the country in default on more than U.S. $80 billion in international debt.In a moment of national vulnerability, Argentina closed ranks around what it knew best. Over the next ten years the country elected three consecutive Peronist presidents. These leaders implemented the heavy-handed economic policies that characterize Argentina today.Initially, the approach seemed reasonable: Cash transfers made sense for an urban core that lost much buying power when the peso was untethered from the dollar in 2002. Similarly, price controls on basic utilities helped support a middle class in free fall. But just as pre-crisis policymakers clung to convertibility beyond the plan's period of utility, the present leadership has maintained various subsidies that probably should have been rolled back in subsequent years of strong growth.Because Buenos Aires has not completely resolved its defaulted debt, it cannot tap external financing for its expansionary fiscal policy. Unable to run a significant current account deficit, leaders of the ruling Partido Justicialista (PJ) implemented notoriously protectionist trade and currency policies.During the post-crisis boom years, the Kirchners financed subsidies by taxing the commodity windfall. But as global growth tapered following the Great Recession, all the soya in the Pampa could not hide the extent of Argentina's macroeconomic distortion.Thus, the ailments that Argentina faces today -- the inflation, the currency distortions, the holdout-provoked default -- stem directly back to emergency-era economic policy. The commodity boom may have generated years of strong growth, but soya y suerte alone could not spearhead a true recovery. Could a new president?Which Way Forward?Inside and outside Argentina, many seem convinced that the environment will improve with a new executive next year. In fact, all three major candidates -- the market-driven Mauricio Macri, the opposition-Peronist Sergio Massa, and even the PJ's Daniel Scioli -- have fronted reform-minded campaigns. The feeling of light at the end of the tunnel has pushed the blue dollar back towards the official rate. Argentine bonds have actually rallied despite the country's ongoing default.But is this faith well placed? To address Argentina's economic malaise -- and to fully close the door on the 2001 crisis -- the next government would need to address subsidies, return the keys to the Central Bank, and come to a solution with respect to debt holdout creditors.Watch ""What's Next?"" hereThese are neither easy nor popular measures for a new and untested government. Argentines may say they want change now, but will they reach for their casserole pans if their energy bills spike?Even a well-intentioned president will face complex hurdles. An agreement with the holdouts would likely require congressional support, something insiders suggest will be difficult to obtain. Macri has been competitive in polls, but as a non-Peronist he would lack a congressional majority and labor-union support. He would be challenged to replicate on a national level his success governing Buenos Aires.A few months out, the election remains up for grabs. Most polls have generally shown an advantage for Scioli over Macri of a couple of percentage points-within the margin of error-so essentially a dead heat.More in-depth polls suggest that Argentines still favor an active state hand in the economy--arguably an advantage for Scioli. A straw-poll in a gaucho bar split two, two, two and too drunk to answer.It's uncertain where to any of the candidates will guide Argentina through this crossroads, but one thing is clear: The country needs a new direction if it wants to stop the bleeding.Otaviano Canuto is an ex-Vice President and ex-Executive Director at the World Bank, as well as an ex-Vice President at the Inter-American Development Bank.

13,POLITICS,Iowa Supreme Court Strikes Down Telemedicine Abortion Ban,Samantha Lachman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/iowa-abortion-ban_n_7621646.html,,2015-06-19,"In this Sept. 22, 2010 photo, a doctor, foreground, in Des Moines, Iowa, and a nurse in a clinic in another city, demonstrate a telemedicine program with which Planned Parenthood of the Heartland clinic doctors can remotely prescribe the abortion-inducing drug RU-486. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb900fb250000cf003a5ff8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Supreme Court of Iowa unanimously ruled Friday that Planned Parenthood clinics in the state may continue using a telemedicine abortion system to provide the procedure to patients in rural areas. A 2013 rule from the Iowa Board of Medicine would have ended the practice, which helps patients who otherwise would have to travel as far as 400 miles round trip to access the procedure. More than 7,200 Iowans have used the telemedicine system to obtain medication abortion since 2008, according to the Des Moines Register. The first-in-the-nation system allows Planned Parenthood doctors in Des Moines or Iowa City to video conference with patients in outlying clinics, which dispense the pills. Medication abortion involves two medications: Mifepristone, which blocks progesterone, a hormone that is needed for pregnancy to continue, and misoprostol, which induces uterine contractions to end the pregnancy in the first trimester. Patients report that the process feels similar to having a heavy period.State regulators appointed by Iowa's Republican Gov. Terry Branstad effectively banned telemedicine abortion in 2013 by passing a rule requiring doctors to conduct a physical exam on abortion-seeking patients. The board cited safety concerns in its ruling. Branstad had replaced the board's entire membership after a different composition of members evaluated the remote delivery system in 2010 and ruled that it was safe. Sixteen other states have still effectively banned the practice of abortion via telemedicine, according to the Guttmacher Institute. On Friday, Iowa's highest court said the regulators were singling out abortion from other health services provided via telemedicine. National standards do not require a physician to perform a physical examination on a woman before providing a medication abortion. ""It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the board's medical concerns about telemedicine are selectively limited to abortion,"" the court wrote, saying that it didn't see how an in-person exam would ""provide any measurable gain in patient safety."" The court also noted that staff members in the outlying Planned Parenthood clinics take medical histories, draw blood and perform sonograms on patients, transferring those results to physicians.Planned Parenthood called the ruling ""a big victory"" for Iowans in a press release. ""This unanimous ruling says that a state cannot single out abortion with a different set of rules that don't apply to any other health care procedure, and that a state cannot prevent women from accessing safe, legal abortion,"" Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement. ""Similar restrictions and bans on abortion are being pushed through in other states, and this ruling sends a strong and clear message to politicians across the country. Restrictions and bans on abortion are unconstitutional and deeply unpopular, and we will continue to fight them in every state in this country.""The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists had called on the court to block the rule, writing that the ban is ""not justified by any medical evidence"" and ""undermines its own stated purpose 'to protect the health and safety of Iowans.'""The telemedicine option for first-trimester abortions has proven popular in Iowa. A 2013 study in the American Journal of Public Health found that the delivery system did not increase the state's abortion rate as it improved abortion access for women living in rural areas. A 2011 study of nearly 600 abortion-seeking patients interacting with Iowa's Planned Parenthood found that telemedicine patients had comparable clinical outcomes to those who visited face-to-face with a provider.

Morton)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae0e112000003000ff320a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I am an African-American ordained minister in the AME Church. I am the daughter and granddaughter of AME bishops, and I am a licensed clinical psychologist. I have spent my career working on the integration of faith and mental health, especially in the context of trauma, ranging from the medical trauma of HIV to the trauma of human trafficking. As I received the news of the terrorist attack on a historical church in Charleston, I felt an urgency to respond not only spiritually, but psychologically to address the wounds of my community. These are not new wounds, unfortunately, so this urgency is also not new, but was instead rekindled by the hate crime that left nine people dead, including a pastor who was my age as well as six women. This most recent tragedy is not an isolated violation, but an exclamation mark in a long string of violations.My lived experience and my experience as a researcher, clinician and advocate give me a psychological framework for understanding the reality of racism-based trauma. There are experiences of racism that are everyday micro-aggressions and these can have an overwhelming cumulative effect over time, but there are also single incidents that can overwhelm our normal capacity to cope and that can create traumatic stress.These traumas are sometimes referred to as intergenerational trauma, when we consider the generations that have been effected by the systemic and individual acts of covert and overt racism. Another term that is used in the psychological literature is societal trauma, which speaks to the violation of oppression. Additionally vicarious trauma occurs when we are not the direct targets, but are affected by hearing about it and in this digital age it can include seeing it directly or seeing the consequences of it live or online. We all respond to trauma differently, and there is a need for emotional space to acknowledge the impact of our experiences. We may feel shock, anger, sadness, fear or even numbness, and we may seek out people or we may isolate ourselves. Some experience intrusive thoughts, hypervigilance and avoidance of things and people that remind us of the trauma. It is important to take time to heal and to acknowledge the impact of the violations. The consequences of these traumatic experiences cross generational lines, effecting children and elders who are all deserving of care. It is important for us to know these traumas affect us, but do not define us. We are more than our wounds, and yet our wounds need to be tended. In our community, there has often been a stigma about attending therapy, but there have been a range of ways we have coped, survived and healed. Some of these include turning to family and friends, the Arts, our faith, and activism. Each of these are valuable and it is also important for us to consider the support of counseling with a counselor who is culturally aware of both the realities of racism and the richness and strength of our culture beyond racism.As a minister, I would like to briefly share some important healing steps that have empirical support and which also mirror the steps Jesus took after the trauma of the cross. 1. Be still. Jesus spent time in the tomb. It is important to take time to be still and heal instead of getting busy and ignoring our pain. 2. Connect with family and friends. Jesus appeared first to the women who had showed up to support him during his trauma. It is important for us to connect with family and friends who have showed they are trustworthy during the times of our ongoing crises. 3. Nourish. After appearing to the women, Jesus ate, and we have to remember to engage in self-care by taking time to eat, sleep, exercise and engage in other health-promoting behaviors. 4. Show your wounds. Jesus was willing to show his wounds, and we need to remember that shame often keeps us silent and isolated, but it is a gift to find those with whom we can speak of our pain without masks. 5. Separate forgiveness from reconciliation. Another important step Jesus took is demonstrating the capacity to separate forgiveness from reconciliation. There are times when we need to choose to release the pain for our mental and spiritual health, but we also have to recognize when someone is not a safe person for us to have in our intimate space. There are allies that cross demographic lines and it is important to distinguish those who are allies from those who disregard your humanity. 6. Ascend. Jesus ascended into heaven, which reminds us not to settle for merely surviving, but to go the next step to thriving and post-traumatic growth. We have the desire to be everything we were created to be, and nothing less. We want to live an abundant, empowered life, and that has to be our aim. 7. Give back. Jesus promised to return, and we have to look for ways that we can give back, create positive change, resist oppression and serve those who can benefit from the lessons we've learned. Many times we may jump to action, which is admirable, but we must also remember not to neglect tending to our souls, minds, bodies and, hearts as we move from surviving to thriving. We come from a church tradition of honoring our humanity in the face of discrimination and violence and as our elders taught us, ""walk together children. Don't you get weary. There's a great camp meeting in the promised land."""

By releasing its patents -- vowing not to sue anyone who copied them -- Tesla encouraged other companies to use its platform. In time this could result in a whole segment of the car industry being compatible with Tesla's chargers. Not to mention that, as electric vehicles are more widely adopted, Tesla’s customer base grows.Moreover, other automakers could build battery-powered cars at a cheaper price than Tesla. Tesla’s Model S sedan starts at about $70,000. A release date for the planned Model 3 line of more affordable vehicles -- Musk says the company is hoping for a $35,000 price tag -- has yet to be announced. “What about people who can’t afford the Tesla?” Tyler said during the radio interview. “They’ll get the Ford one that’s not f-----g up the earth. It’s all relative. It’s sick that he did that.”The rapper said he had yet to meet Musk. They planned to cross paths in April at the Coachella music festival, but their schedules didn’t align. The billionaire entrepreneur, who serves as CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and as chairman of SolarCity, came up in conversation after Tyler listed him as someone who has achieved an impressive level of success.“If you look at Jay, P. Diddy, Elon Musk, I’m nothing,” he said.But, as much as musicians may like him, Musk still doesn't enjoy the same name recognition as Jay Z or Diddy. “Elon Musk?” the interviewer, Ebro Darden, asked. “Is that a cologne or something?”"

I am an Itinerant Elder in the African Methodist Episcopal Church, yet, prayer doesn't seem like enough. I need action. I need change.The group of faithful members of Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church in Charleston, South Carolina, were praying Wednesday night when a shooter invited himself into the church and terrorized the members, leaving nine dead. A 5-year-old little girl had to play dead just to survive. This imagery instantly takes me back to the history of violence in churches due to hundreds of years of anti-black racism. It's a memory that takes us back to the day four girls were murdered in the bombing of the 16th Street Church in Birmingham in 1963. The AME Church has been an ark of safety for me for a long time. My parents dropped me off at church a few times a week for activities, leaving me in the care of other adults who taught me. We never imagined anything would happen at the church. I'm sure that's what the parents of the 5-year-old survivor thought when they left her at church. And yet, the AME church was formed to escape the violence of racism.In 1787, Bishop Richard Allen and his colleagues walked about of St. George's Methodist Episcopal Church because they were not allowed to pray at the altar. Together, they formed the Free African Society, a space where black enslaved individuals could worship freely, in our own culture, not segregated to the balcony or the back of the church, and with the ability get loud or stay quiet as they caught the spirit. These black havens were so powerful that our country outlawed all-black churches in 1834.As I studied our church's history through my ordination training, I grew more proud of this history and of the resilience of black people in the struggle for our freedom. For centuries, the black Church was the only entirely black space for those who worked as maids, butlers and sharecroppers. Even in the present generation, it remains one of the few solely black spaces we have. It is a space free from having to speak up about race daily at my job, of the feeling of looking different than most of the people I spend my days with. Living in a racist and racially defined society is exhausting. The church is my place to refresh and escape from the legacy of racism. The people at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church could not escape the legacy and violence of racism, even in their sacred black space. Why? Because we live in a country where black spaces cannot thrive. This shooting was not a senseless crime. It makes perfect sense that a white man, who, by virtue of his skin color and gender, is able to enter any space, specifically spaces that are marked as a safe haven for black lives, and wreak havoc. It makes sense in a country where white children beg for the ability to use the word ""nigger"" despite knowing that it is a hateful word. It makes sense in a country where white people, when not invited to certain spaces, to speak a certain language, to wear a certain style of dress and hair, hijack them and the many rush to defend them. It makes sense in a country where most of the occupiers of the prisons are black men, for drug-related crimes, when whites and black use and sell drugs at the same rates. It makes sense in a country where the police open fire on black youth, and when the black community march in the streets in protest of the violence, they open fire, again.As I scrolled through my Facebook feed the morning after the shooting, many AME colleagues called for us to pray for the Emanuel AME Church family. I also noticed the number of white Christian allies sharing their anger through photos, memes, articles and, of course, Martin Luther King quotes. It saddened me that white Christians seem angrier that this happened in a place of worship, a space that they are familiar with, than that it happened to a group of black people. I'm glad they are angry, but they're not angry for the same reasons I am. They're not angry at the root cause of the problem. To end racism, the world needs white Christians to address their own racism. To my white Christian brethren, I don't need for you to tell me how angry you are. I need you to tell your white family members, friends and congregants. I need you to talk about your anger at racism and white supremacy from the pulpit. I need you to urge your congregants to address racism in their own family. White folks know who their racist family members and friends are -- now is not the time sit idly by and ignore it. We must face those who we love, and challenge their prejudice. White folks must say, ""no more"" to racism, especially when it's a system that they benefit from.I urge white pastors in all white churches to have racial justice conversations as a part of their Bible studies and sermons. There are many passages of Scripture than can be used to address slavery, such as Galatians 3:28, ""There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus."" White pastors can lift up the stories of Hagar, Rahab and Ruth, all women who were ""othered"" in the Hebrew narrative, but they were all instrumental in building the nation of Israel. I urge white pastors to study liberation theology, and read passages of Scripture with a critical racial lens. As Congressman Jim Clyburn said when addressing his community after the massacre, ""If we stay silent, they win. They must not win.""I'm asking white allies to join me in my commitment to anti-racism, but to do so in your own communities. Now is the time to stand up for the sanctity of black lives. We must not stay silent, at the pulpit or in the streets. We must speak out to end the violence and racism that permeates our society."
17,POLITICS,Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy Goes Out Of His Way To Denounce Solitary Confinement,Samantha Lachman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-solitary-confinement-_n_7614776.html,,2015-06-18,"Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy speaks to faculty members at the University of Pennsylvania law school, Thursday, Oct. 3, 2013, in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e691877230000d11a0c257f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Justice Anthony Kennedy agreed with the majority in a capital punishment case Thursday. But in an unusual move, he dedicated almost all of his concurring opinion to condemning the practice of solitary confinement in the nation's prisons, even though the issue, of his own admission, had ""no direct bearing"" on the case. The case concerned whether the defendant, Hector Ayala, should have been able to argue that prosecutors intentionally excluded black and Hispanic jurors during his 1989 trial for a triple murder during a San Diego drug robbery four years earlier. The trial judge asked prosecutors to justify why they had excused all seven potential minority jurors, but accepted their explanations in a private hearing without providing an opportunity for Ayala's lawyers to respond. On Thursday, the court's conservative wing, joined by Kennedy, held that any jury selection error in the case was harmless, overturning a decision from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In Kennedy's lengthy opinion concerning how Ayala was incarcerated, he noted that Ayala had been isolated for most of his 25 years of custody. The justice wrote that at least 25,000 of the country's inmates are serving a substantial amount of their sentence in isolation, ""many regardless of their conduct in prison."" ""If [Ayala's] solitary confinement follows the usual pattern, it is likely respondent has been held for all or most of the past 20 years or more in a windowless cell no larger than a typical parking spot for 23 hours a day; and in the one hour when he leaves it, he likely is allowed little or no opportunity for conversation or interaction with anyone,"" Kennedy wrote. Kennedy's opinion emphasized growing evidence that solitary confinement irreparably harms prisoners, quoting authors Charles Dickens and Fyodor Dostoyevsky along the way. Crucially, he invites litigation -- which is already winding its way through the federal court system -- over the issue. Kennedy frequently serves as the court's swing vote, so this invitation may hearten criminal justice reform advocates. ""In a case that presented the issue, the judiciary may be required, within its proper jurisdiction and authority, to determine whether workable alternative systems for long-term confinement exist, and, if so, whether a correctional system should be required to adopt them,"" he wrote. The justice suggested that the public wasn't sufficiently interested in how prisoners are incarcerated.""Too often, discussion in the legal academy and among practitioners and policymakers concentrates simply on the adjudication of guilt or innocence,"" he argued. ""Too easily ignored is the question of what comes next. Prisoners are shut away -- out of sight, out of mind. It seems fair to suggest that, in decades past, the public may have assumed lawyers and judges were engaged in a careful assessment of correctional policies, while most lawyers and judges assumed these matters were for the policymakers and correctional experts."" Kennedy's condemnation of solitary confinement provoked sarcastic disagreement from Justice Clarence Thomas, who was also in the court's majority. Thomas argued that Ayala's accommodations in prison were better than those of his victims. ""I join the Court’s opinion explaining why Ayala is not entitled to a writ of habeas corpus from this or any other federal court,"" Thomas wrote. ""I write separately only to point out, in response to the separate opinion of JUSTICE KENNEDY, that the accommodations in which Ayala is housed are a far sight more spacious than those in which his victims, Ernesto Dominguez Mendez, Marcos Antonio Zamora, and Jose Luis Rositas, now rest. And, given that his victims were all 31 years of age or under, Ayala will soon have had as much or more time to enjoy those accommodations as his victims had time to enjoy this Earth."" Kennedy's advocacy on the issue has previously gone beyond the pages of his opinions: In March, he told a House of Representatives subcommittee that ""solitary confinement literally drives men mad."" The stance fits in with Kennedy's overall emphasis on the concept of dignity. In his Thursday opinion, Kennedy suggested that the public is increasingly becoming aware of the issue. He cited news articles about Kalief Browder, who committed suicide earlier this month after being put in solitary for roughly two-thirds of his three years at New York City's Rikers Island jail complex. Browder was charged with stealing a backpack, but was confined to solitary without standing trial or being found guilty of the charge. ""Over 150 years ago, Dostoyevsky wrote, 'The degree of civilization in a society can be judged by entering its prisons,'"" Kennedy concluded. ""There is truth to this in our own time.""

""You rape our women and you're taking over our country. And you have to go,"" said the alleged killer, Dylann Storm Roof, a white South Carolinian, according to media reports.South Carolina Governor Nikki R. Haley asked for prayer and said, ""We'll never understand what motivates anyone to enter one of our places of worship and take the life of another,"" according to The New York Times.Governor Haley could not have been more mistaken. Racism caused this. Easy access to guns caused this. Hate caused this. It would surprise no one if it were determined that mental illness played a role in the events of last night. But this event did not begin last night. It started with the slave trade. It will be remembered and marked as an ugly stain in America's on-going struggle for justice.To that small minority who see this crime against humanity as a victory: Know that God is with the people of Mother Emanuel. God is with those working to end gun violence. God is with those seeking to create more just systems of accountability. God is with those working for economic justice. Yes, God takes sides and calls those of us who follow that call to take sides with both humbleness and a fierce desire for justice.""The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it."" -- (John 1:5 NRSV)"

Marco Rubio (R-FL) questions Assistant U.S. Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Roberta Jacobson as she testifies before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee May 20, 2015 in Washington, DC. The committee heard testimony on the topic of 'U.S. Cuban Relations - The Way Forward.'

Marco Rubio's (R-Fla.) speech at an annual conference of conservatives in the nation's capital on Thursday, demanding that he shield federal programs that would protect undocumented immigrations from deportation.""Implement DAPA! Protect DACA!"" two activists repeatedly shouted at the Faith & Freedom conference, referring to Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, Obama administration programs that would offer deportation relief to certain young undocumented immigrants and their parents. Both programs have been challenged in court and are currently on hold.The junior senator from Florida, who is running for president, responded to the protesters by acknowledging their right to stand up and be heard.""If you do that in another country, you'd be in jail tonight,"" Rubio said to applause. ""They have a right to be rude and they have a right to be wrong. We live in a free society.""Event organizers escorted the activists out of the room shortly after, but they could still be heard shouting outside the room as Rubio continued his speech.The senator has a tenuous history with immigration reform. Earlier this year, as he was weighing a run for the White House, Rubio told a crowd of conservatives that he made a mistake in supporting a bipartisan Senate bill that included a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. He now maintains that the U.S. must first bolster security on its southern border before addressing comprehensive immigration reform, a position more in line with the conservative wing of his party.Rubio isn't the only presidential contender to draw heat over his position on immigration. Activists interrupted former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) as he announced his campaign for president earlier this week in a speech at Miami-Dade College. Unlike Rubio, however, Bush favors granting undocumented immigrants ""legal status"" -- a more moderate position, but one immigration activists say still does not go far enough."
