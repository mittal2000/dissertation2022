Then one doctor had an idea: Let them play sports.,2016-09-07,"Joep de Beer of Doorn, Holland, leans into the javelin from his wheelchair during the Stoke Mandeville Games for paraplegic contestants.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d01d621700002430c781e1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Less than a century ago, a spinal cord injury was considered something of a death sentence. Most people before World War II died within three years of sustaining one. And before death, they were mostly cast aside from society and forgotten, largely considered a lost cause.But something changed in 1944 when a doctor named Ludwig Guttmann opened the Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Great Britain. A Jewish emigrant from Nazi Germany, Guttmann was a neurologist by trade who hoped to improve the general condition of paraplegics, and the Stoke Mandeville Hospital would become his center for helping those who sustained spinal injuries ― at first from the war, particularly from D-Day.Unlike his neurological predecessors, however, Guttmann decided to focus not just on the body, but on the mind. One of the major issues for people with spinal cord injuries, he realized, was depression, understandably developed after being discarded by society and left in beds. And so, he worked tirelessly to infuse something new in them: a sense of optimism. “They had basically been told in their previous hospitals that they would never walk again and that they were going to die. As a result most of them were badly depressed and not interested in doing anything. They had got used to lying immobile for months on end,” Joan, a nurse at the hospital, once remembered. “And then suddenly here were these nurses saying, ‘You can do this. We’ve got to get you up.’” While Guttmann obsessed over his patients, he treated them like people, listening to them in hopes of discovering ways to convince the others that they had a place within society, too, rather than beside it. One of his chief rules, in fact, came not from him, but from one of his patients, who said, “The first duty of the paraplegic patient is to cheer up his visitors.”The aha moment came at lunchtime in 1945, when Guttmann witnessed some of his patients using their walking sticks to hit a puck around. Up to that point, Guttmann had been focused on turning them in their beds, but realized he could do more. “Games, sport, that is what we must have,” he reportedly said.Soon, the patients were competing in games of darts and archery and snooker. Then he moved them into team games, like wheelchair polo (a little too rough, it ended up) and wheelchair netball. The games served as a way to remind the patients they hadn’t lost their humanity, and they still had reason to believe in themselves. And it worked. “My eyes were opened when we received one particular patient in 1956,” John Silver, one of Guttman’s doctors, once said. “He had had to wait 18 months before he could get transferred to Stoke; and when he came to us, he had every complication in the book; he was covered in pressure sores; his kidneys were full of stones; he was practically dead. And this man, working with poor staff who he had welded into a team that he could rely on (he had done it all himself), he cured him, sent him out into the world and back to a meaningful life.”Eventually, Guttmann decided even more could be done. And in July 1948, on the same day of the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games, he had 16 servicemen and women compete in an archery competition that would become known as the first Stoke Mandeville Games. Over the next decade, the annual games would add sports and participants every year. In 1949, Guttmann added netball, and 37 competed. In 1950, he added javelin, and 61 competed. In 1951, he added snooker, and 126 competed. In 1952, former servicemen from the Netherlands competed, creating the International Stoke Mandeville Games. By 1954, the Stoke Mandeville Games included 250 competitors in seven sports from 14 nations. And by 1960, the games had moved out of Stoke Mandeville and into Rome, where what is now considered the first official Paralympic Games were played. At the time, they were called, simply, the 9th Annual International Stoke Mandeville Games.Today, many people misinterpret the term “Paralympic,” thinking it to be a reference to paraplegics. But in truth, it means something much more in line with Guttman’s vision. “Para,” in this instance, comes from a Greek preposition, which means “to stand alongside.” In this case, as equals. "

2,POLITICS,Why Trump's Attack On The Federal Reserve Makes No Sense,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-attacks-federal-reserve_us_57cf51a1e4b0a48094a67d0f,The GOP nominee claims the central bank is favoring President Obama with low interest rates.,2016-09-07,Donald Trump thinks the Federal Reserve is rigging the entire economy to help President Barack Obama.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57cf524d180000b429bcfa55.jpeg?cache=XKuq0sUebF&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump on Monday added the Federal Reserve to the long list of elite institutions he believes are in the tank for his political enemies, asserting that the central bank is helping President Barack Obama by inflating a stock market bubble through low interest rates.“We have a very false economy,” Trump told reporters during a Labor Day campaign swing in Ohio. “At some point the rates are going to have to change.”“The only thing that is strong is the artificial stock market,” he said.Trump, Reuters reported, has alluded to the charge in the past, claiming the Fed is keeping interest rates low for “political reasons.”Hillary Clinton responded on Tuesday by criticizing Trump for breaching protocol surrounding the independence of the central bank. She argued that presidents and presidential candidates should not comment on Fed interest rate decisions at all.Whatever one thinks of Clinton’s institutional critique ― Bernie Sanders, for example, would clearly disagree ― Clinton could just as easily have attacked the substance of Trump’s remarks. Like many of Trump’s allegations, this one is demonstrably false.There is no evidence of a stock market bubble. And if there were, raising borrowing costs throughout the economy by increasing the Fed’s benchmark interest rate would be a terrible way to do it.Dean Baker, co-director of the Washington-based Center for Economic and Policy Research and one of the few economists to predict the late-2000s housing bubble, sees no signs that stocks are dangerously overpriced.Adjusting for economic growth, Baker estimates that stocks are one-third lower in value than they were in 2000, when there was a real stock-market bubble.But if there were such a bubble, economists like Baker argue that hiking interest rates would amount to using a proverbial shotgun on a problem that requires a more precise weapon.The Fed has a dual mandate to maximize employment and prevent runaway price inflation by raising or lowering the target range of the federal funds rate. That is the interest rate banks charge one another for overnight lending, and it is a benchmark for interest on lending throughout the economy, such as mortgages, cars and student debt.Raising the federal funds rate could make it less attractive to buy stocks by increasing the costs of borrowing to buy stocks and providing greater return on other forms of investment.The collateral damage from such a move would be significant though. Higher interest rates across the economy mean less money in consumers’ pockets, which would slow economic growth and the pace of job creation.The Fed could just as easily use its bully pulpit to call out runaway investment in certain sectors or tighten select regulations on financial institutions to deflate overvalued assets. Those techniques could burst a bubble without bringing the economy down with it, many economists insist.Trump is right about one thing: The economy would be much worse off if the pace of rate increases had been faster.But rather than merely helping Obama ― and, one assumes, Clinton, his party’s nominee ― the central bank has simply crafted monetary policy that is consistent with their dual mandate.The damage done by the Great Recession in the wake of the financial crisis was so great that even a record streak of net job creation has failed to heal the labor market.The official unemployment rate may be a rosy 4.9 percent, but other figures reveal that the country is still suffering. When counting workers who have given up looking for work or want to work full time but can only find part-time hours, the unemployment rate is 9.7 percent.Congress, which would normally stimulate consumer demand with tax cuts or spending increases, has insisted on austerity, warning that deficit spending would spark hyperinflation.Instead their efforts have limited the government’s tools for ensuring an adequate recovery, even as the inflation they warned about has failed to materialize.The Federal Reserve, by contrast, has won the moniker “the only game in town,” because it has refused to do the equivalent on the monetary side of the equation by raising rates as rapidly as hawks have wanted it to do.For seven years after the financial crisis, the Fed kept the benchmark federal funds rate at a range of 0 to 0.25 percent. The Fed raised it to a range of 0.25 to 0.5 percent in December, where it remains.“If the inflation rate were rising, getting to 3, 4 percent, Trump would have a good case” that the Fed is somehow interfering in politics, Baker said. Inflation has yet to reach 2 percent, the Fed’s target rate.If anything, the Fed is more concerned about inflation than it needs to be. The central bank has hinted that it will raise the benchmark rate one-quarter of a percentage point when its policymaking committee meets later this month, despite a lackluster August jobs report and the protests of economists like Baker.As usual, however, it is hard to know which of Trump’s positions on the Fed to take seriously. He made similar rumblings in August 2015 about low rates inflating a financial asset bubble.But in May, he said rates needed to stay low so as not to boost the value of the dollar and hurt U.S. exports. He also suggested that he would replace Janet Yellen as Fed chair, not for policy reasons, but because she is “not a Republican.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

5,POLITICS,Black Voters Have Some Ideas About Gun Violence Donald Trump Could Use,Mariah Stewart,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-black-voters-guns_us_57cae5dee4b0e60d31df565b,He can start by ditching the idea that more guns will solve the problem.,2016-09-07,Donald Trump says he can protect people from gun violence. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57cae74c160000231cc0067c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump’s attempts to appeal to black voters have mostly fallen flat ― his use of tragedy to suggest that he’ll protect people from gun violence, for example, and his assertion that black voters have nothing to lose by voting for him. Perhaps unsurprisingly, his popularity with black voters has been hovering in the single digits.During his visit to a black church in Detroit on Saturday, Trump called for “a civil rights agenda for our time.” He was characteristically short on policy details, though he said he was visiting Great Faith Ministries International to “learn” about what the black community wants: “I am here to listen to you,” he said.If Trump really wants to listen, black and Latino communities have plenty of ideas about addressing gun violence ― which differ pretty significantly from those of white voters. A Huffington Post/YouGov poll found that while only 25 percent of white respondents felt that passing stricter gun control laws would be “very helpful,” 47 percent of black respondents felt that way, along with 51 percent of Hispanic respondents.Meanwhile, 32 percent of white respondents felt that allowing more private citizens to carry guns would be “very helpful,” compared to just 9 percent of black and 15 percent of Hispanic respondents. The poll, conducted in December, surveyed 1,000 adults.Thirty-two percent of black respondents and 38 percent of Hispanic respondents also said that laws that make it easy for people to obtain guns were among the biggest contributing factors to gun violence in their communities, compared to just 15 percent of whites. The partisan split on gun violence was even starker, with 58 percent of Democrats saying stricter gun control laws would be very helpful in reducing the violence, compared to 11 percent of Republicans. And Republicans were more likely to think that allowing more private citizens to carry guns would be very helpful, at 43 percent, compared to just 12 percent of Democrats.There was a general consensus across the racial and ethnic groups that creating programs that help reduce poverty in high-crime areas and programs that keep teenagers from joining gangs would be helpful in addressing gun violence. On gun issues, Trump has aligned himself with the NRA, a group that has opposed every gun proposal before Congress in recent years. And he has suggested that more guns would help address violence.The split in poll responses along racial lines makes more sense when, for instance, you drive down almost any street in St. Louis and see a shrine of teddy bears and flowers memorializing someone killed by a gun. In 2015, there were 188 homicides in the city ― 178 of those committed with a gun, according to St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department records. Over 90 percent of the St. Louis residents killed by guns in 2015 were African-Americans, and nearly two-thirds of them were younger than 30 years old.The proportion of homicides in St. Louis that were committed with a gun has increased in recent years, from 86 percent in 2013 to 87 percent in 2014 and 95 percent last year. But while death at the end of a barrel occurs much more frequently in black and brown communities, the voices of those communities are left out of the national discussion of gun control. “Gun control” is a topic that comes up in national news and politics only in the wake of a mass shooting, not as it relates to the dozens upon dozens of shootings in a city like St. Louis. But rather than restricting access to guns ― as many of these respondents felt was necessary to protect their communities ― states like Missouri have moved to make them more available. In 2014, Missouri lawmakers passed a measure stating that it would not enforce federal laws that infringe on gun rights. Under the law, citizens have an “unalienable” right to bear firearms, and state residents could sue if they felt that law enforcement was infringing on those rights.More recently, Gov. Jay Nixon (D) vetoed a bill that would eliminate the need for concealed carry permits. The Senate plans to attempt an override of that veto on Sept. 14.Missouri’s gun laws are already pretty lax. Residents aren’t required to have a permit to purchase a gun. They don’t have to register their firearms, and they don’t have to have a license. There are no restrictions on magazine capacity, and there is nothing preventing people from purchasing the kind of semi-automatic weapons that some other states have banned. Although the 2014 bill later expired in the legislature, lawmakers’ move to undermine federal law and make the state’s rules even more lax drew criticism from those whom gun violence has affected most. “They should have never passed that law. It’s senseless,” James Bolden said of the 2014 legislation. Bolden’s 9-year-old daughter Jamyla was fatally shot through a window while doing her homework in her Ferguson, Missouri, home in August 2015. Police arrested 21-year-old De’Eris Brown for the shooting and charged him with second-degree murder, but have not described a potential motive for the crime. State Rep. Stacey Newman, a Democrat representing a suburb of St. Louis, also criticized the bill. Law enforcement officials in St. Louis fought strongly against the proposal, she said, because it “hamstrings” their ability to prosecute gun crimes. “It gives criminals more gun rights,” Newman told HuffPost.Newman says she has been working closely with St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay, St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson and an anti-gun violence initiative affiliated with Washington University. The initiative invites community leaders, scholars and professionals to study gun violence and create solutions.Jooyoung Lee, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Toronto, said the debate over gun violence “too often gets mired and stuck too centrally on gun control as the magic bullet or the panacea that’s going to fix everything.”“When the media covers school shootings, there is a public uproar on getting tough on guns. But the people who are really affected at a statistical level by access to guns are black and brown communities in the U.S.,” Lee told HuffPost. Communities of color tend to be more interested in other ways of addressing the issues that underlie gun violence ― issues like “improving the educational system, building more affordable housing, and increasing people’s access to health care,” Lee said. “Some of these are the basic necessities in life, that many people who are wrapped up in the gun control debate take for granted.”The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Dec. 9-10, 2015, among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling.

Sullivan held the Bible during the swearing-in ceremony for Surgeon General Regina Benjamin in 2010. Sullivan, a Republican former secretary of Health and Human Services, is endorsing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Louis Wade Sullivan, the only African-American to serve as a cabinet secretary under former President George H. W. Bush, said Wednesday that he’s crossing party lines to endorse the Democratic nominee for president, Hillary Clinton.“I’m an American, and I’m concerned about my country,” Sullivan told The Huffington Post. “Though my enthusiasm for Hillary Clinton is somewhat tempered, I certainly believe she is an infinitely better choice for president than Donald Trump.” Sullivan, who was health and human services secretary throughout Bush’s presidency, said he has not publicly supported a presidential candidate since he left his cabinet position in 1993. He described himself as a lifelong moderate Republican, with the exception of a vote for John F. Kennedy in 1960. Sullivan was honored in 2014 at a Republican National Committee event saluting the party’s black trailblazers.Sullivan praised Clinton’s experience and temperament and shared a laundry list of concerns about GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, from his polarizing rhetoric to his unwillingness to release his tax returns. “He has impressed me as someone who is unstable, who regularly changes his mind, who has not articulated a clear underpinning for the policies that he has espoused,” Sullivan said.“I’m concerned about his attitude toward minorities,” he added. “His statements against Mexicans I find repulsive; the same of his statements toward Muslims and his ridicule of women. I want to have a president that I can be proud of.”Sullivan joins two other GOP former cabinet secretaries and a host of other high-ranking Republicans from previous administrations in rejecting his own party’s nominee and supporting Clinton, though he does not plan to campaign or fundraise on her behalf.In 1975, Sullivan founded the Morehouse School of Medicine, now one of the country’s leading medical schools for black students. Asked about Trump’s recent efforts to woo black voters, Sullivan was unimpressed.“I see them as very superficial,” he said. “They don’t convince me as being genuine. He’s said that blacks don’t have anything to lose if he was president. Well, I’m interested in: What do they have to gain? He has not articulated that.”“Both Clintons have worked over the years with the black community on a number of issues, so I have every confidence that their relationship is genuine,” Sullivan added. “On the other hand, I’m not aware of anything that Trump has done positive with the black community.”Of the cabinet secretaries who served under the last Republican president, George W. Bush, nine have endorsed Trump while seven have said they will not support the GOP nominee, according to a tally by HuffPost. Another 18 have not publicly declared a position on either candidate.Steve Preston, a Republican businessman who headed two federal agencies under the younger Bush, told HuffPost that he remains undecided.“I think both Trump and Clinton have pretty significant policy positions that would be out of line with my thinking and I’m really looking forward to listening to the debates,” he said.Preston bemoaned what he described as a lack of specificity from the major candidates on the economic issues he cares most about, particularly regulatory, tax and trade policy.“I think the whole debate has gone toward rhetorical, emotional sound bites on both sides,” he added.Preston acknowledged both candidates have been heavily critical of the type of free trade agreements he supports, although he sees opportunities for deal-making under a President Trump.“If Trump wins the presidency, and you’ve got a Republican legislature, there are a lot of things that can happen,” he said. “There’s a lot of horse-trading that can happen when you’ve got people of the same party in both branches of government to move things across the line.”“I do not know what I’m going to do when I walk into the voter booth,” Preston added. “I have three voting-age children who ask me every other day what I think they should do. I honestly don’t know.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

He described himself as a lifelong moderate Republican, with the exception of a vote for John F. Kennedy in 1960. Sullivan was honored in 2014 at a Republican National Committee event saluting the party’s black trailblazers.Sullivan praised Clinton’s experience and temperament and shared a laundry list of concerns about GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, from his polarizing rhetoric to his unwillingness to release his tax returns. “He has impressed me as someone who is unstable, who regularly changes his mind, who has not articulated a clear underpinning for the policies that he has espoused,” Sullivan said.“I’m concerned about his attitude toward minorities,” he added. “His statements against Mexicans I find repulsive; the same of his statements toward Muslims and his ridicule of women. I want to have a president that I can be proud of.”Sullivan joins two other GOP former cabinet secretaries and a host of other high-ranking Republicans from previous administrations in rejecting his own party’s nominee and supporting Clinton, though he does not plan to campaign or fundraise on her behalf.In 1975, Sullivan founded the Morehouse School of Medicine, now one of the country’s leading medical schools for black students. Asked about Trump’s recent efforts to woo black voters, Sullivan was unimpressed.“I see them as very superficial,” he said. “They don’t convince me as being genuine. He’s said that blacks don’t have anything to lose if he was president. Well, I’m interested in: What do they have to gain? He has not articulated that.”“Both Clintons have worked over the years with the black community on a number of issues, so I have every confidence that their relationship is genuine,” Sullivan added. “On the other hand, I’m not aware of anything that Trump has done positive with the black community.”Of the cabinet secretaries who served under the last Republican president, George W. Bush, nine have endorsed Trump while seven have said they will not support the GOP nominee, according to a tally by HuffPost. Another 18 have not publicly declared a position on either candidate.Steve Preston, a Republican businessman who headed two federal agencies under the younger Bush, told HuffPost that he remains undecided.“I think both Trump and Clinton have pretty significant policy positions that would be out of line with my thinking and I’m really looking forward to listening to the debates,” he said.Preston bemoaned what he described as a lack of specificity from the major candidates on the economic issues he cares most about, particularly regulatory, tax and trade policy.“I think the whole debate has gone toward rhetorical, emotional sound bites on both sides,” he added.Preston acknowledged both candidates have been heavily critical of the type of free trade agreements he supports, although he sees opportunities for deal-making under a President Trump.“If Trump wins the presidency, and you’ve got a Republican legislature, there are a lot of things that can happen,” he said. “There’s a lot of horse-trading that can happen when you’ve got people of the same party in both branches of government to move things across the line.”“I do not know what I’m going to do when I walk into the voter booth,” Preston added. “I have three voting-age children who ask me every other day what I think they should do. I honestly don’t know.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

So it was only a matter of time before this happened: Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich began coughing while criticizing Clinton for coughing.Phlegmghazi occurred Tuesday during a discussion on Sean Hannity’s radio show as the two conservatives dissected Clinton’s coughing fit at a campaign event in Cleveland earlier this week.“Now you sound like Hillary!” Hannity exclaimed. “Can I get you a drink of water? By the way, yours didn’t last 4 minutes and 20 seconds ― thank God!”“No, I’m in good shape,” Gingrich said. “At least I’m in better shape than Hillary.” Ironically, both Gingrich and Hannity then acknowledged that frequently flying can dry out the throat, at least for them. “I fly so much, my throat dries out,” Gingrich admitted. “It does,” Hannity agreed. “You have to keep hydrated big-time.” Clinton, who’s been traveling the country for campaign events, has blamed her coughing on allergies. A letter her doctor released last year also noted that Clinton suffers from “seasonal pollen allergies.” The allergy index for Cleveland on Monday reached medium-high levels of 8.9, according to Pollen.com.

12,POLITICS,Trump's New Military Plan Will Cost $150 Billion -- At The Very Least,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trumps-new-military-plan_us_57d09664e4b03d2d4598435b,Some analysts say the Republican nominee's proposals don't make much sense.,2016-09-07,Donald Trump has an expensive plan for the military.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump’s plan to reform the United States military has some elements that veer sharply from Republican orthodoxy, such as an end to foreign intervention, and others that hew closely to it, such as bolstering weapons programs. But the main feature of the proposal, as outlined in a speech on Wednesday morning, is that it comes with a serious price tag. Trump’s reforms would cost the U.S. government an estimated $150 billion over the next 10 years, according to an analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan budget watchdog. That takes into account all of the offsets that Trump himself identified as means to pay for his policies. And that $150 billion estimate is, the group acknowledged, “generous” to the Republican nominee. Other analysts discounted some of Trump’s proposed pay-fors as unserious efforts to bring down the cost that have limited, if any, chance of becoming law. “My overall assessment,” said Stan Collender, a well-regarded budget expert, is “he wants to spend more and will increase the deficit and government borrowing to do it. The rest is all pure fiscal BS and it shows Trump isn’t ready for prime time on the budget.”At the heart of Trump’s plan is the lifting of spending caps known as sequestration. Established in a 2011 deal to avoid a debt ceiling default, those caps have been partially dulled by budget deals hammered out by lawmakers these past few Congresses. Trump doesn’t want a similar deal to those of the past, though. Instead, he calls for lifting only the caps on defense spending while keeping in place the caps for spending on non-defense. Trump framed this decision as a geopolitical imperative, arguing that the United States is forfeiting its military advantage by sticking to sequestration. In reality, the nearly $600 billion the government spends on defense is roughly $60 billion short of what the next 14 biggest defense-budgeting countries spend combined.  Either way, lifting the defense caps comes at a significant cost, which the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated to be roughly $450 billion through 2026, before interest. But Trump, in his speech, pledged to pay for it all. And here is where his math doesn’t appear to add up.To cover the cost, Trump proposed things like eliminating “government waste and budget gimmicks,” collecting unpaid tax revenues, reducing the size of the government “through responsible workforce attrition,” and ending the funding of programs that are not authorized in law. He tossed around figures for how much money all of these reforms might save. And, needless to say, budget experts don’t agree with him.“Even generous estimates of these policies suggest they would only save about $300 billion over a decade,” said the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.  A more biting analysis came from Collender, who argued that Trump’s proposals are essentially fictitious. Eliminating budget gimmicks, he noted, would actually increase the cost of Trump’s plan since “gimmicks are a way to make it look like you’re spending less. Cut them and spending goes up, not down.” As for collecting unpaid taxes, Collender noted that would require more IRS agents, a prospect Republicans are loath to consider. “The GOP Congress has cut IRS so deeply that it can’t do its job,” he explained. “Does Trump really think the GOP will go for increasing the IRS budget and doing more audits?”Analyses like this certainly will hurt claims from Trump, already difficult to take at face value, that he will find a way to fully pay for his military reforms. But it’s unlikely he will stop making the claims. Trump is already also proposing a massive tax cut and a major investment in infrastructure, in addition to a pledge not to touch entitlement programs ― all while insisting the debt is a huge burden that must be dealt with.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Conrad left the limelight and hefty MTV paychecks to focus on her fashion career, launching laurenconrad.com and thebeautydepartment.com.As the proprietor of two websites, one would think that Conrad, 30, might be at least tangentially familiar with Graphics Interchange Format ― more commonly referred to as a GIF. Nope. Vanity Fair recently caught up with Conrad, who assured the publication she has no plans to return to reality TV, although she is thankful that some of the most important moments in her life were not only immortalized on film, but “beautifully lit and shot with a soundtrack.” But when VF asked whether she liked the GIFs of her that people have created from “The Hills,” things took a very unexpected turn.“I don’t understand how to use a GIF,” Conrad stated.VF pressed further, asking whether that included the iconic GIF of a single mascara-stained-tear rolling down her face, to which she responded: “It always shows me crying, that’s all it is. I don’t cry very often, either, so I’m like, ‘I never look that sad!’”TL;DR: Lauren Conrad somehow doesn’t understand how to use GIFs."

He responded by calling 911 and rushing inside with a tire iron, which he used to beat Nash in the building’s elevator as he tried to escape.The medical examiner found cocaine in Nash’s system and declared his death a homicide, prosecutors said.Diallo was charged with assault, criminal possession of a weapon and harassment. He was released on his own recognizance in June."

The president should be standing up for America. The president should be encouraging every American to honor the flag that so many have bled and died for and to honor the freedom that it stands for.”Kaepernick has said he’s “not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.”Obama backed Kaepernick’s protest on Saturday, saying the football player “cares about some real legitimate issues.”“If nothing else, what he’s done is he’s generated more conversation around some topics that need to be talked about,” the president said.Other athletes, including soccer star Megan Rapinoe and 49ers safety Eric Reid, Kaepernick’s teammate, have also recently taken a knee during the anthem."

Do you know what the difference between real superheroes and comic-book superheroes is? Real superheroes didn’t wear spandex. So I don’t know. Spandex must cost a lot.” Ben Affleck’s still over here thinking about the movie like: Before name-dropping Affleck’s film, the actor-director ranted about other movies with budgets in the hundreds of millions of dollars.“I look at them and scratch my head. I’m really baffled by it,” Gibson said. “I think there’s a lot of waste, but maybe if I did one of those things with the green screens I’d find out different. I don’t know. Maybe they do cost that much. I don’t know. It seems to me that you could do it for less.” Gibson’s new film, “Hacksaw Ridge,” was applauded by critics at the film festival ― literally ― earning itself a 10-minute standing ovation. But the director was perhaps more proud of his budgeting skills for the project, which was shot in Australia. “The exchange rate for the U.S. dollar was good at the time, and I think we locked in at about 72 cents on the dollar and took a $27 million budget and turned it into a $40 million budget,” the director said. Impressive, indeed. Maybe Gibson can help us with our monthly finances? "

The previous fall, his personal foundation had given $25,000 to a pro-Bondi PAC. But by hosting her fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago and bringing in some of his own star power, Trump provided Bondi’s campaign with a nice financial boost.Since he began his run for the White House, Trump has repeatedly claimed that Bondi is merely someone he has supported politically. But his fundraising efforts for her were extensive and varied: In addition to the $25,000 donation from his foundation and the star-studded Mar-a-Lago event, Trump and his daughter Ivanka each gave $500 to Bondi’s campaign in the fall of 2013. The following spring, Ivanka and her father donated another $125,000 to the Republican Party of Florida ― Bondi’s single biggest source of campaign funds.All this money created the appearance that Donald Trump was thanking Bondi for halting any further investigation into his failed seminar programs. Trump’s efforts to boost her politically came during and after a period when Bondi was under pressure to pursue allegations that those seminars were defrauding consumers.The use of Mar-a-Lago alone was a donation of some value. Space at the resort is expensive to rent, and Trump has charged his own presidential campaign roughly $140,000 per event for use of the mansion.In contrast, the Republican Party of Florida paid only $4,855.65 for the Bondi fundraiser, cutting a check on March 25, 2014. It was a “small event on the lawn ... featuring snacks and refreshments, attended by about 50 people,” a Bondi campaign staffer told The Huffington Post.Trump’s courtship of Bondi, including the Mar-a-Lago event, could complicate a line of attack his campaign is currently making against Hillary Clinton. Trump and his surrogates have attacked Clinton’s family foundation for accepting donations from governments and individuals with business before the State Department during her tenure there. They have suggested that, in turn, those donors were given special access to then-Secretary of State Clinton and her staff.Clinton and her aides have denied that charge and responded by arguing that Trump has used his money to influence politicians ― an accusation that he hasn’t always denied. “I’ve got to give [campaign contributions] to them, because when I want something, I get it,” he said in January. “When I call, they kiss my ass. It’s true. They kiss my ass. It’s true.”Allegations of fraud by Trump University and its predecessor Trump Institute began before Bondi took office in 2011. The previous Florida attorney general, Bill McCollum, had received numerous complaints from attendees of Trump’s real estate programs. According to those attendees, Trump had promised classes and mentoring that never materialized, and when customers complained, the organization refused to give refunds.One attendee, Sheila Roberts, contacted McCollum’s office in 2009 when she did not receive a refund of almost $2,000. Roberts told The Huffington Post that she felt the office handled her complaint appropriately.“I did get my money back, so no problem there,” she said. Roberts added that she is voting for Trump.But for many unhappy customers of the real estate seminars, refunds were few and far between.Carol Minto of Connecticut said the Trump Institute, which is based in Florida, refused to honor her refund. She reported the matter to the attorneys general of both Florida and Connecticut, but only heard back from the latter, who helped her get her money back.“Trump holds himself out to be this great person in real estate, and I wanted to learn how I could buy and sell properties just like him,” Minto told HuffPost. “And he didn’t even turn up. He just had a picture of himself [at the seminar].”When Bondi was elected attorney general, the broader question of what to do about all the Trump Institute complaints ― and whether Florida could or should join pending lawsuits ― had yet to be resolved. As late as Sept. 14, 2013, Bondi’s spokesman said that the office was reviewing the allegations “to see if they have any relevance in Florida.” But around that time, Bondi personally solicited Trump for a political donation. On Sept. 17, the real estate mogul’s charitable foundation wrote the $25,000 check to the Bondi-backing PAC named And Justice For All. (The check proved to be a violation of Internal Revenue Service rules for tax-exempt nonprofits. Trump recently paid a $2,500 penalty.) Florida resident Kenneth Lafrate claims that the Trump Institute scammed him out of roughly $7,000, most of which paid for a mentoring program. He said he spoke to a mentor online “for a number of months,” until the mentor abruptly stopped answering messages. Lafrate contacted the Florida attorney general’s office as early as 2008 but said he did not receive a response. When he later learned of Trump’s connection to Bondi through news reports, he stopped expecting to get an answer.“She’s not going to do anything because she’s kind of in with [Trump],” he told HuffPost.Lafrate said he also notified the office of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who filed a consumer fraud suit against Trump in 2013, and received “a nice letter saying that they were aggressively pursuing this.”Connecticut resident Mitzie Andrade reached out to the Florida attorney general’s office under McCollum as well, seeking a refund on the more than $3,000 she had paid for Trump’s seminar programs. “I got everything back. I was lucky, I guess,” Andrade said, but she added, “It is not a real seminar, it is a scam. It is a downright scam.”Trump has pushed back against criticism of his seminar programs, in part by offering up positive reviews by carefully vetted attendees. To this day, the first entry on the “Issues” page of Trump’s presidential campaign website is a video of people insisting that Trump University was not a scam. It’s worth noting, however, that none of these positive reviewers are descibed as working in the real estate business that Trump promised to teach them all about. Despite taking office after Trump University had largely been disbanded, Bondi did some follow-up with the alleged victims. On Oct. 10, 2013, for instance, a representative for her office followed up with Harold Stevens. The representative told Stevens the office was “concerned with all potentially unfair and deceptive trade practices.” But there is little or no evidence that Bondi’s office followed up on scores of individual complaints against Trump’s seminars made before she became attorney general or developed a larger legal response to the widespread dissatisfaction with Trump’s education business.In September 2013, three days before Trump’s foundation donated to the pro-Bondi PAC, the Orlando Sentinel reported that her office was considering joining the New York lawsuit against Trump University. But Bondi ultimately did not.At the time, the Florida attorney general’s office said there was no need to pursue any Florida litigation or to join another state’s effort. Bondi’s office assured Floridians that “the New York litigation would provide relief to aggrieved consumers nationwide.”Florida isn’t the only state where campaign donations appeared to be linked to investigations of Trump that went nowhere. In 2013, the businessman gave $35,000 to then-Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, who had dropped his probe into Trump University a few years earlier. (In an email to HuffPost, a spokesperson for Abbott, who is now Texas’ governor, noted that although the state did not bring a suit against Trump U, the company closed its Texas operations after an investigation by the deputy attorney general.)A former employee of Trump University, who requested anonymity because he has a nondisclosure agreement, said that politics always played a role in how Trump University did business.“All we had to do is stroke a check to the committee to re-elect [the state attorney general],” the individual said. “And the problems went away.” S.V.

The previous fall, his personal foundation had given $25,000 to a pro-Bondi PAC. But by hosting her fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago and bringing in some of his own star power, Trump provided Bondi’s campaign with a nice financial boost.Since he began his run for the White House, Trump has repeatedly claimed that Bondi is merely someone he has supported politically. But his fundraising efforts for her were extensive and varied: In addition to the $25,000 donation from his foundation and the star-studded Mar-a-Lago event, Trump and his daughter Ivanka each gave $500 to Bondi’s campaign in the fall of 2013. The following spring, Ivanka and her father donated another $125,000 to the Republican Party of Florida ― Bondi’s single biggest source of campaign funds.All this money created the appearance that Donald Trump was thanking Bondi for halting any further investigation into his failed seminar programs.

Police said late on Tuesday morning they had arrested all nine and the airline was preparing to resume flights.British Airways said it was taking longer than normal to process customers at a number of airports around the world, including London’s Heathrow and Gatwick, and urged passengers to check in online before they reached the airport.The airline, owned by International Consolidated Airlines Group, apologized to customers.“Really unhappy with @British_Airways “The system is down” & can’t check in!,” one passenger, Shail, said on Twitter.Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada said the delays - the second problem with the service this year - could damage the airline’s reputation after passengers took to social media to complain about delays in San Francisco, Washington D.C. and Atlanta on Monday night.British Airways has been rolling out a new check-in system since last year and a spokeswoman said the check-in delays were teething problems that affected many airports.Shares in BA’s owner rose 1.5 percent, apparently unaffected by its airline’s computer troubles.At City Airport, the protesters earlier erected two large posters with the slogans “Black Lives Matter” and “Climate Crisis is a Racist Crisis.”The British arm of the group, which started in the United States as a reaction to fatal shootings of black people by police, said it wanted to highlight Britain’s environmental impact on the lives of black people locally and globally. Members blocked a main road to London’s Heathrow Airport in August.“Black people are the first to die, not the first to fly, in this racist climate crisis,” the group said in a statement.“When black people in Britain are 28 percent more likely to be exposed to air pollution than their white counterparts, we know that environmental inequality is a racist crisis.”The campaign group said City airport was designed for the wealthy while those who lived near the site struggled on low salaries.Police said the protesters were now in police custody after being arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass, being unlawfully airside and breaching London City Airport bylaws.(Additional reporting by Sarah Young and Georgina Prodhan; Editing by Andrew Heavens and Raissa Kasolowsky)"

She and her grandfather later hurry out of the room before another person holding a crowbar enters.Patel’s mother later told ONE News that her daughter approached the intruder thinking the person was her father.“She held one of the guy’s legs because she was thinking it’s her dad. And then he just looked at her and she got scared again because he was hitting ... Jordan,” Nashrin Patel told the network.The suspects allegedly stole cell phones, broke a glass cabinet, and injured an employee in the incident before leaving.“It was amazing. She’s fine. We’re all fine,” said Sarah’s father, Suhail Patel. “Everyone is getting back to normal now.

Further details were not immediately available.A first couple, aged 34 and 29, were arrested on a motorway on Tuesday in southern France also in connection with the incident on Saturday and remain in custody.There was no detonating device present in the car, found on a Seine riverside stretch called the Quai de Montebello, yards from Notre Dame, one of Paris’s most popular attractions. Documents with writing in Arabic were also found in the car.The car’s owner is on an intelligence services watchlist of people suspected of religious radicalization, police and judicial officials said on Wednesday. The owner was taken into custody but later released. The Peugeot 607, which had no registration plates, contained seven gas cylinders, one of them empty on the front passenger seat, two police officials said.It was found with its hazard lights flashing, as if to attract attention, they said.There was no detonating device present in the car.More than 200 people have been killed in terror attacks over the past year-and-a-half in France.France remains on maximum alert after calls by the Islamic State group for followers to attack the country, which is bombing the militant group’s bases in Iraq and Syria.Florence Berthout, mayor of Paris’s Fifth Arrondissement (District), said on Wednesday the incident highlighted the need to beef up security and put more police on patrol in one of the world’s most visited cities.She said the vehicle was left in a zone where parking is strictly prohibited and that it had remained there for around two hours before it came to the attention of police.“Police and army staffing must be stepped up,” she told news TV channel BFM.Thousands of extra police and soldiers have been deployed to patrol sensitive sites across France since 130 people were killed by Islamist gunmen and suicide bombers in multiple attacks on Paris last Nov 13.A state of emergency declared at that time is still in place and gives police extra search and arrest powers but debate still rages over security levels, following a further attack on July 14 in which a man mowed into crowds in the city of Nice, killing 86."

Rebels rapidly captured the town of Halfaya. Pro-Assad forces have hit back with heavy air strikes.Many people had fled from the fighting towards Hama city and neighbouring villages, as well as north into Idlib province, the U.N. said.There were originally about 4,500 families in the town of Halfaya, of which 2,800 remain trapped by the fighting while the rest managed to flee, the U.N. report said.Another 4,500 families were displaced from Taybat al Imam, out of 9,500 in that town, and 5,000 families were uprooted from the army stronghold of Soran, about half the population there.Many of the displaced people were sleeping outdoors, but four mosques in Hama city and 12 schools in rural areas were temporarily housing people, the U.N. said.The Red Crescent had provided aid to about 7,000 families in Hama, roughly 35,000 people, and the United Nations sent a convoy of 12 trucks to Hama on Sept. 4 with aid for another 15,000 people.

But only one of the incidents was what the pilot determined was unsafe,” said another official, who was not authorized to speak publicly.Officials were talking with the pilot and reviewing the incident to determine whether it would be included in an annual meeting of U.S. and Russian officials about more serious intercepts, the official added.The Russian defense ministry said it had sent Su-27s on Wednesday to intercept a U.S. aircraft approaching its border over the Black Sea because the American planes had turned off their transponders, which are needed for identification.There have been a number of similar incidents involving Russia and the United States this year. In April, two Russian warplanes flew simulated attack passes near a U.S. guided missile destroyer in the Baltic Sea.The events are reminiscent of the Cold War, when a series of close calls led to a bilateral agreement aimed at avoiding dangerous interactions at sea that was signed in 1972.In July, NATO leaders agreed to deploy military forces to the Baltic states and eastern Poland for the first time and increase air and sea patrols to reassure allies who were once part of the Soviet bloc, following Russia’s seizure of Crimea from Ukraine.The 28-nation Western defense alliance decided to move four battalions totaling 3,000 to 4,000 troops into northeastern Europe on a rotating basis to display its readiness to defend eastern members against Russia.(Additional reporting by Lidia Kelly in Moscow.; Editing by G Crosse and Alistair Bell)"

Despite the dilemma (which doesn’t seem half-bad considering there are two shows created by and featuring people of color on at the same time),  TV viewers rejoiced, critics sang their praises and Twitter users transformed the show’s titles into celebratory, trending hashtags. It may have seemed impossible to watch both, but even your favorite stars found a way to work it out.Anticipation around the respective releases has been building ever since the trailers dropped earlier this year. Previews gave a tantalizing peek into what seemed to be nuanced and powerful portrayals of black life and both DuVernay and Glover delivered on that promise. DuVernay is the real queen behind “Queen Sugar.” As a writer and director who is best known for 2014’s “Selma,” DuVernay makes her first foray into TV by teaming up with Oprah Winfrey to debut the series on OWN. Together, DuVernay and Winfrey crafted a series that chronicles one black southern family’s experience with love, death, infidelity, conflict and redemption. The show, which includes a brilliant cast of black stars, explores these themes with powerful writing and beautiful imagery. The stirring first episode earned heavy praise online: Glover’s “Atlanta” was also highly applauded. Glover, who co-wrote and co-directed the series and has starred on other shows like “Community” and “Girls,” has also made a name for himself as a rapper under the alias Childish Gambino. With “Atlanta,” those two worlds seemingly collide as Glover, who is featured as the show’s the main character, navigates through a fictional series that follows one young man’s journey after he drops out of Ivy League and tries to make a living by spearheading his cousin’s budding rap career. The show, which is crafted entirely by black writers, is quirky, hilarious and real much like Glover himself. Plus, it gives a powerful glimpse into societal issues in the south and highlights the hustle African Americans are all too familiar with. Together, DuVernay and Glover are showing the world that black creators are beyond capable of achieving success through film and television. They prove to everyone that diversity in film and TV should be celebrated and that when it comes to telling the black narrative, we should praise those who know how to tell it best. With these two new shows added to our Fall TV lineup and the return of all things Shonda Rhimes and other black-led shows like “black-ish,” we’re okay with the end of summer nearing. Bring it on. "

For most of the past decade, North Dakota has been the economic envy of every state in America posting the lowest jobless rate, the highest increase in personal income, and the fastest-growing populationall thanks to a historic oil boom. Now with crude prices at 13-year North Dakotas economy is shrinking, employment is falling fast, and the state is imposing the deepest spending cuts in its history.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57cb7a2a170000f92dc776d9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― At a private meeting of conservatives in Cleveland this summer, Donald Trump’s senior economic adviser, Stephen Moore, said the candidate planned to pay for his costly proposals by eliminating the departments of Commerce, Energy and Education; lifting all restrictions on mining, drilling and fracking; ending Temporary Assistance for Needy Families programs, and offering rust-belt factory workers new jobs on oil rigs and steel mills. Speaking at the private summer meeting of the Council for National Policy (CNP), a secretive group of powerful conservatives, Moore, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, also described how Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions had “infiltrated” Trump’s campaign operation, and how Moore and other supply-side economists were working hard to get Trump to be more supportive of free trade.An audio recording of Moore’s question-and-answer session with CNP vice president Bill Walton was posted online a few weeks after the July 14 conference, but has not been reported on until now. Moore’s description of how a Trump administration would pay for its programs is not something that Trump himself talks about much on the stump. A consummate showman, Trump prefers to play to his crowds. In front of blue-collar audiences, he touts his plans for trade protectionism and building a wall with Mexico. For older voters, Trump promises not to make any changes to Social Security or Medicare benefits. This “something for everyone” message is a key part of Trump’s popular appeal to voters, and it helps to set him apart from hardcore anti-government conservatives like Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas), whose most memorable campaign pledge was to abolish the Internal Revenue Service.On top of Trump’s plans to maintain costly programs like Social Security, he’s also proposed a massive tax cut and pledged to balance the federal budget within seven years. Yet anyone who looks closely at Trump’s proposals comes away with the same question: How would a Trump administration pay for all this? For starters, Moore said, major cabinet-level agencies should be eliminated. Walton asked him specifically about eliminating the departments of Commerce, Education and Energy. Together, these agencies employ an estimated 150,000 people, and they oversee things ranging from nuclear security to federal student loans to the U.S. patent system. “I’m going to press as hard as possible to [eliminate the agencies],” Moore said. “We’re putting a budget together right now that is going to not only pay for the tax cut, but balance the budget in six or seven years. And to do that, you’ve got to make very significant cuts in those kinds of programs.“I mean, my God, why do we need an Energy Department?” Moore asked, semi-exasperated. “All the Energy Department has done in the last 25 years is make energy prices more expensive!” In an interview Friday, Moore said he has spoken to Trump about eliminating the Energy Department. “I don’t know if he’d shut it down, but there’s a good chance the energy subsidies are going to be on the chopping block. I haven’t talked to him about the Education Department, so I was speaking for myself. As for Commerce, I call it the department of corporate welfare, and I know Trump has been specific about ending the crony corporate welfare systems.”A spokeswoman for Trump said Moore “is one of many different outside advisors to the campaign, but is speaking on his own behalf.”A few days after his speech to the Council for National Policy, Moore talked to Fox News about how Trump might balance the budget as president. Watch the video, below. So far, Trump has given only one speech on energy policy, back in May. But as Moore explained in the Council for National Policy meeting, fossil fuels will be a major piece of Trump’s economic plan, both in terms of generating revenue and in terms of putting unemployed workers back to work.  “If we promote American energy and use our coal, and our oil, and our natural gas and nuclear power, not only can the United States be energy-independent in five or six years, we can be the dominant energy power in the world,” Moore said at the meeting.“You’re talking about 6 to 8 million more jobs. And these are trucking jobs, construction, engineering, pipe-fitting jobs, welding jobs. I think Trump has a great chance to go to these industrial unions and tell them, ‘I’ll put your members to work and create new jobs, unlike these lunatics over here, like Tom Steyer and Hillary Clinton, who want to put you out of business.’ So that’s a big big part of the agenda.” Moore’s lust for oil and coal is well known in conservative circles, and his most recent book, Fueling Freedom: Exposing the Mad War on Energy, makes it pretty clear where he stands. When Moore signed on to advise the Trump campaign, he was working as a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank that also helped Trump come up with his infamous list of potential Supreme Court nominees. Moore’s first task for Trump was to devise the candidate’s energy policy ahead of a speech Trump gave in North Dakota on May 26. Thanks to Moore, unlimited drilling, fracking and mining has become one of the four pillars of Trump’s “Economic Vision.” At the Council for National Policy meeting, Moore reiterated that Trump will lift any and all restrictions on fossil fuel production. The millions of jobs this will create, he said, can be filled by the same disaffected blue collar workers who form the base of Trump’s electoral support. Moore’s plan is almost genius, except for the fact that it relies entirely on the presumption that global energy prices will be high enough to make all this drilling and mining worthwhile for the energy companies. Currently, oil and gas prices are so low that many of North Dakota’s famed natural gas wells can’t even afford to operate, leaving thousands of rig workers without jobs. Despite what Trump says at his rallies about looking out for the downtrodden, being unemployed or poor in Trump’s America would likely be even more difficult than it is today, thanks to draconian public assistance reforms and cuts in social services. “We’re going to borrow a really good idea from John Kasich,” Moore said, referring to transforming the federal social safety net into a system of block grants for individual states. “All these programs, job training, health care, medical services, da da da, we’ll just pass all that stuff back to the states.”Long a favorite among conservative deficit hawks, block grant programs have been shown in recent studies to be very vulnerable to budget cuts at the state level, which ultimately means fewer services for needy families.“We’re also going to do some welfare reform,” Moore continued. “We’ve built an incredible entitlement state, and this kind of victimization, and that’s got to end. We’re going to go after those programs. “All you have to do is require employable adults who don’t have disabilities to work for their benefits, and you’re going to see big changes in the welfare system,” Moore said. What he failed to mention was that the majority of people receiving federal anti-poverty benefits are already working, so his plan wouldn’t apply to them. Moore’s message of tough love is also a far cry from the sympathetic take on poverty that Trump adopted a month later, as he wooed African-American voters in August. “No group in America has been more harmed by Hillary Clinton’s policies than African Americans,” Trump said at an August rally, before citing bogus statistics about race, poverty and crime. His policies, Trump said, were aimed at helping “unemployed African-American youth in cities like Detroit who have become refugees in their own country.”  On Saturday, Trump visited a predominantly black congregation in Detroit, where he told parishioners he would remedy “injustice in any form,” and he called for a “civil rights agenda for our time.” Watch Trump’s speech at Great Faith Ministries International in Detroit, below. If you’re starting to think that maybe Trump actually worries about the plight of the poor, think again. It is business and industry leaders, not unemployed youth, who are the intended beneficiaries of a Trump economy.According to Moore, several of Trump’s economic proposals came out of monthly meetings he held with the Trump Leadership Council, which Moore described as “25 or 30 major industry leaders, the men and women who run the great companies in America.”“These are energy companies, transportation companies, telecommunications and tech companies. We meet about once a month with Donald Trump, and he always sits there and each person has about two or three minutes to talk.”Moore continued: “What shocked me about these meetings was listening to these business leaders, and they all said the biggest thing is the regulatory state, and it’s just strangling their businesses in every single arena. So the first thing we’re going to do about this is have a regulatory freeze. The day he enters office we’re just going to put a halt on any new regulations.”“Number two, and you’re gonna love this,” Moore said, “we are putting together a list, and we need your help on this. If you guys can get us the information, we want to make a list of about 50 to 100 executive orders that Obama has passed that we can repeal on the first day [Trump is] in office. As many of them as we can. With a strike of the pen. That’s going to be an injection of performance-enhancing drugs into the economy.”Three weeks later, when Trump debuted his economic plan in Detroit, however, there was no mention of the Council for National Policy members who’d been invited to propose executive orders for repeal. Instead, Trump said, “I will also immediately cancel all illegal and overreaching executive orders.” On Friday, Moore admitted that the Trump campaign is “still working on a budget plan, frankly. I’ve made suggestions, but we’re still figuring out how to pay for things and still balance the budget.”He also hinted that voters may not get to see much more of Trump’s economic or budget plans before Election Day. “I don’t think it would be wise in a presidential campaign to talk too much about what you’re going to cut, and get stuck in the weeds,” Moore said. “It’s a trap, and you make more enemies than you can attract among voters.”Moore said he has been working on tax policy and energy with Trump. “I’ve made suggestions about what to cut and some program eliminations, and so we’ll see.“Trump’s got some specific policies, but he doesn’t have a huge number of them,” Moore said, before citing two examples of Trump proposals: “Making Europe pay more for NATO, and allowing the government to negotiate prescription drug prices for Medicare.”Then again, Moore said, “Clinton was elected in ‘92 on a three-word slogan, ‘Putting People First.’” Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.
