0,QUEER VOICES,50-State Food Tour For Equality Shines A Light On Some Of Its Heroes,Noah Michelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/blgt-usa-food-tour_us_56015e56e4b0fde8b0cfb46e,WE,2015-09-22,"<em>Clockwise from top left: Denver, Seattle, </em><em>Portland, </em><em>Salt Lake City</em>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56015ed41c00007300757981.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Note: The following is the tenth post in a series of posts from GET//OUT regarding BLgT USA - the first 50-state food tour for equality. We'll be sharing updates, photos and more as the BLgT team travels across the country to get people out locally for LGBT equality.When we set out this summer to connect people across the country in support of LGBT equality through a twist on the classic BLT sandwich, we really had no idea what we were getting into. A 50 state, 55 city food tour in 4 months? We didn’t know how challenging AND rewarding it was going to be to build relationships with local restaurants nationwide. Our partnership process was as much art, as it was science. We weren’t sure who exactly we should be looking for, how and where to find the right partners, and what would seal the deal in the shortest amount of time. Now, we get it. We understand the power of partnering with local, visionary food heroes, who are as crazy as we are.Who are these heroes? And what is it about this rare breed that makes them so great? These people have a particular allure, because of their community street cred, a team to back them up, and passion for a better world. Most of the partners featured below are part of a bigger restaurant group or small local chain. They have a strong social media following of loyalists. They understand the importance of engaging people online. People trust them and love them, because they visibly support their communities. They are the bedrocks making things happen with a smile...and it makes you come back for more. For today and tomorrow’s posts, we’re diving deep on BLgT USA standouts of the past few weeks. WE <3 YOU, BOOS. BLgT USA Local Food Heroes: Part IAugust 9, 2015 // Denver, CO - Masterpiece Deli. BLgTs for Denver The GLBT Center of Colorado, supporting LGBTQ programs in Denver and education services. Renowned Chef Justin Brunson and partner Stephen Allee have two locations, and are building out the new Masterpiece Kitchen. “We're getting married next summer. We're trying to figure out how Olive is going to carry our rings down the aisle.” -Harbadna, BLgT USA SupporterAugust 15, 2015 // Salt Lake City, UT - Even Stevens Sandwiches. BLgTs for Equality Utah, working on policy and programming for LGBT individuals in Utah -- Mormon gays are getting it done. Even Stevens is a local Salt Lake chain with a one-for-one model. For every sandwich you buy, they donate one to someone in need through local partners. BIg expansion plans in the works. Watch these epic movers and shakers. They are crushing it in every way. “We've said it before, and we'll say it again, food connects everyone. People who farm, people who cook, people who eat, and of course, people who love.” -Jamie Coates, Creative Director, Even Stevens Sandwiches August 22, 2015 // Seattle, WA - Tippe and Drague.BLgTs for the Rainbow Center of Tacoma, supporting education, resources, and safe spaces for LGBTQ people and allies in Washington state. Perfect hidden back patio for summer nights. “Seattle is the birthplace of the It Gets Better Project. It started out in our alternative newspaper, The Stranger, with Dan Savage. I grew up with my mother incarcerating my brother for being gay when he was 14. She put him in jail because the law allowed you to do that back then. It was the 60s in the Seattle. If your children were ‘incorrigible’ you could incarcerate them. He was a year older than me. He told me that he was a queer. Which sounded okay to me. Whoever you love and care about, is whoever you love and care about. I didn’t know I was gay at the time. I grew up watching persecution. As I’ve gotten older, I believe that you need to communicate to a younger person that it does get better. It’s the shit of life to be treated like trash because you’re gay. There’s going to be a better day. All of us recovered. There were five kids in my family. Three of us were gay. All five of us banded together to save ourselves. And it got better.“ -Leslie, BLgT USA SupporterAugust 26, 2015 // Portland, OR - Bunk Sandwiches. BLgTs for Basic Rights Oregon, working on equal rights for all Oregon citizens. Friends Tommy Habetz, Nick Wood, and Matt Brown have seven sandwich locations, which includes a food truck and a space that moonlights as a indie rock venue. Epic. “The first thing I did when I moved to Portland was join a rugby team. Rugby is family. Here in Portland, everyone can be comfortable and be exactly who they are. Portlanders just live. It’s really thrown off my gaydar, though. [In between bites] This is delicious. Did I mention that the team loves Bunk Sandwiches? So good.” -Steph, BLgT USA SupporterToday, September 22nd, is the official last day of summer. Our adventure began Memorial Day weekend, 123 days ago on May 23nd in Provincetown, MA.

Together, these bacteria make up what researchers call the human microbiome.Previous studies have found that at least three sources contribute to the airborne cloud of bacteria surrounding us: dust, emissions from clothing and emissions from the person, the researchers wrote in their study, published today (Sept. 22) in the journal PeerJ.In the new study, researchers asked participants to sit alone in a sanitized chamber filled with filtered air. To reduce the number of particles coming from clothing, each participant was given an identical new, clean outfit. Each participant sat in a plastic rolling chair that had been disinfected, and was given a sterilized laptop to use to communicate with the scientists outside the chamber (they were also allowed to use the laptop for entertainment purposes), according to the researchers.Any particles that came off the participants were filtered out of the chamber, collected and genetically sequenced. The researchers used the sequences to identify the bacteria.In one experiment, the researchers compared the air in the chamber to that of a neighboring, unoccupied chamber. Three people participated in this experiment, and each sat in the chamber for a 4-hour session and then a 2-hour session, with a break in between.After 2 hours, the researchers found they were able to determine whether a person was present in the chamber based on looking only at the bacteria from the air samples.But the researchers noticed that the combinations of bacteria surrounding each person could be easily distinguished from one another, so they set up a second experiment to see how well they could identify individuals using their unique bacterial cloud.In the second experiment, eight new people were asked to sit in the chamber for two 90-minute periods.""We expected that we would be able to detect the human microbiome in the air around a person, but we were surprised to find that we could identify most of the occupants just by sampling their microbial cloud,"" said Meadow, who was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oregon at the time of the study. The researchers found that the main types of bacteria in people's ""clouds"" were human-associated bacteria, including Streptococcus, which is commonly found in the mouth; and Propionibacterium and Corynebacterium, which are commonly found on the skin. For female participants, the researchers also noted the presence of common vaginal bacteria.Although the results of the study suggest that the findings could be used in forensics, the researchers cautioned that further research is required because the patterns they found ""are likely to be more nuanced in a crowd of occupants, in a larger indoor space or in the presence of resuspended dust,"" the researchers wrote.And that doesn't even factor in all the microbes left behind by our nonhuman companions.Follow Live Science @livescience, Facebook & Google+.

4,HEALTHY LIVING,The Jury's Still Out On E-Cigarettes As A Way To Quit Smoking,"Lisa Rapaport, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-jurys-still-out-on-e-cigarettes-as-a-way-to-quit-smoking_us_56017027e4b0fde8b0cfc8f6,There are still too many unknowns.,2015-09-22,Some youth have their first taste of nicotine via e-cigarettes.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55b7a5df1400002e002e110a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"By Lisa Rapaport(Reuters Health) - There isn’t enough evidence yet to say whether e-cigarettes are safe or effective for helping people quit smoking, new U.S. guidelines on tobacco cessation conclude.The conclusion, issued by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) today as a part of updated recommendations on smoking cessation, adds to an emerging consensus in the medical community that e-cigarettes come with too many unknowns for them to be recommended to current smokers looking to kick the habit.“There is not enough evidence to evaluate the effectiveness, safety or benefits and harms of using e-cigarettes to help people quit smoking,” said Dr. Francisco Garcia, a task force member and researcher at the University of Arizona.Battery-powered e-cigarettes typically feature a glowing tip and a heating element that turns liquid nicotine and other compounds into a cloud of vapor that users inhale.While tobacco control advocates fear that e-cigarettes may give rise to a new generation of nicotine addicts who eventually transition to conventional cigarettes, some small studies have suggested the devices might benefit the health of people who already smoke.An international analysis of published research by the Cochrane Review in December concluded the devices could help smokers quit but said much of the existing research on e-cigarettes was thin.The USPSTF, a government-backed independent organization that reviews medical evidence, last updated its tobacco cessation guidelines in 2009. Then, as now, the task force found too little evidence to weigh in for or against e-cigarettes as a cessation aid. These guidelines are widely used to determine whether insurance will pay for screenings and treatments and are widely followed by primary care physicians.“The task force recommends that clinicians direct patients who smoke tobacco to other cessation interventions with established effectiveness and safety,” Garcia said by email. “Many studies show that combinations of behavioral interventions or pharmacotherapies can help the most.”Carrie Patnode, lead author of the research review USPSTF used as the basis for its updated guidelines, said that to date, just two large trials assessing e-cigarettes for smoking cessation met the gold standard for medical research, i.e., randomly assigning some patients to receive the treatment and others to receive a placebo or alternatives.One of the two trials involved about 650 smokers and found no significant difference in smoking cessation after six months for e-cigarettes containing liquid nicotine, e-cigarettes without nicotine, or nicotine patches.The second trial followed 300 smokers for one year and found e-cigarettes containing nicotine to be slightly better than the devices without nicotine cartridges, with cessation rates of 11 percent and 4 percent, respectively.Both of these trials were conducted using older models of e-cigarettes, one of which is no longer available, and both studies had large numbers of participants drop out before the end.The review, along with the task force recommendations, was published today in the Annals of Internal Medicine.One challenge that faces doctors and scientists who assess e-cigarettes is the sheer variety of options, all of which may contain different amounts of nicotine, chemicals and additives that might impact the safety and effectiveness of the devices as cessation aids.“There is a large variation in the devices and cartridge fluids publicly available and new products are rapidly entering the market,” Patnode, a research associate at Kaiser Permanente’s Center for Health Research in Portland, Oregon, said by email. “It is clear that more data on both the benefits and harms of these products – from well-designed trials – is needed.”SOURCE: http://bit.ly/1i46lF7 Annals of Internal Medicine, online September 21, 2015.Also on HuffPost: "

7,POLITICS,Health Chief Expects Tough Obamacare Enrollment Season This Year,Jeffrey Young,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sylvia-burwell-obamacare-enrollment_us_56015379e4b08820d91a0fc6,Many of the hardest-to-reach people still need help.,2015-09-22,"Sylvia Mathews Burwell, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, speaks during a press conference at the Department of Justice on June 18, 2015, in Washington, D.C.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56016b322000002500242c93.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The first two years of Obamacare enrollment brought health coverage to millions of people, overcoming political obstruction and a disastrous initial rollout of the sign-up system in the process. But the road could be even rougher ahead, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said Tuesday. By the end of this year, President Barack Obama's administration expects that a little more than 9 million people will be enrolled into health insurance policies obtained via the exchange marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act. But the administration estimates another 10.5 million uninsured people are eligible -- and they're the most elusive customers in the market.""As we reduce the rate of the uninsured, there are fewer potential marketplace customers out there,"" Burwell said during a speech at Howard University Hospital in Washington. ""Overall, the open enrollment is going to be tougher than last year.""Nearly half of the remaining uninsured are between the ages of 18 and 34, the most coveted demographic for health insurers because of their relatively low medical costs -- but among the most difficult to enroll for the same reason, because the value of health coverage may be less apparent to consumers who need little medical care.While 4 in 10 of the people who could sign up for health insurance exchange plans now earn low enough incomes to qualify for generous subsidies that significantly bring down the cost, awareness of these tax credits is low among the uninsured. Enrolling these people can also be a challenge even if they know about financial assistance, because they may find even small premiums unaffordable. The price of health insurance also remains out of reach for some whose incomes make them eligible for only modest tax credits or none at all.Burwell highlighted Obamacare's progress to date, citing a new departmental report finding that 15.3 million previously uninsured adults gained coverage between October 2013 -- when the first enrollment period began -- and this month, either from the exchanges or from Medicaid in states that expanded eligibility for that program under the Affordable Care Act. A separate provision allowing young adults to remain covered by their parents' insurance until age 26 accounted for an additional 2.3 million people who have health coverage they wouldn't have absent Obamacare, HHS reported. That puts the total at 17.6 million, up from 16 million as of March, according to the department's analysis.These findings are consistent with numerous other studies and surveys. The U.S. Census Bureau announced last week that 9 million people had gained coverage through the end of 2014, and Gallup polls have shown steep declines in the uninsured rate through the first half of 2015.Through the first half of this year, 9.9 million people were enrolled into health plans from the exchange marketplaces, down from 11.7 million in February. The decline came as some consumers gave up that insurance, whether because they got coverage from another source, they could not afford their premiums or for other reasons. HHS expects 9.1 million people will still have this coverage by year-end, which is in line with the department's own goals prior to the last open enrollment period. Nevertheless, the pace of new sign-ups slowed during the first two years of Obamacare enrollment, and remains far behind what the Congressional Budget Office projects. The CBO expected 11 million people to have exchange plans this year, and for that number to more than double next year -- an outcome that seems far-fetched at current enrollment levels, especially given Burwell's assessment of the current challenges.In addition, health insurance companies in some cases will implement large price increases that could dissuade consumers, though prices for the health insurance polices used to set subsidy levels appear more stable, suggesting that affordable options will remain available, at least in many markets. Enrollment also could be bolstered because the tax penalty for not complying with the Affordable Care Act's ""individual mandate"" to get coverage will be at least $325 per adult and $162.50 per child, an increase from this year, for people who don't qualify for an exemption.To maximize enrollments during the upcoming sign-up round, Burwell said, HHS will concentrate its efforts on five geographic areas with large numbers of possible enrollees: Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Miami and northern New Jersey. These locations have the highest concentrations of uninsured but eligible people of anywhere in the nation. In addition, these areas have high concentrations of African-American and Hispanic residents -- and the uninsured rates remain higher in those communities than the national average, despite gains in recent years.To cater to the remaining uninsured, HHS plans to intensify its public education about the tax credit subsidies available for private insurance on the exchanges, which 84 percent of current enrollees receive, Burwell said. The department will also unveil improvements to HealthCare.gov, the online portal to the federally run exchanges, such as better information about which medical providers and prescription drugs are covered by health insurance plans. And HHS will promote its call center and in-person assistance, which surveys have shown are especially valued by people of color.HHS has not yet released its projections for how many more people will sign up on the exchanges during the open enrollment period for 2016 health coverage, which runs from Nov. 1 through Jan. 31. The federal government operates the health insurance exchanges, in whole or in part, in 37 states. Thirteen states and the District of Columbia run their own exchanges.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story inaccurately described the income levels of those who remain uninsured but qualify for enrollment in health plans through the exchanges.

""The one thing the Sunday shows still do that stands out is that we are the one place that you have long, in-depth, well-researched, probing interviews,"" Wallace, the host of “Fox News Sunday,” said in an interview with The Huffington Post. As the show celebrated its 1,000th episode over the weekend, Wallace doubled down on his commitment to in-depth reporting, saying his program stands out from other Sunday political programs like NBC's “Meet The Press” and CBS's “Face The Nation” -- that have begun airing shorter interviews and more segments. To that point, Wallace has declined to allow Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to phone in to the program. ""Prior to this cycle, I’d never seen a presidential candidate doing a phone interview and we’re not going to do it on ‘Fox News Sunday’,” Wallace said, adding that ""a phoner debases the currency.” Trump did, however, call in to three other Sunday programs this week -- NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" ABC's ""This Week"" and CNN's ""State of the Union."" Networks typically only allow reporters and other guests to call in by phone during breaking news situations, but appear to have made multiple exceptions to accommodate Trump.Wallace said in-depth programs like his, which can accommodate longer interviews, are important during election seasons to get politicians to answer tough questions.""All of these candidates are so skilled with their talking points and their scripts, and you have to go at them to get them off the script, and think and reacting in real time,"" he said. ""That means not only asking a question, but asking a follow-up and sometimes a follow-up to a follow-up.""Wallace did just this on Sunday when he grilled presidential candidate Carly Fiorina on claims she made about Planned Parenthood during CNN's GOP presidential debate. Fiorina described watching a grisly video in which an aborted fetus' heart continues to beat while Planned Parenthood staff discuss how to harvest its brain.Fact-checkers, however, have pointed out that no such video exists -- though anti-abortion group The Center for Medical Progress has released a video in which a former Planned Parenthood employee describes such a scene. “As horrific as that scene is, it was only described on the video by someone who has claimed to see it,” Wallace said to Fiorina in the segment. “There is no actual footage of the incident you just mentioned.”“No. I don’t accept that at all,"" Fiorina responded. ""I’ve seen the footage and I find it amazing, actually, that all these supposed fact-checkers in the mainstream media claim this doesn’t exist.""Wallace, who co-moderated the first GOP debate, didn't shy away from comparing Fox News' performance with CNN's.""I liked our debate better, among other things I thought it was better at 2 hours rather than 3 hours,"" he said. ""I thought that CNN spent too much time trying to pick fights. Some of them were over legitimate issues, and some of them were about ‘He said this about you, what do you say to him?’ I thought some of those didn’t go anywhere.”Last week's CNN Republican debate brought in over 22 million viewers, while more than 24 million tuned in to Fox's GOP debate last month.Watch Chris Wallace's ""Fox News Sunday"" interview with GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina below:"

12,POLITICS,Senate Democrats Stage Major Climate Change Push,Laura Barrón-López,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-climate-change-bill_us_56017397e4b00310edf895c8,"""Compared to what Republicans are doing, it's pretty damn good.""",2015-09-22,"Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), right, is the author of climate change legislation introduced Tuesday. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/560173db1c00004800082c10.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Leading Senate Democrats unveiled climate change legislation on Tuesday that is expected to go nowhere.The point: Present a united party front on the energy and climate debate.Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), the top Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, authored the bill, which would declare it national U.S. policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2 percent per year.Notably, the bill doesn't attempt to put a price on carbon emissions, which many experts see as a more effective way to mitigate climate change. That omission is arguably an acknowledgement by Democrats that a tax on carbon would diminish the bill's chances of garnering Republican co-sponsors.Asked if the exclusion of such a tax indicates that the bill is a retreat from more realistic goals, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said that ""compared to what Republicans are doing, it's pretty damn good.""Cantwell too pushed back against the idea that the bill represents a capitulation of some kind. She said she didn't want to pass up any opportunities to tackle greenhouse gas emissions. ""I don't think it's a retreat. Change happens incrementally,"" Cantwell told reporters on Tuesday. ""These are real things that can get implemented now.""Aside from the 2 percent reduction marker, the bill also offers a long-term performance-based tax incentive program, which Cantwell worked through with Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a longtime champion of clean energy tax incentives. Included in the plan are tax credits for clean electricity from renewable to fossil fuel facilities. The cleaner the energy, the bill says, the higher the tax credit. The plan also offers a credit for clean transportation fuel, translated to a production tax credit of up to $1 per gallon.The bill attempts to cover all the bases, including permanently reauthorizing the nation's Land and Water Conservation Fund, investing in energy research and development, modernizing the electric grid and repealing fossil fuel subsidies. It would also stipulate that the U.S. use its leadership to pressure other countries into commitments to cut their greenhouse gas emissions. Cantwell said Democrats decided push the bill now to coincide with visits to the U.S. from Pope Francis, who has written an encyclical on the moral obligation to combat climate change, and Chinese President Xi Jinping, who recently entered into a deal with the U.S. to curb emissions. But the odds of getting a vote on the Senate floor appear to be nil, as Republicans have widely opposed the Obama administration's climate initiatives. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) himself has vowed to work against the president's so-called war on coal to the very end. Pressed on the bill's future, Cantwell said she thinks there is a willingness among Republicans to have the debate. Specifically, she said, she believes an opening will come once the Senate eventually considers a different, all-encompassing energy bill that was voted out of the energy committee earlier this year.""It was very clear to both sides that once this bill hits the Senate floor, there were going to be ideas on both sides that people were going to propose,"" Cantwell said. ""That's where we think this has an avenue.""She acknowledged, however, that in the end they will have to see if McConnell decides to give her and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), chair of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, the ""time to talk about energy policy.""Co-sponsors praised Cantwell for putting forward the bill as Republicans prepare to bring up legislation that would lift a decades-old oil export ban in the coming months. So far, 28 Democrats have signed on to Cantwell's bill, along with Sen. Angus King (I-Maine). Despite the holdups, environmental groups largely cheered the bill, with the Sierra Club calling it a ""bold, ambitious vision."" "

The National Park Service later set up barriers around sections of the portico that were vulnerable to similar sorts of damage.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55fc5cd21c0000480008281f.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Early one morning in April 2014, the water-damaged ceiling of the Jefferson Memorial portico finally surrendered to the elements, dropping a 5-foot-long, 3-foot-wide slab of limestone some 40 feet onto the marble floor below.For months, the public didn't seem to notice. Then in October, a spokesman for the National Park Service -- which oversees the Jefferson Memorial and other monuments around Washington, D.C. -- confirmed that a faulty gutter system had allowed water to seep in from the structure's roof, eating away steel support beams until the ceiling could no longer hold the block. It was the latest reminder that the National Mall is, both literally and figuratively, crumbling under the weight of its own decaying infrastructure.Years of congressional budget cuts have exacerbated this issue on the Mall and at national parks around the country. Park Service officials regularly warn of the consequences of neglect in the face of a nationwide maintenance backlog that now exceeds $11 billion. Had the quarter-ton chunk of rock fallen in the afternoon, during the peak tourist season that surrounds the blooming of Washington's cherry blossoms each year, the oversight could have proved deadly. Instead, the warning incident was met with relative silence.This weekend, a nonprofit dedicated to restoring, preserving and improving the nearly two-mile stretch of land between the U.S. Capitol and Lincoln Memorial -- including many of Washington's most iconic monuments -- is putting an end to that silence.On Saturday and Sunday, the Trust for the National Mall, along with production group C3 Presents, will put the 700-acre park front and center at the inaugural Landmark Festival. Some of the nation's biggest musical acts will be on hand to send the message that nearly 40 years after the last large-scale restoration effort, ""America's Front Yard"" is in trouble. With the goal of raising awareness and money for the trust, 40 artists, including Drake, The Strokes and alt-J, are set to perform in West Potomac Park, a ward of the Memorial Parks just adjacent to the National Mall proper.The concert is the trust's latest and perhaps most ambitious push to raise funds for a proposed $700 million facelift to the Mall. The blueprint includes more than $400 million in deferred maintenance, as well as plans for more extensive renovations and new construction across the park, like the trust's forthcoming revitalization of Constitution Gardens, a 38-acre site that connects the Lincoln Memorial's Reflecting Pool and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. When construction is complete, the grounds will feature a winter ice skating rink, a brand-new pavilion and a rejuvenated lake that ideally won't kill its inhabitants.The trust is responsible for raising half of the project's funds -- an even $350 million. Though Congress' chronic underfunding of the Park Service is largely to blame for the Mall's current state of disrepair, lawmakers have promised to come up with the rest.The decision to organize a music festival marks a significant strategic departure for the trust, which launched in 2007 and has only 10 full-time employees. For years, it has pursued more traditional philanthropy, holding benefit luncheons, galas and other fundraisers to tap into the personal wealth that flows through the nation's capital.But the trust has become increasingly aware that relying on this sort of benefaction underscores a broader concern with the National Mall's image.The Park Service estimates that around 29 million people from around the globe visit the National Mall and Memorial Parks each year, making it one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country. However, the demographics of those visitors hardly match up with the U.S. or the rest of the world. In a commonly cited survey of Mall visitors in 2008, around 90 percent of all respondents identified as white. The average age of each visitor was nearly 50 years old.Kristine Fitton, vice president of marketing and communications for the trust, said internal statistics suggest this trend has only continued over time. It may seem sadly fitting, then, that older, wealthier white people are primarily the ones supporting the preservation of an area used mostly by individuals who look like them. However, Fitton saw an opportunity for the Mall to step up its outreach to a younger, more diverse crowd.""It's one of the most democratic spaces we have,"" she said. ""It belongs to everyone, so everyone should have a stake or feel a sense of stewardship toward the National Mall.""And if you want to prove the Mall is cool for younger people too, what better way to do it than to put on a top-billed music festival right next door?Drake will headline the Saturday show less than a week after releasing a new mixtape with rapper Future, and his appearance will come at the tail end of a tour that has brought him to some of the nation's biggest music festivals, including Coachella, in California, and Governor's Ball, in New York City. (While that puts Landmark Festival in good company, it's hard not to feel that bringing in Drake, a Canadian, to help save a celebrated U.S. landmark is at least a little awkward.) To further modernize its outreach, the trust is launching a ""virtual National Mall"" website, which will allow users to create their own ""monuments"" honoring heroes in their lives and share their submissions on social media. The concert will also fulfill many of the standard functions of a fundraising campaign. For example, people who purchase tickets, which start at $150 for a two-day pass and $105 for a single day, are placed on an email list -- likely to be groomed as future donors. (Fitton also pointed out that people who don't have tickets will be able to watch performances on large monitors set up outside the festival grounds.)Washington hasn't seen an event of this scale and format in over a decade. Throughout the '90s and early aughts, the now-defunct radio station WHFS hosted the annual HFStival at RFK Stadium, attracting artists like the Foo Fighters, Green Day and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The event moved to Maryland in 2005 and eventually closed shop for good in 2011.The largest commercial music events in the area now typically take place in neighboring Virginia or Maryland. And while the Mall regularly plays host to well-attended concerts, they are often billed as free-speech rallies and rarely sell tickets or alcohol, which will be available at Landmark.Now, Fitton says, a new generation of people from Washington and around the nation will have the opportunity to come together in the heart of D.C. for a cause that honors a part of the city's history, while contributing to its future.""There are major structural and engineering problems with the monuments that do require a significant investment to address,"" she said. ""And as a country, we have to decide how important these symbols are to us.""But the restoration effort isn't just about sentimentality, sustainability and keeping tourists from being crushed by disintegrating monuments. According to a Park Service report released last year, visitors to the Mall and other national parks in D.C. injected $610 million into the local economy in 2013. Overall visitors to the city in 2014 reportedly spent nearly $7 billion in total, Washington's tourist agency found.Trash, pollution and structural and cosmetic deterioration in the Mall all wear on visitor satisfaction and may, by extension, even affect the city's general reputation.Of course, if Congress were more attentive to the state of the Mall, the trust might not have needed to step in as caretaker for one of the city's most vital economic engines. Yet the congressional Park Service budget simply hasn't kept pace with the Mall's growing needs in recent years despite government studies showing that each dollar invested into the park system returns $10 to the U.S. economy.Fitton says this shortfall has made the Park Service and other federal agencies increasingly receptive to the idea of turning to public-private partnerships for more immediate financial solutions.""These friend groups have really sprung up to supplement government funding, because government funding is insufficient,"" she said. ""And that's sort of the wave of the future.""While the trust aims to make Landmark Festival an annual Washington, D.C., event to benefit the Mall, a lot will depend on how this weekend goes. Music festivals are not always successful endeavors, and many struggle to turn a profit, especially early on when organizers haven't yet built a profile. The trust has partnered with PR firms to help them make the most out of this year's festival, and Fitton says she's optimistic, even though her expectations are realistic.The trust is also hoping to do more than just make money this weekend. Its longer-term goals involve changing the way people think about the Mall. Part of that effort apparently means giving the public a brutally honest diagnosis of the park's current state. All of the photos included in this story are from the trust, and together they come pretty close to calling the Mall a barren wasteland overflowing with garbage, diseased wildlife and booby traps. Perhaps that's a more accurate description than most of us would like to believe.Fitton also wants to challenge the Mall's reputation as a concert venue reserved only for formal events and the most extravagant tributes to Americanness. She traces some of the Mall's stiff perception back to a dispute over a free July 4 concert in 1983, when then-Interior Secretary James Watt indirectly banned The Beach Boys from playing, saying rock bands attracted ""the wrong element.""""[From] now on, July Fourth will be a [traditional ceremony] for the family and for solid, clean American lives,"" Watt said at the time. In the end, Las Vegas performer Wayne Newton headlined the show, accompanied by the U.S. Army Blues Band. While Watt's decision looks even more ridiculous today -- seriously, The Beach Boys were too rock 'n' roll? -- Fitton says aspects of that tradition live on. Most concerts on the Mall still tend to avoid controversy at all costs, and many feature fantastical displays of patriotism that cater to an audience that trends older, whiter and more conservative.Last Veterans Day, for example, hundreds of thousands of attendees flocked to the Mall for the free Concert for Valor. Many ended up packing the surrounding streets to view the performances on Jumbotrons because there was no way to get within viewing distance of the stage, a common issue at larger events on the Mall. That show featured seemingly safe artists like Bruce Springsteen, Carrie Underwood and the Zac Brown Band, but even they managed to attract criticism. Some in particular questioned Springsteen's decision to play anti-war songs in front of the decidedly pro-military crowd. Though the Landmark Festival's grounds may not provide the same picturesque backdrop as the Mall, Fitton believes the trust can help reset broader precedents about how to use the space. After all, the Mall's legacy has been shaped by events that took risks, challenged convention and unabashedly embraced First Amendment principles. Martin Luther King Jr. wasn't worried about pleasing everybody when he delivered his ""I Have a Dream"" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in 1963. Nor were the gay rights activists who unfurled the iconic AIDS Quilt across the Mall in 1987.""I don't want young people to feel that the National Mall is like going to church, where everything has to be proper and you can't sing a song unless it's patriotic,"" Fitton said. ""If you can offend anyone, you should do it on the National Mall."""

And while the Mall regularly plays host to well-attended concerts, they are often billed as free-speech rallies and rarely sell tickets or alcohol, which will be available at Landmark.Now, Fitton says, a new generation of people from Washington and around the nation will have the opportunity to come together in the heart of D.C. for a cause that honors a part of the city's history, while contributing to its future.""There are major structural and engineering problems with the monuments that do require a significant investment to address,"" she said. ""And as a country, we have to decide how important these symbols are to us.""But the restoration effort isn't just about sentimentality, sustainability and keeping tourists from being crushed by disintegrating monuments. According to a Park Service report released last year, visitors to the Mall and other national parks in D.C. injected $610 million into the local economy in 2013. Overall visitors to the city in 2014 reportedly spent nearly $7 billion in total, Washington's tourist agency found.Trash, pollution and structural and cosmetic deterioration in the Mall all wear on visitor satisfaction and may, by extension, even affect the city's general reputation.Of course, if Congress were more attentive to the state of the Mall, the trust might not have needed to step in as caretaker for one of the city's most vital economic engines. Yet the congressional Park Service budget simply hasn't kept pace with the Mall's growing needs in recent years despite government studies showing that each dollar invested into the park system returns $10 to the U.S. economy.Fitton says this shortfall has made the Park Service and other federal agencies increasingly receptive to the idea of turning to public-private partnerships for more immediate financial solutions.""These friend groups have really sprung up to supplement government funding, because government funding is insufficient,"" she said. ""And that's sort of the wave of the future.""While the trust aims to make Landmark Festival an annual Washington, D.C., event to benefit the Mall, a lot will depend on how this weekend goes. Music festivals are not always successful endeavors, and many struggle to turn a profit, especially early on when organizers haven't yet built a profile. The trust has partnered with PR firms to help them make the most out of this year's festival, and Fitton says she's optimistic, even though her expectations are realistic.The trust is also hoping to do more than just make money this weekend. Its longer-term goals involve changing the way people think about the Mall. Part of that effort apparently means giving the public a brutally honest diagnosis of the park's current state. All of the photos included in this story are from the trust, and together they come pretty close to calling the Mall a barren wasteland overflowing with garbage, diseased wildlife and booby traps. Perhaps that's a more accurate description than most of us would like to believe.Fitton also wants to challenge the Mall's reputation as a concert venue reserved only for formal events and the most extravagant tributes to Americanness. She traces some of the Mall's stiff perception back to a dispute over a free July 4 concert in 1983, when then-Interior Secretary James Watt indirectly banned The Beach Boys from playing, saying rock bands attracted ""the wrong element.""""[From] now on, July Fourth will be a [traditional ceremony] for the family and for solid, clean American lives,"" Watt said at the time. In the end, Las Vegas performer Wayne Newton headlined the show, accompanied by the U.S. Army Blues Band. While Watt's decision looks even more ridiculous today -- seriously, The Beach Boys were too rock 'n' roll? -- Fitton says aspects of that tradition live on. Most concerts on the Mall still tend to avoid controversy at all costs, and many feature fantastical displays of patriotism that cater to an audience that trends older, whiter and more conservative.Last Veterans Day, for example, hundreds of thousands of attendees flocked to the Mall for the free Concert for Valor. Many ended up packing the surrounding streets to view the performances on Jumbotrons because there was no way to get within viewing distance of the stage, a common issue at larger events on the Mall. That show featured seemingly safe artists like Bruce Springsteen, Carrie Underwood and the Zac Brown Band, but even they managed to attract criticism. Some in particular questioned Springsteen's decision to play anti-war songs in front of the decidedly pro-military crowd. Though the Landmark Festival's grounds may not provide the same picturesque backdrop as the Mall, Fitton believes the trust can help reset broader precedents about how to use the space. After all, the Mall's legacy has been shaped by events that took risks, challenged convention and unabashedly embraced First Amendment principles. Martin Luther King Jr. wasn't worried about pleasing everybody when he delivered his ""I Have a Dream"" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in 1963. Nor were the gay rights activists who unfurled the iconic AIDS Quilt across the Mall in 1987.""I don't want young people to feel that the National Mall is like going to church, where everything has to be proper and you can't sing a song unless it's patriotic,"" Fitton said. ""If you can offend anyone, you should do it on the National Mall."""
15,RELIGION,Native Americans Decry Sainthood For California's Iconic Missionary,Julian Brave NoiseCat,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/junipero-serra-native-americans_us_560171fbe4b0fde8b0cfcb32,"Junípero Serra ""created and brought genocide to the California Indian people.""",2015-09-22,Junipero Serra founded the California mission system that converted and killed so many Native Americans.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/560175cb2000002500242cb1.jpeg?cache=YCgqf0i5FQ&ops=crop_74_378_3739_2214%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"On Wednesday, Junípero Serra, the architect of the California mission system that converted 81,000 Native Americans to Christianity in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, will be canonized as a saint in Washington during Pope Francis' first visit to the United States. Serra, the ""apostle of California,"" is a familiar figure to residents of that state. Every year, thousands of fourth-graders in California's public schools learn about Serra, who founded the first nine of what were ultimately 21 missions stretching from San Diego to San Francisco on behalf of Spain and the Catholic Church. The history unit culminates with the ""mission project,"" in which students play Serra by building a scale model of one of his missions.I went to public school in Oakland, California, so I had to do the mission project in fourth grade, too. I was assigned the Mission Santa Clara de Asis, the eighth one in California, founded in 1777 to proselytize the local Ohlone Indians and blessed by Serra in 1779. But when I built my mission, I departed from the rubric slightly and constructed tall wooden crosses in the graveyard to overshadow my model church. I was only 10, but this was a political statement.Historians estimate that 60,000 indigenous Californians had died in the missions by the time the Mexican government sold them to private landowners in the 1830s. Over the Spanish mission era, the system contributed to the direct and indirect deaths of half of the California Indian population, which is estimated at 300,000 to 1 million people before contact with the Catholic missionaries. The California Indians subjugated in these missions spoke 64 to 80 distinct languages and were part of the most diverse and densely populated region of indigenous peoples in North America before colonization. They were decimated by disease, war and the conditions in the missions, where Native people were worked and starved to death. By 1910, after a century and a half of missions, gold rushes and reservations, there were only 15,850 California Indians left. Serra and the California missions represent the brutal history and bloody legacy of colonization to many Native people, including fourth-grade me. ""I believe that Junípero Serra actually created and brought genocide to the California Indian people,"" Corrina Gould, co-founder of Indian People Organizing for Change and an Ohlone tribal member, told The Huffington Post. ""In less than 100 years, our way of life, our language, our foods -- everything -- was destroyed.""So I built oversized crosses for Gould's Ohlone ancestors, who met slavery and the destruction of their bodies and their way of life in Bay Area missions such as Santa Clara de Asis.In July, Pope Francis apologized for the Catholic Church's role in the global history of colonization during his visit to Ecuador. The apology was notable, even for a papacy characterized by support for progressive politics and social justice.In the wake of that apology, the pope's decision to canonize Serra -- and to fast-track that process by bypassing the usual requirement of two miracles attributed to the sainthood candidate -- has left Gould and many other Native people disappointed. ""I believe that the Catholic Church is making a horrendous mistake,"" Gould said.Indeed, the real miracle, she said, is that the descendants of ""any of the California Indians that were pushed into those California missions, those slave encampments, are alive today.""Against California Indians' condemnation of Serra's record and legacy, Vatican officials have argued that Serra was actually a champion of Native rights during his lifetime, defending indigenous peoples against worse treatment by the military and government of colonial Spain.In the midst of a wave of anti-Mexican xenophobia on the American political right, the church is also hopeful that Serra's canonization will promote greater acceptance of Hispanic Americans and recognition of Catholic contributions to U.S. history. ""[I]t will allow many millions of Hispanics who live in the United States to free themselves of a mentality that says they are barely tolerated and frequently discriminated-against foreigners on the margins of society,"" Guzman Carriquiry, Vatican official from Uruguay, told the Catholic News Service at a press conference in April. Carriquiry said that Hispanic Americans should see themselves ""in continuation with a line of Hispanics who for centuries have inhabited large areas of what is now the southwestern, central and eastern United States. They can rightly affirm, 'We are Americans,' without having to abandon their best cultural and religious traditions.""But the Vatican's effort to recognize Hispanic Americans seems to come at the expense of the truth about Native peoples, and Gould and many other California Indians aren't buying it. They will be protesting Serra's canonization with demonstrations at missions across the state on Wednesday. Although they cannot stop him from being canonized, Gould said that the work of educating people about his barbarous legacy must continue. Modern injustice against Native Americans rests on ignorance of how the U.S. was built.""The truth of this history needs to be told, especially in California,"" Gould said. ""They are still building those little missions in schools today, and in doing so they continue to perpetuate genocide against California Indians."""

It will then tell you how long you'll have before it's time to pick up your order.Starbucks began testing the program last year at stores in Portland, Oregon, and expanded it to 3,400 more stores in select states over the summer.Now it's available across the U.S. and will be in select company-owned stores in the UK and Canada by the end of October.It's the fastest technology roll-out Starbucks has ever done, Adam Brotman, the company's chief digital officer, said in a statement. It is ""indicative of the strength of our digital ecosystem, how well it has been received by both our customers and store partners and the impact we think it can have on the future of retail.”What does this mean? Not only will Starbucks will have a ""glut of information"" on us, as Gizmodo pointed out, but we might be one step closer to Starbucks delivery.A spokesperson for Starbucks told The Huffington Post that the company has plans to test a delivery program in New York's Empire State Building, called Green Apron Delivery, specifically designed for high-rise buildings.Right now though, the spokesperson said, ""we’re focused on making our U.S. Mobile Order and Pay rollout in over 7,400 company-owned stores an exceptional experience for our customers... We already have thousands of drink customization options available but we’ll continue to refine those options and longer term, look at expanding to our licensed stores.""If only they could serve it through our phones.Also on HuffPost:"
17,MEDIA,Vice Went To Prison With Obama. Now It's Going Deep Into Inmate Issues.,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/vice-obama-prison-documentary-hbo_us_55fd7c1ee4b00310edf74566,"""It was too good an opportunity not to throw the kitchen sink at it.""",2015-09-22,Obama was the first sitting president to visit a federal penitentiary.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=crop_85_59_4330_2437%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- ""Is the criminal justice system in America racist?""Vice co-founder and CEO Shane Smith put that question to President Barack Obama after running through the grim statistics of how federal mandatory minimum laws have disproportionately hurt poor and minority communities, with long prison sentences issued for nonviolent drug offenses. While 1 in 17 white men will spend time in prison, Smith noted, the rate is 1 in 3 for black men.""I think the criminal justice system interacts with broader patterns of society in a way that results in injustice and unfairness,"" Obama told Smith during their July trip to El Reno Federal Prison in Oklahoma, the first time a sitting president has visited a federal penitentiary.""The system, every study has shown, is biased somewhere institutionally in such a way where an African-American youth is more likely to be suspended from school than a white youth for engaging in the same disruptive behavior, more likely to be arrested, more likely to be charged, more likely to be prosecuted aggressively, more likely to get a stiffer sentence,"" Obama said.The president's interview with Smith appears in ""Fixing the System,"" a Vice documentary on mass incarceration airing 9 p.m. Sunday night on HBO. The White House did not comment as to why Vice was invited to follow Obama at El Reno. Criminal justice reform, and the president's support for it, is something the White House wants to showcase -- and Vice has been covering the topic closely for years. (It may also have been helpful that Vice's chief operating officer, Alyssa Mastromonaco, worked for Obama from 2005 to 2014.)In May, the president participated in a Vice roundtable with Smith and five students on the cost of college education, and last week, he spoke at a White House screening of ""Fixing the System.""The HBO documentary is just one component of a Vice editorial project stretching beyond television to all of the company's 10 online channels, its print magazine and mobile offerings like Snapchat Discover.""When we realized that something of this magnitude was going to happen in front of our cameras, we thought it was too good an opportunity not to throw the kitchen sink at it,"" Alex Miller, Vice's global head of content, told The Huffington Post. ""What we're doing is finally leveraging ... the multitude of media platforms which we have at our disposal to truly ram home how seriously we take this issue.""Vice plans to publish more than 50 pieces on prisons and reform in the coming weeks, through the editorial lens of its various sites. For instance, Vice Sports will look at the significance of handball to inmates, while Motherboard, a science and technology site, is examining the high costs of Skype in prison. Food site Munchies will look at the cooking practices of Italian inmates, while Noisey is appropriately covering music in prison. Vice's next print edition, ""The Prison Issue,"" hits newsstands Oct. 5. ""When the idea for the documentary started to be bounced around the office, it was clear that this was an enormous project for us, a significant moment in the history of Vice,"" said Miller.He added that criminal justice is ""not only undeniably significant in the eyes of the American people,"" but of particular interest to Vice's CEO, who helped found a punk magazine in 1994 that has since grown into a youth media juggernaut valued at $2.5 billion. ""What we're trying to do is shine a spotlight,"" Smith said Monday on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" ""We're trying to say, 'Hey, look, there's bipartisan support -- support from the judiciary, support from the president. Let's push this together and reform.'""For ""Fixing the System,"" Smith interviewed several inmates serving long prison sentences for nonviolent drug offenses, their families, members of the law enforcement community, former Attorney General Eric Holder, and reform-minded lawmakers like Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.). What's most striking is the unprecedented sit-down between Obama and six inmates. He listens to their stories and expresses empathy with the situations they've landed in.The president admits doing a ""lot of stupid stuff"" during his younger years, including using drugs. But Obama acknowledges he was fortunate that such youthful indiscretions took place ""in an environment where you could afford to make some mistakes,"" as opposed to low-income communities with high levels of drug activity whose residents often don't get a second chance.""I had more of a margin of error than a lot of kids do,"" Obama says.
