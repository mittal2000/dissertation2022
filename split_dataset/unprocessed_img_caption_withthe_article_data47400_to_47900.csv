Meanwhile, Trump, the GOP’s nominee, has frequently lauded Russia and Putin, and several of his current and former advisers have strong ties to that nation. For the top Democrats on the House Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, Homeland Security, and Oversight and Government Reform committees, those facts are suggestive enough to warrant further investigation.“Serious questions have been raised about overt and covert actions by Trump campaign officials on behalf of Russian interests,” states the letter to FBI Director James Comey from Reps. Eliot Engel (N.Y.), Elijah Cummings (Md.), John Conyers (Mich.) and Bennie Thompson (Miss.).“It is critical for the American public to know whether those actions may have directly caused or indirectly motivated attacks against Democratic institutions and our fundamental election process,” the lawmakers wrote.The letter notes that Trump himself has declared he hopes Russia has obtained Clinton’s email from her time as secretary of state and that his close confidante Roger Stone claims to have intelligence regarding a fresh “October surprise” from Wikileaks.The formal request also points to those Trump advisers with Russian ties, including departed campaign head Paul Manafort, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, adviser Carter Page, and others.The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

The New York State Court of Appeals overturned a 1991 decision that defined a parent as a biological or adoptive relative, noting that relationship and family structures have changed dramatically in the 25 years since that ruling was handed down. Nonbiological, nonadoptive parents, the ruling reads, can seek custody if “a partner shows by clear and convincing evidence that the parties agreed to conceive a child and to raise the child together.” The case marks a major victory for people, including many in same-sex relationships, who have elected to raise children they are not biologically related to. “In light of more recently delineated legal principles, the definition of ‘parent’ established by this Court 25 years ago... has become unworkable when applied to increasingly varied familial relationships,” wrote Judge Sheila Abdus-Salaam. The ruling came in response to two cases involving lesbian couples who had had a child together before splitting up. The nonbiological mothers in both cases were denied visitation rights, as they had no legal standing to claim parenthood under the 1991 ruling. Now, people in similar situations will be able to seek visitation or custody. Whether they are granted those rights will still be decided on a case-by-case basis.“This is a major step forward for same-sex couples and especially for the children of those parents,” said attorney Eric Wrubel, who represented the child involved in one of the cases. “Tying the definition of parenthood to biology or adoption was no longer viable. This new ruling will help to protect children, regardless of the marital or financial status of their parents.”"
3,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Is Doing Better In States With Highly Educated White Populations,Ariel Edwards-Levy and Janie Velencia,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-college-educated-whites_us_57c5d19ee4b0664f13cb0530,The demographic is one Donald Trump can't afford to lose.,2016-08-30,"Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton speaks at a rally at Truckee Meadows Community College in Reno, Nevada, Aug. 25, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c5d7b31700000011c76791.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hillary Clinton is winning in states with a greater proportion of highly educated white voters, a demographic that her rival Donald Trump needs to win over in order to have a shot at the presidency.Clinton polls proportionally better in states that have a higher ratio of white people with college degrees relative to the overall number of white people in the state. As the following chart shows, in the 21 states where HuffPost Pollster has enough survey data to estimate the state of the race, there’s a moderately positive correlation between Clinton’s margin and the percentage of whites over age 25 who’ve obtained a bachelor’s degree.These white, highly educated Americans, who have tended to lean Republican, could help to reshape the electoral map, keeping Clinton competitive in traditionally red states and contributing to her advantage in states like Colorado and Virginia, where races have often been closer.As The Atlantic’s Ron Brownstein notes, winning over educated white voters is crucial for Trump. With white voters who don’t have a college education still largely in Trump’s camp, and nonwhite voters unlikely to give him much support, “that leaves college-educated whites as the campaign’s most closely contested ― and conflicted ― major constituency,” Brownstein wrote in July.“Even if [Trump] grows among blue-collar whites to Reagan ’84 levels, his struggles among non-whites means he likely can’t win without capturing either slightly below or just above 60 percent of college-educated whites, depending on how large a share of the vote they comprise,” Brownstein went on. “For comparison, the exit polls showed Romney winning 56 percent of white-collar whites last time.”Now, a month later, Trump seems increasingly unlikely to match even those numbers. Clinton leads among white voters with college degrees by 10 points, 46 percent to 36 percent, according to the most recent YouGov/Economist poll. Other surveys have shown her leading among that group by smaller margins.If those numbers hold, they would mark a significant realignment along educational lines, making Trump the first Republican presidential candidate in 60 years to lose white college graduates.Clinton’s strength among that demographic is the culmination of a long shift in American politics.As recently as 1992, there was no correlation between the share of a state’s population with a college degree and that state’s willingness to vote Republican, according to Lee Drutman, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation. By 2012, Democrats were performing markedly better in more educated states.“Republicans and Democrats essentially underwent a four-decade exchange program,” Drutman wrote. “Democrats sent Republicans their non-college-educated, culturally conservative white voters, mostly in declining rural and exurban areas, who had once been the core of the New Deal. In return, Democrats got culturally liberal wealthy professionals, largely in prosperous urban and suburban areas, many of whom were once ‘Rockefeller Republicans’ and had once opposed many elements of the New Deal.”Trump’s weakness with well-educated white voters, in fact, could explain his recent outreach to black and Latino voters. Polls have shown that one of the things college-educated whites don’t like about Trump is their belief that he is either racist or willing to use racist themes in his campaign. It’s been argued that his newfound concern about minorities may be less about winning voters of color and more about persuading skeptical white voters that he is not a racist.S.V.

He has not indicated whether he will sign it into law.The measure was introduced in response to the sentence given to 20-year-old Brock Turner by Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky in June, which was widely condemned as too lenient.Prosecutors had asked that Turner be given six years in state prison. He is scheduled to be released on Friday from jail in Northern California.“Sexually assaulting an unconscious or intoxicated victim is a terrible crime and our laws need to reflect that,” Democratic Assemblyman Bill Dodd, a co-author of the legislation, said in a written statement following its passage.Turner was convicted of assault with intent to commit rape, penetration of an intoxicated person and penetration of an unconscious person in the January 2015 attack. Under California law, those charges are not considered rape because they did not involve penile penetration.The uproar over the sentence, fueled in part by the victim’s harrowing letter in which she detailed the assault in graphic terms, comes amid growing outrage over sexual assault on U.S. college campuses.“This bill is about more than sentencing, it’s about supporting victims and changing the culture on our college campuses to help prevent future crimes,” Dodd said.The case has also led to efforts to remove Persky from the bench. Earlier this month, the judge asked for a transfer to civil court.According to the legislators, current California law calls for a mandatory prison term in cases of rape or sexual assault where force is used, but not when the victim is unconscious or severely intoxicated and thus unable to resist.The bill, which faced no serious opposition in the Democratic-controlled legislature, would eliminate a judge’s discretion to sentence defendants convicted of such crimes to probation. Under its provisions, Turner would have faced a minimum of three years behind bars.Need help?

Arianna Huffington delivered a remarkable keynote speech at this year’s conference while Essence publisher Michelle E. Banks and motivational speaker Lisa Nichols delivered special remarks on self-care and how to succeed at work and in life. Being a woman in the workplace can prompt feelings of invisibility, casual sexism and lead to a pay gap that could cost black women, in particular, more than $1 million. “ColorComm’s conference focuses on action, professional development, business partnerships and opportunities,” Wilson told HuffPost. “Women leave feeling empowered because the organization advances the visibility and accomplishments of women of color in communications.” This year’s ColorComm conference was filled with valuable lessons for women from women. Here are 11 pieces of advice from the conference that all women of color in the workplace should know: "

8,POLITICS,Trump Hits Clinton For Not Doing News Conferences While Banning Reporters From His Pressers,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-news-conference-media_us_57c5f496e4b0a22de092e8f4,The GOP nominee's media blacklist has excluded a big chunk of the press corps.,2016-08-30,"Donald Trump and the Republican Party have attacked Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for not holding news conferences, even though he has banned dozens of reporters from attending his own.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c5f6d9180000dd10bce262.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON – Republicans have ramped up their hammering of Hillary Clinton for not holding a news conference this year – even as their own presidential nominee has been banning dozens of journalists from participating in his.Trump has banned Univision, Buzzfeed, The Huffington Post, The Daily Beast, The Des Moines Register, Politico and The Washington Post from receiving credentials to his campaign events, including news conferences. The ban prevents reporters who have produced some of the most critical coverage of Trump from even attending, let alone asking questions.The news organizations were blacklisted because of coverage Trump did not like. (Many of the banned news organizations, though, including this publication, are taking part in a rotation for pool coverage of Trump through the election.) The Des Moines Register was banned after its editorial board called on Trump to drop out of the GOP race last July. HuffPost was also banned last summer after its editors relegated coverage of Trump to its entertainment section. Politico was banned this spring after it ran a story questioning the temperament of its first campaign manager.This record, though, has not stopped Trump and the RNC from trying to exploit the Democratic presidential nominee’s aversion to question-and-answer sessions with the reporters who cover her campaign daily.At the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani scolded reporters for not more forcefully demanding news conferences from Clinton. “You, the press should be ashamed of yourself. You should be ashamed for not doing your job,” said Giuliani, now a top Trump supporter. “She should not be allowed to run for president and hide in an ivory tower.”In the intervening weeks, Republican leaders have taken to taunting Clinton on Twitter, in interviews and in their daily emails to campaign reporters.“Why is the press OK with that?” asked Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway last week on CNBC. “Two hundred and sixty days, you could have had a baby by then.”Starting last week, the campaign also began sending out emails counting how many days have passed since Clinton’s last formal news conference in December. “HIDING HILLARY: DAY 269,” was the subject line for Tuesday’s, which included a statement from Trump spokesman Jason Miller demanding “full transparency.”On the issue of transparency, however, the Trump campaign lags far behind the Clinton operation in one key area: fundraising.The Clinton campaign, from the day it was launched, has disclosed the location of every fundraiser, the name of the hosts, how many were in attendance and what the minimum donation amount was. The practice has been common for presidential campaigns in recent years. Both President Barack Obama and GOP nominee Mitt Romney routinely disclosed this information in 2012.Clinton, for example, on Monday released information on three fundraisers she attended in the Hamptons. The third, according to the campaign, was held at the home of Tracy and Jay Snyder in East Hampton, where the 25 attendees each donated a minimum of $33,400 to attend.Trump also held a fundraiser Monday, at a private home near the Stanford University campus in Woodside, California. His campaign revealed zero information about who attended or how much was raised.Neither the Trump campaign nor the Republican National Committee, which co-sponsors his events as part of a joint fundraising agreement, responded to requests for comment from HuffPost.The names of donors and the amounts contributed are eventually reported to the Federal Election Commission, but those records do not reveal the names of the hosts or event locations.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

The “all lives matter” camp fails to realize that the lives of black Americans are disproportionately destroyed by the criminal justice system, civil rights advocates point out.Some Twitter users scolded Rice for the controversial tweet and for speaking out against Kaepernick’s actions at all.Rice’s tweet also appears to reference a quote from Rodney King, the victim of a horrendous police beating in 1991 that was caught on camera. After a jury acquitted the Los Angeles cops involved in the incident, King famously pleaded against rioting by saying, “Can we all get along?”Rice used almost the same wording on Twitter.Kaepernick refused to stand for the national anthem at a preseason game on Friday night, arguing that he did not want to “show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.” Despite criticism from other players and the public, the 49ers quarterback is defending the gesture as a way to protest racism in the U.S., particularly police brutality.Kaepernick said on Sunday that he will sit during the anthem in forthcoming football games."

Since then, it has received over 55,000 views.Hajduk told The Huffington Post that he and his boyfriend wanted “to show people that gay love is no different than [any other kind of] love,” and they didn’t intend to make a strong political statement when they created the video. “We are just ordinary people. We have fun, we love, we care for each other the same way [everyone else] does,” he said. “That’s not so obvious for people in Poland.” The acknowledgement from Roxette, which is best known in the U.S. for ‘90s hits like “Joyride” and “It Must Have Been Love,” meant a lot to the guys, who are lifelong fans. “We were really amazed,” Hajduk told HuffPost. “I was a Roxette fan when I was a kid, and David likes them, too, so that’s really great that now, they like something that we do.” The men hope the impact of the video will resonate in their native Poland, where same-sex marriage remains illegal and recent efforts to expand anti-discrimination measures to include the LGBT community have gone nowhere. “In Poland, gay life is not easy,” Hajduk said. “So even such a small thing like a support from a music star makes you feel better and proud of being gay.” Kudos for creativity, guys!

After obtaining permission from Wetter, the boys looked around but forgot to close the bus door when they left. Wetter allegedly slapped and punched the teenagers and supposedly even grabbed one by the throat. Documents obtained by Seattle Times say that the 65-year-old’s alleged attack caused one of the boys to complain “a sore, raspy throat, fear of dying and pain in his throat area.”People reports the the twins are Wilson’s nephews and the sons of her sister, Nancy Wilson, and her ex, director Cameron Crowe. Ann Wilson’s rep told People, “Since this is a family matter, it is asked that you respect their privacy.”Wetter was booked on assault charges at King County Jail in Kent, Washington, early Saturday morning.

Emily Blunt has received Julie Andrews’ blessing regarding her casting as Mary Poppins in the upcoming sequel to the classic 1964 film. Blunt is set to introduce the magical English nanny to a new generation of youngsters when the Rob Marshall–helmed “Mary Poppins Returns” hits theaters December 2018. The story will reportedly pick up 20 years later in Depression-era London after Poppins and company chim chim cher-eed one final time.“Rob said he was in the Hamptons, and he saw [Andrews], and he said, ‘It’s top secret, but Emily Blunt’s playing Mary Poppins,’” Blunt told Entertainment Weekly. “And she went, ‘Oh, wonderful!’”“I felt like I wanted to cry,” she added. “It was lovely to get her stamp of approval. That took the edge off it, for sure.”The Poppins we’ll see on the big screen, however, might be a far cry from Andrews’ more gentle interpretation of the now-iconic nanny. According to Blunt, the sequel is relying more heavily on the original source material, P. L. Travers eight-part children’s books series, which depicts Poppins as a bit rougher around the edges. “We’re delving into the books a lot more, which is a different version of the character, I’ll say that much,” Blunt revealed. “She’s a little meaner, yeah.”But that doesn’t mean the actress isn’t aware of what made filmgoers fall in love with Poppins in the first place. After all, few films have managed to have the staying power of the original adaptation.“I feel a little more trepidation with this [character] because she’s so emblematic of people’s nostalgia,” Blunt admitted. “It’s such an important character in people’s childhood.”"

All four had been reported missing in California and have since been released to Louisiana’s Department of Children and Family Services, police said in a release.Moreno and Rascon were booked into the Acadia Parish Sheriff’s Office. Moreno faces an active arrest warrant from California for three counts of lewd and lascivious acts on a child under the age of 14. Rascon was booked for child abduction.State police had received information that the couple might be heading to Louisiana, prompting an alert. It’s not clear why Moreno and Rascon went to Louisiana or why police anticipated that they might.Nonetheless, two state troopers who received the alert recognized Moreno in the Arcadia Parish store around 3 a.m. Rascon and her children were then found in the parking lot, police said.The kids were described as hungry and dirty, having not bathed in several days. Troopers purchased food and drinks for them before transporting them back to their headquarters, where they were treated to toys and visits by other troopers, state police said.“This is an excellent example of Troopers working hand in hand with law enforcement across the nation to help those in need,” Col. Mike Edmonson, Louisiana’s state police superintendent, said in a release. “The successful recovery of these four children is proof that law enforcement partnerships work. Troopers will continue to work with our established partners to seek out and bring to justice those who wish to harm our children.”"

We’ve signed petitions, raised awareness on social media and among friends, and sent letters to our local politicians. But there’s something missing. There has to be, given that this barbaric practice is still allowed to occur.The difficulty in this day and age is that too few of us are able to find the time or the motivation to actually, physically go outside and be present, so that our voices might be heard in person. This is perhaps a sign of the changing times, as technology has taken over. Barely audible now are the whispers to ‘save the whale’; we have laid aside our placards and our pluckiness.While we have learnt how invaluable the power of social media truly is, and while there are those who serve the cause working in other ways, there is still a very much needed place for peaceful marches. It’s not so easy to ignore thousands of people standing outside of an office window. And it is your physical presence that is being called upon now; to show up as we used to when we wanted to invoke a change. This time, it’s to help save the more than 1,000 dolphins killed annually during the Taiji drive hunt season, which starts every year on September 1.Bottlenose dolphins comprise the majority of the cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises) driven into the killing cove by boats, nets and disorientating blasts of sound. Also captured and killed are Risso’s, Pacific white-sided, pantropical spotted and striped dolphins, as well as false killer and short-finned pilot whales. A pod of ten orcas, remembered as the Taiji Ten, has been decimated in Taiji’s cove too.No cetacean is safe. This year alone, the Japanese Fisheries Agency has authorized fisherman to kill or capture 16,000 cetaceans. The force driving these bloody hunts? Money from the captive entertainment industry. Perhaps it is no coincidence that bottlenose dolphins are the most captured cetacean, given that they are also the most kept cetacean species in captivity. A dolphin selected for captivity (usually the “pretty”, docile ones) will earn a Taiji fisherman as much as $154,000 per animal. Those butchered for human consumption, despite the toxic levels of mercury accumulated within their bodies, sell for much less. Countries that have been implicated in Taiji cetacean importations (in the last ten years alone) include China, Korea, Ukraine, Egypt, Iran, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan and the Philippines. Although allowing Taiji-captured individuals into the US is now illegal, cetaceans that were captured in the killing cove have previously gone to SeaWorld, the Indianapolis Zoological Society, Miami Seaquarium and the US Navy. According to Ric O’Barry’s Dolphin Project, “Dolphin brokers from the United States are often spotted in Taiji.” And Canada may also be guilty, with the possibility that two dolphins displayed at the Vancouver Aquarium were captured in the Taiji drive hunts.It has now been seven years since the release of the Oscar-winning documentary The Cove, in which dolphin welfare advocate Ric O’Barry exposed this mass slaughter. Everyone appeared to be horrified, yet we have seen very little change. The drive hunts continue to present a grave welfare concern for each cetacean captured, killed or left behind, (not to mention for the people unwittingly eating poisonous meat). These animals are sentient creatures with the capacity to understand what is going on; to comprehend and put into context everything that they experience and witness. And there is also the serious conservation concern of removing individuals from these unstudied populations.“I have been going to the cove multiple times a year for the last 13 years trying to stop this madness,” said O’Barry, a former dolphin trainer who learned from his time working with dolphins in captivity that they do not belong there. Since leaving the industry after his revelation more than four decades ago, he has spent his days trying to free dolphins from confinement and to bring an end to the Taiji drive hunts. “I desperately need to see the dolphin slaughter end in my lifetime, and at 77 I’m running out of time.”O’Barry is pleading for people to turn up to the peaceful march that will take place in London next week to mark the first day of this year’s hunt. It is hoped that if enough individuals are present, those in power will have no choice but to take notice. “I feel sure that if we can get 10,000 Londoners in front of the Japanese Embassy, it will end,” O’Barry stated, adding that “London is the only city where this is possible.”And there is one very specific need that O’Barry is placing huge emphasis on: “I’m begging the UK animal protection community to please contact their millions of members directly and urge them to show up.”The Japan Dolphins Day march will begin in Cavendish Square Gardens in London at 12pm GST next Thursday, September 1, marking the first day of the slaughters. From there, everyone who attends will proceed to the Japanese Embassy in Piccadilly. It will be a peaceful protest against an entirely violent act, and your presence is needed to demonstrate how much this issue –how much each and every cetacean– matters…That is 10,000 people for the 16,000 whales and dolphins that will be slaughtered or sold into captivity. Please. Can you help?"

And there is also the serious conservation concern of removing individuals from these unstudied populations.“I have been going to the cove multiple times a year for the last 13 years trying to stop this madness,” said O’Barry, a former dolphin trainer who learned from his time working with dolphins in captivity that they do not belong there. Since leaving the industry after his revelation more than four decades ago, he has spent his days trying to free dolphins from confinement and to bring an end to the Taiji drive hunts. “I desperately need to see the dolphin slaughter end in my lifetime, and at 77 I’m running out of time.”O’Barry is pleading for people to turn up to the peaceful march that will take place in London next week to mark the first day of this year’s hunt. It is hoped that if enough individuals are present, those in power will have no choice but to take notice. “I feel sure that if we can get 10,000 Londoners in front of the Japanese Embassy, it will end,” O’Barry stated, adding that “London is the only city where this is possible.”And there is one very specific need that O’Barry is placing huge emphasis on: “I’m begging the UK animal protection community to please contact their millions of members directly and urge them to show up.”The Japan Dolphins Day march will begin in Cavendish Square Gardens in London at 12pm GST next Thursday, September 1, marking the first day of the slaughters. From there, everyone who attends will proceed to the Japanese Embassy in Piccadilly. It will be a peaceful protest against an entirely violent act, and your presence is needed to demonstrate how much this issue –how much each and every cetacean– matters…That is 10,000 people for the 16,000 whales and dolphins that will be slaughtered or sold into captivity. Please. Can you help?"

The former speaker of the House and runner-up for Donald Trump’s VP made his deadbeat intentions official on Aug. 1 when he filed a debt settlement plan that proposed repaying none of the money he owed. The FEC rejected this plan in a letter to the campaign committee dated Sunday.The letter from the chief federal election finance regulator states that Gingrich’s plan to not pay his creditors “does not meet the requirements” under the applicable federal election law. Further, the committee “may not terminate based on this [debt settlement plan] filing because it contains no debt settlement agreements and must continue to file all required reports.”Newt 2012 racked up a staggering $4.6 million in debt to 114 creditors, among them many small businesses that made TV spots and yard signs. Several business owners told The Huffington Post in 2015 that they’d given up hope of ever getting paid.Gingrich’s rejected debt settlement plan is the result of a 2011 complaint filed by the liberal watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. The complaint alleged Gingrich commingled campaign funds with corporate money in a company operated by him and his wife, Callista. FEC investigators found reason to believe a violation had been committed, but the FEC commissioners divided on ideological lines in a 3-3 vote on whether to sanction Gingrich’s committee. They did state that for Gingrich to terminate the committee, he would have to go through the official debt settlement plan procedures.Gingrich has not responded to requests left with staffers of his production company, Gingrich Productions.

It is expected to be available in the next several weeks.“We understand the deep frustration and concerns associated with the cost of EpiPen to the patient, and have always shared the public’s desire to ensure that this important product be accessible to anyone who needs it,” Mylan CEO Heather Bresch said in a statement.The price hike for the EpiPen prompted an outcry from consumers and became a hot topic in the presidential race. The company initially responded to the pushback by offering to reduce out-of-pocket costs for some patients. In 2009, the product had a $100 price tag, USA Today reported. Since then, Mylan executives have enjoyed major increases in compensation.Bresch has defended EpiPen’s high price, saying Mylan had spent hundreds of millions of dollars improving the product, including making the needle invisible, since acquiring it from Germany’s Merck KGaA.Mylan has said that it recoups less than half of EpiPen’s list price because pharmacy benefit managers, which often require discounted prices or rebates from drugmakers, are involved, along with insurers and others.“Our decision to launch a generic alternative to EpiPen is an extraordinary commercial response,” Bresch said on Monday. “We determined that bypassing the brand system in this case and offering an additional alternative was the best option.”The FDA rejected Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corp’s rival treatment in June and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd’s generic version earlier this year. Sanofi SA pulled its device from the market last year on concerns of inaccurate dosage.Netherlands-based Mylan said on Monday it also intends to continue to market and distribute branded EpiPen.Reuters contributed to this report."

It was during those hours that the shooting occurred, police said.Darwin Sorrells was sentenced to six years in prison in 2013 on a gun charge but was “let out early,” police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said on Twitter on Sunday.NATIONAL ATTENTIONIn a city with as many as 90 shootings a week, homicides in Chicago this year are on track to reach their highest since 1997, raising concern about a reversal in the declining rate of serious crime in the country’s largest cities in recent years.Aldridge’s death has drawn national attention because of the connection to Wade, a 12-time National Basketball Association All-Star who signed a two-year, $47.5 million deal this summer to play for his hometown team, the Chicago Bulls.“This tragedy isn’t just noteworthy because Ms Aldridge has a famous family member,” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson told reporters on Sunday. “It’s noteworthy because these two offenders are the prime example of a challenge we have in Chicago of repeat offenders who ... clearly don’t face the consequences of their actions.”On Saturday Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said in a campaign speech that the shooting illustrated why black voters would rally behind him, calling it an example of violence that Democrats have failed to address.Earlier Trump was criticized for politicizing the killing, and for spelling the NBA player’s name wrong, when he sent a Twitter message that read:“Dwayne Wade’s cousin was just shot and killed walking her baby in Chicago. Just what I have been saying. African-Americans will VOTE TRUMP!”Sen. Tim Kaine, who is running for vice president on the Democratic ticket with Hillary Clinton, suggested the remarks were inappropriate when asked about them.“We ought to be extending our sympathy to the family ― that’s the only reaction that is appropriate right now, and maybe a sadness about this gun violence issue, which we know is complicated,” Kaine said.Hours after his initial message, Trump followed up with a Tweet that offered condolences to Wade’s family.When asked about Trump’s remarks, Johnson said: “If you have a magic bullet to stop the violence, not only in Chicago but anywhere in the country, please share it with us.”(Reporting by Chris Prentice, Jonathan Allen and Frank McGurty in New York; Editing by Alan Crosby and Andrea Ricci)"
27,BLACK VOICES,How Donald Trump Appeals To Bigots By Pandering To Black Voters,Zeba Blay,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-donald-trump-appeals-to-bigots-by-pandering-to-black-voters_us_57c443dae4b026734450f141,Trump's approach to African-Americans just reinforces racist stereotypes.,2016-08-29,The factually incorrect picture retweeted by Trump. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c456f5180000dd10bcdc77.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Friday, NBA player Dwyane Wade’s cousin, 32-year-old Nykea Aldridge, was tragically shot and killed by crossfire in a Chicago shooting. Within hours of her death, surely before her friends and family (including four children) even had the chance to process her death, Donald Trump decided to make the tragedy about himself.He tweeted: The tweet was heartless, opportunistic, and yet another example of Trump pandering to black voters by insulting them, ignoring the issues they truly care about, and playing into racist ideas about the black community. These are ideas that, in actuality, appeal to a subset of his white, anti-black supporters. Trump has earned criticism in recent weeks for the way he has been courting African-Americans. The problem, of course, is that so much of the rhetoric Trump has used to appeal to black voters is steeped in stereotypes and generalizations about black people. That’s how a lot of political pandering works, of course ― Hillary Clinton hitting the Nae Nae and posting blogs about how she’s like every Latino’s abuela is a prime example of that. Clinton’s pandering may be obnoxious to some, but Trump’s is just downright dangerous. He draws on generalizations steeped in racist ideology ― generalizations designed specifically to avoid actually addressing perhaps the most important issues facing black people at the moment: racism and police brutality. In a speech at a Michigan rally on Aug. 20, Trump tried to entice black people to vote for him by painting a dire, desperate picture of black life that implicated no one but black people themselves. “What do you have to lose?” Trump asked. “You live in your poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58 percent of your youth is unemployed. What the hell do you have to lose?”On Monday, he tweeted the following:It’s true that community violence, poverty, unemployment, and subpar education are issues that plague members of the black community, although Trump has a tendency to paint broad pictures without getting his numbers right. Inner-city crime, for instance: inner-city crime is not at “record levels.” Trump’s preoccupation with black-on-black violence is telling of his complete ignorance of racism’s lethal impact across the country. At this point, Trump’s complete avoidance of the topic of police brutality is ridiculous. When he does address it, he addresses it only tangentially, focusing mostly on the shootings of police officers (which are of course important to acknowledge). He completely glosses over the unjust deaths of black men and women as a result of police violence. When he does talk about violence against black people, it’s always in regards to black-on-black crime. In November 2015, Trump retweeted an image with (false) statistics on so-called black-on-black crime vs. police shootings of black people. The original image has since been deleted, though a screencap taken by The Washington Post reveals a graphic of a dark skinned man with a bandana on his head, pointing a gun, with statistics that claim “97 percent” of black people were killed by black people in 2015, and only “16 percent” of white people were killed by other white people. It was later revealed that the statistics were completely false ― 82 percent of white people were killed by other white people in 2014, according to the FBI. But the truth of the fake statistics didn’t actually matter ― what mattered to Trump, and to many of those who bring up black-on-black crime is the picture it paints of black people in America. The black lives taken by black lives are inconsequential to Trump. All they serve to do is deflect from a larger conversation of police brutality. Which brings us back to Trump’s tweet. Two-hundred-and-thirty-nine empty characters inexplicably linking Nykea Aldridge’s death to why black people will vote for him. The tweet, totally dismissing Aldridge’s humanity, is really all about pushing the narrative of black people shooting black people as the only problem within the black community. Some people have suggested that Trump isn’t actually courting black voters. Surely, he realizes that there’s little chance that he’ll earn a meaningful portion of the black vote. Instead, as Domenico Montanaro argued recently on NPR, he’s reaching out to black people in order to better appeal to “whites with college degrees [who] don’t want to feel like they are voting for somebody who’s seen as a bigot or a racist.” But there’s something else at play here. Because Trump is also appealing to white voters who may not care if he’s seen as a bigot or racist, in addition to voters who themselves have views that may be considered bigoted or racist. By framing the “black problem” as one that reinforces every stereotype about black people (lazy, violent, uneducated), he’s also letting these kinds of voters know that he has no intention of actually engaging with the Black Lives Matter movement, or the conversation surrounding police brutality.It’s a win-win for him, but black people lose regardless."

The vast majority of parents in the United States clearly do as well, as evidenced by national vaccination rates that have remained relatively stable ― and high. Yet according to a new study published in the journal Pediatrics on Monday, pediatricians say they’ve seen a shift in parents’ concerns about childhood vaccines in the past decade ― and not necessarily a good one. Doctors report that they’re seeing more caregivers who are looking to delay vaccines, or refusing them altogether, suggesting the anti-vaccination movement may still have legs.The researchers compared surveys of random samples of practicing pediatricians administered in 2006 and 2013. Both years, roughly 600 doctors responded.The 2006 survey did not ask about vaccine delays, so the researchers were unable to track trends overtime. However, the 2013 survey found that nearly 88 percent of pediatricians had been asked by parents to hold off on at least one vaccine within the last year. Most parents were worried about their child’s discomfort, or believed the vaccines would be too much for their immune system all at once, pediatricians reported. There's sufficient evidence, however, that delays can be harmful and vaccines do not “overload” the immune system, as they contain only a fraction of the antigens (substances like viruses, bacteria, chemicals or pollen, for example) that children encounter every single day. In the 2006 survey, nearly 75 percent of pediatricians said they’d seen parents who’d refused at least one vaccine in the past year. By 2013, however, that had grown to 87 percent. In that time, the reasons why parents refused changed, pediatricians said, and a growing number of parents seem to feel vaccines are simply unnecessary. “The concern that vaccines are necessary [being given] as a reason for refusal increased significantly from 63 percent [in 2006] to 73 percent [in 2013], which I found very interesting,” said study author and pediatrician Dr. Catherine Hough-Telford, with the University of Alabama, Birmingham. “Most of the parents making the decisions about vaccines for their children have no first-hand knowledge of children getting sick and dying from measles, from congenital rubella, even pertussis,” Hough-Telford continued. “Even a generation ago, these bacteria and viruses were killing babies and children.” Whopping cough, for example, was one of the most common childhood diseases in the U.S. in the 20th century and a major cause of childhood mortality. And in the 1950s -- a decade or so before a vaccine for measles was available -- between 3 and 4 million people were infected with that infectious disease every year. The new survey was administered before the well-publicized 2015 measles outbreak linked to an amusement park in California, Hough-Telford noted, adding that it would be interesting to see if parents’ feelings have changed since then. The number of parents who refused vaccines because of fears about autism did appear to drop between the two surveys; however, it is clearly still a force. In 2006, 74 percent of pediatricians cited it as a reason why parents refused vaccines. In 2013, 64 percent did.But rather than finding these overall trends troubling, Hough-Telford said she felt optimistic. Now that pediatricians have a clearer sense of parental concerns, they can work harder on education.“It’s an opportunity for us, as clinicians, to help parents understand these vaccines and the diseases they prevent,” she said. “While it’s definitely something to take notice of, I think we should see it as an opportunity for change.”Here’s hoping."
