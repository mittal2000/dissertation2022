Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) continued his attacks against real estate mogul Donald Trump on Sunday, criticizing Trump's suggestion that in going after Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, her husband's extramarital affairs are ""fair game.""""We have got more important things to worry about in this country than Bill Clinton's sex life,"" Sanders said on CNN's ""State of the Union.""On the campaign trail, Trump frequently brings up the former president's infidelities in the 1990s to counter Hillary Clinton calling out his sexism.""You look at whether it's Monica Lewinsky or Paula Jones or many of them. That certainly will be fair game. Certainly if they play the woman's card with respect to me, that will be fair game,"" the GOP candidate said last week.Sanders, who often chides Trump for diverting attention away from substantive policy issues, strongly disagreed that the former president's personal life is relevant to Hillary Clinton's campaign.""I think that Donald Trump might want to concern himself with the fact that he's dead wrong when he says we should not raise the minimum wage, he's dead wrong when he says that wages in America are too high, he's dead wrong when he thinks we should give huge tax breaks to billionaires like himself, and he's dead wrong when he thinks that climate change is a hoax, when the entire -- virtually an entire scientific community thinks it's the great environmental crisis that we face,"" Sanders said.""Maybe Trump should worry about those issues, rather than Bill Clinton's sex life.""Host Dana Bash was amused by Sanders' response. ""Only Bernie Sanders can segue from Bill Clinton's sex life to climate change. That was impressive,"" she said.Also appearing on CNN, GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina was forced to clarify her previous statements suggesting she sided with Trump's tactics.""Listen, I said Bill Clinton is fair game. I also then very promptly said going after Bill Clinton is not going to defeat Hillary Clinton,"" she said. ""The way to defeat Hillary Clinton is to go after her track record, her lack of accomplishment.""Fiorina argued that as a former president, Bill Clinton can be targeted, citing Trump's recent criticisms of former President George W. Bush.""Any former president is fair game. The question is, how do you beat Hillary Clinton? And, in my opinion, that's not the way to beat Hillary Clinton."" Also on HuffPost:"
1,POLITICS,Chris Christie Calls Obama 'A Petulant Child' For Executive Action On Guns,Marina Fang,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chris-christie-obama-guns_us_56897783e4b0b958f65bf1ef,The 2016 GOP presidential hopeful has faced criticism for flip-flopping on gun laws.,2016-01-03,1981: The Attempted Assassination Of President Ronald Reagan,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587a8abe1200002d00ad7981.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) on Sunday called President Barack Obama ""a petulant child"" for using executive action to curb gun violence.""The American people have rejected his agenda by turning both the House and the Senate over to the Republicans, and going from 21 governors when he came into office, to 31 Republican governors now. Now this president wants to act as if he is a king, as if he is a dictator,"" Christie told Fox News' Chris Wallace.Amid several mass shootings in recent months, Obama is preparing to take executive action to expand background checks, according to White House officials. On Sunday, CNN announced that Obama would participate in a live town hall on the issue, which will air on the network on Thursday.In response, Christie warned that whatever measures Obama proposes ""will be rejected by the courts"" and pledged that if he were elected president, he would take executive action to reverse Obama's move.The 2016 GOP presidential hopeful has come under scrutiny for walking a fine line on gun laws. As governor of a relatively liberal state, he authorized stricter gun regulations -- in 2013, he signed 10 gun control measures into law and said that gun control could help prevent gun violence. Earlier in his career, he supported an assault weapons ban.But now, Christie has largely renounced his previous stance and this year took measures to loosen gun laws in New Jersey. He vetoed several gun control bills, such as a bill that would issue IDs for gun owners and a bill that would restrict guns for people convicted of domestic violence. He also pardoned violators of the state's gun transport laws. Critics have suggested that he reversed his position for political reasons. Pressed by Wallace on Sunday, Christie claimed that he was making ""decisions that are in the best interests of the people of New Jersey.""""The approach I’m going to take is to protect Second Amendment rights but make sure I make decisions that are in the best interests of the people of New Jersey,"" he said. ""I think that's what the people of the United States want. That's the kind of president I’m going to be.""Christie has ramped up his campaign in New Hampshire, where guns are a major political issue. While he continues to trail his opponents in national polling, he is gaining ground in the Granite State, which will hold the first GOP primary on Feb. 9.Also on HuffPost:"

Plans developed quickly and organically, driven in part by what Allen characterized as a spirit of camaraderie in the tight-knight newsroom but also a sense of duty to the Globe’s readers.""It was hard to listen to people saying they were subscribers for 30 years and were not getting their paper,” Allen said. ""We felt really bad about that.”Come delivery time on Sunday, the Globe staffers’ commitment apparently paid off.""One of the reporters said they were delivering to an elderly housing complex,” Allen said, noting the Sunday paper deliveries took place overnight and in the early morning hours. “Reporters said as soon as people heard the paper thump down on the door, they picked it up. They were waiting for it.” Armed with flashlights ahead of sunrise, they scoured the streets looking for address numbers -- making Allen fear customers would think they were burglars.Instead, some of the very bylines printed throughout the paper appeared at its readers' doorsteps, including metro reporter Milton Valencia, whose name graced the front page.Though readers didn't know when their paper would arrive, or by whom, they didn't hide their eagerness on social media.""Should I leave out cookies and milk for whatever reporter is delivering my @BostonGlobe tomorrow, a la Santa? Much love to folks stepping up,"" tweeted Katie Lannan.""How much extra is it to request a particular @BostonGlobe reporter to deliver my paper tomorrow?"" tweeted Daniel Guzman.""@GlobeKPD I can see the future: How would you like to have the @BostonGlobe Reporter read their column to you in person over breakfast?"" @DrJeffLo tweeted to senior sports reporter Kevin Paul Dupont. In an endearing 20-second video tweeted by reporter David Abel, Sunday Editor Mark Morrow hand delivers a paper to an excited elderly woman at her front door.""Are you really?"" she exclaims when Morrow is introduced to her.Other reporters tweeted out photos of signs left at doorsteps for them. ""To whoever deliver our paper: Thank you!"" one handmade note read. Another enthusiastic reader shared his doorstep sign reading: ""Welcome to #NewtonMA Globe Reporters!""The decision to use a volunteer delivery staff followed the Globe's switch to delivery vendor ACI Media Group, the paper reported.Globe CEO Mike Sheehan, in an interview with the paper last week, said that 95 percent of home delivery subscribers received their papers Wednesday but that 5 percent were missed.In a note included with subscribers' papers on Sunday they noted that delivery by editorial staff ""is clearly not a long-term solution -- but we hope you can be patient as our top administrators sort things out.""Also on HuffPost:"

A prosecutor said 40 people were held.Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, criticized Saudi Arabia for the second straight day over Nimr's execution.""The unjustly spilled blood of this oppressed martyr will no doubt soon show its effect and divine vengeance will befall Saudi politicians,"" state TV quoted Khamenei as saying.Iran's Revolutionary Guards had promised ""harsh revenge"" against the Saudi Sunni royal dynasty for the execution of Nimr, considered a terrorist by Riyadh but hailed in Iran as a hero of the rights of Saudi Arabia's marginalized Shi'ite minority.Nimr, the most vocal critic of the dynasty among the Shi'ite minority, had come to be seen as a leader of the sect's younger activists, who had tired of the failure of older, more measured leaders to achieve equality with Sunnis.His execution sparked angry protests in the Qatif region in eastern Saudi Arabia, where demonstrators denounced the ruling Al Saud dynasty, and in the nearby Gulf kingdom of Bahrain.Relatives of Nimr, reached by telephone, said authorities have informed them that the body had been buried ""in a cemetery of Muslims"" and would not be handed over to the family.Although most of the 47 men killed in the kingdom's biggest mass execution for decades were Sunnis convicted of al Qaeda attacks in Saudi Arabia a decade ago, it was Nimr and three other Shi'ites, all accused of involvement in shooting police, who attracted most attention in the region and beyond.The move appeared to end any hopes that the appearance of a common enemy in the form of the Islamic State militant force would produce some rapprochement between the region's leading Sunni and Shi'ite Muslim powers, allied to opposing sides in wars currently raging in Syria and Yemen.Khamenei's website carried a picture of a Saudi executioner next to notorious Islamic State executioner 'Jihadi John', with the caption ""Any differences?"". The Revolutionary Guards said ""harsh revenge"" would topple ""this pro-terrorist, anti-Islamic regime.""Saudi Arabia on Saturday summoned the Iranian ambassador to protest what it described as hostile remarks emerging from Tehran. On Sunday, the United Arab Emirates, a key ally of Saudi Arabia, also summoned the Iranian ambassador and handed him an official letter of protest, state news agency said.IRAQ ALSO FURIOUSIn Iraq, whose Shi'ite-led government is close to Iran, religious and political figures demanded that ties with Riyadh be severed, calling into question Saudi attempts to forge a regional alliance against Islamic State, which controls swaths of Iraq and Syria.Iraq's top Shi'ite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani described the executions as an ""unjust aggression."" The opinion of Sistani, based in the Shi'ite holy city of Najaf south of Baghdad, carries weight with millions of Shi'ites in Iraq and across the region, including in Saudi Arabia.Despite the focus on Nimr, the executions seemed mostly aimed at discouraging jihadism in Saudi Arabia, where dozens have died in the past year in attacks by Sunni militants.The ruling Al Saud family has grown increasingly worried as Middle East turmoil, especially in Syria and Iraq, has boosted Sunni jihadists seeking to bring it down and given room to Iran to spread its influence.But Saudi Arabia's Western allies, many of whom supply it with arms, are growing concerned about its new assertiveness.The U.S. State Department said Nimr's execution ""risks exacerbating sectarian tensions at a time when they urgently need to be reduced,"" a sentiment echoed by EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini. The State Department also urged Saudi Arabia to respect and protect human rights.UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad al-Hussein said it was not clear those killed were granted effective legal defense, while the scale of the executions was very disturbing ""particularly as some of those sentenced to death were accused of non-violent crimes.""The execution of 47 people - 45 Saudis, one Egyptian and a man from Chad - was the biggest mass execution for security offenses in Saudi Arabia since the 1980 killing of 63 jihadist rebels who seized Mecca's Grand Mosque in 1979.The four Shi'ites had been convicted of involvement in shootings and petrol bomb attacks that killed several police during anti-government protests from 2011-13. More than 20 Shi'ites were shot dead by the authorities in those protests.Family members of the executed Shi'ites have denied they were involved in attacks and said they were only peaceful protesters against sectarian discrimination.Human rights groups say the kingdom's judicial process is unfair, pointing to accusations that confessions have been secured under torture and that defendants in court have been denied access to lawyers.

A prosecutor said 40 people were held.""The unjustly spilled blood of this oppressed martyr will no doubt soon show its effect and divine vengeance will befall Saudi politicians,"" Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was quoted as saying by Iran's state television.PROTESTSNimr, the most vocal critic of the dynasty among the Shi'ite minority, had come to be seen as a leader of the sect's younger activists, who had tired of the failure of older, more measured, leaders to achieve equality with Sunnis.His execution, along with three other Shi'ites and 43 members of Al Qaeda, sparked angry protests in the Qatif region in eastern Saudi Arabia, where demonstrators denounced the ruling Al Saud dynasty, and in the nearby Gulf kingdom of Bahrain.Relatives of Nimr, reached by telephone, said authorities had informed them that the body had been buried ""in a cemetery of Muslims"" and would not be handed over to the family.Although most of the 47 men killed in the kingdom's biggest mass execution for decades were Sunnis convicted of al Qaeda attacks in Saudi Arabia a decade ago, it was Nimr and three other Shi'ites, all accused of involvement in shooting police, who attracted most attention in the region and beyond.Khamenei's website carried a picture of a Saudi executioner next to notorious Islamic State executioner 'Jihadi John', with the caption ""Any differences?"". The Revolutionary Guards said ""harsh revenge"" would topple ""this pro-terrorist, anti-Islamic regime.""Saudi Arabia on Saturday summoned the Iranian ambassador to protest what it described as hostile remarks emerging from Tehran. On Sunday, Riyadh's Gulf allies the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Bahrain also summoned Tehran's envoys to their countries to lodge complaints.IRAQ ALSO FURIOUSIn Iraq, whose Shi'ite-led government is close to Iran, religious and political figures demanded that ties with Riyadh be severed, calling into question Saudi attempts to forge a regional alliance against Islamic State, which controls swaths of Iraq and Syria.Iraq's top Shi'ite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani described the executions as an ""unjust aggression."" The opinion of Sistani, based in the Shi'ite holy city of Najaf south of Baghdad, carries weight with millions of Shi'ites in Iraq and across the region, including in Saudi Arabia.Despite the focus on Nimr, the executions seemed mostly aimed at discouraging jihadism in Saudi Arabia, where dozens have died in the past year in attacks by Sunni militants.But Saudi Arabia's Western allies, many of whom supply it with arms, are growing concerned about its new assertiveness.The U.S. State Department said Nimr's execution ""risks exacerbating sectarian tensions at a time when they urgently need to be reduced,"" a sentiment echoed by EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini. The State Department also urged Saudi Arabia to respect and protect human rights.France said on Sunday it deeply deplored the mass execution and said it reiterated its opposition to the death penalty in all circumstances.In Istanbul, hundreds of protesters, some carrying pictures of Nimr and chanting ""Saudi Arabia will pay the price,"" gathered outside its consulate on Sunday as riot police stood guard.The four Shi'ites had been convicted of involvement in shootings and petrol bomb attacks that killed several police during anti-government protests from 2011-13. More than 20 Shi'ites were shot dead by the authorities in those protests.Family members of the executed Shi'ites have denied they were involved in attacks and said they were only peaceful protesters against sectarian discrimination.Human rights groups say the kingdom's judicial process is unfair, pointing to accusations that confessions have been secured under torture and that defendants in court have been denied access to lawyers. Riyadh denies torture and says its judiciary is independent.(Additional reporting by Sami Aboudi, Sam Wilkin, Noah Browning, Omar Fahmy, Katie Paul, Dubai newsroom, Michel Rose in Paris, Stephen Kalin in Baghdad, Laila Bassam in Beirut, Hamdi Istanbullu in Istanbul, Parisa Hafezi in Ankara and Jeff Mason in Washington; Writing by Kevin Liffey; Editing by Richard Balmforth)Also on HuffPost:"

The 47 people executed on terrorism charges Saturday included prominent Shiite dissident cleric Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, a vocal critic of Saudi Arabia’s treatment of the Shiite minority. Iranian officials condemned Nimr’s execution and protesters in Tehran ransacked the Saudi embassy there. Analysts warned the execution threatened to inflame sectarian tensions in the Middle East. But 2016 Republican candidate Carly Fiorina dismissed Iran’s reaction to the death of the leading anti-government protester.“I take the Iranian condemnation with a huge grain of salt,” Fiorina told CNN’s ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. “This is a regime that tortures citizens routinely, that thinks nothing of executions, that still holds four Americans in jail.” “Saudi Arabia is our ally, despite the fact that they don’t always behave in a way that we condone,” Fiorina continued, in her only reference to Riyadh’s mass executions. “Iran is a real and present threat.” Retired neurosurgeon and presidential hopeful Ben Carson went further, suggesting that the nuclear deal struck last July between Iran, the U.S. and five world powers pushed Saudi Arabia to violently repress its Shiite population. “The Saudis have been one of our strongest allies in the Middle East, and I think it’s unfortunate that we put them in the position we have by showing the support to Iran that we have with this foolish deal,” Carson told ABC’s “This Week."" “There’s no reason for the Saudis to believe that we’re really on their side when we do things like that.”When pushed to specifically address Riyadh’s mass executions, Carson added a disclaimer but stuck to his previous notion that American support of the nuclear deal is partly to blame: “Of course we don’t condone that kind of thing. But I’m just saying we need to stop doing silly things that promote these kinds of activities.”In 2015, Saudi Arabia executed 158 people, making it the kingdom’s deadliest year on death row since 1995. With 47 people killed just two days into the new year, 2016 is on track to overtake that record. Saudi Arabia justifies the executions as part of its strict interpretation of Islamic law, also called Sharia law. Punishing government protesters with death while citing Sharia law has led some, including The New York Times editorial board, to compare the kingdom’s judicial system to that of the self-proclaimed Islamic State. Unlike the Islamic State group, Saudi Arabia enjoys international legitimacy despite its atrocious human rights record. It currently sits on the United Nations Human Rights Council and, as Fiorina and Carson noted, is a key U.S. ally in the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Because of this, even the U.S. State Department balked at condemning the Saudi executions, only voicing “concerns” over the practice. “We have previously expressed our concerns about the legal process in Saudi Arabia and have frequently raised these concerns at high levels of the Saudi Government,” State Department spokesman John Kirby wrote in a statement on Saturday. “We reaffirm our calls on the Government of Saudi Arabia to respect and protect human rights, and to ensure fair and transparent judicial proceedings in all cases.”"

The men now occupying the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge building include at least two sons of Cliven Bundy, the rancher whose legal battle with the government over grazing rights culminated in an armed standoff with federal authorities near Bunkerville, Nevada, in 2014. ""We’re planning on staying here for several years,"" Ammon Bundy said in a video posted to Facebook Saturday. ""We’re calling people to come out here and stand…. We have a place for you to stay warm. We have food planned and prepared. We need you to bring your arms. And we need you to come to the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge."" His brother Ryan Bundy told The Oregonian's Ian Kullgren the militiamen are ""willing to kill and be killed if necessary,"" Kullgren tweeted Saturday.The Bundys and other militia members have gathered in Burns in recent weeks to protest the return to prison of Dwight Hammond Jr. and his son Steven, two local ranchers who were convicted in 2012 of arson, imprisoned, released and given new, harsher sentences last year. But there's no evidence the Hammonds are involved in the occupation of the federal building, and they told The Oregonian through their attorneys on Sunday that they plan to return to prison on Monday as ordered. ""Neither Ammon Bundy nor anyone within his group/organization speak for the Hammond Family,"" W. Alan Schroeder, a lawyer for the family, wrote to Burns Sheriff David Ward, CBS News reported Sunday. Nor does the local community support the militia's actions. ""The majority of Burns does not want him here,"" Sarah Spurlock, a Burns resident who interviewed Ammon Bundy on Saturday, told The Huffington Post via Facebook message. ""There are a handful that do, but they are few compared to those that don't."" At a community meeting Friday night, Burns residents told militia members who had traveled there to support the Hammonds they worried confrontation with the government could lead to violence. ""We are not coming into your town to shoot it up,"" Brandon Curtiss, an Idaho militia leader, promised, according to The Oregonian's Les Zaitz. ""We won't fire anything unless we're fired upon."" Curtiss told The Oregonian Sunday he ""knew nothing"" about the occupation of the federal facility.In recent statements, the Bundys have de-emphasized the Hammonds, instead focusing on their plan to restore eastern Oregon's economy by forcing the federal government to hand over federal lands to local ranchers, miners and loggers.The federal lands that the Bundys and their compatriots argue should be ""returned"" to the local, overwhelmingly white population were once part of a reservation established by President Ulysses S. Grant for the Northern Paiute, an American Indian tribe. The Northern Paiute still live on a now much-smaller reservation north of Burns.This most recent incident is only the latest confrontation between the federal government and the militia movement, which gained popularity among conservative ideologues in the aftermath of the 1992 Ruby Ridge incident and the 1993 Waco siege, two of the most infamous and deadly standoffs involving federal agents in U.S. history. During the tense Ruby Ridge standoff in northern Idaho, three people died, including a deputy U.S. marshal, as authorities attempted to apprehend a white separatist for failing to appear in court for selling illegal sawed-off shotguns. In Waco, Texas, 76 people died during a 51-day siege after federal officials stormed a fortified religious compound led by David Koresh and his group of Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists in an attempt to apprehend Koresh for stockpiling weapons. Both incidents prompted congressional inquiries into use of force by federal officials.Who's occupying the building?We don't know much about who's occupying the building. The Bundys initially claimed they had around 150 people there, but a reporter who managed to get close spotted about a dozen. Videos from the scene have depicted Ammon Bundy. Ryan Bundy has spoken to reporters about the occupation. Militia leader Blaine Cooper and Ryan Payne, an Iraq war vet, are both involved in the occupation, according to The Oregonian. Both men have said they were involved in the 2014 Bundy ranch standoff. Last year, the Missoula Independent published an extensive profile of Payne.Jon Ritzheimer, another militia member, posted a video to YouTube calling people to come to Burns and ""take a stand.""""I am 100 percent willing to lay my life down to defend against tyranny in this country,"" Ritzheimer said. ""We need real men here... Americans who have the intestinal fortitude to come here and take a stand and say enough is enough…. To my family, just know that I stood for something. Don't let it be in vain. I love you.""How are local, state, and federal authorities responding?The building the gunmen seized is closed for the holiday weekend. So far, law enforcement is staying away. One Oregon State Police car was spotted idling outside Burns, according to Oregon Public Broadcasting. An FBI spokeswoman told HuffPost the agency was aware of the situation. A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spokesperson told CNN that federal officials, including the Bureau of Land Management, are monitoring the situation.What happened at the Bundy ranch?Ammon and Ryan Bundy’s father, Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, held his own standoff with federal officials in April 2014 after refusing to pay cattle grazing fees to the Bureau of Land Management. Bundy was joined on his ranch by hundreds of protesters, some of whom were armed militia members, and the incident drew national media attention. Several Republican lawmakers and conservative radio and television talk show hosts rallied to Bundy’s cause. Bundy was widely condemned, however, after he made controversial comments on live television about “the Negro” and that African-Americans might have been “better off as slaves.” As for the land dispute, BLM officials eventually backed down, allowing Bundy’s cattle to graze on federal lands.What's all this about arson?The Bundys and their allies are upset because Steven and Dwight Hammond, two ranchers who live near Burns, are supposed to head back to prison on Monday. In 2012, a jury convicted the Hammonds of arson for setting fires on federal land in what witnesses testified was an attempt to cover up an illegal deer slaughter. Prosecutors said the government spent $600,000 fighting the blazes. A federal judge initially sentenced the Hammonds to short prison terms. But the government appealed the sentences, arguing that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 required the Hammonds serve mandatory minimum sentences of 5 years. The feds won, and last year, a second federal judge ordered the Hammonds to return to prison on January 4, 2016. The Bundys and other militia figures have called the Hammonds' sentences unjust.Who can I follow on Twitter to learn more?The hashtags to follow are #OregonUnderAttack and #OregonStandoff.

14,TRAVEL,What TSA's New Scanner Rules Mean For Your Next Flight,"Christopher Elliott, ContributorAuthor, How to Be the World's Smartest Traveler (and Save Time...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-do-the-tsas-new-scan_b_8907774.html,The Transportation Security Administration's new rules for screening passengers with its controversial full-body scanners -- which were quietly changed just before the busy holiday travel season -- represent a significant policy reversal that could affect your next flight.,2016-01-03,2016-01-03-1451845601-8804807-shutterstock_27964433.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-01-03-1451845601-8804807-shutterstock_27964433-thumb.jpg,"The Transportation Security Administration's new rules for screening passengers with its controversial full-body scanners -- which were quietly changed just before the busy holiday travel season -- represent a significant policy reversal that could affect your next flight.Getting checked by the TSA's advanced-imaging technology used to be entirely optional, allowing those who refused a scan to be subjected to a pat-down. In fact, many observers thought the agency installed the 740 body scanners in 160 airports with an understanding that no one would be forced to use them, ever.But on a Friday in late December, the TSA revised its rules, saying an ""opt out"" is no longer an option for certain passengers. (The full document can be found on the Department of Homeland Security's website.) The decision drew mixed reaction from experts and raised concerns from passengers. The biggest: Will I get pushed through one of these scanners before I board my next flight?Related: Frequently asked questions about the TSA.""Most people will be able to opt out,"" says Bruce Anderson, a TSA spokesman. ""Some passengers will be required to undergo advanced-imaging screening if their boarding pass indicates that they have been selected for enhanced screening, in accordance with TSA regulations, prior to their arrival at the security checkpoint. This will occur in a very limited number of circumstances.""To some, the change appeared to be timed to ensure a muted public response. It escaped the traveling public's notice until almost a week later, which happened to be Christmas Eve. Anderson says the TSA wasn't waiting for a slow news day. ""The revision to this policy was designed to provide TSA with the flexibility necessary to address immediate security concerns,"" he says. Either way, barring a major outcry, the new opt-out rules are likely to stick. But it's still too early to tell how the TSA plans to implement its new protocol or how the vague guidelines could affect your spring break or summer flights. That, say TSA observers, is cause for concern.Passenger advocates object to the full-body scanners on many levels. The pricey machines, they say, were deployed without giving the public a chance to comment, a process required by federal law. They also say the devices violate the Fourth Amendment right to protection from unreasonable searches and seizures. Also, the scanners have not been adequately tested and may present health risks, some claim.Critics say the technology is easily foiled and ultimately ineffective at identifying threats, citing an audit in which the TSA failed to catch weapons 67 of 70 times. To date, the scanners have not thwarted a single attempted terrorist attack, these agency-watchers correctly point out. What's more, the agency has broken a promise it made to passengers and legislators when it began installing the scanners in 2009.""The TSA is going back on its word,"" says Fred Cate, a law professor at Indiana University and prominent TSA-watcher. ""The scanners were sold to Congress and the public on the promise that they were optional, but for at least some people, that is no longer the case.""Marc Rotenberg, the executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, which filed the original lawsuit to suspend deployment of the devices, says the new policy represents an important reversal. In previous court filings, the agency offered written assurance that the scanners were optional. Based on the agency's statements, a federal appeals court affirmed the legality of using the full-body scanners as long as fliers were given a choice.""The TSA lacks the legal authority to compel travelers to go through the body scanners,"" Rotenberg says.Despite the concerns, the new scanning rules may improve security, says Stephen Lloyd, a former safety director for the Federal Aviation Administration who now runs an aerospace consulting firm in the Washington region. ""This recent change was implemented, I'm sure, based on security threat assessments and the need to use scanners when security conditions dictate, to protect the public,"" he says.Anthony Roman, a counterterrorism expert in Lynbrook, N.Y., concurs. ""I believe it is one of the best initiatives taken by TSA in recent memory,"" Roman says. ""Surprise is the key element of this initiative. It creates a randomness and unpredictability regarding who will be scanned and who will not be scanned."" That randomness, for fliers screened in the future, can prevent a terrorist attack, he adds.Some fliers are skeptical and upset about the change. Karen Pliskin, an anthropologist from Oakland, Calif., opts out of the scanners and plans to continue doing so. She objects to the advanced-imaging technology for several reasons, chief among them her fear that they may emit harmful radiation.""I had a small skin cancer removed, and I don't do anything that could potentially exacerbate a recurrence,"" she says. ""No matter that the TSA says that their scanners are foolproof; only a fool would say that something is foolproof.""Anderson says they are safe: ""The radio-frequency emissions from these systems are well below the safety limits established by national health and safety standards for the general public.""Stephen Costanzo, who runs an education company in St. Petersburg, Fla., says he's not bothered by the new rules. He interprets the new guidelines to mean that only passengers with screening anomalies will have to use the scanner. ""In other words, when a person, for whatever reason, has already failed multiple checks, a full-body scan can be required in order to identify with more accuracy whether that traveler poses a potential security threat,"" he says.""Clearly, there is still room for abuse,"" he adds. ""But there always has been, and these new guidelines do not change that.""For now, the TSA's new rules mean you might not be able to say ""no"" to its full-body scanners on your next flight. If you do, you won't be allowed into the boarding area. (Time is running out for the TSA; its scanners are expected to start reaching the end of their useful life in two years, and it's unlikely they'll be replaced.) Down the road, it's unclear whether the TSA's rules will change yet again, perhaps mandating that an opt out is no longer an option at all.But we know when such a policy change is likely to be announced. Look for it on a Friday just before the next major travel holiday.After you've left a comment here, let's continue the discussion on my consumer advocacy site or on Twitter, Facebook and Google.

Let me put as directly as I can.America has succumbed to a vicious cycle in which great wealth translates into political power, which generates even more wealth, and even more power.This spiral is most apparent in declining tax rates on corporations and on top personal incomes (much in the form of wider tax loopholes), along with a profusion of government bailouts and subsidies (to Wall Street bankers, hedge-fund partners, oil companies, casino tycoons, and giant agribusiness owners, among others).The vicious cycle of wealth and power is less apparent, but even more significant, in economic rules that now favor the wealthy.Billionaires like Donald Trump can use bankruptcy to escape debts but average people can't get relief from burdensome mortgage or student debt payments.Giant corporations can amass market power without facing antitrust lawsuits (think Internet cable companies, Monsanto, Big Pharma, consolidations of health insurers and of health care corporations, Dow and DuPont, and the growing dominance of Amazon, Apple, and Google, for example). But average workers have lost the market power that came from joining together in unions.It's now easier for Wall Street insiders to profit from confidential information unavailable to small investors.It's also easier for giant firms to extend the length of patents and copyrights, thereby pushing up prices on everything from pharmaceuticals to Walt Disney merchandise. And easier for big corporations to wrangle trade treaties that protect their foreign assets but not the jobs or incomes of American workers. It's easier for giant military contractors to secure huge appropriations for unnecessary weapons, and to keep the war machine going.The result of this vicious cycle is a disenfranchisement of most Americans, and a giant upward distribution of income from the middle class and poor to the wealthy and powerful.Another consequence is growing anger and frustration felt by people who are working harder than ever but getting nowhere, accompanied by deepening cynicism about our democracy.The way to end this vicious cycle is to reduce the huge accumulations of wealth that fuel it, and get big money out of politics. But it's chicken-and-egg problem. How can this be accomplished when wealth and power are compounding at the top? Only through a political movement such as America had a century ago when progressives reclaimed our economy and democracy from the robber barons of the first Gilded Age.That was when Wisconsin's ""fighting Bob"" La Follette instituted the nation's first minimum wage law; presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan attacked the big railroads, giant banks, and insurance companies; and President Teddy Roosevelt busted up the giant trusts.When suffragettes like Susan B. Anthony secured women the right to vote, reformers like Jane Addams got laws protecting children and the public's health, and organizers like Mary Harris ""Mother"" Jones spearheaded labor unions.America enacted a progressive income tax, limited corporate campaign contributions, ensured the safety and purity of food and drugs, and even invented the public high school.The progressive era welled up in the last decade of the nineteenth century because millions of Americans saw that wealth and power at the top were undermining American democracy and stacking the economic deck. Millions of Americans overcame their cynicism and began to mobilize.We may have reached that tipping point again.Both the Occupy Movement and the Tea Party grew out of revulsion at the Wall Street bailout. Consider, more recently, the fight for a higher minimum wage (""Fight for 15""). Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign is part of this mobilization. (Donald Trump's bastardized version draws on the same anger and frustration but has descended into bigotry and xenophobia.)Surely 2016 is a critical year. But, as the reformers of the Progressive Era understood more than a century ago, no single president or any other politician can accomplish what's needed because a system caught in the spiral of wealth and power cannot be reformed from within. It can be changed only by a mass movement of citizens pushing from the outside.So regardless of who wins the presidency in November and which party dominates the next Congress, it is up to the rest of us to continue to organize and mobilize. Real reform will require many years of hard work from millions of us.As we learned in the last progressive era, this is the only way the vicious cycle of wealth and power can be reversed.ROBERT B.

But around 25 percent of the warming expected for 2016 is explained by the strong El Niño, which exacerbates the warming impact of climate change.",2016-01-03,An El Nino rainstorm approaches San Clemente Beach on a beautiful sunny afternoon.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb180cc2500003200382d58.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Extreme weather is all over the news, worldwide, this winter. Here in Britain we've just had one of the costliest run of floods the country has ever experienced, with economic losses of over $4.5Bn (PwC) and more expected. The Northeast US has been warm and wet with record breaking temperatures, whilst tornadoes and record breaking floods have gripped the Southeast. Then there is the heightened wildfire season in Australia, the persistent drought building up in Southern Africa and Ethiopia, and in Central America ongoing drought means 3.5 million people in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador are in need of food aid (WMO). These extremes are not just a coincidence.Extremes, El Nino and climate changeScientists have long warned that extreme events like these will become more common as a result of climate change leading to a warmer planet (e.g. IPCC extremes report). More heatwaves, record temperatures, a wetter planet overall and in general dry areas get drier and wet areas wetter. But the regional distribution of many of the extremes above also has the hallmarks of what climate scientists expect from the global footprint of a strong El Niño event. A natural phenomena characterised by the build-up of warm water in the tropical Pacific Ocean every 3-7 years that can influence climate and weather across the globe. It is therefore no surprise that this extreme weather is coinciding with the peaking of a super strength El Niño. Not just any El Niño, but the strongest El Niño event in the modern day record, beating the infamous 1997-98 ""super"" event. In many places this is heightening the changes in extremes we expect from climate change.And it's not just this winter. The current El Niño was already well established as a monster event in Summer 2015. The signature strong tropical cyclone season in the Central and Eastern Pacific and the somewhat suppressed Atlantic hurricane season, expected during an El Niño, both occurred. Models predicted then that the El Niño was very likely to hold and strengthen into this winter, like they normally do. Experts had a good idea what was coming.What's in store for 2016?The current forecasts suggest this El Niño will stay strong through the spring (see here). The news is rightly all focused on record breakers and disasters, but on the upside, the benefits of a continuing strong El Niño persisting over the coming months include some likely reprieve, for example, to the massive long-term drought that has been gripping California for many years now. But it also suggests continued and worsened drought conditions are to be anticipated in many food-constrained regions of Africa and Central America, and a continuing wet season in the Southeast US and northern Europe ahead. Forecasters expect 2016 to be the warmest year ever recorded. Models suggest this is primarily because of the long term warming trend caused by man-made climate change. But around 25% of the warming expected for 2016 is explained by the strong El Niño, which exacerbates the warming impact of climate change. In the case of the weather extremes, the 2015/2016 super El Niño in many regions either exacerbates or dampens the impacts driven by climate change. What's to blame?Over the last decade the science of weather attribution has advanced. Huge progress in computing power has enabled finer scale resolutions to be modeled, with regional models better able to capture the smaller scales of weather extremes. Studies are proliferating with major extreme events, like those of this winter, now under autopsy almost in real time. The science is strongest for heatwaves and then droughts, and more challenging for flooding and storms, though in some cases still possible.The World Weather Initiative is one such research program which today does real time analysis of high impact events to attribute likely cause - human-influence or other. They calculated that climate change made the December floods in the Northern UK from Storm Desmond 40% more likely (see here). The signal will be different, for the other extremes of this winter. Both climate change and/or the El Nino will be playing more of a role in some than others. But what is clear is that this new science of weather attribution has changed the narrative around weather disasters. In Summer 2007 when the UK was affected by flood losses of comparable magnitude, scientists steered away from making firm connections. The UK Met Office's commentary on this winter's UK floods brings climate change into sharper focus. As weather attribution research progresses, this evidence will no doubt impact public policy, business and investment decisions, public perception, and could even potentially fuel climate court cases.  Some lessons for the future1. Plan, build and invest for a changing risk horizon: All the infrastructure we build and invest in today, including the $90Tr of infrastructure investment expected over the next 15 years, will need to function in a more extreme risk environment. Standard practice, from the insurance industry, to city planners, design and construction, investors, and policymakers, should be to not just plan for today's 1/100 flood events, for example, but consider risk over the lifetime of assets concerned. For such a medium term view of risk to be mainstreamed, it will help for it to be rooted in policy and facilitated by industry regulators and ratings agencies. Better risk data, including data that takes into account climate change, should be a priority public sector and business investment, and needs to be widely accessible. 2. We have sophisticated forecasts, so use them, and invest in their next generation: El Nino forecasts exist and are improving all the time. With an event as strong as the current one, experts have known for a while, at least since the summer, that such a winter of extremes was very likely, and where. The insurance industry, in many cases, already models the change in risk from certain climate perils correlated with El Niño. Underwriters are able to look at El Niño forecasts, stress test portfolios and factor this into their pricing. But this practice could be improved and mainstreamed within and beyond the sector. From Aid agencies and humanitarian relief organizations mobilizing pre disaster, to public utilities, local authorities and businesses preparing resilience efforts. 3. Modernize our approach to climate risk management: In our future world, we will need to get smarter quickly, in dealing with heightened weather extremes. Our traditional defenses need to be reassessed and improved. New approaches to water management are key including reforestation and land reinstatement. Upgraded building codes with stricter monitoring and enforcement, and communication of residual risks to communities are vital. The insurance industry will need to increasingly play a societal role. The sophisticated proprietary risk models this industry has could be used more widely by governments and business. Insurers will need to be in dialogue with governments. They will want to be involved in determining what gets built or rebuilt and where, in order for lifetime insurability to be achievable. They will also need to innovate new solutions to protect more people, such as risk pools, resilience bonds, and micro-insurance. The huge progress over the last two decades in climate science and risk modeling means that we are getting smarter. The data, tools, experiences and evidence exists to prepare for a world of constant change, of changing risks, and of unprecedented extremes. Putting this into practice is sound climate risk management, which needs supportive institutional set up - from public investment and policies, to industry associations, regulators and rating agencies."

20,TASTE,Tales of Hunger: Food in Italy Between the Two World Wars,"Fabio Parasecoli, ContributorAssociate professor and director of Food Studies initiatives, ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tales-of-hunger-food-in-i_b_8908250.html,,2016-01-03,2016-01-03-1451858706-283559-FerdinandoMercato1933.jpeg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-01-03-1451858706-283559-FerdinandoMercato1933-thumb.jpeg," My great-grandfather at the Trionfale market in Rome, circa 1933  Growing up in Italy in the 1960s, World War II was quite remote to me. Although I was not fully aware of it, the country was experiencing its ""economic miracle:"" a few years of rapid and sustained growth that saw the movement of millions of people from the south to the north, from the interior to the coasts, and from the countryside to the cities where new industrial jobs had become available. As the damage and destruction from the recent war was erased, Italians were eating their way towards the future, enjoying their newly found resources and access to a variety of ingredients and products that had no comparison to any previous era.I had not known any other way of eating. Although we may still not have been eating meat too often, we were consuming mass-produced cheese, desserts, and cold cuts. Canned food was widely available in supermarkets, a relatively novel concept for grocery shopping. Frozen food was creeping its way into our fridges, many of which only had a tiny icebox that needed to be deiced pretty often.Yet, every time I did not want to eat something, here came the war stories. My parents were children during the Nazi occupation, when food was very hard to come by, and only available on the black market at outrageous prices. My mother's family left the city for their mountain village where, at least, the occasional egg and fruits and vegetables were still available. My father remembers when the American GIs entered Rome, distributing chocolate bars; he ate so much of it, he got seriously sick. And they were the young ones. My grandparents' generation had their own trove of stories about hunger, great for guilting me into eating, but they were less overt about it. From them, I often heard stories of food sharing, celebrations, and culinary prowess despite scarcity. I knew that those had been hard times for them, preceded by the harshness of World War I and the following years under Mussolini, when food became increasingly scarce due to the leader's dream of autarchy and self-sufficiency. However, many of that generation had ambivalent feelings towards Fascism. Some had fond memories of the youth activities and the trips to the beach organized by the party. Others longed for a sense of order that was constantly threatened by the swift changes of the 1960s, and later by the dark shadow of terrorism. Others blame Mussolini for all the injustices and hardships they had to go through.The same mixed perceptions emerge in the stories that Karima Moyer-Nocchi collected in her book Chewing The Fat: an Oral History of Italian Foodways From Fascism to Dolce Vita. She interviewed elderly Italian women from different social backgrounds and geographical origins, who had all experienced the events in the first half of the twentieth century. The specific point of view the author has chosen is food, which played a crucial role in most women's experience as they were expected to produce, process, sell, buy, cook, serve, and -- with any luck -- consumed it. Due to its absence, it was a constant theme in social and political life.Readers are introduced to recipes, ingredients and culinary techniques that many Italians are likely to have forgotten, erased with the bad memories of those years. We hear voices of an old aristocratic lady from Bologna as well of a sharecropper from Basilicata, in the south. Lives in the city and in the countryside could have not been more different. Moyer-Nocchi also intersperses the stories with information about the period, which can be quite useful to non-Italian readers. Although the choice of translating the women speaking in dialect with a Southern-inflected American English is debatable, the author succeeds in conveying a life world that needs to be remembered and appreciated in its complexity. There were no heroes or villains, just people struggling to survive. History may not repeat itself, but it is always important to know were we come from to have a more objective and informed vision of where we are, especially at a time when Italy is going through a deep recession, fears of immigration and terrorism dominate the public discourse, and the specter of dangerous forms of populism is gripping the country."

In fact, we are literally moving into the New Year.Rob sold his office building in Pasadena in November and is moving his office and shop (two rooms full of tools and construction equipment) up to Santa Barbara next week. At the same time, we are moving him out of a guesthouse in Santa Barbara to our place across town. And in mid-January, we will move him out of his apartment in Old Town Pasadena. We have been organizing and packing and planning for several weeks, and I'm grateful we at least got to get away to Mammoth (and a day of glorious skiing) for a few days over Christmas.All of this moving is crazy-making hard work, and to be honest it has tested our young relationship at times. You learn a lot about your partner when under intense pressure. And we've certainly had enough stress the past few weeks to last several years. Thank goodness we also know how to laugh--at the circumstances and ourselves. Rob somehow always knows the exact thing to say to humor me out of a foul mood. And he is a fount of optimism most of the time.But all this moving also makes me mindful of how much change and transition is still ahead of us. We have been looking for a house to buy, but meanwhile are renting a darling place by the beach in Summerland, a tiny burg just south of Santa Barbara. Tiny is the operative word here; our place is small. It's been fine for the two of us, but when we add all of Rob's things from two different residences we will be overflowing with stuff. My tendency is to get rid of most of it, but Rob is a bit of a packrat (in fact, I think he could fall into major hoarding if allowed). So another negotiation is necessary. For now, most will end up in storage. But that is not a long-term solution.All of this has made me consider just what it means to be settled. I have been in a state of transition since August 2014, when I decided to move to Santa Fe. Most of my belongings went into storage. When I moved back to Santa Barbara a year ago to be with Rob, I remember how good it felt to unpack at least some of my boxes and settle into our new place. For the first time in months I had my own things around me--my furniture and kitchen items, my bedding and clothes, my desk and office supplies.As we unpacked last January, I realized how many things I really didn't need--or want. I have learned I can live without most of the things I thought were important to me. And I have come to understand how little I need to be happy. In fact, having less is a path to a kind of freedom, really, that I didn't know one could feel. It's a letting go that comes with an emotional bonus. Untethered, unfettered, unburdened.So, a dichotomy at this New Year. As we pack and move and plan and organize, we also see the value in letting go and giving away. Which opens up our lives--and our hearts--for the intangible gifts of love, purpose and joy.May you have a 2016 full of the intangible gifts of life. Let all the rest fall away.Crossposted from marciameier.com."

""I'm well aware that the announcement of these hearings have generated considerable controversy and opposition,"" he said at the start of the enquiry.""What King seems not to have noticed,"" said Potok, ""is the very day before he gave that talk to the nation's television cameras, a man was arrested in Spokane Washington for attempting to murder hundreds of people marching in a Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade.""The SPLC had tracked this man for years.

Clearly it was. But he was not part of an organized effort with a particular agenda. He's a whacked out kid who follows the teachings of whacked out people.

Phillip Martin: But that would also be true of the Boston Marathon Bombers. They're what we would call lone wolves.

""And to be clear it's o.k. to be a Sovereign Citizen. What we're looking for are those fueled by that ideology who want to commit violent attacks.""Sovereign Citizens don't recognize courts or the Federal government.

Others include Cliven Bundy, the Nevada rancher who was applauded by conservative media and has been engaged in an armed standoff with government over grazing rights and has dared law enforcement officials to try to arrest him. Since 2000, sovereigns have killed six law enforcement officers, including two in Arkansas during a routine traffic stop in 2010. In Georgia last year, a sovereign citizen attacked a court house with tear gas, smoke grenades and an AR-15 Rifle ""Just like with international terrorism,"" said Carlin, ""you see people being radicalized, where they go from someone with a series of beliefs to someone who's willing to kill in the name of those beliefs.

Clearly it was. But he was not part of an organized effort with a particular agenda. He's a whacked out kid who follows the teachings of whacked out people. But it's not an organized effort like the Islamic State in the Levant. However, having said that, it wasn't a random act of violence either. It is domestic terrorism. What I'm trying to do is not portray them as ISIL. They're not part of an organized effort to hold territory and expand power."" Phillip Martin: But that would also be true of the Boston Marathon Bombers. They're what we would call lone wolves. GRAHAM: ""That's right, they're lone wolves who were inspired by the people who want to create jihad and are answering the call of the jihadists to hit us in our back yard.""But Dylan Roof was also inspired. In this case by white supremacists and a movement most Americans have never heard of.He's a whacked out kid who follows the teachings of whacked out people. But it's not an organized effort like the Islamic State in the Levant --Sen Lindsey Graham on Dylann Roof""According to one study of state and law enforcement, the group that they are most concerned about in terms of causing violence are the Sovereign Citizens,"" said John Carlin of the DOJ. ""And to be clear it's o.k. to be a Sovereign Citizen. What we're looking for are those fueled by that ideology who want to commit violent attacks.""Sovereign Citizens don't recognize courts or the Federal government. The best-known sovereign was Oklahoma City bomber, Timothy McVeigh. Others include Cliven Bundy, the Nevada rancher who was applauded by conservative media and has been engaged in an armed standoff with government over grazing rights and has dared law enforcement officials to try to arrest him. Since 2000, sovereigns have killed six law enforcement officers, including two in Arkansas during a routine traffic stop in 2010. In Georgia last year, a sovereign citizen attacked a court house with tear gas, smoke grenades and an AR-15 Rifle ""Just like with international terrorism,"" said Carlin, ""you see people being radicalized, where they go from someone with a series of beliefs to someone who's willing to kill in the name of those beliefs. The new Counsel [domestic counsel on domestic terrorism] that we've created at the national security division is to make sure that we have someone focusing full-time in catching those people before they commit the violent act.""And that's John Carlin's job, now that the Justice Department has made countering right wing extremism a priority.========This is the third of a four part public radio series:Defining Domestic Terrorism Part One: Hate Groups Move On-line and On CampusDefining Domestic Terrorism Part Two: Legal Meaning of a Loaded WordDefining Domestic Terrorism Part Three: Conservative Politicians Downplay Threat from the Far Right"

Prince Salman went on to add that the coalition would coordinate its efforts ""with major powers and international organizations.""According to a statement later released by SPA, the Saudi state news agency, the coalition would have a joint operations center based in Riyadh to ""coordinate and support military operations.""

Speaking specifically about the deployment of ground troops, he remarked that no option ""is off the table.""The coalition includes Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Pakistan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Benin, Chad, Togo, Tunisia, Turkey, Djibouti, Senegal, Sudan, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Gabon, Guinea, the Palestinian Authority, Comoros, Qatar, Ivory Coast, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Maldives, Morocco, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria and Yemen. The announcement was welcomed by the Obama administration. U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter described the proposed coalition as ""very much in line with something we have been urging for quite some time, which is greater involvement in the campaign to combat ISIL by Sunni Arab countries."" Carter went on to add that the United States looked forward ""to learning more about what Saudi Arabia had in mind"" for the coalition. The U.S. words of support notwithstanding, the announcement marked the latest move in Saudi Arabia's increasingly assertive and, from Washington's standpoint, independent foreign policy. It is the latest in a series of Saudi moves that underscore a significant foreign policy shift.  Prince Mohammed bin Salman al Saud announcing the creation of a new Saudi-led, 34 nation coalition. December 15, 2015On Oct 18, 2013, just one day after being elected to a two year term on the U.N. Security Council, the Saudi government unexpectedly turned down the seat. The reasons cited by Riyadh were the Security Council's impotence in dealing with the Assad government's continued atrocities against Syrian Sunni Muslims as well as its ineffectiveness in making any measurable progress in the impasse over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or in ridding the Middle East of weapons of mass destruction. This was the first time that Saudi Arabia had been elected to a seat on the Security Council and the first time that a newly elected member had rejected its seat. Some 17 months later, on March 26, 2015, Saudi Arabia announced that it would lead a coalition of Arab states made up principally of Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and Egypt in a military intervention in Yemen designed to restore the legitimate government of President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi. That government had earlier been overthrown by Houthi rebels backed by Iran. The original announcement had included Pakistan, but that government subsequently distanced itself from an active role.Serious planning for the actual operation, ""Decisive Storm,"" had only begun in early March. Although the Saudi Foreign Ministry had claimed that Riyadh had been in close consultation with Washington for months, sources at the White House confirmed that the Saudis did not begin having detailed, top level discussions with the White House's national security staff till Sunday, March 15. General Lloyd Austin, head of the U.S. Central Command, in testimony in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee on March 26 disclosed that he had been advised by the Saudi military of the impending operation only one hour before it was launched. Dubbed an example of the new ""Salman Doctrine,"" the intervention formalized the Saudi response to the ""Arab Spring"" civil unrest that had gripped the Arab world since the winter of 2011 and which, in particular, had resulted in a number of violent demonstrations in Bahrain and elsewhere in the Gulf. Simply put, Riyadh made it clear that any attempts to overthrow Sunni Muslim governments in the Arabian Peninsula by Iranian backed, Shiite militant groups would be met by a Saudi-led armed military intervention. Some pundits were quick to characterize this new, 34 member, Saudi-led coalition as an ""Arab NATO,"" That assessment was premature. It's unclear at this point whether there is a formal treaty between the various parties in the coalition. It does not seem that there is one. Riyadh has made it clear that ""participation"" in any operation is voluntary. Nor does it appear that the agreement, formal or otherwise, has any binding provisions for mutual defense. As of yet, there is nothing similar to the Article 5 provisions of the NATO treaty that binds each party to come to the defense of any of its members.  Saudi air strike in Sana'a Yemen, November 5, 2015There is no standardization of arms or equipment among the various members and little history of joint training or the coordination of joint operations. Organizing joint air operations will prove easier than effectively deploying a combined ground force. Moreover, those countries with the strongest militaries, Turkey, Egypt, Nigeria and Pakistan will likely face considerable domestic opposition to the foreign deployment of their troops, although both Egypt and Pakistan have a history of deploying troops, at Saudi request, in the Arabian Peninsula. The organization may well evolve into a NATO like, mutual defense treaty, but for now it represents more a commitment for cooperation than it does a binding defensive alliance. Nonetheless, the creation of such an organization is significant. At the very least it represents an expansion of the Salman Doctrine beyond just the defense of the Sunni governments in the Gulf to include a much broader array of Sunni governments across the Muslim world. The addition of African and Asian nations further highlights its ""Sunni character ""over that of its Arab one. The point is underscored by the absence of any Shiite-led governments, notwithstanding the supposed participation of the Lebanese government. Moreover, although the stated purpose of the alliance is to combat ""terrorism,"" its potential role as an anti-Iranian, anti-Shiite coalition is unmistakable. As such it is further evidence of the continued and growing realignment of Middle East polities along a Sunni-Shia fault line. The announcement of the proposed alliance underscores a much more assertive, much more militaristic Saudi policy in the Middle East; a foreign policy willing to act unilaterally, one less reliant on American security guarantees and one far less willing to operate under an American security umbrella. As one Arab commentator put it in an article in al-Arabiya on April 1, 2015, ""Saudi Arabia no longer cares if this U.S. silence is the passing weakness of a president whose term ends in two years."" U.S. Senator John McCain, echoed much the same sentiment when, hours after the launch of Operation Decisive Storm, he said that ""Arab countries no longer trust the U.S. and that is why they planned this alliance on their own.""The continued weakness in oil prices may also be a factor that is shaping the Saudi response. At current price levels, Riyadh's budget deficit is around 21% of GDP. That level would be unsustainable for most countries. Only the existence of Saudi Arabia's extensive financial reserves makes it possible for the government in Riyadh to avoid, at least for now, a financial crisis. The Saudi willingness to consider more aggressive military options may simply be a reflection that Riyadh's traditional response of spreading copious amounts of cash to resolve disputes will be less of an option in the future. Finally, the new alliance further underscores the Saudi intention to position itself as the leader of the Sunni world and, more significantly, what appears to be Turkey's willingness to set aside its own ambitions to lead the Sunni world and to support the Saudi initiative. Saudi Arabia's unique position as the caretaker of Islam's holiest shrines and its considerable petroleum wealth has always given it considerable influence in both the Arab and Muslim world. Historically, however, it has preferred to exercise that leadership quietly, through back channels. Under King Salman, that leadership is increasingly visible, assertive, and, when necessary, willing to pursue military options either with or without the United States. As such, this new Sunni alliance represents nothing less than a Saudi declaration of independence from America's Middle East policy and a clear signal that in the absence of American leadership, Riyadh is willing to go it alone."

It’s not that you lose your passion,” Crawford said. “I have that. That’s insanity. But it just comes to the point where you say, ‘I don’t want to make a fool out of myself.’ And it’s been so good that I want to go out on a high note. I don’t want to go out on a low note. I want to be in the NBA Finals, and I don’t want to be reffing just for the sake of reffing.”Passion is one thing Crawford will surely be remembered for -- sometimes to a fault. He was infamously suspended in 2007 for challenging San Antonio Spurs star Tim Duncan to a fight after the two exchanged words during a game. Other angry and dramatic moments in Crawford’s refereeing career prompted Deadspin to declare that his “seemingly pathological need to make himself a factor in games was so grating that you could make a very sensible case that he’s the worst thing about the NBA.”The basketball official is also respected for his toughness.""But while no official is immune to bias, nobody else was as willing to call a controversial or unpopular call against the home team,"" the same critical Deadspin article noted. ""As much as he made himself a pariah, he had no problem making tough calls, even if they got entire arenas booing and spitting venom at him.""Crawford told The New York Times he once broke a finger while giving a player a technical foul -- and he started seeing a sports psychologist soon after.The mixture of resentment and affection many basketball fans feel for Crawford was evident in the reactions to the news of his retirement on Twitter.Crawford, who is recovering from knee surgery, plans to resume refereeing on March 1, according to the Delaware County Times.He has officiated in more playoff games than any active referee in the league -- 313 of them, to date.Also on HuffPost:"

Martin confirmed that his new book in the A Song of Ice and Fire series, The Winds of Winter, will not be completed before Season 6 of the HBO show, ""Game of Thrones"" -- and that the show will spoil the books.In the post, the author covers a saga so epic it's perhaps only surpassed by his novels. Martin recalls how everyone, including HBO, wanted the book to come out before Season 6 of ""GoT"" premieres in April, because the show has basically caught up to his source material. Martin said he missed multiple deadlines due to distractions, previous obligations and just not feeling it. The author explained that he was having more bad writing days than good ones. Martin wrote that he's still ""months away"" from finishing Winds. And that's ""if the writing goes well.""""You're disappointed, and you're not alone,"" he wrote. ""My editors and publishers are disappointed, HBO is disappointed, my agents and foreign publishers and translators are disappointed... but no one could possibly be more disappointed than me."" Even worse, the author confirmed some book spoilers are coming.""Given where we are, inevitably, there will be certain plot twists and reveals in season six of 'Game of Thrones' that have not yet happened in the books,"" Martin said. Book readers shouldn't totally freak out, though. At this point, the show has diverted so much from the books that a lot of the perceived twists probably won't even happen in the books, Martin said. And many characters who are dead in the show still have significant stories coming in his novels.But whether you prefer the show's take or the books, ""you can still enjoy the hell out of both,"" Martin said.Ok, so you hear that, Arya?
