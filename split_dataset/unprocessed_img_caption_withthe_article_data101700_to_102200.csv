Sony defended itself Thursday against a flood of criticism for canceling the movie which angered North Korea and triggered a massive cyber-attack, as the crisis took a wider diplomatic turn.

Washington began consultations with Japan, China, South Korea and Russia seeking their assistance in reining in North Korea.Japan and South Korea said they would cooperate. China, North Korea's only major ally, has yet to respond, but a Beijing-run newspaper said ""The Interview"" was not a movie for Hollywood and U.S. society to be proud of.""The vicious mocking of Kim is only a result of senseless cultural arrogance,"" the newspaper said.It was the first time the United States had directly accused another country of a cyberattack of such magnitude on American soil and set up a possible new confrontation between longtime foes Washington and Pyongyang.Obama said he wished that Sony had spoken to him first before yanking the movie, suggesting it could set a bad precedent. ""I think they made a mistake,"" he said.""NOT CAVED IN""Sony Pictures Entertainment Chief Executive Michael Lynton insisted the company did not capitulate to hackers and said it is still looking for alternative platforms to release ""The Interview."" This week, a spokeswoman for Sony had said the company did not have further release plans for the $44 million film starring Seth Rogen and James Franco.Despite Obama's stern warning to North Korea, his options for responding to the computer attack by the impoverished state appeared limited. The president declined to be specific about any actions under consideration.North Korea has been subject to U.S. sanctions for more than 50 years, but they have had little effect on its human rights policies or its development of nuclear weapons. It has become expert in hiding its often criminal money-raising activities, largely avoiding traditional banks.The FBI said technical analysis of malicious software used in the Sony attack found links to malware that ""North Korean actors"" had developed and found a ""significant overlap"" with ""other malicious cyber activity"" previously tied to Pyongyang.But it otherwise gave scant details on how it concluded that North Korea was behind the attack.U.S. experts say Obama's options could include cyber retaliation, financial sanctions, criminal indictments against individuals implicated in the attack or even a boost in U.S. military support to South Korea, still technically at war with the North.But the effect of any response would be limited given North Korea's isolation and the fact that it is already heavily sanctioned for its nuclear program.There is also the risk that an overly harsh U.S. response could provoke Pyongyang to escalate any cyber warfare.Non-conventional capabilities such as cyber warfare and nuclear technology are the weapons of choice for the impoverished North, defectors said in Seoul.They said the Sony attack may have been a practice run for North Korea's ""cyberarmy"" as part of its long-term goal of being able to cripple its rivals' telecommunications and energy grids.(Additional reporting by Matt Spetalnick, Roberta Rampton, Susan Heavey, David Chance, Arshad Mohammed and David Brunnstrom in Washington, Ju-min Park in Seoul; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan and Crispian Balmer)"

3,POLITICS,Here's Where Campaign Finance Reform May Move Ahead As Congress Dithers,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/campaign-finance-reform-states_n_6357182.html,,2014-12-20,"WASHINGTON, DC - NOVEMBER 12: People stand in line to enter the US Supreme Court building, November 12, 2014 in Washington, DC. Today the high court will hear oral arguments for cases, Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, Alabama Democratic Conference v. Alabama, and Comptroller of Treasury of Maryland v. Wynne. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e18e220000bb01dd7f65.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Nearly five years after the Supreme Court decision in Citizens United altered the landscape for money in politics, Congress has done nothing to reverse the ruling's adverse side effects for disclosure and collaboration between independent groups and the candidates they support. A similar degradation of campaign finance rules has occurred in many states. While reform remains unlikely in Congress, it's possible in some states, where extreme polarization on the issue of money in politics is less evident than in Washington.Numerous states and municipalities have already enacted new disclosure laws and rules governing candidates' coordination with independent groups. Still others have pushed for small-donor matching fund systems to dilute the power of big money, or have passed conflict of interest restrictions on gifts from lobbyists and contractors.In some cases, these reforms included raising campaign finance limits. In Maryland and Massachusetts, disclosure legislation was matched with higher limits for campaign contributions. This pattern played out across in other states. But in Minnesota and Florida, disclosure provisions were cut from bills that wound up increasing the contribution limits.Over the next two years, there are possibilities for more reforms in states and municipalities. Here's where action is likely:New MexicoNew Mexico was one of the worst-prepared states for the altered campaign finance landscape wrought by the Citizens United decision. The state’s laws had no legal definition or standard for either independent expenditures or coordination between an independent group and a candidate or party committee. And, like every other state, New Mexico did not require disclosure of donors to nonprofits active in electoral politics.“We don’t have clear rules and reporting requirements for people who are not candidates or political parties,” Common Cause New Mexico executive director Viki Harrison said.State Sen. Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) will introduce two bills in the next legislative session on campaign finance reform. One will establish clear rules for independent expenditure disclosure and coordination. The other will seek to update the state’s public financing system by allowing candidates who are outspent to receive matching funds for small donations.Both bills have had bipartisan success in previous legislative sessions. The public financing bill passed both houses with substantial support in 2013, only to be vetoed by Gov. Susana Martinez (R). The disclosure bill passed the state Senate by voice vote in the most recent session, only to die in the House.The state’s legislative makeup is different this year, after Republicans won control of the state House for the first time in 60 years. But the campaign finance issue is not as polarized in New Mexico as it is in Washington. Republican state Rep. Jason Smith will introduce the House version of Wirth’s bill. Harrison said she has had conversations with supportive Republican members.“There’s a bipartisan recognition that the current system is not working,” Wirth said.ArkansasArkansas voters this year passed a ballot initiative with significant campaign finance and ethics reforms, including a total ban on direct corporate contributions to candidate campaigns. The state-level reform group Regnat Populus hopes to build on this success with an initiative in 2016 to expand these reforms and enact new disclosure rules for independent groups.“We aren’t the most transparent state when it comes to campaign finance,” Regnat Populus founder Paul Spencer said.Arkansas is one of a few states that does not require disclosures for independent spending (known as independent expenditures) and does not recognize issue advertising close to an election (known as electioneering communications) as subject to disclosure. State laws also allow nonprofit groups to spend freely without disclosing their donors.Regnat Populus’ initiative would expand disclosures for independent expenditure and electioneering communication spending, and require donor disclosure of certain nonprofits engaged in electoral activity. The initiative also would tweak the 2014 ballot proposal’s ethics reforms.MissouriOn Dec. 8, local newspapers reported that Missouri mega-donor Rex Sinquefield contributed $1 million to the lieutenant governor campaign of Republican Bev Randles. It was billed as the largest donation to a single candidate in state history, and an example of Sinquefield’s growing influence. In recent months, the St. Louis financier made six-figure donations to other statewide candidates, including a $750,000 donation to Republican gubernatorial candidate Catherine Hanaway.These outsized contributions that came after Missouri ended its campaign contribution limits are sparking action.Democratic lawyer Brad Ketcher said he will propose a constitutional amendment for the ballot that would re-establish contribution limits for legislative candidates, place limits on lobbyist gifts and impose strong coordination rules on independent spending.“I think there’s a good and fair chance that we’ll something on the ballot on the next election,” Ketcher said.The issue is gaining attention from Republicans as well. Republican state Rep. Caleb Rowden (R-Jefferson City) introduced legislation to require disclosure of dark money spent by nonprofit groups on elections, ban lobbyist gifts and increase campaign finance disclosure.Missouri Roundtable for Life, an anti-abortion organization, is behind another ballot initiative that would reinstate campaign contribution limits.The issue is also drawing attention from U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) who has said she's increasingly worried about the large contributions flowing into state-level campaigns.Connecticut, MaineBoth states are likely to update their public financing systems to adjust to changes in campaign funding. In Maine, this means lawmakers would be allotted public funds in an amount appropriate to counteract the dramatic increase in independent spending since Citizens United. Maine Citizens for Clean Elections is working to get an initiative on the ballot in the next election.Connecticut legislators are expected to tackle similar fixes, according to groups involved in reform efforts.Other states and municipalitiesLegislation related to the disclosure of donors to independent groups like nonprofits is likely to be considered in California, Minnesota and Nebraska. Legislators from both parties in Arizona also have shown interest in disclosure legislation, which may translate into action, considering the outsized role dark money played in the 2014 election.Dark money disclosure is also likely to be up for debate in Texas after the state’s ethics commission put new disclosure rules in place in 2014. These will certainly face a court challenge from disclosure opponents.Philadelphia City Council members are looking to pass legislation requiring similar donor disclosure rules, as well as stricter coordination language.Public financing systems will be considered by municipal lawmakers in Buffalo, New York; Howard County, Maryland; and Seattle.There also will be efforts by the anti-corruption group Represent.Us to push ballot initiatives packaging lobbying, ethics and campaign finance reforms together as they did to much success in Tallahassee, Florida in 2014. The group will target multiple municipalities and states in 2016, but has not announced which ones yet.Reforms are not the only thing on the docket in the coming years. Those pushing for these changes are also paying attention to court cases and other legislative moves to rollback reforms and increase the amount of money in politics.“We expect to see efforts to weaken disclosure, weaken public financing programs that are out there, possibly weaken coordination language,” Karen Hobert Flynn, vice president for strategy and programs at Common Cause, said."

Let stand for 15 minutes. Place the soft butter, sugar and vanilla in the bowl of an electric mixer and whip at slow speed until fluffy and pale. Add the eggs one at a time and continue whipping at slow speed until the mixture is smooth. Scrape the sides of the bowl and whip at medium speed for another minute until thick and ribbony. Set aside. Place the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl and whisk with a wire whisk until well blended. Add to the egg mixture and stir with a wooden spoon until just incorporated. Drain the cherries and add them to the dough, along with the pistachios. Stir until the dough comes together.Step 2: Turn the dough over a generously floured work surface and divide into 5 even pieces. Roll each piece into a long, skinny log (1 1/4"" in diameter and 16"" long). Place the logs 2"" apart on the prepared pan. Bake the logs until they've risen and are golden, about 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside to cool for 15 minutes.Reduce oven temperature to 250ºF (130ºC).Step 3: Using a serrated knife, slice the logs crosswise to make 3/4""-thick biscotti. Lay the slices on the prepared pans (you'll need to use both pans) and bake for 20 minutes. Turn the slices over and return to the oven, making sure to switch the position of your pans in the oven, and bake for an additional 20 minutes until the slices are dry and pale golden. Cool on racks and store in an airtight container for up to 1 month.Viviane's TipThis recipe makes bite-sized biscotti, which I find much more refined than the giant ones we're used to seeing in most bakeries. However, if you wish to make larger biscotti, shape the dough into 3 larger logs (2"" thick and 14"" long) and extend the baking time to 35 to 40 minutes for the logs and 25 minutes on each side for the biscotti. This will yield 5 dozen medium-sized biscotti.* * *Never miss a recipe... Join my mailing list!"

Mercedes-Benz's latest S-Class features a ""traffic jam assist"" that allows the car to automatically follow the vehicle in front of it at at low speeds. Still, fully automated vehicles have a long drive ahead of them before they hit the market. Regulatory and insurance policies will have to come first. Moreover, the technology faces serious ethical questions -- namely, if an accident becomes unavoidable, who should die?Consider this scenario, spelled out by Jason Millar in the September issue of Wired:You are travelling along a single-lane mountain road in an autonomous car that is fast approaching a narrow tunnel. Just before entering the tunnel a child errantly runs into the road and trips in the centre of the lane, effectively blocking the entrance to the tunnel. The car is unable to brake in time to avoid a crash. It has but two options: hit and kill the child, or swerve into the wall on either side of the tunnel, thus killing you. Now ask yourself, Who should decide whether the car goes straight or swerves? Manufacturers? Users? Legislators?Google is as yet unprepared to answer that question.""People are philosophizing about it,"" Ron Medford, the director of safety on Google's self-driving car project, told The Associated Press last month, ""but the question about real-world capability and real-world events that can affect us, we really haven't studied that issue."""

Now, with the embargo severely hollowed out, we can focus on fostering a democratic Cuba in collaboration with others in the region.Already, the leaders of countless Latin American countries have expressed unanimous support for the president's announcement. Even Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro called the actions ""a brave gesture and historically necessary.""For over five decades the United States put pressure on the Cuban regime through a policy of isolation. The problem -- as seen in countries like North Korea and Iran -- is that sanctions and isolation only have a chance to work when the global community is united in its support. In Cuba, with the U.S. going it alone, isolation failed. Instead, it was the United States that became isolated. That will now change. Now, new travel policies will bring an influx of American culture and values on the island. Newly-permitted telecommunications technology will create better access and exposure to ideas. The financial provisions announced will provide the Cuban people, especially independent entrepreneurs, with resources previously out of reach. These steps will weaken the Castros' control of everyday life and give new tools for civil society. The American people were ahead of Washington in coming to this conclusion. Fifty-six percent support normalizing relations, with the strongest support coming from Florida, the home of the Cuban exile community. Unlike most other issues, a majority of Democrats, Republicans and Independents all agree on the need for change. Americans are even more supportive when asked about specific changes that the president has now enacted. Whether it is changing the travel ban, easing financial restrictions, meeting with the Cuban government, or removing Cuba from the State Sponsors of Terrorism List, support for each one rose by six to eight percentage points, to above 61 percent.Removing Cuba from the terrorism list will yield the biggest impact, both for Cuba and the United States. For the United States, it will further legitimize the list. For years, Cuba has sat only in the company of Iran, Syria, and Sudan. The Cuban regime may be unfriendly, but it does not pose any of the active dangers to the United States and our security that these other countries possess. Taking Cuba off the list will free up bureaucratic resources to even further focus on these truly rogue nations. The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) handles all travel and monetary sanctions, not just those related to the State Sponsor of Terror list. OFAC is responsible for sanctions related to 20 countries and five programs (such as arms control and narcotrafficking). Their time would be best spent monitoring transactions and exchanges that are of real concern to the security of our homeland. For Cuba, removal from the list allows access to aid and loans from international institutions, including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. This assistance will come with strings attached, forcing the Cuban government to undertake reforms that will prevent economic collapse -- and the ensuing exodus of people to Florida's shores. Removal also means new access to trade and banking services.The policy changes are not a reward for the Castros. They are a recognition that involvement, not estrangement, will foster a productive relationship better able to reach our goals of an inclusive, democratic hemisphere.

But this multicultural cast redux adds a hip swag to the classic kid's story. This Annie is urban, emotional and fun. But far from perfect.Jamie Foxx and Quvenzhané Wallis co-star in the family musical Annie (photo courtesy of Sony Pictures).Annie (Quvenzhané Wallis, Beasts of the Southern Wild), a foster child, lives with some other girls in a modern-day tenement apartment in Harlem. The kids are watched over by a cruel and constantly inebriated Miss Hannigan (Cameron Diaz). Hannigan, when she is not screaming her lungs bloody and can catch her breath, reminds them why they live with her: $157 a head from the Social Services department. Every Friday night Annie goes to a restaurant in Greenwich Village and waits for a couple to arrive. It's the couple who abandoned her there as an infant. Friday nights for Annie are a mix of hope and disappointment.On the other side of town, the rich side, Will Stacks (Jamie Foxx), an ambitious, billionaire cellphone honcho, lives in a luxury building. Stacks is running for mayor but not getting much traction. His campaign manager (Bobby Cannavale) and advisor (Rose Byrne) coach him the best they can, but Stacks' knack for charming the press and possible constituents is nonexistent. Then, as if by fate, he saves Annie from being run over by a car. In this day of iPhones and YouTube, his one act of heroism is recorded, uploaded and on the Web in seconds. And thus begins the journey of two lost souls who try to make sense of their disparate lives -- together. Screenwriters Will Gluck and Aline Brosh McKenna set their story against a slow economic recovery that feels like the ghost of the 1920s Great Depression, the setting for the original Annie. The plotting, with the new algorithm, heads down that same city sidewalks as the original, with Annie and her new, rich surrogate dad learning life lessons from each other. There are mishaps, misunderstandings, photo ops and finally a day of reckoning. The cheeky dialogue is surprisingly funny. When asked how big Stacks' penthouse apartment's living room was, Annie replies, ""I think it was Connecticut."" There are also sexual innuendos that adults will understand and kids won't, kind of like the dialogue in Shrek, when children couldn't figure out why their parents where howling with laughter.Gluck's direction is pretty kinetic. Scenes move along at a quick pace, and he seems to have a visual gimmick for each sequence. That said, there is nothing spectacular about his guidance; he lacks style, and the footage looks more fitting for the Family Channel and not what you'd expect from a major theatrical release.Wallis is solid, but we know from her Oscar-caliber performance in Beasts of the Southern Wild that she is a gifted young actress. Foxx is smooth and is a lot better at crafting his stuffy, wealthy, 40-something character in this comedy than he is at building credible interpretations in dramatic films. His smirk is worth a thousand lines of dialogue. Cameron Diaz's performance is over the top, and she has to play to the cheap seats because she portrays such an unlikable character and is given the worst lines. Cannavale and Byrne are decent but not great. Stephanie Kurtzuba, as a social-services clerk/counselor with a thick Russian accent and a roving eye, steals their thunder easily. Tech credits -- sets, editing, costumes, art direction -- are OK, but nothing particularly stands out. Old songs like ""Tomorrow"" are joined by new tunes like ""Who Am I?"", which is the best-performed song in the movie. And while we're talking about music, I have to ask: Why cast a musical with people who can't sing? Wallis' soft vocals are forgettable. Acting dynamo? Yes. Singer? No. Diaz is near tone-deaf, and her meek vocals are embarrassing. Only Foxx and Kurtzuba can belt it out, and their voices alone can't carry the entire film. And to top it off, all they are doing is lip-synching. It's not like they're singing live, like Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway in Les Misérables.Even with all these imperfections, as Annie careens towards the final moments, your eyes may get a bit misty. She's just a kid. Life has been brutal. She's looking for love. How can you hate a protagonist like that? How can you hate the movie she's in? You may grimace at some points, but kids might like it anyway. Visit NNPA Syndication film critic Dwight Brown at DwightBrownInk.com."

Bergoglio attended the event as the soon-to-be-named archbishop of Buenos Aires, but he clearly was versed in the issues well before given the impact of the Cold War standoff throughout Latin America.In the booklet, Bergoglio harshly criticized socialism and by extension Castro's atheist revolution for denying individuals their ""transcendent dignity"" and putting them solely at the service of the state. At the same time, he denounced the U.S. embargo and economic isolation of Cuba that impoverished the island.""The Cuban people must overcome this isolation,"" he wrote.Significantly, the first chapter of the book is titled ""The value of dialogue,"" and it is clear that Bergoglio fervently believes as did John Paul that dialogue was the only way to end Cuba's isolation and its hostility to the Catholic Church while promoting democracy.In quoting from both John Paul and Castro's speeches during the trip, Bergoglio noted that the two sometimes talked past one another as John Paul insisted on a space for the church to operate in Cuba and Castro insisted on the similarities between Marxism and Christianity.""But they both had to listen to each other,"" he wrote.Francis has frequently emphasized the need for dialogue to forge peace, as evidenced by his invitation to the Israeli and Palestinian presidents to come together to pray at the Vatican last June. His invitation to U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban counterpart Raul Castro to hash out their differences over the Caribbean island, with the Vatican as a mediator, was done in that same vein.Austen Ivereigh, who referenced the book in his new biography of Francis ""The Great Reformer,"" said Bergoglio demonstrated an ""incredibly evenhanded"" approach to the Cuban problem while outlining a future for the island that may well be more realistic now that the thaw has begun.""He sees Cuba's future as being a democratic government rooted in the Christian, humanist values of the Cuban pueblo,"" he said in a phone interview.

Here are five things that boomers can expect in 2015:1. Learning William P. Bengen's name. As you inch closer toward retirement, the name William P. Bengen will get passed around your breakfast table with as much frequency as the box of Special K. Bengen is the financial adviser who published what is known as the ""Four Percent rule"" -- the calculation that a person could draw up to 4 percent a year from their portfolio without fear of outliving their money. He published his research in the Journal of Financial Planning in 1994, which, as some would note, is an awfully long time ago. A lot of breakfast-table talk currently centers on this: Does Bengen's advice still hold?It absolutely does, said Wes Moss, host of Money Matters and author of ""You Can Retire Sooner Than You Think."" Mind you we are talking about stretching your money to last longer than you live, not how to accumulate it in the first place. If you are a super young retiree -- 50 to 60 years old -- keep your withdrawals close to 4 percent a year. If you are older, you can inch toward 5 percent, Moss said.Moss said that for each $1,000 a month you want to have at your disposal in retirement, you need to have $240,000 saved. And that $1,000 a month will supplement Social Security, and income from pensions, part-time work and any other income streams you can establish.And the ever-present question in retirement circles, of course, is how much do you need to have saved before you retire? While the $1 million figure is what gets tossed around the most, Moss is a bit more modest. He says $500,000 -- to draw $2,000 a month -- should do it for most people (adding Social Security and pensions to that amount). Moss believes that, if possible, pay off your mortgage too. You eliminate one big monthly bill that way and buy yourself some peace of mind. 2. Being pressured to save more. Every birthday brings you a little closer to retirement, and while many like to joke that they will die with their work boots on, few actually do. The U.S. Census Bureau says that just a small sliver of workers are actually 75 or older, although more older workers are staying on the job for a few years past the traditional retirement age of 66. https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/laborfor/Working-Beyond-Retirement-Age.pdfSo that means you need to start squirreling away your money before you stop work. The big flaw with Bengen's four percent theory, of course, is that it assumes that we actually have something saved for retirement upon which to withdraw. More than a third of adults do not, according to a national Bankrate poll published last summer. Even those closest to retirement age are slackers in this regard: More than 25 percent of those age 50 to 64 have yet to start saving for retirement.3. The government bugging you to save too. To help boost the amount earned and saved for retirement, beginning 2015, the government has raised 401(k) contribution limits. Taxpayers can contribute up to $18,000 to their 401(k), 403(b), most 457 plans and the federal government’s Thrift Savings Plan in 2015, which is $500 more than in 2014.There is also a new retirement account called a myRA for individuals earning under $129,000 (couples, $191,000) and who are without a workplace retirement account. The myRA is essentially a Roth Ira, with the distinction that it will be protected by market losses and is guaranteed to never go down in value. Moss notes that the most someone can put in over the life of the myRA is $15,000, ""so it's a great starter account for people but doesn't allow for significant accumulation."" 4. Bigger Social Security checks, sort of. Social Security recipients will get 1.7 percent bigger checks in 2015. This cost-of-living adjustment is expected to result in the typical retiree getting about $22 more per month. The annual adjustment is below 2 percent for the third consecutive year and the fifth time in the last six years. As one recipient quipped, $22 a month buys a case of Alpo.5. Knowledge of how many calories are in everything, whether you want to know or not. In 2015, the FDA will require that all restaurants with more than 20 stores to post the number of calories of each dish on their menus. This will presumably help people who didn't know that an apple fritter is fattening to make a smarter food choice. Just to give you a jump start, an apple fritter has 490 calories. Calorie labeling became required by law in 2010 as part of the Affordable Care Act, but implementation has been delayed for several years. "

The most punishing blow came more than a year ago from the shocking documentary ""Blackfish,"" in which several former SeaWorld trainers expressed their own anguish and hurt for the orcas in their care -- SeaWorld insists on calling them ""killer whales."" One SeaWorld orca, Tilikum, has been involved in the killing of three people so far, yet is still kept for public performances and, perhaps more importantly, for milking of his sperm to use to artificially inseminate female captive orcas to breed yet more captive orcas.The documentary, and subsequent incidents such as children being bitten in dolphin feeding pools and videos of dolphins flopping out of their pools, has led to major changes in public perceptions of SeaWorld and other dolphinariums. SeaWorld's value as a business on the stock market has gone way, way down. Amid the red ink, SeaWorld's CEO Stan Atchison recently stepped down. Well, SeaWorld, now that we have your attention...SeaWorld has responded by proposing to build new orca tanks that will be twice the size of the current tanks, complete, according to an artistic rendering, with nice trees and even a water ""treadmill"" for orcas to swim against. All this is supposed to make things better for one of the smartest animals in the world, as if they were chickens that just need a bit bigger cage to play in.What SHOULD SeaWorld do?Here are some ideas:Stop the Circus Acts: Marine mammals are the only zoo animals that have to perform for their food. Indeed, the business model for SeaWorld is not that of a zoo; it is of a circus. If the animals don't perform, they do not eat; they need to be kept hungry to make them perform all the tricks. And the tricks are just that -- there is nothing natural about an orca or dolphin being ridden by a human trainer or launching a trainer up into the air or jumping over obstacles. The open mouth that orcas and dolphins display when they bob their head above the water is completely unnatural -- it is a begging behavior to get more fish. As biologist Dr. Naomi Rose of the Animal Welfare Institute says: ""The fish are in the water; they don't rain down from the sky."" These performances are unnatural for the cetaceans and teach our children dominance of animals. SeaWorld argues that the cetaceans like doing the tricks, but then why do they require fish rewards? SeaWorld also claims the performances are critical for exercise and to stimulate the animals, but the performances are the same day after day, week after week, year after weary year. Taking advantage of natural behaviors and different experiences each day would suit their needs for exercise and mental stimulation much better, albeit this is no substitute for their rich lives in the wild.Stop the Lies: Parents take their children to SeaWorld to learn about the ocean and be entertained, but the information provided by SeaWorld is often warped if not dead wrong. Male orcas like Tilikum have flopped-over dorsal fins in captivity -- this rarely occurs in nature. Yet SeaWorld tells visitors that the flopping dorsal fin is ""natural."" One guide even told people that flopped-over fins were like some people having curly hair! Most cetaceans do poorly in captivity, but SeaWorld insists they live as long as in the wild. SeaWorld claims that its goal is to make committed conservationists out of the visiting public. But as Dr. Susan Davis summed up in her book-length study of SeaWorld (""Spectacular Nature""), its message to the public is falsely soothing: ""Don't worry; there are problems with the environment, but scientists and corporations are working together to solve them."" SeaWorld even outrageously says that by attending its park, people are contributing to protection of the oceans! Stop lying to the public, SeaWorld, and provide the public with the truth. Stop the Breeding: None of the species of dolphins, orcas and whales held in captivity are considered endangered, and aquariums breed them with little regard for genetic purity anyway. The only reason SeaWorld breeds dolphins and orcas and belugas are to produce more cetaceans for their silly shows. Most of the breeding is done through artificial insemination. Stop the breeding and stop the production of more miserable circus clowns. No More Captures of Wild Cetaceans: The capture of wild dolphins, orcas, and belugas, which has been depicted in documentaries like ""Blackfish"" and ""The Cove,"" is a horrendous and cruel activity. Many animals die during such captures. SeaWorld now claims that they do not catch dolphins, orcas and belugas in the wild anymore, but they once did, including buying dolphins from the dolphin slaughter at Iki Island, Japan. And SeaWorld is part of a consortium now trying to import 18 beluga whales captured in the wild in Russia. In other words, SeaWorld doesn't catch wild cetaceans anymore -- they pay the Russians and others to do it for them. Let us put an end to this nonsense and leave cetaceans in the wild where they belong.Consider Sea Pens: There is an alternative to the sterile concrete tanks that captive cetaceans now live in. In a sea pen, an area fenced off from the ocean, a captive orca or dolphin can experience the tides, the currents, the fish and the seasons as if in nature. Care and feeding could still be given to the animals. The Free Willy/Keiko Foundation kept the orca Keiko, the star of the hit movie ""Free Willy,"" in his home waters in Iceland for six years, most spent in a sea pen. Keiko was even taken out on the open ocean for ""walks"" in following a boat to and from his pen. And putting dolphins and whales in a sea pen does not mean ending public involvement -- seeing these animals in a more natural habitat can only enhance the educational experience. Sea pens are a good compromise between the deep ocean and the shallow sterile boxes on land where captive cetaceans are currently housed. SeaWorld has made millions off of performing dolphins and whales. It is time for them to give some of that money back and develop sea pens, carefully built and carefully sited, for the retirement of their captive cetaceans.Consider Releases Back Into the Wild: SeaWorld insists that none of the animals can be released back into the ocean, and they may be right. The question of which whale or dolphin might be able to survive in the wild is complex: Can they catch fish and feed themselves? Were they born in captivity or were they taken from the ocean? Are they in good health? Is there a chance they can be re-united with their home pod and family, or perhaps be integrated into another pod? These are questions for experts based on the best available scientific information and evaluation, not glib SeaWorld publicists and hacks. Many dolphins and one orca have been successfully returned to their ocean habitat -- some are still there and thriving. It is a question we should seriously ask.SeaWorld has a choice. They can continue to cast aspersions on their critics, and they can continue to deny the truth about their dolphins, orcas and belugas by spinning fantasies about how much these wild intelligent beings enjoy life in a small concrete tanks doing stupid circus tricks for the public. Or they can seize the opportunity to truly show their corporate integrity and do the right thing. I've outlined a few ideas above. We all know what SeaWorld SHOULD do. But will SeaWorld do it?"

Though I invited Danny Cortez to speak to multiple groups in North Texas, I just wasn't in it when I pulled up to the curb at the airport. Danny is an unassuming man small in stature and quick to smile. When he got in the car, I tried to strike up some small talk. Desperate to engage the greatest theological questions of our time, Danny wasn't interested in small talk.Our group was bigger than the venue and we had to find space with more room. Upon finding a suitable location, Danny Cortez started to tell his story. From the people that he sent to repairative therapy to the lesbian that has become one of his dearest friends to his gay son, we encountered the intensity with which Danny has wrestled with questions of orientation and gender. The conversion of Danny to a place of supporting full inclusion was a process. Though he knew it would cost him his job, Danny decided to tell his Southern Baptist congregation that he had changed his mind and now supported the celebration and participation of all people in the life of the church. Ultimately, Danny persuaded his church to keep him as their pastor and agree to disagree about issues of human sexuality and gender. The Southern Baptist Convention wasn't having it and kicked them out not long after the decision. In the group, most of the people listening didn't even think that such a church was possible. Danny repeated the same conclusion over and over again throughout the visit to every group and in every venue, ""As Christians, we must believe that the process is just as important as the destination.""From a home to a large progressive Baptist church to the largest LGBT church on the planet, Danny Cortez did not stop talking about love and embracing the other. Though I am much more radical and abrasive than Danny, his message caused a tremendous stirring in my soul. How do I treat those I disagree with? How do I love those who know nothing but hate? What would Jesus do in this age of polarities? The questions are not the most profound pieces of theology that I can muster, but I am more interested in following Jesus than profundity. I know that the follower of Christ must love well along the way. By choosing to believe that all people have value regardless of their beliefs and daring to seek to love them all, Danny is a dangerous man for all sides. Jesus was too.Amen."

After a hacking attack that the FBI has now officially connected to the government of North Korea, and subsequent threats by the hackers, theater chains refused to show the comedy The Interview and Sony eventually pulled it from distribution.  The question here is not about the wisdom of making the movie, or whether perceived quality determines its merits of being defended. As actor George Clooney has recently said,  With the First Amendment, you're never protecting Jefferson; it's usually protecting some guy who's burning a flag or doing something stupid. This is a silly comedy, but the truth is, what it now says about us is a whole lot. We have a responsibility to stand up against this. The First Amendment protects Americans' right to decide what they want to say, read, write, watch and listen to without interference from the government. Government officials do not always honor that principle and that is why organizations like ours that advocate for First Amendment values are a necessary bulwark to free expression in the arts as well as politics.  But censorship by government officials and agencies is not the only threat to freedom of expression. Back in 1998, the Manhattan Theatre Club initially cancelled its planned production of Terrence McNally's Corpus Christi when it received bomb threats. After an outcry by proponents of free expression, and with security precautions in place, the play eventually opened. People offended by the play's content were, of course, free to protest, and they did. But so were free expression advocates, and we marched as well. In the end, the show went on.  For The Interview, it appears for the moment, the show will not go on. It's hard to know exactly what motivated the theater chains that cancelled the show -- fear of making themselves the next hacking target, legitimate worries about the potential for violence and/or legal liability in the case of violence. The end result is that we have now allowed the government of North Korea to dictate content.   That is, to state the obvious, not an acceptable state of affairs. Judd Apatow, one of the first to speak out, tweeted earlier this week, ""I am not going to let a terrorist threat shut down freedom of speech. I am going to The Interview."" I think the vast majority of Americans, whatever their political persuasion, can applaud that spirit, and embrace Clooney's insistence, ""We cannot be told we can't see something by Kim Jong-un, of all f*cking people.""   This isn't about pointing fingers at theater owners or Sony. This week's events are an extreme example of the complicated questions free expression advocates around the world are facing as private corporations control more and more of the world's access to information and communications -- whether it's corporate control of internet service providers, search engines and social media channels, or efforts by regulators in some countries to require search engines like Google to censor the content they make available. These aren't traditional free expression questions, but they are ones that we must face.  It's time for a renewed national commitment to and celebration of the fundamental value of free expression. It is time to dedicate the intellectual and financial resources necessary to safeguard our online infrastructure. And maybe more importantly, it is time to assert a shared national will to stand up to those who would limit our freedom expression, whether they are corporate executives, government censors or foreign dictators who will happily export their political repression to our shores if we allow them to do so."
