7,SCIENCE,A Chat with Information Scientist Pedro Marijuán,"Suzan Mazur, ContributorAuthor, 'The Origin of Life Circus:  A How To Make Life Extrav...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-chat-with-information-s_b_11212594.html,,2016-08-06,2016-07-28-1469710774-5050670-PEDROCLEMENTEMARIJUAN.JPG,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-07-28-1469710774-5050670-PEDROCLEMENTEMARIJUAN-thumb.JPG,"PEDRO CLEMENTE MARIJUÁN While there is still no scientific consensus on what ""life"" is -- although that does not deter attempts to make life in the lab -- there is a growing conversation among scientists about life's ""information"" component. However, scientists also find it difficult articulating just what information is. So I phoned information scientist Pedro Clemente Marijuán in Spain to explore the subject. Marijuán's current research interests include ""the nature of intelligence and the nature of information, at the molecular-cellular and organismic (brain) levels."" Pedro Marijuán is Senior Research Scientist at Spain's Aragon Institute of Health Sciences (IACS) where he heads the Bioinformation Group. He has also served as IACS Research Director (2011-2015). In 1991, Marijuán co-founded FIS (Foundations of Information Science) with theoretical biologist Michael Conrad. Marijuán says one of the missions of FIS is ""organizing a sound body of new thinking about the informational cohesion of the physical, biological and social realms"" of science. He is also Vice-President for Protocol of the International Society for Information Studies (IS4SI). Pedro Marijuán's professional career began as an industrial engineer in the 1970s in Spain, working with computers in ""enterprise organization,"" after receiving his undergraduate degree in engineering from the Polytechnic University of Catalonia. Later inspired by  John von Neumann's ideas, Marijuán began his own investigations into cognitive neuroscience, which led to his PhD (University of Barcelona, 1989): ""On Natural Intelligence: The Evolution of Biological Information Processing."" In the early 1990s he was a Visiting Research Associate at the University of Chicago, working with microbiologist James Shapiro, as well as at the University of Canberra. Marijuán has taught engineering at the University of Zaragoza and is former SAMCA Chair at the Engineering School, University of Zaragoza.Through the years Pedro Marijuán has organized and co-organized international conferences on information science in Madrid, Vienna, Paris, Beijing, Gothenberg (upcoming, 2017) and elsewhere, and a regular series of seminars in Spain on biomedicine and neuroscience. He is author of the book, The Dual Brain and numerous other scientific publications, editor of ""Cajal and Consciousness"" (Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences) and of special issues on FIS published in the journals BioSystems and Symmetry: Culture and Science as well as of ""Selected Papers from 'FIS 2010 Beijing.'""One of Pedro Marijuán's other principal interests is understanding the sound of laughter, its structure, and using that information as a diagnostic tool in biomedicine. Our interview follows. Suzan Mazur: In between your careers as an industrial engineer and cognitive neuroscientist, you were a visiting research associate at the University of Chicago in the early 1990s, working with microbiologist James Shapiro. That's quite a range of expertise. What sort of research were you doing with Jim Shapiro in Chicago?Pedro Marijuán: I was advancing an informational scheme of the prokaryotic cell in relation to James Shapiro's interest in developing new evolutionary ideas. At the same time I was learning real biology from James -- I personally thank him for his hospitality and patience. However, I realized I needed stronger insights into the molecular machinery of the cell and into enzymes and proteins, so I began collaborating with biophysicist and theoretical biologist Michael Conrad as well as with enzymologist John Westley.   Both were relatively close to James Shapiro's interests. Michael Conrad was especially influential; Michael pioneered molecular computing and adaptability in ecological information processes. He looked beyond science in his work to philosophy, art, and literature. Suzan Mazur: Please tell me a little about your current research interests.Pedro Marijuán: Here at the Aragon Institute of Health Sciences (IACS) in Zaragoza, I'm investigating cellular signaling systems, social bonding, and human laughter. I and my small bioinformation group -- Jorge Navarro and Raquel del Moral -- are interested in studying everything alive that communicates: cells, organisms, people, and the way human society is structured through social bonds, i.e., language -- talking face-to-face, by phone, texting, etc. Because it's through language that human society evolved, grew complex and interesting. Suzan Mazur: Is this layering a perspective from your background in engineering?Pedro Marijuán: Perhaps. I was an industrial engineer here in Spain during the 1970s, working with computers, in the field of ""enterprise organization."" I got terribly excited about the possibility of similar information processes in the human brain and in society. Then I read John von Neumann's book comparing the human brain to a computer. I began to realize the informational scheme of the single cell was missing in the scientific literature. I began doing informal research and wrote some newspaper articles, which eventually led to my PhD [""On Natural Intelligence: The Evolution of Biological Information Processing""]. Suzan Mazur: IACS, where you're currently Senior Research Scientist -- this is an organization focused on biomedical research?Pedro Marijuán: IACS and its germane organization IIS Aragon cover all areas of biomedical research for the main hospitals in the Aragon region. Until the political change last year, I was Director of Research in charge of organizing teams, and focused on the many problems biomedical research has. I was reassigned as IACS Senior Research Scientist. Suzan Mazur: Information science research.Pedro Marijuán: Actually our group looks to find ways to apply information science to biomedicine. For example, we use information science as a diagnostic tool to study changes in the sound of laughter of depressed individuals. We've used it with EEG records, and to look for objective markers in fibromyalgia. We've also designed a questionnaire to gauge the sensitivity of the individual state of the sociotype. It's particularly helpful for the elderly because they suffer a lot from loneliness.Suzan Mazur: You first wrote on the informational patterns of laughter 10 or so years ago. What was the thrust of that paper?Suzan Mazur: I've interviewed Jaron Lanier, the ""father of virtual reality"" who has said regarding the digital world that humans may have taken a wrong turn for the right reasons and he predicts artificial intelligence ideology will reach a breaking point in Europe, but ""the US will break first certainly, as we'll find out."" His thinking is that human job displacement due to computerization and robotics will lead to a welfare state that can't be sustained. Pedro Marijuán: Something similar happened with the first industrial revolution, with the second industrial revolution, and now we are suffering the consequences of the information and computer revolution. We have not developed the tools to successfully integrate all these artificial information flows with our natural information flows. The adaptability of our social nature, of our sociotype, has been pushed to the extremes. In my info science parlance, the artificial flows of information that are reshaping the structures of our societies at tremendous speed are blind to the natural info flows to which our modest individual lives are upended. ""No one to talk with? Do not worry, here's a pet robot that will fill your nostalgic needs of social bonding."" The power structure does not care about impoverishing people throughout the world through tremendous economic disruption and loss of intermediation structures; it pushes for even more disruption, impervious to the social crisis. Suzan Mazur: Would you talk a little bit about your role as chair of the Foundations of Information Science and would you define what you mean by the term ""information""? Pedro Marijuán: I co-founded the Foundations of Information Science with Michael Conrad more than 20 years ago -- we coined the name FIS in 1992. Michael Conrad was a very great man, enormously enthusiastic and engaging. Among Michael's many contributions to science, he was one of the first to attempt an evolutionary model of the ""vertical information flow"" in brain behavior. He passed away in 2000. Michael brought most of the specific scientific content to FIS, while the multidisciplinary vision of FIS was largely mine.Suzan Mazur: What do you mean by the term ""information""? I once interviewed physicist Sara Walker on the subject. She's a collaborator of Paul Davies at Arizona State University. Walker defined information as ""events that affect and direct the states of a dynamic system."" How do you define it?Suzan Mazur: Is biosemiotics part of this?Pedro Marijuán: Not really. Most of biosemiotics follows more or less directly the central dogma of Francis Crick, i.e., that information flows from DNA to RNA to proteins. And this is like basic mechanics. This is mechanical information that the cell has, of course. But, again, the cell communicates with the environment via specific signaling pathways. This is the essence of all prokaryotic activity. And this is the essence of multicellular development. The whole signaling system has enormous complexity, even in ""simple"" prokaryotes, as they have sophisticated signaling with the environment -- the ""1-2-3 component systems scheme."" But the whole of biosemiotics, so to speak, is not founded on the ability to distinguish signals from the environment, to transduce them, and to build their meaning -- biosemiotics is mostly focused on abstracting transcription-translation flows.Almost everybody has taken a shortcut in applying information views to life. Most have followed communication engineering (Claude Shannon). Others have taken the Turing machine view. Others von Neumann's operating system. And biosemiotics also is taking a shortcut, Peircean (Charles Sanders Peirce, ""the father of pragmatism"") -- though the generalization may be unjust for some biosemiotic works. Suzan Mazur: You're doing investigations into the dozens of signaling pathways, Wnt, Hedgehog, Notch, etc.Pedro Marijuán: Yes, absolutely. We've written a couple of useful articles devoted to prokaryotic signaling and eukaryotic signaling on ""cellular intelligences,"" about how productive information flows and communicative information flows are handled intelligently, adaptively, around the essential core of the life cycle. . . .Suzan Mazur: How large is your foundation, FIS? Has it grown a lot over the last 20 years?Pedro Marijuán: It's a public place, and I'm coordinating and promoting the discussion sessions. There is a healthy plurality of views. We conference online, and we meet every two years or so.  Europeans, Americans and scientists from other countries are well represented in FIS. We have a remarkable representation of Chinese intellectuals and scientists, who are very involved in information science and who are doing interesting philosophical research as well as introducing information science into their educational and research systems.

It's in short supply because our brains are wired to overreact to uncertainty with fear. As uncertainty increases, the brain shifts control over to the limbic system, the place where emotions, such as anxiety and panic, are generated.This brain quirk worked well eons ago, when cavemen entered an unfamiliar area and didn't know who or what might be lurking behind the bushes. Overwhelming caution and fear ensured survival, but that's not the case today. This mechanism, which hasn't evolved, is a hindrance in the world of business, where uncertainty rules and important decisions must be made every day with minimal information.Craving CertaintyWe crave certainty. Our brains are so geared up for certainty that our subconscious can monitor and store over two million data points, which the brain uses to predict the future. And that isn't just a neat little side trick--it's the primary purpose of the neocortex, which is 76% of the brain's total mass.Our brains reward us for certainty. If our nomadic ancestors were anxious about where their next meal was coming from, finding it would result in increased dopamine levels in their brains in addition to a full stomach. You get the same rush from listening to music that has a predictable repeating pattern or from completing a puzzle. Predictable activities satisfy our craving for certainty.  Great Leadership Requires ConvictionIn business, things change so quickly that there's a great deal of uncertainty about what's going to happen next month, let alone next year. And uncertainty takes up a lot of people's mental energy and makes them less effective at their jobs.The brain perceives uncertainty as a threat, which sparks the release of cortisol, a stress hormone that disrupts memory, depresses the immune system, and increases the risk of high blood pressure and depression. These are things no leader wants her team to endure.Leaders with conviction create an environment of certainty for everyone. When a leader is absolutely convinced that he's chosen the best course of action, everyone who follows him unconsciously absorbs this belief and the accompanying emotional state. Mirror neurons are responsible for this involuntary response. They mirror the emotional states of other people--especially those we look to for guidance. This ensures that leaders with conviction put us at ease.Leaders with conviction show us that the future is certain and that we're all headed in the right direction. Their certainty is neurologically shared by everyone.When leaders have conviction, people's brains can relax, so to speak, letting them concentrate on what needs to be done. When people feel more secure in the future, they're happier and produce higher quality work.A leader who can demonstrate conviction will be more successful, and so will everyone she works with. Amplifying your sense of conviction is easier than you think. The following traits of leaders with great conviction will show you the way.1. They're strong (not harsh). Strength is an important quality in a leader with conviction. People will wait to see if a leader is strong before they decide to follow his or her lead. People need courage in their leader. They need someone who can make difficult decisions and watch over the good of the group. They need a leader who will stay the course when things get tough. People are far more likely to show strength themselves when their leader does the same.A lot of leaders mistake domineering, controlling, and otherwise harsh behavior for strength. They think that taking control and pushing people around will somehow inspire a loyal following. Strength isn't something you can force on people; it's something you earn by demonstrating it time and again in the face of adversity. Only then will people trust that they should follow you.2. They know when to trust their gut. Our ancestors relied on their intuition--their gut instinct--for survival. Since most of us don't face life-or-death decisions every day, we have to learn how to use this instinct to our benefit. Often we make the mistake of talking ourselves out of listening to our gut instinct, or we go too far in the other direction and impulsively dive into a situation, mistaking our assumptions for instincts. Leaders with conviction recognize and embrace the power of their gut instincts, and they rely on some tried-and-true strategies to do so successfully:They recognize their own filters. They're able to identify when they're being overly influenced by their assumptions and emotions or by another person's opinion. Their ability to filter out the feelings that aren't coming from their intuition helps them focus on what is.They give their intuition some space. Gut instincts can't be forced. Our intuition works best when we're not pressuring it to come up with a solution. Albert Einstein said he had his best ideas while sailing, and when Steve Jobs was faced with a tough problem, he'd head out for a walk.They build a track record. Leaders with conviction take the time to practice their intuition. They start by listening to their gut on small things and seeing how it goes so that they'll know whether they can trust it when something big comes around.3. They're relentlessly positive. Leaders with conviction see a brighter future with crystal clarity, and they have the energy and enthusiasm to ensure that everyone else can see it too. Their belief in the good is contagious. While this might look natural, leaders with conviction know how to turn on the positivity when the going gets tough. Positive thoughts quiet fear and irrational thinking by focusing the brain's attention on something that is completely stress free. When things are going well and your mood is good, this is relatively easy; when you're stressing over a tough decision and your mind is flooded with negative thoughts, this can be a challenge. Leaders with conviction hone this skill.4. They're confident (not cocky). We gravitate to confident leaders because confidence is contagious, and it helps us to believe that there are great things in store. The trick, as a leader, is to make certain your confidence doesn't slip into arrogance and cockiness. Confidence is about passion and belief in your ability to make things happen, but when your confidence loses touch with reality, you begin to think that you can do things you can't and have done things you haven't. Suddenly it's all about you. This arrogance makes you lose credibility.Confident leaders are still humble. They don't allow their accomplishments and position of authority to make them feel that they're better than anyone else. As such, they don't hesitate to jump in and do the dirty work when needed, and they don't ask their followers to do anything they aren't willing to do themselves.  5. They embrace that which they can't control. We all like to be in control. After all, people who feel like they're at the mercy of their surroundings never get anywhere in life. But this desire for control can backfire when you see everything that you can't control or don't know as a personal failure. Leaders with conviction aren't afraid to acknowledge what's out of their control. Their conviction comes from an unwavering belief in their ability to control those things that they can. They don't paint a situation as better or worse than it actually is, and they analyze the facts for what they are. They know that the only thing they really control is the process through which they reach their decisions. That's the only rational way to handle the unknown and the best way to keep your head on level ground.6. They're role models (not preachers). Leaders with conviction inspire trust and admiration through their actions, not just their words. Many leaders say that something is important to them, but leaders with conviction walk their talk every day. Harping about the behavior you want to see in people all day long has a tiny fraction of the impact you achieve by demonstrating that behavior yourself.  7. They're emotionally intelligent. The limbic system (where emotions are generated in the brain) responds to uncertainty with a knee-jerk fear reaction, and fear inhibits good decision making. Leaders with conviction are wary of this fear and spot it as soon as it begins to surface. In this way, they demonstrate emotional intelligence and contain the fear before it gets out of control. Once they are aware of the fear, they label all the irrational thoughts that try to intensify it as irrational fears­--not reality­--and the fear subsides. Then they can focus more accurately and rationally on the information they have to go on. Throughout the process, they remind themselves that a primitive part of their brain is trying to take over and that the logical part needs to be the one in charge. In other words, they tell their limbic system to settle down and be quiet until a hungry tiger shows up.8. They don't ask, ""What if?"" ""What if?"" questions throw fuel on the fire of stress and worry, and there's no place for them in your thinking once you have good contingency plans in place. Things can go in a million different directions, and the more time you spend worrying about the possibilities, the less time you'll spend focusing on taking action that will calm you down and keep your stress under control. Leaders with conviction know that asking ""what if?"" will only take them to a place they don't want, or need, to go to.  9. They're willing to take a bullet for their people. Leaders with conviction will do anything for their teams, and they have their people's backs, no matter what. They don't try to shift blame, and they don't avoid shame when they fail. They're never afraid to say, ""The buck stops here,"" and they earn people's trust by backing them up. Leaders with conviction make it clear that they welcome challenges, criticism, and viewpoints other than their own. They know that an environment where people are afraid to speak up, offer insights, and ask good questions is destined for failure.  Bringing It All TogetherConviction assures people that their work matters. They know that if they focus all their energy and attention in a determined direction, it will yield results. This belief does more than put people at ease--it creates a self-fulfilling prophecy of success.Have you ever worked for a leader with conviction? Did it bring out the best in you?

14,HEALTHY LIVING,"Integrative Scientist Pizzorno: ""Toxicity is the Primary Driver of Disease""","John Weeks, ContributorPublisher and Editor, Integrator Blog News & Reports",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/integrative-scientist-piz_b_11353632.html,,2016-08-06,2016-08-05-1470421229-8733640-socialdeterminants_health250.PNG,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-08-05-1470421229-8733640-socialdeterminants_health250-thumb.PNG,"Regular medicine is awakening to the dumbfounding reality that clinical care accounts for just 10%-20% of the factors contributing to health. But if research recently presented by a leader in the revitalization of the naturopathic medical profession - and of the movements for functional and integrative medicine - is correct, even the most aggressive adopters of the new thinking are still missing the boat. The new thinking argues that if we want to create health, we need to address things like poverty, education, genetics and healthy behaviors. The figure describes these.Yet according to best-selling author and researcher Joseph Pizzorno, ND, even these new adopters are grossly understating the most significant factor. In a recent presentation at Snowbird, Utah at the annual conference of the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians, Pizzorno presented compelling evidence that - if his calculations hold up - ""toxicity is the primary driver of disease."" Pizzorno, the co-author of the Textbook of Natural Medicine - the first major textbook detailing the evidence behind natural therapeutics - is the leading figure in the re-emergence of the naturopathic medical profession over the past 40 years. The founding president of what is now Bastyr University is presently the editor of the peer-reviewed and PubMed-indexed scientific publication, Integrative Medicine: A Clinician's Journal. Since leaving the Bastyr presidency, Pizzorno led a multi-year employee health project with a significant Canadian employer. Through it, he opened his eyes further to what he now believes is the most important yet grossly under-respected target for remedial action if health is our goal.Pizzorno and colleagues first shared well-known data showing that our present chronic disease epidemics - including obesity, diabetes, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and kidney disease - are temporally associated with a parallel rise in environmental pollutants. The worst are what are called POPS - ""persistent organic pollutants."" These are chemical compounds that are defined as ""resistant to environmental degradation through chemical, biological, and photolytic processes."" They have long half-lives and hang around in our soils and tissues. The parallel arcs of increase - see the graph below -- in each from 1960s to the present are startling. In his presentation, Pizzorno showed that, in contradistinction, the sugar-and-diabetes relationship is not nearly as compelling. In his presentation, Pizzorno then described a mathematical model he and his team built for predicting the ""attributable fraction"" of a disease that can be linked to specific chemical exposures. The team worked out data for high profile POPS: DDT, glyphosates, arsenic, lead, vinyl chloride and a dozen more. The conclusions are ugly. Reported Pizzorno: ""Greater than 50% of ADHD is due to just 3 toxins. Over 50% of diabetes is due to phthalates, arsenic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons."" His team found direct correlations between specific POPs and IQ decreases in children. Individual toxins were found to have profound impacts on numerous serious diseases. ""Nearly 45% of Alzheimer's,"" reported Pizzorno, ""is linked to DDT alone."" The calculations put the attributable fraction of arsenic to prostate cancer at 31.5%. Over 40% of gout in women is arsenic related. PCBs had a high association with heart attacks. And on and on.The POPS are everywhere. Pizzorno presented a slide that denoted the following proportional sources: food (70%), water (10%), house and yard chemicals (10%), air (5%) and health and beauty aids (5%). I asked Pizzorno after the talk if the formula has been vetted. He responded that he'd had it reviewed by multiple scientists and the method is under discussion. He added that ""the results are so surprising that all possible critiques need to be thoroughly considered."" That process continues.The week after the presentation, I opened my email to a document from the Health and Medicine Division of the National Academies of Sciences entitled ""The Interplay Between Environmental Chemical Exposures and Obesity: Proceedings of a Workshop."" The workshop was a world removed from the gathering of naturopathic physicians to whom Pizzorno presented his findings. Yet they had similar conclusions. Instead of naturopathic doctors whose whole system world views dispose them toward anticipating health problems from toxins, the report sponsors included Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell and Colgate Palmolive. Yet here, too, according to the introduction to the report, ""the speakers at the workshop discussed evidence from both studies with animal models and human epidemiological studies that exposure to environmental chemicals is linked both to weight gain and to glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, inflammation, and other aspects of the metabolic syndrome.""Their content was neither as wide-ranging or causality-specific as that presented by Pizzorno. Yet the agreement that addressing diet and lifestyle alone are not going to get to the bottom of the huge and costly obesity epidemic is strong. And it should not surprise that the naturopathic and integrative medicine communities remain a few steps ahead of regular medicine in respecting the damage of these agents in human health.The implications of Pizzorno's research and analysis are profound. The piece of the pie chart above on determinants of health would need to vastly expand from the 10% share attributed to the ""physical environment"" to reflect the corrosive, disruptive forces of toxins on our tissues and life processes. Presidential candidates vie over whether we need $1-trillion or $500-billion or $250-billion to begin to get our nation's infrastructure in order. But what is the budget needed for economic conversion from POPS-riddled industry, agriculture, energy production, food processing, housing and consumer goods to methods in each of these arenas that co-habit with human health?

But there's a new twist to the ongoing story. There aren't any women on his list of economic advisors. And asked yesterday about what women he might appoint to his Cabinet if he wins, he replied:""I can tell you everybody would say, 'Put Ivanka in, put Ivanka in,' you know that, right? She's very popular, she's done very well, and you know Ivanka very well.""Think about the stupendous lack of judgment involved in making a comment like that. What's his daughter's expertise? She's been a model. She's designed jewelry. She once hosted the Miss Teen USA Pageant. And of course, she works for Daddy. As for popularity, why not Taylor Swift, who's beloved by many more people, if that's a criterion for a Cabinet post.Trump couldn't come up with the name of a single woman governor, member of Congress, diplomat, professor, economist, jurist or anyone in any field qualifying her for a government position. As he likes to say in his tweets: Sad!And it's also illegal. Trump doesn't even know the law.Trump compounded his ignorance about who should be in his Cabinet by telling his woman interviewer, ""But there really are so many that are really talented people -- like you, you're so talented, but I don't know if your viewers know that."" Why would he suggest a TV personality few people have ever heard of? Because she used to work for him in his organization.So there you have it: his first choices are his daughter and a former employee. Why not Olivia Pope from Scandal? She knows her way around Washington. Oh, wait, she's fictional--like so much that Trump says.....Lev Raphael is the author of 25 books in genres from mystery to memoir that you can find on Amazon."

AFP PHOTO/SAMUEL KUBANI (Photo credit should read SAMUEL KUBANI/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5baf9e50250000360037e945.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When circumstances change, it might be time to reframe one's argument. Rebranding is a way of life in America, and it could work for the Movement as well. I've been attending the 2016 Lavender Law conference in DC this past week, following on the heels of the Democratic National Convention, last week, and have some thoughts.For over a decade now I've been speaking and teaching on the biological and medical fundamentals of gender identity, and was extremely pleased to read the brief of the United States v. State of North Carolina filed on May 9, 2016, in response to the odious North Carolina HB2. The attorneys at the Justice Department saw fit to educate the court, not known for its scientific expertise, in the fundamentals of human biology. While many LGB attorneys were dismayed by that action, I believe it was necessary, and long overdue.I say that because the opposition to trans persons, be it the Pope's appalling statement based on his shocking ignorance that somehow children are being taught they can choose their gender saying that trans people represent the ""annihilation of mankind"" and trans children are a form of ""ideological colonization,"" or the usual hate spewed by organizations like the American Family Association and Family Research Council, is always reduced to biology. Our adversaries always come back to sex, whatever euphemism they use -- ""biological male/female,"" chromosomes, genes, etc.And it does come back to ""sex"" in the legal arena, because it's the three words from the 1964 Civil Rights Act added to Title VII, ""because of sex,"" that are a commonsensical bridge to gender identity protections and trans liberation. I'm a physician and scientist, so I'm drawn to scientific metaphors, analogies and explanations. I recognize using them is just one way to fight the battle, and maybe not the best way in some circumstances, but since our adversaries are drawn to such language, we must respond in kind. And, as I've noted over the years, it has been the growing recognition in federal court since 2000 that ""sex"" does include gender identity (and, more recently, sexual orientation), that creates the opening to move us forward legally as well as culturally.Over the past few years we've been routinely using the phrases ""assigned male (female) at birth"" to explain that trans persons are born trans, that we don't simply choose it as the Pope foolishly imagines. That phrase doesn't role off the tongue, and the acronym, AMAB/AFAB, isn't well known. When the script for the recent trans rights ad that was produced for the political conventions was being written the term was considered and rejected because it's too arcane.What I've been teaching, however, is that the problems that most trans persons face result from one simple, cursory observation -- the sex identification announced by the pediatrician in the delivery room. That observation, no more than a best guess, is rapid and accurate 98-99 percent of the time, so it's been very useful. But trans persons, because of the circumstances of their birth, bear a burden for their entire lives because in their cases it is mistaken. If we had a birth sign that distinguished our gender identity, rather than our genital anatomy, there would be no problem. Alas, we do not.So what gender transition comes down to is not a choice, and not a whim, but a foundational biological awareness of trans humans that they have the right to correct that medical error and live their authentic lives. Correct the medical error -- doctors do make mistakes, and some are very costly mistakes for which their patients pay, on occasion, with their lives. We need to acknowledge this is one class of mistake which can easily be rectified. Trans women are women, and trans men are men, as Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta said to the nation on May 9th.That reframe -- Correct the medical error -- has a legal analogue. As I mentioned earlier, the courts have prohibited discrimination (in employment) on the basis of sex since 1964, with the progress accelerating since the landmark Supreme Court decision, Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, in 1989. Since the 1980s the courts have routinely carved out exceptions for gay and trans persons, with Ulane v. Eastern Airlines in 1984 being the most notable. Like Eastern Airlines, these exceptions should be completely dead and buried.The trans community has benefited from a change in judicial culture since 2004 with the Smith case, winning most of our federal court cases since then. The LGB community is a much later addition to such success, with the first victories occurring in 2011 in the federal sector Veretto and Castello cases, and most recently the EEOC's landmark Baldwin v. Foxx last year.Missing from our understanding and, hence, active arguing, for our civil rights, has been the fact that, like the medical underpinning of gender transition, our federal court actions are based, as explained by EEO Commissioner Chai Feldblum, on an attempt to correct an error from the past. Correct the legal error -- the Congress never carved out an exception to ""because of sex"" for sexual orientation or gender identity (except for Jesse Helms' hostile amendment to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 did not have carve-outs). Federal judges did, beginning in the 80's, based on ignorance, prejudice, ideology or politics. In 1964 Congress did not know any trans persons, and if they did know gay ones they would not discuss them in polite company. Maybe if they had been able to they would have carved out an exception, but they didn't. It was only the activist conservative judges of the late 20th century who changed the plain meaning of the Civil Rights Act. Hence, all that our advocates and plaintiffs have been doing in the past few decades is correct those errors committed by the Reagan-era activist judges, who knew nothing of basic biology and were motivated by sufficient prejudice that they couldn't see just how obvious it was that both gender identity and sexual orientation were manifestations of sex.We are at one of those forehead-slapping, face-palming moments, when the courts, building off the decade of trans victories is now ready, post-Obergefell, to do the same for the LGB community. Just read Judge Rovner's decision in the recent 7th Circuit Hively v. Ivy Tech Community College case, where she twists herself into a pretzel looking for some way to rule for Ms. Hively, before ultimately conceding defeat based on precedence, or stare decisis. She was begging for help from the Supreme Court, or an en banc sitting of the entire 7th Circuit (which Greg Nevins of Lambda Legal is requesting) to follow her logic to its inevitable conclusion -- that sexual orientation is a form of sex.This is one of those losses that is really a victory when you dig more deeply. The door was opened last year when, in oral argument during the Obergefell case, the Chief Justice himself recognized that same-sex discrimination was sex discrimination. In a response to Michigan attorney John Bursch, the Chief Justice said, I'm not sure it's necessary to get into sexual orientation to resolve the case. I mean, if Sue loves Joe and Tom loves Joe, Sue can marry him and Tom can't. And the difference is based upon their different sex. Why isn't that a straightforward question of sexual discrimination?Indeed, and the federal appeals court judges across the country have taken note of that, most importantly the 7th Circuit's David Hamilton, who has also made a similar comment. I hope for the same from his fellow judges, Wood, Posner and Estabrook. The neon sign is flashing, or, to use an archaism, the handwriting is on the wall, and it's in a large, bold font -- Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity is, per se, sex discrimination."

The eastern Mediterranean has witnessed two military coups in the last three years: Egypt's on July 3, 2013, and Turkey's on July 16, 2016. In both cases, it appeared that the military stepped in to oppose a president committed to the steady centralization and Islamization of the country's government. Both ruling political parties, Egypt's Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) and Turkey's Justice and Development Party (AKP), had their roots in the Muslim Brotherhood, and both parties have been accused of having a hidden agenda, notwithstanding their avowed commitment to respecting the political process. The similarities notwithstanding, the coups had widely different outcomes, and their consequences will have far reaching implications for the international politics of the Middle East.The Egyptian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood had announced the formation of the Freedom and Justice Party on February 21, 2011, in the wake of the 17 day, Arab Spring inspired, revolution that had toppled the Mubarak government. The party's leadership, President Mohamed Morsi, Vice President Essam el-Erian and Secretary General Saad El-Katatni, were all chosen from the Muslim Brotherhood's ""Guidance Office,"" the organization's senior leadership council. The Muslim Brotherhood was founded in Egypt, in 1928, as a Sunni Islamist religious, political and social movement committed to installing the Quran and the Sunnah as the foundation of the state and society, and the adoption of the religious Sharia law. Initially, the group focused on charitable and educational work for the poorer strata of Egyptian society, but it quickly emerged as a major political force and played a prominent role in the Egyptian nationalist and anti-colonial movement. From Egypt the organization spread throughout the Middle East and North Africa. Its model of melding charitable works with political activism has been widely adopted by a number of Muslim Brotherhood inspired organizations - most notably Hamas.The FJP made quick political inroads in post-Mubarak Egypt. It won just under half of the seats in the 2011 Egyptian parliamentary elections, which when combined with the support of the Salafist Al Nour Party, gave it an overwhelming majority. Mohamed Morsi contested the 2012 presidential election for the FJP, polling 51.7 percent of the vote to become the first democratically elected president of Egypt.Morsi's term as president quickly became controversial. The FJP used its majority in the Egyptian Parliament to force through a controversial constitution. Morsi issued a ""temporary"" constitutional declaration, later rescinded, that granted him unlimited powers, including the power to legislate without judicial review, which made all presidential decisions final and irrefutable until a People's Assembly was elected. In the meantime, he moved aggressively to appoint Muslim Brotherhood members to key judicial and administrative posts. His opponents called the moves a de facto ""Islamist coup."" By June 2013, anti-Morsi protests and pro-Morsi counter protests had become a daily ritual in Egypt's principal cities. On June 30, 2014, more than 14 million demonstrators, according to the Egyptian military, took to the streets to protest against Morsi. The next day, more than a million protestors converged on Cairo's Tahir Square. That same day, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAFs), the Egyptian military's ruling council, issued a 48-hour ultimatum to Egypt's political parties, ""to meet the will of the Egyptian people."" Egyptian protests against Mubarak government, January 2011 Two days later the Egyptian military detained Morsi and placed him under house arrest. The leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood was also arrested. In December 2013, the Muslim Brotherhood was declared a terrorist group. The organization was dissolved and its assets seized by the government. Since then, between 15,000 and 20,000 Muslim Brotherhood members have been arrested and imprisoned by the Egyptian government. Morsi was subsequently tried in Egypt for inciting violence, as well as a number of other charges. He was found guilty and given the death penalty. As of August 2016, he remains incarcerated. The head of the Egyptian armed forces, General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, was subsequently elected as the sixth president of Egypt. The election, which was boycotted by the Muslim Brotherhood and most political parties, resulted in el-Sisi winning 93 percent of the vote. In one sense, the election of el-Sisi signaled a return to the military dominated governments that have marked Egypt's politics since the July 23, 1952 revolution. The military has continued its historic role as a major player in Egypt's economy and as a government contractor. In September 2013, for example, the Egyptian government awarded building contracts, without any competitive bidding, totaling one billion dollars, to companies controlled by the Egyptian Army.On the other hand, el- Sisi has moved to defuse religious partisanship, becoming the first Egyptian president to attend a Christmas mass. He has called for the reform and modernization of Islam and moved to regulate sermons and school textbooks that ""incite violence and intolerance."" He has also moved to reign in Jihadist groups in Egypt and is fighting an Islamic State affiliated insurgency in the Sinai. El-Sisi has also called for a national goal to remove unsafe slums within two years, and outlined plans to build 850,000 housing units. By the spring of 2016, approximately 125,000 units have been built. Other ambitious plans include the widening of the Suez Canal (completed in July 2015), the creation of new industrial zones along the canal and a 2,600-mile expansion of the national road network. There are even plans to build a new capital city halfway between Cairo and Suez to relive Cairo's chronic overcrowding. Notwithstanding the historic unreliability of polling data in the Middle East, El-Sisi appears to be widely popular in Egypt, with most polls putting his approval rating between 70 and 80 percent. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, making the rabia sign in solidarity with Muslim Brotherhood protestors in Egypt, July 2013Turkey's Justice and Development Party was founded in 2001, under the leadership of Abdullah Gull, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Fetullah Gulen. The party, which had long standing ties to the Turkish branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, has been in continuous power in Turkey since winning the 2002 parliamentary elections. From 2002 through 2014, Erdogan was the leader of the AKP. In August 2014, he was elected president of Turkey. When it was first founded, the AKP described itself as a pro-Western and pro-American conservative party, with ""an agenda of social conservatism and economic liberalism."" The party's tenure occurred during a period of unprecedented economic growth in Turkey. Critics, however, have accused the AKP of having a hidden agenda, and that it was pursuing policies designed to move the country away from the secular principals enshrined in the Turkish constitution. Over the course of the last decade, and increasingly since he became president, Erdogan's critics have accused him of attempting to consolidate greater power, and of making the Turkish government increasingly authoritarian. Under Erdogan, the AKP has pushed for a strong, centralized government built around a presidential system of government and has reduced the number of government positions filled by popular elections in favor of state appointed ones. The government has moved to tightly regulate Internet use, and to discourage abortions and alcohol consumption. It has been heavy-handed in its use of the courts to punish its critics, especially those in the press. At last count, Erdogan had initiated more than 1,500 lawsuits, since withdrawn after the failed coup attempt, against various defendants, many in the media, for ""slandering"" the office of the presidency. Under Erdogan, Turkey's historic pro-Western foreign policy has been seen as increasingly Pan-Islamist. Ankara has voiced support for the Hamas government in Gaza, organizing ""volunteers"" to deliver needed supplies to the region, a move that led to a highly publicized split with the Israeli government, since repaired, when Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) intervened to block the ships from landing in Gaza. The Turkish government has also been heavily involved with the Free Syrian Army and other rebel groups fighting the Assad government. It has also been accused of aiding radical jihadist groups, like the Islamic State and the al-Nusra Front, and to turning a blind eye to Islamic States' smuggling of oil and antiquities into Turkey, or to the transit of jihadist fighters across its territory.Anti-Erdogan, Protect Your Republic protests, April 14, 2007 On July 15, 2016, a group of Turkish officers, calling themselves the Peace at Home Council, declared that it had launched a coup against the government of President Erdogan. The Peace Council claimed that it had been forced to act by the erosion of secularism in Turkey at the hands of the government. The very term ""Peace at Home"" harkened back to a famous saying by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the secular Turkish Republic, following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I. Ataturk had described his policy as ""Peace at Home, Peace in the World."" The council also cited the Erdogan's government disregard for human rights and its steady reduction of democratic rule. The coup proved short lived. Erdogan, in a Facetime interview with CNN Turkey, urged his supporters to take to the streets in defiance of the military imposed curfew. In Istanbul, General Salih Zeki Colak, commander of the First Army General Command, one of the four field armies of the Turkish military, declared that the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) did not support the coup. Over the course of the next 24 hours, military forces loyal to the Turkish government, supported by local police forces, rounded up the rebels. Eight military officers escaped to Greece where they asked for political asylum. In total, 300 people were killed and 2,100 people injured in the coup attempt. Erdogan claimed that the coup attempt had been organized by Fetullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric and political activist, who has self-exiled himself to the United States. Gulen was one of the founders of the AKP and was a close ally of Erdogan for many years. The two found themselves increasingly at odds until they had a complete falling out in 2013, when Erdogan accused Gulen of being the mastermind behind the corruption investigations that exposed the rampant cronyism in the Erdogan government. Since then, Gulen has been accused of being a terrorist and has outstanding arrest warrants against him from Turkey. Ankara has repeatedly demanded his extradition to Turkey from the United States.Erdogan also accused the United States and General Joseph Votel, the head of U.S. Central Command, in particular, of ""siding with the coup plotters."" On August 2, Erdogan accused the United States and Europe of supporting the coup plotters and ""taking their side."" That same day, the Turkish government filed criminal complaints against General Joseph Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, and General Joseph Votel. Turkish newspapers have accused the CIA of being behind the abortive coup and of attempting to assassinate Turkish President Erdogan. According to the New York Times, a majority of Turks believe the U.S. had a hand in planning the coup. Gulen, on the other hand, has accused the Erdogan government of staging the coup in order to create a pretext to carry out further purges of the judiciary, schools and military, all centers of anti-Erdogan opposition, and to impose further curbs on civil liberties.In the roughly three weeks since the failed coup, over 8,000 people have been arrested, including 2,839 members of the Turkish armed forces, and 2,745 judges. Another 8,000 or so people have been detained, although not yet charged with any crime. In addition, 15,000 teachers and staff at Turkish government schools and in the Education Ministry were suspended, and a further 21,000 teachers in private schools had their teaching licenses revoked. In total, around 50,000 government officials and employees have been suspended. The government has also ordered three news agencies, 16 TV stations, 23 radio stations and 45 newspapers, 15 magazines and 20 publishers to close down their operations. Regardless of the origins of the Turkish coup attempt, there is little doubt that the Erdogan government is using it as a pretext to rid itself of many of its long-standing critics in the media, government, military and education sectors. Two coups, two very different outcomes - both of which will have long-term consequences for Mid-East stability. In Egypt the el-Sisi government seems committed to rationalizing the Egyptian economy and improving social services for the country's most downtrodden. The cronyism, which has ensured that Egypt's military leadership profited from government contracts and its privileged role in the Egyptian economy, however, shows no sign of changing. In Turkey, on the other hand, the AKP is clearly on a course to consolidating its power and, under the Erdogan presidency, centralizing governmental authority at the expense of civil liberties and a more pluralistic and secular society. How far that process will go, and the extent that the Erdogan government will abandon the secularism enshrined in the Kemal Revolution of 1922, remains to be seen. What is clear is that the path that Turkey is following is one that will put it increasingly at odds with the United States, Europe and, more importantly, with its NATO allies. NATO has had authoritarian governments among its members before, but it has never had an increasingly pro-Islamist government. Whether Turkey's Islamist stance can be reconciled with NATO's growing role in countering jihadist inspired violence remains to be seen. For Washington, trying to keep its anti-Islamic State coalition intact, while trying to mediate between Kurdish aspirations and Turkish fears, not to mention Russian intervention and ever growing Iranian support for the Assad regime, the war in Syria against the Islamic State is about to get even more complicated."

The eastern Mediterranean has witnessed two military coups in the last three years: Egypt's on July 3, 2013, and Turkey's on July 16, 2016. In both cases, it appeared that the military stepped in to oppose a president committed to the steady centralization and Islamization of the country's government. Both ruling political parties, Egypt's Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) and Turkey's Justice and Development Party (AKP), had their roots in the Muslim Brotherhood, and both parties have been accused of having a hidden agenda, notwithstanding their avowed commitment to respecting the political process. The similarities notwithstanding, the coups had widely different outcomes, and their consequences will have far reaching implications for the international politics of the Middle East.The Egyptian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood had announced the formation of the Freedom and Justice Party on February 21, 2011, in the wake of the 17 day, Arab Spring inspired, revolution that had toppled the Mubarak government. The party's leadership, President Mohamed Morsi, Vice President Essam el-Erian and Secretary General Saad El-Katatni, were all chosen from the Muslim Brotherhood's ""Guidance Office,"" the organization's senior leadership council. The Muslim Brotherhood was founded in Egypt, in 1928, as a Sunni Islamist religious, political and social movement committed to installing the Quran and the Sunnah as the foundation of the state and society, and the adoption of the religious Sharia law. Initially, the group focused on charitable and educational work for the poorer strata of Egyptian society, but it quickly emerged as a major political force and played a prominent role in the Egyptian nationalist and anti-colonial movement. From Egypt the organization spread throughout the Middle East and North Africa. Its model of melding charitable works with political activism has been widely adopted by a number of Muslim Brotherhood inspired organizations - most notably Hamas.The FJP made quick political inroads in post-Mubarak Egypt. It won just under half of the seats in the 2011 Egyptian parliamentary elections, which when combined with the support of the Salafist Al Nour Party, gave it an overwhelming majority. Mohamed Morsi contested the 2012 presidential election for the FJP, polling 51.7 percent of the vote to become the first democratically elected president of Egypt.Morsi's term as president quickly became controversial. The FJP used its majority in the Egyptian Parliament to force through a controversial constitution. Morsi issued a ""temporary"" constitutional declaration, later rescinded, that granted him unlimited powers, including the power to legislate without judicial review, which made all presidential decisions final and irrefutable until a People's Assembly was elected. In the meantime, he moved aggressively to appoint Muslim Brotherhood members to key judicial and administrative posts. His opponents called the moves a de facto ""Islamist coup."" By June 2013, anti-Morsi protests and pro-Morsi counter protests had become a daily ritual in Egypt's principal cities. On June 30, 2014, more than 14 million demonstrators, according to the Egyptian military, took to the streets to protest against Morsi. The next day, more than a million protestors converged on Cairo's Tahir Square. That same day, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAFs), the Egyptian military's ruling council, issued a 48-hour ultimatum to Egypt's political parties, ""to meet the will of the Egyptian people."" Egyptian protests against Mubarak government, January 2011 Two days later the Egyptian military detained Morsi and placed him under house arrest. The leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood was also arrested. In December 2013, the Muslim Brotherhood was declared a terrorist group. The organization was dissolved and its assets seized by the government. Since then, between 15,000 and 20,000 Muslim Brotherhood members have been arrested and imprisoned by the Egyptian government. Morsi was subsequently tried in Egypt for inciting violence, as well as a number of other charges. He was found guilty and given the death penalty. As of August 2016, he remains incarcerated. The head of the Egyptian armed forces, General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, was subsequently elected as the sixth president of Egypt. The election, which was boycotted by the Muslim Brotherhood and most political parties, resulted in el-Sisi winning 93 percent of the vote. In one sense, the election of el-Sisi signaled a return to the military dominated governments that have marked Egypt's politics since the July 23, 1952 revolution. The military has continued its historic role as a major player in Egypt's economy and as a government contractor. In September 2013, for example, the Egyptian government awarded building contracts, without any competitive bidding, totaling one billion dollars, to companies controlled by the Egyptian Army.On the other hand, el- Sisi has moved to defuse religious partisanship, becoming the first Egyptian president to attend a Christmas mass. He has called for the reform and modernization of Islam and moved to regulate sermons and school textbooks that ""incite violence and intolerance."" He has also moved to reign in Jihadist groups in Egypt and is fighting an Islamic State affiliated insurgency in the Sinai. El-Sisi has also called for a national goal to remove unsafe slums within two years, and outlined plans to build 850,000 housing units. By the spring of 2016, approximately 125,000 units have been built. Other ambitious plans include the widening of the Suez Canal (completed in July 2015), the creation of new industrial zones along the canal and a 2,600-mile expansion of the national road network. There are even plans to build a new capital city halfway between Cairo and Suez to relive Cairo's chronic overcrowding. Notwithstanding the historic unreliability of polling data in the Middle East, El-Sisi appears to be widely popular in Egypt, with most polls putting his approval rating between 70 and 80 percent. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, making the rabia sign in solidarity with Muslim Brotherhood protestors in Egypt, July 2013Turkey's Justice and Development Party was founded in 2001, under the leadership of Abdullah Gull, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Fetullah Gulen. The party, which had long standing ties to the Turkish branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, has been in continuous power in Turkey since winning the 2002 parliamentary elections. From 2002 through 2014, Erdogan was the leader of the AKP. In August 2014, he was elected president of Turkey. When it was first founded, the AKP described itself as a pro-Western and pro-American conservative party, with ""an agenda of social conservatism and economic liberalism."" The party's tenure occurred during a period of unprecedented economic growth in Turkey. Critics, however, have accused the AKP of having a hidden agenda, and that it was pursuing policies designed to move the country away from the secular principals enshrined in the Turkish constitution. Over the course of the last decade, and increasingly since he became president, Erdogan's critics have accused him of attempting to consolidate greater power, and of making the Turkish government increasingly authoritarian. Under Erdogan, the AKP has pushed for a strong, centralized government built around a presidential system of government and has reduced the number of government positions filled by popular elections in favor of state appointed ones. The government has moved to tightly regulate Internet use, and to discourage abortions and alcohol consumption. It has been heavy-handed in its use of the courts to punish its critics, especially those in the press. At last count, Erdogan had initiated more than 1,500 lawsuits, since withdrawn after the failed coup attempt, against various defendants, many in the media, for ""slandering"" the office of the presidency. Under Erdogan, Turkey's historic pro-Western foreign policy has been seen as increasingly Pan-Islamist. Ankara has voiced support for the Hamas government in Gaza, organizing ""volunteers"" to deliver needed supplies to the region, a move that led to a highly publicized split with the Israeli government, since repaired, when Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) intervened to block the ships from landing in Gaza. The Turkish government has also been heavily involved with the Free Syrian Army and other rebel groups fighting the Assad government. It has also been accused of aiding radical jihadist groups, like the Islamic State and the al-Nusra Front, and to turning a blind eye to Islamic States' smuggling of oil and antiquities into Turkey, or to the transit of jihadist fighters across its territory.Anti-Erdogan, Protect Your Republic protests, April 14, 2007 On July 15, 2016, a group of Turkish officers, calling themselves the Peace at Home Council, declared that it had launched a coup against the government of President Erdogan. The Peace Council claimed that it had been forced to act by the erosion of secularism in Turkey at the hands of the government. The very term ""Peace at Home"" harkened back to a famous saying by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the secular Turkish Republic, following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I. Ataturk had described his policy as ""Peace at Home, Peace in the World."" The council also cited the Erdogan's government disregard for human rights and its steady reduction of democratic rule. The coup proved short lived. Erdogan, in a Facetime interview with CNN Turkey, urged his supporters to take to the streets in defiance of the military imposed curfew. In Istanbul, General Salih Zeki Colak, commander of the First Army General Command, one of the four field armies of the Turkish military, declared that the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) did not support the coup. Over the course of the next 24 hours, military forces loyal to the Turkish government, supported by local police forces, rounded up the rebels. Eight military officers escaped to Greece where they asked for political asylum. In total, 300 people were killed and 2,100 people injured in the coup attempt. Erdogan claimed that the coup attempt had been organized by Fetullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric and political activist, who has self-exiled himself to the United States. Gulen was one of the founders of the AKP and was a close ally of Erdogan for many years. The two found themselves increasingly at odds until they had a complete falling out in 2013, when Erdogan accused Gulen of being the mastermind behind the corruption investigations that exposed the rampant cronyism in the Erdogan government.

21,POLITICS,Platform And Politics: The Change We Made,"James Zogby, ContributorPresident, Arab American Institute; author, 'Arab Voices'",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/platform-and-politics-the_b_11355716.html,"I feel good about what we accomplished with this year's Democratic Party's platform.

The convention officially began on Monday and is expected to attract thousands of protesters, members of the media and Democratic delegates to the City of Brotherly Love. (Photo by Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb823d2240000310098ba35.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The quadrennial process of party platform writing is more of a political exercise than a policy deliberation. When party leaders sit down to debate what will or will not go into their platform, their eyes are less focused on what will constitute sound policy. Instead they consider the politics involved in the positions they want in the document: will they cause concern with important constituencies; will they result in negative press; and will they provoke donors? Given this, I feel good about what we accomplished with this year's Democratic Party's platform. I say this not only as a proud member of the five person team Bernie Sanders picked to serve on the Platform Drafting Committee, but also as the first Arab American to have served in that capacity.Much has been written about the planks we lost or how the platform didn't go far enough, but what shouldn't be dismissed is that the Democratic Party is now on record embracing some of our positions and adopting some of our goals. All this is a clear recognition of the power of the progressive movement that was galvanized by the Sanders campaign and the role that Arab Americans played in that effort. The document includes: a call to abolish the death penalty; the goal of establishing a $15 an hour minimum wage; an expansion of the Social Security program; a recognition of the need to provide for public option health insurance; a call to eliminate Super PACs and overturn Citizens United; and the need to put a price on carbon emissions to deal with climate change. Bernie Sanders has referred to the final product as ""the most progressive platform in the history of the Democratic Party"" and has called for a sustained effort to insure that, after November, the goals recognized in the document become law.What didn't receive coverage, but should also be noted, are the many ""little victories"" we won during the platform deliberations. Sometimes they were simple, but important, word changes or additions we suggested that were ultimately endorsed by all sides.For example, we were able to add language condemning the rise of ""Islamophobia"". And we were able to insure the absence of any terms disparaging of Islam. We also included the protection of civil liberties as a priority concern and expanded on the definition of ""racial profiling"" to include ""religion, ethnicity, or national origin"" thereby making the called for ban on ""un-American and unproductive"" profiling, the most comprehensive ever.In the section on ""Fixing our Broken Immigration System"" we co-authored with the Clinton campaign language recognizing that ""immigration is not a problem to be solved, it is the defining aspect of the American character and our shared history"". We also called for reforming ""the current quota system [that] discriminates against certain immigrants"" and we rejected ""attempts to impose a religious test to bar immigrants or refugees from entering the United States."" The platform also proposes a way forward to defeat ISIS and al Qaeda and end the wars in Syria and Iraq without seeing American forces mired down in prolonged conflict in the Middle East. The document recognizes that there must be ""more inclusive governance in Iraq and Syria that respects the rights of all citizens"". And calls for ""providing more support and security assistance for Lebanon and Jordan, two countries that are hosting a disproportionate number of refugees; and recognizes the importance of ""maintaining our robust security cooperation with Gulf countries.""On the matter of refugees, the platform explicitly supports ""President Obama's call for an international summit to address this crisis so that every country assumes its responsibility to meet this humanitarian challenge"" and pledges to ""look for ways to help innocent people who are fleeing persecution."" There was, to be sure, great disappointment in our failure to change the language on Israel/Palestine. We wanted to have the platform clearly state that the occupation and settlements must end, that the suffering of Palestinians must be acknowledged, and that excessive language on BDS and Jerusalem should be removed. We argued that it was commendable to call for two states, but the refusal to note that the major impediments to the realization of that goal are the occupation and settlements calls into question the commitment to achieving a two state solution. We also argued that our reading of their proposed language on BDS denied Palestinians the right to peacefully protest occupation and the language on Jerusalem was contradictory since, on the one hand, the platform states that ""Jerusalem is a matter for final status negotiations"" and then says that ""it should remain the capital of Israel, an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths."" Since our Sanders' team was outnumbered, we did not win, but from our lengthy debate on these issues (a small victory, in itself), several observations can be made. The draft prepared by the Clinton team sought to preempt our concerns. This is the first platform in history to speak of the recognition of Palestinians as having rights not merely, as Peter Beinart has noted, ""as a matter of Israeli self-interest"". The platform calls for providing ""Palestinians with independence, sovereignty, and dignity"". And, in another place, says that ""Palestinians should be free to govern themselves in their own viable state, in peace and dignity"". On this subject, earlier platforms were confused, at best, insulting, at worst. Finally, on the issues of BDS and Jerusalem, the Clinton campaign sought to explain their language by noting that they ""were very careful not to say outright that we oppose BDS"", but rather to oppose it only it if it delegitimized Israel. And one Clinton supporter offered a caveat regarding Jerusalem noting that nothing in their formulation would preclude Jerusalem from also being the capital of a future Palestinian state.As a reflection of the state of play of American politics, we should see this platform not a defeat but an acknowledgment that there has been a change. Change we made possible. We were able to impact the debate. In some instances, we were able to win changes in the platform and, even when we were not, we were able to force debate on critical issues of concern. That is why I was proud to be a part to be a part of the Sanders campaign and why I endorse his call to continue our forward march. We must remain a part of the progressive coalition working with our allies to elect Hillary Clinton, defeat Donald Trump, continue to transform the Democratic Party, and keep progressive ideas in the mainstream, and not on the fringes of American politics. Within this coalition we can continue to fight for progress. Outside of it, we run the risk of marginalizing ourselves and our issues. Follow @jjz1600 for more. "

Has a lack of political diversity turned campuses into centers of liberal indoctrination?,2016-08-06,"Portrait young annoyed, unhappy, stressed woman covering her ears, looking up, to say, stop making loud noise, giving me headache isolated grey background with copy space. Negative emotion reaction",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae2f552200003501dadeba.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Are college professors too liberal? Do we need more conservative professors? Has a lack of political diversity turned campuses into centers of liberal indoctrination?These are legitimate questions, but I think the answers are ""no,"" ""no,"" and ""no."" Censorship and indoctrination are indeed serious problems on campus, but I don't think the solution is to have fewer liberal professors or more conservatives. On the contrary, the problem is that professors are not liberal enough.Yes, you read that right: College professors should be more liberal, not less. But notice I didn't say there should be more liberals. One can be liberal in the sense relevant to liberal education without being comprehensively liberal in some political sense. Professors should be liberal in the academic sense, regardless of their political views.Colleges and universities have been devoted since the 19th century to liberal education, which assumes and promotes the intellectual autonomy of human minds, including respect for rational collaboration, disciplinary methodologies, and rigorous research. This entails taking the results of research seriously, even when these conflict with traditional beliefs, values, and practices.It is not surprising that liberal education, which is rooted in liberal principles of individual liberty and rational autonomy, disproportionately attracts and produces liberals. Liberals and conservatives differ in ways that make liberal education more attractive to liberals than to conservatives. And involvement in education, even if it doesn't turn people into liberals, often makes them more liberal in the academic sense.Over the past two centuries, for example, liberals have generally accepted scientific conclusions on matters such as the age of the earth, the evolution of species, the reality of global warming, and the role of human activity in climate change. Conservatives, in contrast, have a long history of resisting scientific consensus on conclusions threatening to religious tradition or corporate profits. What, then, is the problem? One concern is that lack of intellectual diversity will hinder research and education. But the sort of intellectual diversity relevant to academic work is diversity with respect to ongoing theoretical controversies, and there is no reason to think this is lacking. Biologists, for example, hold and teach a variety of views about the process of evolution; there is no need for concern about their political or religious beliefs.Even with respect to political diversity the professoriate includes liberals, socialists, Marxists, moderates, pragmatists, libertarians, and (yes) conservatives, with many faculty claiming more than one of these categories, adding categories of their own, or rejecting any system of political categories. Those concerned about diversity of political views on campus need not worry. There is plenty of it.Perhaps the problem is that the range of diversity on campus is skewed to the left compared to the range among the public at large. Conservatives are underrepresented and far-left viewpoints overrepresented. But there is no reason a political ideology should be represented in the professoriate in proportion to its current popularity. Universities should hire on the basis of academic merit alone and let the political chips fall where they may.Rather than focus on the political views of professors, we should keep our focus on campus censorship and indoctrination, which are antithetical to liberal education. Professors should teach what they are hired to teach and should recognize their students' rational autonomy by providing evidence and arguments, not just conclusions, and by encouraging students to think for themselves, seek new evidence, and reach their own conclusions.As for the particular concern about liberal indoctrination, there's nothing liberal about censorship or indoctrination. It may be possible to indoctrinate someone in particular liberal ideas and restrict exposure to alternative ideas but it is illiberal to do that. To reduce indoctrination we need more liberalism, not less.But that doesn't mean more liberals. Professors should be hired on the basis of their teaching and research without regard to their political views or activities. We needn't worry about the representation of various political ideologies in the professoriate. Our focus should be on reminding all professors, regardless of their political views, that liberal education requires them to respect the intellectual freedom of all their colleagues and all their students."

Ellis Hill, who now drives for Uber to make ends meet, is going to travel to Rio de Janeiro to see his son compete in the Olympic games, thanks to the generosity of one of his passengers and a successful GoFundMe campaign.“I cant wait to see him and encourage him in person and let him know I’m 100 percent in his corner.”Hill had picked up Liz Willock during a trip in Philadelphia July 26. During their drive, they began to talk about the upcoming Olympics. That’s when Hill told Willock that his son, Darrell, was going to compete in shot put on the U.S. Olympic Track and Field team.According to Hill’s son, his father is proud of his accomplishment.“He pretty much tells everyone who gets into his car that his son is going to the Olympics,” Darrell Hill told The Delaware County Daily Times.When Willock asked if Hill was going to Brazil to watch his son compete, Hill told her he couldn’t afford it.“It was devastating to hear that,” Willock told People. “Here’s this wonderful man who has a close relationship with his son and I know any parent would want to see their son or daughter compete at the Olympics, but it was very understandable how that could be out of reach.” That’s when Willock, who works for a global concierge service with contacts in Brazil, decided to help.“She tried to see if her company could buy him a plane ticket, but it didn’t work out that way,” Darrell Hill told the Daily Times. “The logistics of it, she was not able to do it in the time it needed to be done so she approached me about starting a GoFundMe account.”On July 28, Willock started the campaign. She asked for $7,500 to pay for a plane ticket, hotel, meals, passport and other travel expenses. Two days later they had reached their goal.Robert Mongeluzzi, a Philadelphia attorney, donated $1,545.“I’ve been an athlete my whole life, and you know, I guess it just touched me,” Mongeluzzi told NBC10.Hill said he came out of church on Sunday to a phone call from NBC10 letting him know the GoFundMe campaign had reached its goal.“It’s a great thing for people to come together like that, and it’s a great opportunity,” Hill told the outlet.Willock told NBC10 her company would arrange ground transportation from Pennsylvania to the hotel in Rio. The outlet also reported that Uber chipped in, giving Hill $1,000 in Uber credits so he can easily get around Rio. The company also gave him a $250 gift certificate to one of the city’s top restaurants.Now all Hill has to do is get his passport and book a ticket in order to see his son compete on August 18.“I haven’t seen my son in a couple months because he’s been training,” Hill told People. “I cant wait to see him and encourage him in person and let him know I’m 100 percent in his corner.” Note: The Huffington Post’s editor-in-chief Arianna Huffington is a member of Uber’s board of directors, and has recused herself from any involvement in the site’s coverage of the company."

Why anyone would debate what, officially, constitutes a press conference stems from a long-running rift between the Clinton press corps and the campaign over the candidate’s accessibility. Clinton had not held a press conference since Dec. 4, 2015, in Fort Dodge, Iowa ― or 244 days ago ― and reporters have frequently highlighted this drought on Twitter.So when NABJ President Sarah Glover introduced Clinton on Friday as speaking before the “largest press conference with any presidential candidate before a room filled with journalists of color,” several Clinton reporters took issue with that designation. The Clinton campaign’s press secretary, Brian Fallon, suggested in response to CNN’s Dan Merica that Clinton was, indeed, participating in a press conference. When asked by The Huffington Post if the campaign considered the event to be a press conference, Fallon emailed, “The president of the organization called it that, and I am not sure what else you could call it.”Following the event’s conclusion, NAHJ president Mekahlo Medina described it as a “press event” to HuffPost. The debate seems to be over whether an event with five pre-selected journalists amounts to a press conference, or if a press conference requires a more freewheeling exchange between the candidate and members of the campaign press corps. At Friday’s event, NBC’s Kristen Welker and Telemundo’s Lori Montenegro, representing NABJ and NAHJ, respectively, served as moderators and began by asking Clinton several questions. Next, three journalists in the audience ― The New York Times’ Yamiche Alcindor, The Washington Post’s Ed O’Keefe, and ESPN’s Kevin Merida ― asked additional questions. Medina said Welker and Montenegro were selected ahead of time to represent each organization, given their familiarity with Clinton’s campaign. The other journalists were part of a 10-person preliminary panel discussion at the joint conference. “What happened today is Hillary Clinton took questions from members of the media,” Medina said. “I don’t know if people want to call that a press conference or not, but that’s what happened.” Medina, an NBC anchor in Los Angeles, added that he’s “been a journalist for a long time” and “anytime there’s somebody who takes questions from the press at a large event, that constituted a press conference.”Still, some journalists weren’t convinced. Though Clinton has not held a press conference all year, she has participated in around a dozen “gaggles,” which are less formal sessions in which traveling reporters are able to ask some questions.Clinton has personally pushed back against criticism over her accessibility to the media by noting in June that she’d given 300 interviews in 2016. And as reporters questioned Clinton’s openness on Friday, traveling press secretary Nick Merrill tweeted that she’d taken 2,600 questions this year. Reporters are inevitably going to want more opportunities for access. Before asking his question Friday, O’Keefe encouraged Clinton to “do this more often with reporters across the country, especially those news organizations that travel the country with you everywhere you go.”"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a4e1c92a00000002fb5001.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Hillary Clinton may view Donald Trump as a racist misogynist, but she feels some sympathy for his supporters. Speaking at a conference of black and Hispanic journalists, the Democratic presidential nominee walked a fine line, casting many of Trump’s most controversial comments as racist and xenophobic, while declining to extend that characterization to his ardent supporters. “We have to recognize that, of course, some of the appeal [of Trump] is xenophobic, racist, misogynistic,” Clinton said, while cautioning the audience not to “lose sight of the pain that many Americans are feeling because the economy has left them behind.”Clinton recalled Trump’s harsh words against Mexican immigrants and his repeated attacks against Khizr and Ghazala Khan, Muslim parents who lost their Army captain son, Humayun, in the Iraq war. Despite the wide gulf that separates Clinton from Trump’s hardcore supporters, she explained his nationalist appeal as a reaction to the declining fortunes of much of the American middle class with the dwindling of manufacturing and the harsh recession of 2008. She said she’d met with a coal mining family in West Virginia, a state she expects to lose in November. But in listening to their concerns, Clinton said she became more sensitive to the wider discontent among Trump supporters with the shortage of stable jobs with decent pay.“We have to reject and stand up against the appeals to the kind of bigotry and the use of bluster and bullying we’ve seen come from the Trump campaign,” Clinton said. “But let’s not forget the pain … all Americans are feeling.” She added that she would continue to reach out to Americans “of all ethnicities,” a phrase usually invoked to refer to groups other than white males. Clinton made the comments at a joint annual conference of the National Association of Black Journalists and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists. Trump was invited to attend, but declined. The GOP presidential nominee has consistently alienated voters of color that the Republican Party sought to reach out to more consistently after Mitt Romney bombed among Hispanics in 2012, winning only 27 percent of the Latino vote. Instead, Trump’s support base is largely white and male, though a McClatchy-Marist poll released Friday showed that his support among that demographic had dropped from a 14-point lead over Clinton last month to just eight points after the conventions and his public feud with the Khan family.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

Nehlen has been running a campaign focused on immigration and trade, accusing Ryan of sending American jobs overseas. And as an interview with a Chicago radio station on Monday revealed, Nehlen also seems to share some of Trump’s Islamophobia, proposing that the U.S. should consider deporting all Muslims.“I’m suggesting we have a discussion about it. That’s for sure,” he said.Nehlen said that like Trump, he supports a surveillance program for Muslims in the U.S. “The question is, why do we have Muslims in the country?” Nehlen asked. “Here’s what we should be doing: We should be monitoring every mosque. We should be monitoring social media.”Later in the interview, Nehlen clarified that he meant only deporting “Sharia-compliant” Muslims, saying that he backs a religious test for Muslims to determine whether they “believe in Sharia,” an idea recently proposed by Trump supporter and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.). “Islam is not a religion. It’s a political system. It has a different set of rules,” Nehlen said.Ryan, who has a significant fundraising advantage over Nehlen and high favorability ratings in the district that he has served for almost two decades, is expected to win next Tuesday’s primary.In an interview with a Wisconsin radio station on Thursday, he dismissed Nehlen’s campaign, claiming that he “has been making stuff up.”“He’s running this sort of make-it-up-as-you-go campaign,” Ryan said.The House speaker has repeatedly affirmed that he opposes a religious test for Muslims entering the country, and despite endorsing Trump, frequently condemns the real estate mogul’s rhetoric.On Thursday, he called Trump’s attacks against Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the parents of a slain Muslim American war hero, “beyond the pale,” but said that he continues to support Trump as his party’s standard-bearer. But Nehlen argued that Ryan has not done enough to support Trump, suggesting to CNN on Tuesday that Ryan “should be reporting in-kind contributions to Hillary Clinton’s campaign.”“When did the speaker attack Hillary Clinton the way he’s attacking Donald Trump right now? He is the top elected Republican in the country right now,” Nehlen said. “Shouldn’t he be focused on supporting Mr. Trump and figuring out how he can partner with him?”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

Time for their wise counsel, everybody: “Republican insiders in key battleground states have a message for The Donald: Get out.”Oh my. For real, you guys? That’s according to The POLITICO Caucus — a panel of activists, strategists and operatives in 11 swing states. The majority of GOP insiders, 70 percent, said they want Trump to drop out of the race and be replaced by another Republican candidate — with many citing Trump’s drag on Republicans in down-ballot races. But those insiders still think it’s a long-shot Trump would actually end his campaign and be replaced by another GOP candidate.A long shot, you say? Hmmm, interesting. Almost as interesting as the 30 percent of this cohort that thinks everything is going just peachy. Of course, as I look back through the Politico Caucus’ back catalog, I see that just a few weeks ago, after they’d expressed just how much they were “dreading” the Republican convention, Politico’s insiders took a measure of Trump’s performance in Cleveland and concluded that he’d “nailed it.”“Trump gave a simple message and expanded the Republican Party: law and order, economic populism and defeat the rigged system,” said one. Another felt that he’d delivered “a very good speech” that “struck on issues and policies that people wanted to hear about” and that Trump was “absolutely right ― this is a movement, not a normal campaign.” Another said, “He talked to the people he needed to very effectively. The speech defined the race and made him a voice for the people — something he should have done months ago.”Hot stuff! But what happened since then? Well, hold on to your hats, people, but the Politico Caucus has since arrived at a host of very different conclusions, like “I’d rather take our chances with nearly anyone else than continue with this certain loser” and “He is an egomaniac” and “If he loses, and I believe he will, God help us all because Trump and his minions will foment an uprising of epic proportions.”So, you know, these guys picked up on some really subtle stuff about Trump that only really came to the surface in the past 10 days. Probably stuff that only really cagey political insiders can notice. I guess the only thing left to ask this group of veteran political thought-havers is what’s going to happen next?The Iowa Republican predicted that rumors of a Trump exit are likely only to get louder: “Talk of Trump dropping out will reach a fevered pitch next week, when his poll numbers bottom out,” the Republican said. “We need to brace ourselves.”Brace yourselves for what? A continued career of being rich, dumb and wrong about everything?~~~~~Jason Linkins edits “Eat The Press” for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost Politics podcast “So, That Happened.” Subscribe here, and listen to the latest episode below."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a498912a00002d004f8911.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If your understanding of the world has slipped away more and more over the last year, Craig Robinson’s new movie about expat family life is a poignant salvation. It also makes a compelling case for Robinson’s continued work in drama, as an actor famous for comedic roles in “The Office” and “Hot Tub Time Machine.”At the 2016 Sundance Film Festival in January, Robinson won a Special Jury Award for his part in “Morris From America,” which is currently available on DirecTV and will have a limited theatrical release beginning Aug. 19. In the movie, Robinson plays a widowed father who has relocated his 13-year-old son, Morris, from New York City to Heidelberg, Germany, for a coaching job with a “football” (soccer) team.The movie is mainly a coming-of-age story for Morris, played by Markees Christmas, but it also has a lot to say about being part of a black minority in an extremely white city. Locals are overtly racist to Morris. Robinson’s character, Curtis, tells his son at one point: “We’re the only two brothers in Heidelberg. We have to stick together.”In an interview with The Huffington Post, Robinson said the project appealed to him because of its theme of family teamwork through adversity. “Them being there in Germany, it kind of forces them to once again revisit that friendship,” said Robinson. “Because it’s really them two against the world.”“Especially in this atmosphere, with this election and all this stuff, it’s like, we’re still in this boat together,” Robinson said. “Let’s not rock it.”Robinson thought screenwriter Chad Hartigan pulled a “smooth move” by writing Morris as a “super fish-out-of-water” character. (Hartigan also won an award at Sundance for the movie.)The relationship between Curtis and Morris becomes particularly nuanced as Robinson decides he also needs to take on the roles of a traditional mother and best friend for his son. Throughout the movie, Morris struggles with the language barrier and different interests between himself and German locals. The young boy is also an aspiring hip-hop star who eventually develops a crush, but, since the girl only knows Jay Z as Beyoncé’s husband, the relationship can only go so far. Robinson explained that he also took the role because of the film’s musical side-plots, such as Morris’ rap efforts and Curtis’ attempts to teach his son about old-school hip-hop. Before becoming an actor, Robinson worked as an elementary-school music teacher ― although he admits he was always “more of a funk guy” than a fan of the rap his character champions in the movie.Midway through “Morris,” Curtis gives his son an old mixtape of his own rapping as a kid. It ends up being his dad trying to imitate Biggie Smalls, but Morris, not knowing what to expect, plays the awkward tracks in his crush’s bedroom. Since she doesn’t know anything about hip-hop, he’s luckily the only one who realizes it’s bad.“I’ve rapped for fun in karaoke,” said Robinson. “But for the most part, my rapping skills are non-existent and that was just fun. I was actually reading when I rapped that.” As Americans overseas, the cast members went out of their way to bond together in Germany, diving into the local party culture. Robinson explained how they would throw impromptu “fests” with German food and beer in a barn with a DJ. “One of the nights I played piano and we partied all night,” Robinson said, smiling.Finding your team can serve a bigger purpose than just survival against the odds.Don’t know what to watch on Netflix?

(See: “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” with Johnny Depp, “How the Grinch Stole Christmas” with Jim Carrey, “The Amazing Spider-Man” with Andrew Garfield.) For reasons that aren’t all rooted in sheer refusal to watch four women comedians fire proton beams at the supernatural just because they weren’t men like in the classic 1984 version, the “Ghostbusters” reboot has faced a lot of criticism. And evidently, director Paul Feig is done grappling with nostalgic moviegoing hordes.Asked whether he’d ever consider reimagining another classic film property, the director responded decisively.“No, no, no. No, I will not,” Feig told The Huffington Post, laughing. The creator of cult hit “Freaks and Geeks” and director of “Bridesmaids” will happily go back to original material, which he noted comprises the bulk of his work. “This one was just too tempting because I knew we could do something with it that was exciting,” he explained. A gender-bent sequel with cameos by all the original main cast members? Sure, that’s pretty exciting. Or blasphemous, depending on your view.Actors including Melissa McCarthy and at least one Sony executive have joined Feig to speak out against the sexist, misogynist bits of “Ghostbusters” criticism, appropriately labeling it, well, sexist and misogynist.But it wasn’t all hateful. The Huffington Post spoke to Feig about the reaction he’s seen from fans since the movie’s July 15 debut, and he explained how a lot of it has been positive ― especially from women and young girls.“It’s such a validation for the years of false controversy,” Feig said.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"George Zimmerman, who was acquitted of shooting unarmed teen Trayvon Martin to death in 2012, says he was punched in the face by a Florida restaurant customer who overheard him talking about the killing, according to police. Zimmerman told police in Sanford that the Sunday evening altercation began inside Gators Riverside Grille after he complimented another customer’s Confederate flag tattoos. A friend of the tattooed man recognized Zimmerman and asked if he was indeed the volunteer neighborhood watchman who fatally shot 17-year-old Martin in 2012.Zimmerman said he showed his identification to the group, which included the wife of one of them.At that point, “a large fat man approached,” according to Zimmerman’s statement to police. “You’re bragging about that?” asked the man, identified only as Eddie, according to Zimmerman.Zimmerman’s statement, which conflicts with what other witnesses told police, becomes confusing at this point. He said Eddie commanded him to leave the restaurant and called him “a n――- lover.” Zimmerman is infamous for killing Martin, who was African-American. “I am not looking for any trouble,” Zimmerman said he told the man.With that, he said, the man slugged him in the face. Restaurant staff intervened and Zimmerman called 911. “And he said he’s going to kill me,” Zimmerman told the dispatcher.Eddie fled on a blue Harley-Davidson motorcycle, the police report said.A Seminole County sheriff’s officer who questioned witnesses concluded that Eddie, a white man with a blonde beard, “is the primary aggressor in this case,” the police report said. Police said the man was being sought.Witnesses differed on details. The two men and woman who first spoke with Zimmerman reported seeing no punches thrown. They portrayed Zimmerman as cocky when he approached them.Joseph Whitmer gave police this account: ”Mr. Zimmerman walks up and says ‘I love your tattoos. My name is George Zimmerman, you know the guy who killed Trayvon Martin?’” Without prompting, Zimmerman took out his ID, according to Whitmer’s statement. David Worrell told police he asked Zimmerman to leave their table. But another of Worrell’s friends, who is unnamed, “began to exchange words” with Zimmerman, according to the statement. Worrell tried to pull his friend away, but Zimmerman “stuck something in his face” that Worrell knocked away, according to the statement.Worrell told police that he then left the restaurant with his friends. “The issue he had was when Mr. Zimmerman came to his table and proceeded to brag about how he was the one who killed Trayvon Martin,” the police report said. Restaurant owner Ed Winters told The Orlando Sentinel there were no punches, though he acknowedged Zimmerman and another man shoved each other. Gregory Home, Zimmerman’s companion at the restaurant, told a vastly different story. Five men approached their table, he told police, and “began yelling at Mr. Zimmerman and acting in a threatening manner towards him.” Horne said he stepped between Zimmerman and the man who punched him. Horne started recording the argument with his phone, but one of the men threw it. A piece of the phone broke, but Horne said he called 911.No one has been charged by police.Zimmerman, who claimed he shot Martin in self defense, has had repeated run-ins with the law since his acquittal.In November 2013, he was accused of pointing a gun at his girlfriend during an argument. In September 2014, police said he threatened to kill a man during a road rage incident in Lake Mary, Florida. The alleged victim declined to press charges."
31,POLITICS,AARP To Withdraw From Controversial Conservative Group Amid Rising Pressure,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/aarp-to-withdraw-from-alec_us_57a4c72de4b03ba6801233e5,It only took a week.,2016-08-05,AARP activists attend a campaign event for then-presidential candidate Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) in March. AARP is trying to make Social Security a focus in the election.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a4c7c82a0000fa01fb4f82.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"AARP announced on Thursday that it plans to let its membership in a controversial conservative group expire at the end of the year, a clear response to mounting pressure from its members and progressive organizations.AARP is one of many organizations that sponsor the American Legislative Exchange Council, a powerful corporate-backed lobbying group focused on influencing state-level legislation. The Center for Media and Democracy, a Wisconsin-based progressive research and advocacy outfit, exactly a week ago revealed the mammoth seniors group’s sponsorship of ALEC’s annual meeting last month in Indianapolis, Indiana.Almost immediately, a number of liberal groups and labor unions, including Social Security Works, the American Federations of State, County and Municipal Employees, and ClimateTruth.org, launched a public campaign to get AARP to cut its ties to ALEC. They argued that AARP’s involvement with ALEC contradicted its mission to represent older Americans, since ALEC has taken many positions that are harmful to seniors.ALEC has supported privatizing Social Security in the past, opposes the expansion of Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act and has helped pass voter identification laws that often disenfranchise senior citizens, the groups noted.The progressive organizations, many of which are longstanding critics of ALEC, sent AARP a strongly-worded letter urging it to withdraw from the group and began an online petition campaign to pressure AARP to do so. Social Security Works told activists in an email blast that the petition had received over 53,000 signatures within 24 hours.On Thursday afternoon, AARP decided it would not renew its membership in ALEC, Politico Playbook reported.“After hearing from many of you, we’ve decided not to renew our membership to ALEC,” AARP wrote in a message posted on its Facebook page early Friday morning. “We would never work against the interests of older Americans and our engagement with ALEC was NOT an endorsement of the organization’s policies, but an opportunity to engage with state legislators and advance our members’ priorities.”AARP, unlike ALEC, opposes Social Security privatization and was a key backer of the Affordable Care Act health care reform law.“We will not renew our membership to ALEC. AARP will continue to explore avenues that will enhance our interaction with organizations and elected officials that represent different perspectives in order to further the issues important to Americans 50+ and their families,” AARP said in a statement. ALEC did not immediately respond to The Huffington Post’s request for comment.AARP had been sending staff to ALEC’s annual meeting since 2014 and paid a membership fee starting this year, according to sources familiar with the matter. AARP claimed it hoped its membership would grant it access to state lawmakers. Although AARP’s financial support for ALEC was likely insignificant, progressive groups worried that AARP’s imprimatur lent considerable credibility to a group that would otherwise have a deeply contentious reputation.The organizations also found it inconceivable that AARP somehow needed ALEC to gain access to lawmakers. AARP is widely viewed as one of the most powerful public interest groups in the country, with over 37 million members over the age of 50. While ALEC is technically an educational nonprofit, it functions as a powerful public policy lobbying group that drafts numerous pieces of model legislation for state lawmakers. In addition to membership dues, corporations often pay ALEC to write and advance specific kinds of laws that benefit their bottom line.ALEC’s influence is sometimes comically apparent in conservative state-level legislation. A Florida lawmaker forgot to remove ALEC’s mission statement from a November 2011 resolution calling on the federal government to reduce corporate taxes. Stand Up to ALEC, a coalition of labor unions, environmental groups and other progressive organizations, have successfully urged many major corporations to leave ALEC in response to the controversial policies the group supports.In recent years, 19 nonprofits and 108 corporations, including Microsoft, Google, Yahoo and Coca-Cola, have withdrawn from ALEC, according to the Center for Media and Democracy.The corporate exodus from the organization picked up in earnest after the killing of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012. ALEC was promoting so-called stand your ground legislation, similar to the law in Florida that allowed George Zimmerman, a civilian, to legally kill Martin because he allegedly felt threatened.ALEC has also come under fire for providing a forum for climate change deniers. It is an active opponent of the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan, the initiative aimed at reducing power plants’ greenhouse gas emissions.Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt cited ALEC’s work against climate change action when announcing the decision to leave ALEC in September 2014. In ripping remarks, Schmidt claimed that when it came to climate change, ALEC was “literally just lying.” Social Security Works, an organization that is fighting to expand Social Security, celebrated AARP’s decision to allow its membership in ALEC to expire. “After a huge uproar from its members, we are very pleased that AARP is doing the right thing and cutting all ties with the anti-senior ALEC,” said Linda Benesch, Social Security Works’ communications director.Although AARP’s decision to withdraw from ALEC has quieted its critics for now, it is likely to raise questions about the organization’s policy agenda. AARP’s involvement in ALEC is the second major instance this year in which it provoked the ire of progressive groups. AARP’s “Take A Stand” initiative, launched in November, mobilizes its members to ask presidential candidates to elaborate on how they plan to reform Social Security to close its long-term funding shortfall.The campaign does not distinguish, however, between plans that boost Social Security’s finances by cutting benefits and those that do not. Maya Rockeymoore, president of Global Policy Solutions, a progressive think tank, was one of the prominent liberal policy experts who publicly criticized AARP for its neutrality in February.“There is no question where AARP should stand: on the side of older adults trying to make ends meet. And their policy prescriptions should reflect that,” Rockeymoore said at the time.This story has been updated with a statement from AARP."
32,POLITICS,Only 1 Percent Of Black Voters Support Donald Trump,Samantha Neal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-voters-trump_us_57a4a2a1e4b021fd98784a42,The GOP presidential nominee polls at a record low among a demographic key to winning the general election.,2016-08-05,The Republican candidate suffers abysmally in polling of black voters and other minority groups.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a4a3ce2a00002d004f8939.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Rounding out one of the worst weeks in his presidential campaign, Donald Trump faces yet another sad reality. According to new NBC/Wall Street Journal polling released Thursday, only 1 percent of black voters nationally support the Republican nominee. This abysmally low level of support reflects a sentiment already present among black voters in swing states. Trump also suffers among Hispanic voters, garnering just 26 percent of their vote, according to an Economist/YouGov poll released earlier this week. Generating support among voters of color ― whom Trump’s rhetoric habitually alienates ― is key to winning the general election. People of color constitute nearly one-third of eligible voters, making the 2016 electorate the most diverse in U.S. history. This renders it essential for Trump to secure higher numbers of those votes in order to win. President Barack Obama won 93 percent of the black vote and 71 percent of the Hispanic vote nationally in 2012; in 2008, he won over 95 and 67 percent, respectively. The most recent Republican president, George W. Bush, won over 11 percent of African-Americans and 44 percent of Hispanics support in 2004; in 2000 he won 9 and 35 percent, respectively. The NBC/WSJ poll also shows Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton with a significant advantage among women, all non-white voters, millennials and white voters with a college degree. Trump pulls ahead more narrowly among all white voters, seniors, independents and white voters without a college degree.In the wake of the two major party conventions, results this week suggest that Clinton’s polling bounce is more sustainable than Trump’s. Not only did she receive a higher bounce in poll numbers, but viewers received Clinton’s acceptance much more positively than they did Trump’s. Post-convention bounces also tend to be more stable when they unify the party, and in the wake of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) endorsement, polls indicate that the Democratic Party is more unified than ever before.Clinton has now reached the level of support she enjoyed before public scrutiny into her use of a private email server. According to our HuffPost Pollster model, which aggregates publicly available polling data, Clinton enjoys an average 9 point lead with third-party candidate Gary Johnson in the race and a 7 point lead in a two-way race.At the state level, new polling in traditional battlegrounds also shows Clinton with a significant lead, The Huffington Post reported earlier this week. Surveys released Thursday give her a 15-point lead in New Hampshire, a 9-point lead in Michigan, an 11-point lead in Pennsylvania and a 6-point lead in Florida. Trump’s disastrous polling week evinces the broader problems his campaign faces. This week alone, he sparked outrage by igniting a social media war against Khizr and Ghazala Khan, whose son, a U.S. Army captain, was killed in Iraq defending his unit in 2004 (a year that, despite what Trump might believe, was not during Obama’s presidency). He refused to endorse House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) or Rep. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) in their respective re-election bids, despite their endorsements of his campaign. He defended Roger Ailes against sexual harassment charges and brushed aside sexual harassment as a serious issue. Trump was also eviscerated Friday morning by former CIA director Michael Morell, who went on to endorse Clinton.And that’s only to name a few. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

Public forums with the DOJ investigators give them the chance, finally, to share their painful and sometime brutal stories ― and to know that the world has heard them.“You’ve got to understand that there is no accountability. Where are people supposed to go? Who are folks supposed to tell their stories to?” said Pamela Cytrynbaum, executive director of the Chicago Innocence Center.The Chicago Police Department along with those in Baltimore and a half-dozen other cities are currently undergoing “pattern or practice” investigations by the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. Under President Barack Obama, DOJ has made it a priority to look into police forces accused of widespread misconduct and unconstitutional behavior, including excessive use of force and illegal searches. That’s in sharp contrast to the Bush administration, during which such probes slowed to a halt. “Every American expects and deserves the protection of law enforcement that is effective, that is responsive, that is respectful and most importantly constitutional,” Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in announcing the Chicago investigation eight months ago.For citizens harmed by law enforcement, internal police department reviews and citizen oversight boards seem to offer little to no recourse ― at least in the cities being investigated. Last year, the Invisible Institute, a civic journalism organization, released over 28,000 citizen complaints of misconduct by Chicago police, covering both verbal and physical abuse, that were filed between 2011 and 2015. Sixty-one percent of those complaints were filed by black Americans, but less than 2 percent of those were sustained.In Baltimore, police union contracts allow “peer” officers to serve on the hearing board for citizen complaints. The American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland argues that practice impedes accountability since officers have an interest in protecting their colleagues from discipline.Three summers ago, Tawanda Jones received a call that turned her world on its head: Her 44-year-old brother, Tyrone West, was dead after an altercation with Baltimore police. Though the official autopsy report states that West died because of a pre-existing cardiac condition, Jones believes that her brother died as a result of police abuse, and a second autopsy from an independent medical examiner found his cause of death to be positional asphyxia. Seeking justice, Jones turned to community activism and led demonstrations in her brother’s name. But, as is often the case with police-involved deaths, no charges were brought against the officers involved. “If it wasn’t for me and my family pushing so hard, no one would even know about Tyrone West,” Jones told The Huffington Post.Unlike more recent incidents of police brutality, West’s death was not captured on video. Jones believes the lack of footage has made justice much more difficult to attain.But with the Justice Department in town, the opportunity to tell her brother’s story to the federal lawyers has been cathartic.“We’ve been crying our tears, and our cries have fallen on deaf ears for decades,” Jones said, referring to the long history of police violence against the black community in Baltimore. “So when you see people of any kind, whether it be the DOJ or the U.N., and we hear that they’re going to be here at this specific spot on this specific day, we feel obligated to talk to them.”The probe of the Baltimore Police Department, a relatively large force of over 3,000 officers, has lasted more than a year ― twice as long as the Ferguson, Missouri, investigation, which focused on a tiny police department with less than 100 employees. Jones has attended many of the DOJ’s public forums in Baltimore and said she has found their team to be very responsive, even accepting her invitations to attend community meetings.“It meant a lot for me to see the guy from the DOJ when he came and sat down with me, took down my information and attended several forums. And then when we were hosting our community meeting, the police commissioner didn’t show up but the Department of Justice guy did,” she said.That sentiment is echoed by Ken Jiretsu, a board member of Baltimore’s Transgender Alliance. The group invited DOJ to their community meetings in an effort to make sure investigators heard the voices of trans people. At one such gathering, Jiretsu, a transgender man, shared his own difficult experience dealing with Baltimore police.“I called to ask for officers to escort [my son] to the hospital. When they arrived, one of the officers that was with them had misgendered me, so I had to correct her. She had said, ‘Miss,’ and I told her, ‘It’s sir,’ and she was like, ‘Oh, OK, how was I supposed to know?’ Then she said, ‘So, man, sir, whatever you want to be called,’” Jiretsu said.“Her colleagues that were with her were also laughing,” said Jiretsu, “and it ended up becoming a triggering situation for me.” The fact that his children were witnesses to the encounter in his own home made it even more upsetting.After hearing his story, Jiretsu said, the DOJ took his information and promised to follow up.“I think a lot of them are sincere,” he said. “They were sincere in listening to what we had to say. The two that I personally spoke to seemed very interested in what we had to say.”The DOJ’s efforts to engage with local communities during these investigations aren’t really geared, however, toward capturing and resolving individual complaints against officers. The Civil Rights Division’s efforts concentrate more on broad reforms and remedies ― which means the federal team isn’t there to hear everyone’s tale. For some residents, that has been the most frustrating aspect of these investigations. Turnout for the public forums in Baltimore has been rather high. One event had to be moved from a location that could hold only 80 people to one that could accommodate over 300. The DOJ teams try to hold forums “throughout the investigation and target different parts of the community so we can hear not only from the greatest volume, but a wide variety of folks so we can get a better sense of the breadth,” a Justice Department spokesperson told The Huffington Post. Three to four events are typically held near the start, which gives the team an opportunity to explain to the community how the investigation will be conducted while also soliciting citizen testimony.In Chicago, the DOJ has hosted four public forums so far, all on weeknights ― a schedule that some have criticized for shutting out people who don’t work 9 to 5. After hearing from friends that the first forum had a turnout of fewer than 40 people, Frances McDonald, a student at the University of Chicago, said she felt compelled to show up at the next one. “Some people were screaming and yelling. Some people went past their allotted time to speak because they were so angry, and there were some people in the crowd crying,” McDonald said. “Some parents of children with mental disabilities spoke of their children’s experiences with the police.”McDonald wasn’t there to tell yet another story, but to witness what members of her community had to say. And she came away convinced of at least one thing.“I definitely think there should be a few more forums. I’d say at least 10 more,” said McDonald.The Chicago police force is the largest department the DOJ is investigating. The probe was prompted by the October 2014 death of Laquan McDonald and the subsequent coverup. A video of the shooting was finally released more than a year later, and those images spurred protests around the city. But Chicago’s history of police abuse extends further back. From the secretive interrogation facility at Homan Square to the tortured confessions elicited by former police commander Jon Burge, the city’s black and Latino residents have complained of police violence for over 40 years.“Given what communities have suffered under in this town for so long, it is appalling to me that there are not more opportunities for the public to tell their stories,” Cytrynbaum of the Chicago Innocence Center said. “Even if they need to rent out a stadium, they need to hear this. It needs to be on the record.”The Justice Department spokesperson told HuffPost that they plan to host more forums in Chicago, including one or two on the weekends.“We had already planned to do more. We were just hammering out details,” the spokesperson said.This doesn’t necessarily mean that the DOJ is aiming for a very high turnout. “If 10,000 people show up, it won’t really be an effective way to engage with folks,” the spokesperson pointed out. “It won’t be a fruitful or engaging conversation, and we won’t be able to hear from the vast majority of people who come. So I think it’s a balance.”Still, Cytrynbaum insists that the DOJ needs to listen to as many tales as community members want to share.“I’m sorry if it’s tiring for people to listen to these stories. I’m sorry if you feel like if you’ve heard one account of a police officer holding a gun to a 3-year-old’s head, then you’ve heard them all,” she said. “We must have an accounting of what’s going on, and the only way to do that is to make sure all of these stories get told and get counted.”As for Jones, the impending end of the Baltimore investigation triggers new worries. She sees the DOJ team as the watchdog Baltimoreans have been pleading for.“These people that hold some type of power and can enlighten our situation need to be around constantly. Because at the end of the day, I feel like nobody oversees these police officers. They get to do whatever they want to do,” she said."
