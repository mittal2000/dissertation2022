1,TRAVEL,4 Full Days of Nashville,"College Tourist, ContributorStudy Abroad Student Community",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/4-full-days-of-nashville_b_9768810.html,,2016-04-24,2016-04-24-1461533673-4241738-IMG_194311024x768.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-04-24-1461533673-4241738-IMG_194311024x768-thumb.jpg,"The College TouristBy: Emily Roth, University of ConnecticutIt's always hard and often impossible during a short visit, to see everything that a new city has to offer. Nashville is no exception!  There are plenty of museums, plantations, and gardens that you will have to pick and choose from but here is an example of how you can get the most out of a short trip to the diverse city of Nashville.Day 1: Be a Tourist  Everyone knows Nashville is the hometown of country music. Start off your trip right by visiting the Country Music Hall of Fame. It is located in the heart of the city so it will only be a short walk to the main downtown area. Head to the city's most colorful street, Broadway and spend the rest of the day walking around. There are plenty of places to grab food and purchase some authentic country boots. Walk over to the John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge and take in the views over the Cumberland River. Later on hang around for the nightlife and make sure to visit Tootsies World Famous Orchid Lounge. Honky Tonk Central is another classic three floor bar and ACME Feed and Seed is the place to be if you're looking for rooftop views and a younger crowd.Day 2: Get a Little More Local  Start the day off by grabbing some coffee at Fido, Taylor Swift's favorite coffee shop on 21st Ave South. It's in an adorable area with plenty of unique shops and boutiques. Right down the street is the Pancake Pantry where there will always be a well-deserved line to wait in. But if you're not hungry until later, order a burger or wings at the Double Dogs sports bar and enjoy the laid back feel and an impressive number of flat screens. Without going far from the area, visit Centennial Park and see the full-scale replica of the Parthenon. Also, go right next door if you want to stroll through the Vanderbilt campus. Take a drive through Music Row to see the heart of the Nashville music industry on your way to the Midtown area. Get some local hot chicken at Hattie B's Hot Chicken. You're not the only one looking for hot chicken though, so be prepared to wait in line. Afterwards, enjoy the bars in Midtown and Demonbreun, and make sure to make a stop at Rebar.Day 3: Take a Day Trip  Enjoy a scenic drive to nearby Arrington Vineyards. Try some wine tasting and bring a picnic to enjoy in their awesome outdoor space. After you fall asleep on one of the bench swings, jump back in the car and head to the Grand Ole Opry. Take a tour through one of the most famous music venues and be sure to go next door to the Grand Ole Opry Hotel, which features a giant indoor garden and river. Head back into East Nashville and explore the artsy shopping scene in that part of town. For dinner, stop at The Pharmacy Burger Parlor & Beer Garden. The servings are generous and there is a wide beer selection to enjoy in the outdoor beer garden seating. Finish off the night by trying out another downtown area, The Gulch, where you'll be sure to find some bars with a lot of character.Begin the day in the 12 South neighborhood. This area includes the Frothy Monkey coffee house, The Filling Station where you can stop for some quality beer, Corner Music Inc. (look for the guitar signed by multiple music stars), and a handful of modern and laid back shopping options. Don't miss a photo opp as there's a multitude of murals along the street. After you've gotten your fill here, head north to wander around the very old and very huge Farmer's Market. While you're at it take a stroll through the Bicentennial Mall close by. In the evening, go out with a bang and catch a show at Ryman Auditorium. There area always amazing shows going on and this is a perfect last impression before departing from the capital of country music!Have you studied abroad?

If you don't teach your children boundaries by showing them that they exist, they won't know how to set their own boundaries when they grow up.",2016-04-24,"Young happy caucasian woman listening music in the nature with her modern ear phone, during the sunset.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9f52342000003100feb57c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Families are like orchestras but sometimes, everybody is playing a different tune. Maybe yours sounds like a mixture between rap and punk with a smidgen of Mozart trying to get a look in?   If you're a parent who's willing to throw away the earmuffs, then listen up. Let me introduce 4 Parenting Tips I affectionately call the Four Rs -- Roles, Rules, Respect and Repetition. These four can transform your chaotic orchestra into some good vibrations.Now, before you anticipate Handel's Messiah, let me first explain how these Four R's work. They won't turn your home into a symphony over-night, but when used correctly and consistently, you'll notice the difference in a major way. Let's begin with the basics.ROLES  I'd like for you to believe for a moment that your family really is an orchestra and that the roles within your family represent different instruments... trumpet, violin, drums and so on. Can you imagine what the orchestral family would sound like if no one knew what instrument (role) they were supposed to be playing? It would be a mess. People would be constantly swapping instruments or fighting over who gets to bang the drums and instead of music, there would be noise.WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO KNOW YOUR ROLE? With that said, let me ask you a question, ""What is your role at home?"" I'm amazed at how many parents really don't know the answer to this question. Often I get a blank look but when I ask them what their role at work is, they've got that one all figured out. Why do you think that is? The sad truth is, if you don't know your role, then there's little chance of your children or your spouse knowing theirs.Every great orchestra needs a Maestro, someone in charge of the baton. Without someone to orchestrate and lead the performance, everybody might be playing their part but likely not together. If the musicians do their own thing without any unity or agreement, there's no hope for harmony and the same holds true for families. So someone has got to wear the pants (hint: it can't be one of the kids). Though everyone may certainly have a vote, not every vote holds the same power or authority. Ultimately, parents have the last say -- they have veto power.Now, before you walk up to the podium, grab the baton and take charge, there  are a couple more things you need to know before you get yourself in treble (pun intended).WHERE THE MAESTRO FITS IN Now, I hate to burst your bubble here but just because you are the Maestro, doesn't mean you can make music on your own. You have to remember that you are just an itty bitty part of the orchestra, not the whole shebang. You can maestro all you like but without your musicians, you are just waving your hands in the air.The Maestro's job is to assign the different roles within the orchestra (and the family) and set the tempo. Notice I used the word, ""assign"" which implies that someone with authority has transferred some level of responsibility to someone else. When it comes to families, roles are essential to setting boundaries and defining responsibilities.Boundaries are crucial. If you don't teach your children boundaries by showing them that they exist, they won't know how to set their own boundaries when they grow up. Children live what they learn at home. A successful orchestra plays within the boundaries but with enough room to express creativity. The boundaries are the rules -- read on.WHAT'S RULES GOT TO DO WITH IT? It might sound like a bad Tina Turner song, but rules really do have everything to do with it. Rules are essential to happy and healthy families. Here's why.If the family is the orchestra and roles are the instruments, then rules are the sheet music. The sheet music provides the guidance and instructions for each member of the orchestra or family to follow. It's the template to hang everything on. With no rules or ""sheet music"", there would only be chaos, confusion and contention. Rules in the home are the specific standards established by you, the parents. All members of the family need to follow them to create order, clarity, security and unity -- in other words, beautiful music. You have to make sure that everybody knows the rules, understands the rules, recognizes why the rules are important and last but certainly not least, appreciates what the consequences will be if they violate said rules. This not only lets your child know what's expected of them, but, maybe more importantly, it also lets them know what's expected from you as the parent.Rules should be practical, simple, mostly positive, limited in number, easy to understand and easy to remember. If you can't remember the rules on demand, how can you expect your children to?R.E.S.P.E.C.T... FIND OUT WHAT IT MEANS  If the family is the orchestra, roles are the instruments and rules are the notes, then respect would represent the ability of the orchestra (family) to work and play together in harmony. This is often the automatic result of wise and educated parents correctly applying the rules and roles mentioned above.For harmony to ever exist, it's important that all family members respect the views, opinions and perspectives of every other member. It doesn't mean you have to agree with everything someone says however, it simply means you need to validate every family member's unique perspective. As long as that perspective is courteously expressed, it's allowed. This is much like how a violinist would be counted on to view a percussionist or a trumpeter. Each instrument has an important role to play within the orchestra, yet no role is more important than any other.Take Note: Respect is an outward display of trust and confidence. If you are finding it hard to gain the respect of your family, try gaining their trust first. Defining your role in the home whilst being firm and consistent with the rules will go a long way to developing more trust within your family unit.REPITITION Repetition, aka practice, is really important. No orchestra gets to be good and  certainly not great without a great deal of practice. They go over the same piece again and again and again. This is how it is with children, get used to it. You can't lay down the rules once and expect everyone to be in tune -- it ain't gonna happen.So let's wrap it all up in a tidy little nutshell and leave on a high note. There has to be a Maestro, whose job is to assign the Roles, make the Rules, model appropriate behavior and command Respect using plenty of Repetition, without harping all the time, of course. Remember, no one expects you to be perfect. You can do it! Now go out there and create your opus.Brook Price is president and co-founder of Forte Strong, a failure-to-launch program that gives young men the skills and character traits they need to tackle the challenges of life.

This sisterhood of black girl magic, said more eloquently in Maya Angelou's Still I Rise, is a reminder of our collective strength.",2016-04-24,"FILE - In this Sunday, Feb. 7, 2016, file photo, Beyonce performs during halftime of the NFL Super Bowl 50 football game in Santa Clara, Calif. Beyonce dropped more than an album with âLemonade,â Saturday, April 23, 2016, her dazzling new musical and visual project that speaks to the deeply personal and political. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae133f2100003100c6c572.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Beyoncé! Sister girl, sister girl!Watching Lemonade seemed like catching glimpses of my mother and aunts at Granny's kitchen table, reminiscent of Annie Lee's picture of women playing cards. As a little girl, my aunts typically went to Granny's house at least once a week. You knew it was something serious when all the women went in the kitchen and told us kids to play outside or go upstairs and play. Granny was southern, so kids were never left unsupervised. If we were sent upstairs, something happened. While others dutifully obeyed, I hid on the stairs to listen as my mother and her sisters would tell Granny what was wrong. Granny would put on a pot of coffee -- an old fashioned percolator. I remember when they all mourned because my cousin's menstrual started at age nine. Most of the times, these ""sitting at the kitchen table"" discussions meant that someone's husband was unfaithful, lost a job, tried to hit an aunt, or mismanaged money in a ""Walter Lee Younger"" fashion. My Granny would listen as her daughters talked about the issues of balancing wife, motherhood, and life. Granny typically would say that their ultimate duty was to raise and protect their kids regardless of the husband's foolishness, even if that meant leaving. I often wondered whether my mom and aunts would have married if they had the same educational opportunities I had.However, my education did not prevent me or my educated girlfriends from making the same mistakes with men. As I watched Lemonade, it felt like Beyoncé took pieces of my Granny's kitchen table discussions and conversations with my girlfriends over relationships that ended either in divorce or from the realization that we deserved better. It reminded me of how during a recent break up, my girlfriends comforted me with emails and text messages reminding me of my worth. Like most women in a break-up, Beyoncé tackled the crazy or jealous question with a new version of Jazmine Sullivan's Bust the Windows. I remember after my first big heartbreak, I called my aunt. It was the first time she spoke to me as a woman and not as her niece. She said in a matter-of-fact way, ""You ain't going through nothing every other woman hasn't gone through. You gone be alright."" That's when I realized that my aunts and mother had more strength than I realized. Indeed, I was alright and moved on to better things. But at that time, when I thought my world was crumbling and that I was not good enough, that ""you gone be alright"" was light.Lemonade speaks to generations -- mothers to daughters, grandmothers to granddaughters. This sisterhood of black girl magic, said more eloquently in Maya Angelou's Still I Rise, is a reminder of our collective strength. We are phenomenal women. I loved that Beyoncé included young black girls rising like Michaela DePrince, Amandla Stenberg, Zendaya, Quvenzhané Wallis, and Chloe and Halle. It's a reminder that this circle of life is bigger than us. As women, we have a duty to pass down our wisdom, aka ""mother wit,"" to the young girls watching and looking up to us for guidance. I used my recent breakup as an example to my nieces to never dim your light to make someone else comfortable. Don't be afraid to walk away when as Nina Simone said ""love is no longer being served."" I hope my nieces learn from my good, bad, and ugly so that they won't repeat the same mistakes, to know their worth, and celebrate their uniqueness.Beyoncé's Daddy Lesson was the song that spoke to me the most. I am a daddy's girl. Yet, my dad and I often butted heads because the things he told me never to take from a man, he did not always mirror to my mother. I wrote about the power fathers possess over their daughters - for better or worse they set the standard for every man that comes after. The daughter in me loved her daddy. The woman in me had issues with his male chauvinist ways towards my mother. Before his death, my dad and I spoke of this and made peace with what caused a rift in our relationship. I will always be a daddy's girl, but Dad always said, ""Men are pigs. I know because I used to be one."" After my first breakup, my Dad flew two thousand miles to comfort me and find the fool that broke my heart to teach him a lesson. After convincing my dad that the guy was not worth the trouble, he said: ""Treat men with a long-handled spoon. Never give a man your heart until he gives you his otherwise he won't appreciate it."" My own ""daddy lessons.""Beyoncé's black girl magic and love for women, particularly black women made me exhale. Sister girl, sister girl! I was going to get a bottle of wine to watch the season premiere of Game of Thrones. Instead, I picked up some Limoncello to have a grown woman's glass of lemonade.

Photo courtesy White House Press OfficeThis week, while on a three-day visit to Great Britain, President Barack Obama waded into the British political debate surrounding the upcoming, June 23, referendum on Britain's continued membership in the European Union--nicknamed ""Brexit."" The visit coincided with the formal beginning of the political campaign over the measure. President Obama's comments in favor of Great Britain's continued membership in the EU were welcomed by British Prime Minister David Cameron, but brought swift condemnation from ""euro-sceptics,"" supporters of a British withdrawal from the EU. Boris Johnson, the mayor of London and a leader of the pro-exit euro-sceptics or ""outers,"" accused Obama of meddling in British domestic affairs, saying that Obama was advocating for Britain policies that the US would never accept for itself. He was sharply criticized when he cited ""the part-Kenyan president's ancestral dislike of the British Empire"" and called his remarks ""incoherent,"" ""inconsistent and...downright hypocritical.""What exactly is Brexit and what does the upcoming referendum mean for the future of Great Britain and the EU and how could it affect the United States?First of all the United Kingdom European Union Membership Referendum, popularly referred to as ""Brexit,"" a contraction of the words British exit, does not mandate an automatic withdrawal from the EU. Under article 50 of the 1993 Treaty of European Union (Maastricht Treaty), and the 2009 Treaty of Lisbon, a member state must first give notice to the European Council that it wishes to withdraw.Once notice is given, negotiations would begin over the withdrawal. During this period the notice could be withdrawn if a new agreement is reached, although any such agreement would, from a political standpoint, necessitate another referendum approving it. If no other agreement was reached, the withdrawal would become effective on the second anniversary of the original notice to the European Council. Moreover, even if Great Britain was to leave the EU, it could still opt to join the European Economic Area (EEA) or the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). The EEA allows for the free flow of persons, goods services and capital between the member states of the EU and Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway. EFTA also allows for a free trade area and includes the members of the EEA, as well as Switzerland. Both organizations would allow Great Britain the benefits of a European wide common market and would still require some financial contributions to the EU, but the scope and reach of EU mandated legislation and administrative jurisdiction would be significantly curtailed. London mayor Boris Johnson ringing the opening bell at NASDAQ September 14, 2009According to the Economist's daily tracking poll as of April 21, a slight plurality of 51 percent, ""the inners,"" are in favor of staying in the EU. The ""outers"" on the other hand are polling 40 percent, while the balance of nine percent are undecided. Its believed by many pollsters that the undecided will likely break disproportionately in favor of staying in the EU.The debate over Brexit has created a deep fissure within the British electorate and sharply divided the Conservative Party, while at the same time fueling the rise of the pro-exit, United Kingdom Independent Party (UKIP). Many of the UKIP's supporters are dissatisfied Conservative Party voters. According to an in-depth analysis by The Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House), on average, Britain's ""outers"" are poorly educated, having ""left school before their seventeenth birthday,"" are ""over 55 years old"" and are employed in ""less secure, lower-income jobs."" This group has ""strong concerns over immigration and its perceived effects on Britain's economy, culture and welfare state."" Demographically, the ""outers"" have much in common with the American voters driving the populist campaign of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.The Obama administration sees a potential UK exit from the European Union as highly destabilizing to the EU; a view widely shared in US government circles. The EU accounts for about 20 percent of US exports, with the UK representing the largest share with the European Community. Roughly one out of every five dollars of exports to Europe goes to the UK. A Brexit would complicate current US plans to negotiate the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TIPP) with the EU. Britain is also the US main business gateway to continental Europe. Uncertainty about Great Britain's future economic relations with the EU would prove disruptive to American exports to Europe. Great Britain is a key gateway to US exports to EuropeMoreover, from Washington's standpoint, the EU represents an institution of regional order and stability on the continent. It has played a critical role in stabilizing economically and politically the former communist regimes in Eastern Europe, and has a major ongoing role in doing the same thing in the Balkans. Historically the EU has been seen as an ""exporter"" of stability and order to the southern and eastern rim of the Mediterranean, although of late it seems that it has instead become an ""importer"" of the regions chaos and violence.Continued EU political and financial support for Ukraine is critical to stabilizing that country, as well as resisting Moscow's attempts to reassert its influence in the former Soviet satellite states of Eastern Europe. Finally, Washington sees the European Union as a critical partner in its efforts to contain and curb the spread of international jihadism and terrorist violence. From America's perspective, any action that weakens the European Community, its internal cohesion, or further fragments its decision making process is detrimental to US interests.In addition, a stable and united Europe allows Washington to focus on more pressing concerns in the Middle East, Central Asia and East Asia, especially rising Chinese aggressiveness in the South and East China Seas, continuing issues with nuclear proliferation, and especially Iran's and North Korea's nuclear weapons program, as well as Russian assertiveness in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. From the US's point of view, continued UK participation in EU institutions maximizes British influence on the continent and in turn makes it a more valuable ally to America.A Brexit could also have one other consequence, that of reviving Scottish sentiments for independence. Historically the EU has been adamant that breakaway regions of current EU members would not retain access to the European-wide common market but upon their independence would have to reapply for membership. That prospect is a significant source of economic uncertainty and risks potentially devastating economic consequences for would be secessionists. Those risks played a major role in persuading Scottish voters to reject independence from the United Kingdom. Scotland's voters are strongly pro-EU. A Brexit and the possibility of a swift ascension to the EU in the event of independence could well tip the balance in favor of Scotland's own exit, shall we call it ""Scexit,"" from the UK. Demonstrations against National Front, Paris May 29, 2014Finally, a British exit from the EU will underscore the contentiousness of the current European debate over immigration as well as the increasing unwillingness of the ""rich,"" northern tier of the EU to economically subsidize the poorer southern tier.The euro-sceptic trend may be older and more widespread in Britain, but it is becoming increasingly powerful elsewhere on the continent. The Dutch voters' recent rejection of Ukraine membership in the European common market being the most recent example.Barring any dramatic new developments, it's likely that the ""inners"" will eke out a narrow victory over the ""outers."" June 23 is still two months away, however, and much can happen in the intervening period. Financial concerns will ultimately weigh heavily on voters in the Brexit referendum as they did on Scottish voters during the referendum on Scottish independence. The Cameron government's claims that a Brexit will cost the average British family 4,000 pounds yearly, roughly 5,800 dollars, in lower economic growth may sway the remaining undecideds. Either way, this issue will not be settled by the outcome of the Brexit referendum and is likely to auger a new period of dissension and instability within the EU for the foreseeable future."

(Photo by Cedric Ribeiro/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb93b1924000031009912c1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Anyone who isn't confused or conflicted on the topic of Israel probably isn't looking into it too deeply. There are two distinctly, almost surreally different narratives in Israel and Palestine... and to a great extent, both are right and both are wrong. Both peoples have suffered greatly and both have legitimate grievances against the other. Holding that juxtaposition is itself a challenge. But things get even thornier when one adds to the mix the most essential fact of all: that neither the Israelis nor the Palestinians are going anywhere.   The us-versus-them paradigm articulated by both far right and far left on this issue does more to exacerbate than to solve the problem. And in their own ways, they're both delusional. The extreme right sees Israel as all angel -- all victim, no demon; while the extreme left sees the Palestinians in that same light. Such positions range from the intentionally false to the ridiculously naïve. Neither position feeds the angels of our better nature, so much as the jackals of anger that inhabit the landscape of all unthinking extremes. Anyone seeking a real solution in Israel and Palestine rejects the us-versus-them mentality entirely. The solution to the problem is not on the level of land, but on the level of consciousness. The fundamental polarity in that region is not between Israelis and Palestinians, but between those who hate and those who love. Among both Israelis and Palestinians -- people actually living with the problem on a daily basis, not just spouting off about it in swank hotel ballrooms or on college campuses -- there are heroes who demonstrate the true fundamentals of peace-making: that any possibility of a sustainable future belongs to those who refuse, in their hearts, to reject anyone. What we need to reject is hatred itself.The problem isn't just that the situation is so crazy; the deeper problem is the crazies on both sides.The extreme right is filled with those refusing to acknowledge a legitimate right to dignity and respect for the Palestinians, much less the legitimacy of their desire for a homeland for themselves. Certain facets of the extreme right in Israel are unquestionably as racist against Arabs as extreme Arabs are racist against the Jews. They display at times a profound mean-spiritedness -- the willingness to grab land that does not belong to them, tolerate oppression, and put their own perceived needs before the needs of others in a way that is neither politically nor morally justifiable. One of the most tragic aspects of their position is that it counters every core Jewish value, thus making a mockery of the spiritual legitimacy of a Jewish State.   The extreme left in America, however, often refuses to acknowledge a legitimate right to dignity and respect for the Israelis. Many Americans parroting lines about ""a more balanced approach in the Middle East"" are promulgating the message, whether they're conscious of it or not, ""To hell with the Israelis; if they die, they die."" One wonders how some of them would react if Al Qaeda was amassed along our border with Canada -- a legitimate analogy to the presence of Hamas in Gaza, by the way -- building huge underground tunnels through which they could launch a military invasion of Seattle or Detroit. One can't help but think many of them would be the first to panic, their cries of ""Save us!"" drowning out any pleas to make sure the response is proportionate. It's not Israel's fault that Hamas forces use human shields. And oh, did I tell you? Hamas and ISIL are bros now.So what are we to do? Some of the most intelligent people have just thrown up their hands in despair, simply assuming at this point that the status quo will have to hold. But fortunately or unfortunately, the status quo never holds forever. What we have to do is rethink this. The biggest problem in the region is a mindset, and the only answer in the region is a new one. Only when we have a new mental filter will we have a new Middle East.  On a recent trip to Israel and Palestine, I was struck not by the hatred I saw but by the love I saw. I visited a school called Hand in Hand in an Arab village in Israel -- one of seven throughout the country -- where every classroom is headed by two teachers: one Jewish and one Arab. All Jewish students learn Arabic, and all Arab students learn Hebrew. They learn not only each other's language, but also each other's culture. Their families are involved in creating a community of inclusivity, an honor for each other's differences combined with the cultivation of shared values. Hand in Hand teachers and school administrators are committed to providing the children with that most critical aspect of peace-building: genuine affection of the other, based on familiarity and understanding -- especially during early childhood.People such as those who created and maintain the Hand in Hand schools exist all over the Middle East. They are educators, businesspeople, politicians, journalists and more. While they aren't the ones who grab headlines in Europe or America, in both Israel and Palestine there are smart, intelligent, deeply humanistic, ready-to-do-things-differently, tired-of-all-the-fighting, know-we-have-to-compromise-so-let's-just-figure-out-a-way-to-do-it, wanting-a-better-future-for-their-kids-just-like-we-do, wonderful human beings who don't need any of us to support their attitudes of anger or victimization. It's often not people who are the problem -- it's governments that are the problem. No, we shouldn't always agree with Benjamin Netanyahu, but neither should we kid ourselves about the deep corruption of the Palestinian Authority or the terrorist threat of Hamas. The real partners for peace are everyday citizens -- Palestinians and Israelis who represent a survivable and sustainable future, not only for their children but also for all humanity. They are those who can listen to the righteous pleas of the other, who can genuinely acknowledge the pain of the other, and can recognize the legitimate aspirations of the other.They meet in a field of consciousness beyond the past, and beyond guilt. ""Out beyond all ideas of good and bad, right and wrong, there is a field. I'll meet you there,"" wrote Rumi. And that is not just poetry. It is a description of the only place where we can meet. Those in both Israel and Palestine who are preparing that field - day after day, despite the rejection of a world that does not understand - are the true deliverers from the insanity of our times. They know the only survivable future for their children is in a land that's called Forgiveness.I have no further listening for the naïve and simplistic voices on either side of this argument. Only those who honor equally the aspirations of both Arab and Jew deserve credence, and the newly minted pro-Palestinian/anti-Israel stance so in vogue on the Left these days is no less imbalanced than the previously accepted pro-Israel/anti-Palestinian position it seeks to replace. Hate is hate, and it ultimately serves no one. No mother's son is more precious than any other mother's son. No people have more of a right than any other to a homeland. And in both Israel and Palestine, there are enough people in both places who know that. Let's support them.As it says in A Course in Miracles, ""The holiest spot on earth is where an ancient hatred has become a present love."" I felt that holiness in both Tel Aviv and Ramallah. I saw it in the eyes and heard it in the words and felt it in the handshakes of the people I met in both Israel and Palestine. Those who don't understand this conversation have little to offer at this point; those who do understand it, need to start thinking about this issue and engaging it more forcefully. Politics as usual doesn't even begin to provide a context for any real solution, because the biggest problem is inside our hearts. The last thing we need is more people pointing their fingers at either side; the greatest enemy is that pointed finger. The struggle between Israelis and Palestinians is a perfect reflection of the struggle between fear and forgiveness that rages within us all. A spiritual perspective doesn't choose sides in this battle, but rather hovers above the battlefield. For only there does the battle end. The relationship between Israelis and Palestinians lays bare every wound and every yearning of the human heart, encapsulating both the tragedy of our humanity and also the potential for our redemption. The search for the Holy Land is above all else an internal journey. We shouldn't expect it to be sweet all the time; just expect it to be real."

When the members of the new Central Committee were announced the following day, Fidel was not among them. Generational succession is high on the agenda of Cuba's leadership, still dominated at the highest level by ""los historicos"" -- the generation that fought together against the Batista dictatorship and founded the revolutionary regime. At the previous Party Congress in 2011, Raúl Castro emphasized the need to build a contingent of experienced young men and women for the inevitable succession. To ease out the old guard, he introduced term limits for top government and party positions -- no more than two five-year terms -- and pledged to abide by the limit himself by stepping down as president in 2018.At the Congress this month, Raúl reiterated the importance of rejuvenating the party. An aged leadership was ""never positive,"" he said, reminding listeners that three leaders of the Soviet Communist Party died within months of one another a few years before it collapsed. Henceforth, Castro proposed, 60 would be the maximum age for admission to the Central Committee, and 70 would be the maximum age for assuming any leadership position. Nevertheless, renovating the leadership will involve a ""five-year period of transition to avoid doing things in haste,"" Castro explained, echoing his watchword for updating the economy: ""without haste, but without pause."" The blend of old and young was visible in the new Political Bureau. Only two of the fourteen members in the old body were dropped -- General Abelardo Colomé Ibarra, who retired as minister of the Interior in October 2015 because of ill-health, and Adel Yzquierdo Rodríguez, who was removed as Minister of Economy and Planning in 2014.José Ramón Machado Ventura, the architect of the party apparatus over preceding decades, retained his post as second secretary despite the fact that he is widely seen as a conservative, skeptical of economic reform. In 2013, Machado stepped down as first vice-president of the Council of State, replaced by heir apparent Miguel Díaz-Canel. Machado's retention as party second secretary suggests that Raúl Castro is intent on maintaining unity at the top -- despite differences in opinion -- as the party navigates the politically treacherous waters of economic change. Five new young members were added and their professions signal the issues the leadership sees as critical going forward. Three are technocrats: one is minister of Health, one works in biotechnology, and one works in information technology -- all high value-added fields that Cuba hopes will form the foundation for its 21st Century economy. The other two new members are the leaders of the trade union federation and the women's federation, organizations that, between them, comprise almost all Cuban adults. The inclusion of these two leaders speaks to the party's need to keep ears to the ground for early warning signs of grassroots discontent unleashed by the economic reforms.The composition of the new Central Committee also suggests how the leadership is preparing its team for the future. Twenty-five percent of the old committee was dropped, but the membership was expanded from 116 to 142 to accommodate the addition of 55 younger members, all below the age of 60, bringing the average age of the body down to 54.5 -- younger than the committee elected in 2011. The new committee is also 44.4% women, up from 41.7% in 2011 and just 13.3% in 1997; and 35.9% Afro-Cuba, up from 31.3% in 2011 and just 10.0% in 1997.The Central Committee of the party represents an extended leadership group, the members of which typically hold other important posts in various state institutions. The relative bureaucratic influence of those institutions can be seen in the Central Committee's changing composition. The biggest increase in representation in the new committee is for government officials working in economic and scientific fields (Table 1). They represent 23.2% of the new Central Committee, up from just 19.8% in the 2011 committee. Presumably, these people are more technocratically minded, and more likely to support economic reform. Representation of the party apparatus increased only slightly, to 32.4% of the committee, up from 31.0% in 2011. Contrary to pundits who insist that the Cuban regime is really run by the military, the armed forces and police were the big losers in the renovation of the Central Committee. Even though the committee expanded from 116 to 142 members, the number of military and security officials fell in absolute terms. They comprise just 9.2% of the membership, down from 13.8% in 2011. Moreover, the long term trend in the number of active duty military and security officials in the Central Committee has been downward ever since 1965 (Figure).Fidel Castro wasn't the only prominent Castro not included in the new Central Committee. Neither Raúl's son, Col. Alejandro Castro, who negotiated the December 17 agreement to normalize relations with the United States, nor Raúl's daughter, LGBT activist Mariela Castro, were included. Their absence was, no doubt, a disappointment to opponents of the U.S. opening to Cuba who have been predicting that Alejandro would succeed his father, thereby consolidating a Castro family dynasty -- North Korea in the Caribbean. The new Central Committee of the Cuban Communist Party reflects the priorities and style of its First Secretary. The party itself maintains the leading role, but the committee has a more technocratic tilt, positioning it for the complex economic tasks ahead. It combines a large new cohort of younger members, while retaining a core of experienced elders to smooth the generational transition. The increased representation of women and Afro-Cubans reflects their important role in society and politics, connecting the party to these key constituencies. In short, the new leadership exemplifies a party updating itself for the future without renouncing its past."

Contrary to pundits who insist that the Cuban regime is really run by the military, the armed forces and police were the big losers in the renovation of the Central Committee. Even though the committee expanded from 116 to 142 members, the number of military and security officials fell in absolute terms. They comprise just 9.2% of the membership, down from 13.8% in 2011. Moreover, the long term trend in the number of active duty military and security officials in the Central Committee has been downward ever since 1965 (Figure).Fidel Castro wasn't the only prominent Castro not included in the new Central Committee. Neither Raúl's son, Col. Alejandro Castro, who negotiated the December 17 agreement to normalize relations with the United States, nor Raúl's daughter, LGBT activist Mariela Castro, were included. Their absence was, no doubt, a disappointment to opponents of the U.S. opening to Cuba who have been predicting that Alejandro would succeed his father, thereby consolidating a Castro family dynasty -- North Korea in the Caribbean. The new Central Committee of the Cuban Communist Party reflects the priorities and style of its First Secretary. The party itself maintains the leading role, but the committee has a more technocratic tilt, positioning it for the complex economic tasks ahead. It combines a large new cohort of younger members, while retaining a core of experienced elders to smooth the generational transition. The increased representation of women and Afro-Cubans reflects their important role in society and politics, connecting the party to these key constituencies. In short, the new leadership exemplifies a party updating itself for the future without renouncing its past."

I wish yourself and David Cameron would take us seriously as transgender people, and perhaps you could elucidate what you can do to go beyond what has been accepted by the LGBTQ rights movement, in including people who fit outside the social norms?"" Munir asked, according to Sky News.""I know that in North Carolina, people are having to produce birth certificates to go to the toilet,"" Munir told the president.“You should feel encouraged social attitudes are changing ... [that] doesn’t mean it’s fast enough, but you should keep pushing and it’s in part due to the courageous acts of young people like yourself,"" Obama responded.Munir told the BBC it was important to come out to the president to help destigmatize thoughts about the trans community. “If I can use myself as a sacrifice, of maybe being ostracised by my community, maybe I will be able to prevent other young people from being ostracised by their community,” Munir told the outlet. Munir said they had not yet come out to their parents, but knows that “they will accept me when they see how much of a change I can have throughout the world.”Munir’s question came on the heels of recent discriminatory laws against the LGBTQ community passed by North Carolina and Mississippi. Obama said the laws should be overturned, but they won’t be without support from Congress. During the town hall, Obama also admitted it took his daughters and Vice President Joe Biden to change his position on marriage equality from a strictly legal issue to a social one.“I have to confess my children generally had an impact on me,” Obama said. “People I loved who were in monogamous same-sex relationships explained to me what I should have understood earlier, which is it was not simply about legal rights but about a sense of stigma, that if you’re calling it something different it means that somehow it means less in the eyes of society.”Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that the town hall took place at York University.

A team of researchers at the University of California, Irvine, recently has invented just that using a nanowire-based battery material.This doesn't mean that we'll soon see such batteries on store shelves. The new research was intended to test nanowires and not a practical battery, research co-author Dr. Reginald Penner, chemistry professor at the university, told The Huffington Post on Friday.The new battery technology, however, could edge us closer to possibly developing longer lasting commercial batteries for computers, smartphones, cars and spacecraft in the future.""Scientists are interested in nanowires because they allow high power to be obtained, without reducing the total amount of energy that is stored,"" Penner said.""But nanowires are fragile,"" he added. ""Any corrosion or dissolution of the nanowire material leads very quickly to breakage of the nanowire, and a loss of its capacity -- which is bad. Our research is important because it demonstrates that a very simple modification to a battery or capacitor may allow nanowire electrode materials to last a lot longer, up to 40 times longer in our studies.""For the research, published in the journal Energy Letters on Wednesday, gold nanowires were coated with a manganese dioxide shell and encased in an electrolyte made of a Plexiglas-like gel. The nanowires are each thousands of times thinner than a human hair.Next, the researchers tested the power of the electrode up to 200,000 times over three months. They were shocked to find that, despite all of the tests, there was no loss of capacity or power and the nanowires didn't fracture.""We were not attempting to extend the cycle life of these electrodes -- we just were trying to prepare a solid state version of ​them by substituting a gel electrolyte for the liquid electrolyte,"" Penner said.Such batteries so far have been engineered to withstand only a certain number of cycles. Previous studies by other scientists have yielded nanowires that could only achieve 7,000 cycles, Discovery News reported.The researchers concluded that the gel may plasticize the metal oxide in the battery and give it added flexibility, while also preventing any cracking -- allowing it to last longer than expected.""The coated electrode holds its shape much better, making it a more reliable option,"" said research lead author Mya Le Thai, a UCI doctoral candidate, in a statement. ""This research proves that a nanowire-based battery electrode can have a long lifetime and that we can make these kinds of batteries a reality."""

The U.S. and nearly 170 other countries signed the Paris climate agreement, which aims to limit global warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius, in a ceremony at the United Nations headquarters in New York on Friday.Although the U.S. has officially signed on to the accord, the next president could still in theory refuse to uphold America's commitment to cutting carbon emissions. Under the Paris accord, carbon reductions are voluntary and established by each country. In addition, the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change lacks a way to enforce each country’s pledge.“In the end, presidents, especially if they have a Congress that’s willing to go along, can totally shape U.S. climate policy and can reshape it,” David Goldston, director of government affairs at the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund, told Public Radio International in March.There’s a history of newly elected presidents abandoning international treaties their predecessors endorsed. In 2001, former President George Bush famously rejected the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, which the U.S. had signed on to in 1998.The major difference between the Kyoto protocol and the Paris agreement? Kyoto required only developed nations to slash greenhouse gas emissions, exempting 100 countries, including China and India, from mandatory reductions. In the Paris agreement, all countries are on the hook to cut emissions.Diringer thinks it's unlikely that the next president would totally abandon the Paris agreement. And he isn’t alone in this view. Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University and a senior adviser to the U.N., made much the same argument this week.To back out of the agreement, “you [would] have to blow off the whole rest of the world,"" Sachs told CNN on Friday. ""And I don't think [the U.S. would] find another partner to do that. You'd have to just be the renegade state.""Moreover, Americans want the government to get serious about climate change. Over 90 percent of Americans believe in global warming and two-thirds support the Paris deal, whereas as late as 2005, fewer than half of Americans said they supported the Kyoto protocol. Public support for the agreement might already be pushing the Republican-controlled Congress to accept the climate deal, or at least not publicly oppose it.“We’re seeing a tacit acceptance [of the Paris agreement] in Congress,” Diringer said. “There’s no sign at all of a concerted effort on the Hill to challenge the agreement.""Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

Despite recent improvements, northern users say more action is needed before the system grinds to a halt.Consider the chaos that would erupt if London or Tokyo lost all of its telecommunications connectivity for a day or two.In northern Canada a miniature version of that nightmare scenario is a distressingly common experience, especially in Nunavut, which is completely reliant on satellite bandwidth for its telecommunications services. In 2011, Telesat Canada’s Anik F2 satellite suffered a “technical anomaly” that caused its signal to point away from Earth and toward the sun.The result was a full-blown communications meltdown in Nunavut and parts of Yukon and the Northwest Territories (NWT). In Iqaluit, business came to a virtual standstill for 16 hours as internet, cellular and long-distance phone connections were all lost. Airlines were forced to cancel flights and Nunavut’s premier took to the local CBC station to communicate with local officials in the territory’s far-flung hamlets. Beyond the nightmare scenario is the monthly grind of expensive bills, usage caps and limited download speeds. Those speeds vary widely, from under 5 megabits per second (mbps) in Iqaluit to an advertised 125 mbps in Whitehorse, a package that costs C$190 ($150) per month. The cost of internet punishes everyone from casual individual users to business owners to large institutions, said David Wasylciw, director of the Smart Communities Society in Yellowknife, NWT, which advocates for internet access for northern nonprofits.“There’s a lot of mid-sized businesses here that, their power bills are pretty high, but their internet bills are just as bad or worse,” he said. “It increases the cost of living up here.”This month, the CRTC, Canada’s national telecommunications regulator, is holding hearings on the state of the country’s broadband internet, with a focus on service for rural and remote communities. The commission is weighing whether telecom providers should be obligated to provide broadband. Northern internet users have a great deal at stake on the answer.Outside of Whitehorse and Yellowknife, many communities rely on a patchwork system of microwave repeater stations or satellite links that, by their very nature, choke off speeds and drive up costs. In places like Dawson City, which gets a microwave signal that’s connected to the fiber-optic line further south, a DSL package offers reasonable speeds, albeit at an advertised price of $84 per month for 200 monthly gigabytes. But that doesn’t include the cost of a mandatory telephone line or a $20-per-month fee if you choose to opt out of the phone line.But the situation is most dire in Nunavut. The territory’s satellite system is groaning under the weight of more and more users going online as the territory’s young population mushrooms and data needs expand.The growing move to streaming software means Nunavut users are often out of luck when it comes to buying, say, design software or updating operating systems, files that can sometimes be several gigabytes in size.That’s enough to shred even the largest internet plans. Northwestel’s best package in Iqaluit offers 5 mbps and a 50 gigabytes (GB) usage cap, all for a cool C$190 ($150) per month. Every gig over the cap is an extra C$10. Outside of the capital, a similar package, provided by the heavily subsidized Qiniq service can reach C$400 (around $300) per month. Meanwhile, the network is so congested, government workers routinely resort to sending files by mail or thumb drive, and to scheduling large downloads for the middle of the night.Even an autoplay advertisement on a news site has implications for the pocketbook, said Iqaluit mayor Madeleine Redfern. “I just cringe and think ‘Oh yeah, how much is that going to cost me?’ I don’t even want to watch it.” Redfern spoke to me from Victoria, where she was using some of her vacation time to download an update for Microsoft Word. This kind of thing is commonplace for Nunavummiut travelling in the south.“We’re getting a fraction of the service [available in southern Canada] at twice the cost,” said Oana Spinu, executive director of the Nunavut Broadband Development Corporation. “The consequences are that people are self-censoring” their use of the internet, effectively asking “Is it worth it?” before downloading, she said.If the situation affected only online multiplayer video games, it might not matter so much. But Spinu said Nunavut’s anemic broadband connection has an impact that resonates through nearly every facet of daily life. It constrains the healthcare and legal systems that rely on teleconferencing and routine transfers of large files. And it impacts the education system: all of Nunavut’s schools must share between them 50 mbps worth of bandwidth.In her testimony to the CRTC, Spinu characterized the territory’s situation as a “market failure.” “It’s not possible for market forces alone to meet the territory’s telecommunications needs,” she told me. Nor, she added, do the federal subsidy programs that typically last three or four years at a time. “You wait and cross your fingers that in another three or four years another program will come out. What we see is that Nunavut’s falling farther and farther behind the rest of Canada.”Ultimately, what the territory needs, Spinu says, is a fiber-optic link, which will mean high upfront capital costs, but lower maintenance costs in the long term. She’d like to see a link to the existing Greenland Connect cable that runs from Newfoundland to Nuuk, Greenland. Spinu says there have been preliminary discussions between Nunavut and the Inuit regions of Nunavik in northern Quebec and Nunatsiavut in Labrador about a possible fiber link, but so far there’s been no political commitment for such a project.Arctic Fibre, a London-to-Tokyo fiber optic line that was supposed to offer fiber service to seven Nunavut communities, has been fraught with delays and is now concentrating on connecting with communities on Alaska’s North Slope. (Redfern is a former advisor to Arctic Fibre but no longer speaks on their behalf.)Problems also remain in Yukon and the NWT. Northwestel’s ownership of the existing fiber lines, and the wholesale prices the CRTC has allowed them to charge would-be competitors has effectively headed off new market entrants. The north’s small, sparsely populated market means full-blown competition will likely remain a pipe dream. “The north probably can’t sustain Rogers, Shaw and Bell all fighting,” said Wasylciw.Still, Spinu, Redfern and Wasylciw are all guardedly optimistic about the north’s telecommunications future. The new Liberal government’s recent budget contained $500 million over five years for rural broadband. Qiniq is proposing a new “open gateway” satellite service for Nunavut. And the Yukon and NWT governments are funding new fiber-optic linesthat will eventually meet near Inuvik, NWT, and provide a loop to create redundancy that protects against outages – for both territories.Somehow, some way, governments are going to have to find the money to further improve the north’s telecommunications system, said Redfern.“With every year that nothing happens we are falling further and further behind.”This article originally appeared on Arctic Deeply.

He said, ‘Let’s see if we can find these,’” Yager told the outlet.Moura’s instincts were correct. The researchers used sonar to figure out which areas they wanted to investigate more closely, then dredged up samples from the ocean floor. They believe the reef, which lies between 164 and 329 feet deep, covers about 5,900 square miles.""We brought up the most amazing and colorful animals I had ever seen on an expedition,"" Yager said in a University of Georgia statement. Those animals included sea fans, brightly colored-fish, yellow and red sponges and pink coral-like crusted algae, National Geographic reports.Scientists were surprised to find such a thriving reef in areas with no light and low levels of oxygen.""We found a reef where the textbooks said there shouldn't be one,” study co-author Fabiano Thompson told National Geographic.The published study explores the relationship between the river movement and the reef, and how the reef transforms from one location to the next.“In the far south, it gets more light exposure, so many of the animals are more typical reef corals and things that photosynthesize for food,” Yager said. “But as you move north, many of those become less abundant, and the reef transitions to sponges and other reef builders that are likely growing on the food that the river plume delivers. So the two systems are intricately linked.""Researchers have gathered more samples of the reef’s inhabitants since 2012, including brittle and basket stars, huge sponges and 73 different species of fish. However, the strong currents and muddy water have prevented researchers from diving down to see the reef firsthand.The discovery comes in a week marked by devastating reports that 93 percent of the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Australia is nearly dead.However, the Amazon reef may also be in danger, particularly from industrial oil exploration.

But fellow university teachers said Siddiquee, while active in cultural events, never spoke or wrote anything about religion or Islam.""Professor Rezaul was killed in a similar fashion as the killings of bloggers,"" Shamsuddin said, adding he was a peaceful person and had no enemies.The Muslim-majority nation of 160 million has seen a surge in violent attacks over the past few months in which members of minority Muslim sects and other religious groups have also been targeted.Five secular bloggers and a publisher have been hacked to death in Bangladesh since February last year.A group affiliated with al Qaeda claimed responsibility for the killing of a liberal Bangladeshi blogger earlier this month, the SITE has said.Bangladesh authorities said the homegrown militant group Ansarullah Bangla Team is behind the attacks on online critics of religious extremism.The gruesome killing on Saturday triggered a protest by teachers and students of the Rajshahi University, blocking a major road and demanding immediate arrest of the killers. Three teachers at the university have been killed in recent years.Islamic State has also claimed responsibility for the killings of two foreigners, and attacks on mosques and Christian priests in Bangladesh since September, but police said local militant group Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen was behind those attacks.The government has denied that the Islamic State or al Qaeda groups have a presence in Bangladesh. At least five militants have been killed in shootouts since November as security forces have stepped up a crackdown on Islamist militants looking to establish a sharia-based Muslim state."

It's a problem. But when one of the most seemingly inclusive beauty brands is accused of appropriating symbols connected to indigenous people, we can't help but cringe a little harder. MAC Cosmetics has been called out for cultural appropriation over its new ""Vibe Tribe"" collection, slated to launch online May 12. Vivid packaging for the new line and a corresponding makeup bag looks awfully similar to Native American prints from the southwest, and the campaign visuals feature ethnic-looking models wearing feather hair accessories and tribal attire.Product names include ""Arrowhead,"" ""Adobe Brick,"" ""Call of the Canyon,"" and ""Wild Horses,"" yet MAC says the collection ""has absolutely no connection to nor was it inspired by the Native American cultures.""Some MAC fans took to Twitter to express their excitement over the new makeup, but there was also a response from those who believe the cosmetics company is misusing cultural symbols and designs -- and that such a move shouldn't be overlooked.MAC took a firm defense in a statement provided to The Huffington Post, maintaining that the collection's imagery is festival-inspired: MAC Vibe Tribe is the summer colour collection for MAC Cosmetics. The collection, including the visuals, product lineup and naming, is inspired by art, outdoor music festivals and the colours of the desert.Walter Fleming, a professor and department head of Native American Studies at Montana State University, said he could certainly understand why people would get upset over ""seeing products with images that could be considered appropriation and making a profit from something taken from another culture.""However, Fleming said he believes MAC's Vibe Tribe collection falls under the ""benign"" category when compared to ""pretty obvious"" examples of cultural appropriation, such as war bonnets/headdresses on models in the Chanel Métiers d'Art Fall 2013 show. ""If somebody took a sand painting that was a religious illustration and incorporated it, that pushes it,"" he said. ""Or, if they were to take a Navajo weaving, which has some sacred objects and used those, that would definitely be a no-no.""Unfortunately, we've seen one too many examples of cultural appropriation in the fashion and beauty industry. Earlier this month, Free People came under fire for its Festival Shop, which sold ""medicine pouches,"" rain sticks, beaded chokers and ""spirit animals"" essential oils. Dolce & Gabbana announced its first-ever abayas and hijabs collection in January, but missed the mark in offering see-through pieces Muslim women would probably not wear. Fashion label Dsquared2 unveiled their ""Dsquaw"" line during Milan Fashion Week, and critics didn't hold back when it came to the tribal-print leggings and fur coats. Do believe this is yet another example of cultural appropriation? Or is it cultural insensitivity? Sound off in the comments section."

Stanton was sleeping on a friend's couch at the time, he wrote, but taking Susie was “one of the best decisions” he ever made.“I’d never had a dog before,” he wrote. “It was a new experience. I was introduced for the first time to a dog’s unexplainable and unconditional love. After a few weeks, it seemed that Susie’s only concern in life was staying as close to me as possible. There was now a joyous reunion waiting for me at the end of every workday. And I learned that there are few greater blessings than a wildly happy dog greeting you at the door.” Susie was 12 years old when Stanton took her in. She served as the inspiration for his fiancée, Erin O’Sullivan, to create Susie’s Senior Dogs, a nonprofit that promotes the adoption of older dogs.The nonprofit posted its own tribute to Susie, writing that she “spurred a movement bigger than she'll ever know.”Hundreds of people commented on the posts with photos and stories of their own senior dogs. Some said Susie was their inspiration for adopting older pets.It's a good moment to remember why senior pets — which are often overlooked in shelters — can make such amazing companions. Older animals are often calmer and more mellow than younger ones and are already trained, making them especially great pets for those with quieter lifestyles, like senior humans."

All was resolved in typical Maury fashion when she passed a lie detector test and DNA results showed her 3-month-old son was Green’s.Since the appearance, numerous websites have printed side-by-side photos showing Hayes next to Cruz.Amazingly, Hayes had never heard of Cruz before the resemblance was pointed out to her and she still knows little about him.“I don’t know his positions and I’ve never seen him, so I don’t know if he’s done a good enough job to be reelected,” she told The Huffington Post.When we pointed out that Cruz isn’t actually president, just a candidate, she said, “Well, yeah, I don’t know anything about him.”Hayes has had such a big impact that Povich did a special Facebook interview with her.Being an internet meme doesn't pay the bills, though, so the ""female Ted Cruz"" is hoping to capitalize on her newfound internet stardom by filming a porn scene.XHamster.com, a popular porn website, has offered to pay Hayes and her fiance $10,000 for a 6-minute sex tape.For those keeping score, that's about $1,666.66 per each minute of carnal screen time.""We wanted Searcy because overnight she became a viral meme,"" XHamster spokesman Mike Kulich told The Huffington Post.

Might we focus on how much of ""it"" someone has because of our culture's preoccupation with quantification and data?",2016-04-23,A young boy resting his head on his arms as he sits in a classroom looking bored,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bacf28f1f00002e01227a7b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I get a kick out of spotting invisible threads that connect disparate theories and lines of research. Sometimes I'll even notice a pattern (after the fact) in my own essays about different topics -- which can be gratifying until I realize that the common denominator is embarrassingly simple.One observation I've offered in various contexts is that ""how much"" tends to matter less than ""what kind."" That's something I've written about in four very different domains. My only defense against the reply ""Well, duh. Who says otherwise?"" is: ""No one says otherwise, but most of us tend to act as if it weren't true."" Let me explain.1. Motivation. After I published a thick book about the damaging effects of rewards, I realized that a lot of the research I had cited could be summarized in a few straightforward sentences: Without really thinking about it, we tend to assume there's something called ""motivation"" - a single entity of which someone can have a lot or a little. When we deal with people who have less power than we do, we're often tempted to offer them rewards for acting the way we want because we figure this will increase their level of motivation to do so.If we ignore the moral implications of treating others this way, rewarding them might be justified in practical terms. . . . that is, if the underlying model of motivation were accurate. Unfortunately, it isn't. In reality, there are qualitatively different kinds of motivation, and the kind is more important than the amount. What matters is whether one is intrinsically motivated to engage in an activity (which means one finds it valuable or satisfying in its own right) or extrinsically motivated (which means that doing it produces a result outside of the task, such as a reward).Even impressive levels of extrinsic motivation don't bode well for meaningful goals. In fact, as scores of studies have shown, rewards tend to reduce people's intrinsic motivation. You get a prize for reading a book (or for being helpful) and you tend to find reading (or helpfulness) itself less appealing in the future. Thus, what matters isn't how motivated someone is, but how someone is motivated. The common but mistaken assumption that motivation comes in only one flavor helps to explain why rewards remain popular despite all the harm they do.Many teachers, I find, are familiar with the modifiers ""intrinsic"" and ""extrinsic,"" yet they continue to talk about ""how motivated"" a student is or how to ""motivate"" kids in general. By overlooking the critical difference between types of motivation, they contribute to a serious problem. Only extrinsic motivation can be increased from the outside, so that's what schools focus on (with grades, points, awards, praise, and the like) -- often at the expense of children's interest in learning. 2. Love. Let's consider a very different example of the same general principle. Many of us who are parents take comfort from the idea that what kids really need -- maybe all they need -- is our love. The implication is that love is a substance we can supply in greater or lesser quantities -- greater, of course, being preferable. But again, this assumption turns out to be fatally simplistic since there are actually different ways of loving a child, and these ways aren't equally desirable. The psychoanalyst Alice Miller observed that it's possible to love a child ""passionately - but not in the way he needs to be loved."" If she's right, the relevant question isn't just whether, or even how much, we love our kids. It also matters how we love them. Once that's understood, we could pretty quickly come up with a list of different types of parental love along with opinions about which are better. I tend to focus on the distinction between loving kids for what they do and loving them for who they are. The first kind is conditional, which means children must earn our acceptance -- by acting in ways we deem appropriate or performing up to our standards. The second kind of love is unconditional: It doesn't hinge on how they act, whether they're successful or well-behaved or anything else. And it's the latter, according to a growing body of research, that children really need -- from their parents and even from their teachers. Unfortunately, it's also the opposite of what most parenting and classroom management resources are selling. Positive reinforcement for good behavior, just like ""time out"" for bad behavior, exemplifies conditional acceptance.3. Self-esteem. Conservatives have been sneering at what they call the ""self-esteem movement"" for decades, but considerable research confirms that how people regard themselves is indeed a powerful predictor of various psychological outcomes -- and that higher self-esteem is better than lower. Over the last few years, however, a number of psychologists have shown that what matters about self-esteem isn't just how much of it one has but how stable it is. If your confidence in yourself is fragile, the result may be anger or depression. And even if your self-esteem is generally high, you may struggle with self-doubt or become defensive if that positive view isn't sufficiently secure.The crucial determinant of stability, in turn, seems to be unconditionality. A solid core of belief in yourself, an abiding sense that you're competent and worthwhile -- even when you screw up or fall short -- creates a more reliable (and healthier) form of self-esteem. Conversely, if you think well of yourself only to the extent that you're successful or attractive or appreciated by others -- if you regard self-esteem as something that's perpetually in doubt -- then you're in for trouble, psychologically speaking. Low self-esteem (""I don't feel very good about myself"") is bad enough; self-esteem that's contingent (""I feel good about myself only when..."") is even more worrisome.[1]It's a neat parallel: The level of esteem one has for oneself, just like the amount of love children receive from their parents, doesn't tell the whole story. Actually, it's more than a parallel because these lines intersect. Being accepted unconditionally is what allows children to accept themselves unconditionally. Or to put it the other way around, conditional acceptance predicts conditional self-acceptance -- and poorer psychological health.4. Internalization. Many people with an interest in child development -- even if they're aware of the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation -- like to say that kids should be helped to internalize good values or behaviors. But how exactly does that process play out? On the one hand, kids may swallow whole (or ""introject"") an adult's rule or standard so that it seems to control them from the inside: They do what they've been told because they'll feel guilty if they don't. On the other hand, internalization can happen more authentically, so the behavior has been fully integrated into their value structure. It feels chosen.[2]In short, internalization can take place in very different ways. Which means, once again, that what counts isn't just whether (or the extent to which) kids are doing it, but how. When adults control children, they end up promoting an introjected style that often results in learning that's rigid, superficial, and ultimately less successful. Many older students have very effectively internalized a compulsion to do well in school. On the outside they look like admirably dedicated students, but they may have mortgaged their present lives to the future: noses to the grindstone, perseverant to a fault, stressed to the max. High school is just preparation for college, college is just an occasion for collecting credentials for whatever comes next. Such students may be skilled test-takers and grade grubbers and gratification delayers, but they're often motivated by a perpetual need to feel better about themselves rather than by anything resembling curiosity. True, these students no longer require carrots or sticks. They don't need discipline because they're self-disciplined. . . to a fault. Their motivation is internal but it sure as hell isn't intrinsic. And that key distinction would go unnoticed if we had just asked whether they had internalized certain values rather than inquired about the nature of that internalization.*If we know better, why do so many of us act as if things like love, motivation, self-esteem, and internalization come in only one variety? Might we focus on how much of ""it"" someone has because of our culture's preoccupation with quantification and data?[3] Or is it just that we've never been invited to consider the practical ramifications of the fact that none of these concepts is actually unitary?NOTES1. For an extended discussion of this point and the supporting research, see chapter 6 (""The Attack on Self-Esteem"") of my book The Myth of the Spoiled Child .2. I rely here on the theory and research of Edward Deci, Richard Ryan, and their many colleagues and former students. For a list of publications on this topic, see http://ow.ly/4n12A9. 3. In all four examples I've offered here, my argument is that it's not enough to ask ""How much?"" because the more meaningful question is ""What kind?"" But some practices may be inherently problematic, such that even the latter question takes too much for granted. In such cases, the more pertinent question is ""Should we be doing this at all?"" One example that comes to mind is homework, the practice of making students work what amounts to a second shift when they get home from school."

The American Conservative Union hosted its annual Conservative Political Action Conference to discuss conservative issues. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb93b0d2400005000578f67.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"You have to have at least a little bit of pity these days for the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus. He seems like one of those guys in a horror flick who keeps trying to convince everyone that the monster isn't real, and that everything can be explained by rational means... right up until the monster unexpectedly (for maximum shock value) rips his head clean off, in graphic 3D. The guy who has persevered in keeping his little group of teenyboppers together and somewhat sane (""If we can just get out to the barn and fire up that Model T/snowmobile/hot air balloon/mine cart/tractor... we can make it out of here to safety!""), who eventually sacrifices himself (in some horrific way) so that the rest of the group of worthless highschoolers can have a chance at survival. You know the guy, right?Well, Reince is now apparently teetering on the edge of losing it himself. Last week, on one of the Sunday morning shows, Reince vowed that he wasn't anywhere near ""pouring Baileys in my cereal,"" which (as Stephen Colbert pointed out last night) seems awfully specific for something that he's swearing he hasn't even contemplated.Colbert also helpfully pointed out that ""Reince Priebus"" is an anagram for ""crisp bee urine,"" which we have to say tops our own favorite alphabetical fun with his name (which we do try to mention whenever his name pops up). Who would have thought that anything could be funnier than the fact that, without vowels, his name becomes: ""RNC PR BS"" -- which could indeed also be a very foreshortened version of his job description. But there it is. Once you've heard a phrase like ""crisp bee urine,"" it's kind of hard to forget it.Crisp bee urine aside (which has to join the list of ""phrases we never thought we'd type in a million billion years""), Reince certainly does deserve a wee bit of pity these days. He faces two rather grim outcomes for his party's presidential contest: either Donald Trump drags the entire Republican Party down in the November elections, or Ted Cruz drags the entire Republican Party down in the November elections. As Lindsey Graham notably put it a few weeks earlier: ""Whether it's death by being shot or poisoning, does it really matter?"" This charming metaphor was advanced this week by none other than GOP House member Peter King, who explained what he'd do if Ted Cruz won his party's nomination: ""I think I'll take cyanide."" And this is what prominent Republicans are saying about their two presidential frontrunners!The chances of Cruz winning the nomination (and King having to take a lethal poison rather than vote for him in November) got a lot smaller this week, as New York Republicans overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump. His victory was (of course) huge. Trump proved once again that his supporters will forgive pretty much anything he says, after he spoke -- in New York, mind you -- of the ""tragedy of 7/11."" Make your own Slurpee joke, we suppose. By winning the Empire State so handily, Trump is now a lot closer to the goal of 1,237 delegates (although we noted earlier this week that the GOP ""magic number"" for Trump might be a bit lower than that). The ""Stop Trump"" or ""Never Trump"" crowd is now looking at Indiana as its final battleground, since Trump seems poised to have a very good night on the Atlantic seaboard next Tuesday, too.Trump's victory speech was gushed over by the entire political punditry, because (they all breathlessly noted) Trump didn't call anyone names, and actually referred to ""Senator Cruz"" (rather than ""Lyin' Ted""). ""It's Donald Trump 2.0!"" the press corps announced (whilst swooning onto their fainting couches). We don't believe this nonsense for a second. Sure, you can teach Trump to speak from prepared remarks (and even use a TelePrompTer); but put him up on a debate stage next to Hillary Clinton and the most likely outcome is a manly resurgence of Trump 1.0, complete with name-calling and misogyny and all the rest of his core persona. He won't be able to help himself -- that's our guess, in any case.Ted Cruz, not to be outdone on Tuesday, gave what certainly sounded like a ""victory"" speech, after getting absolutely crushed in New York. After winning not a single delegate and less than 15 percent of the vote, Cruz was out there assuming the mantle of Ronald Reagan -- and even throwing in J.F.K. for good measure. If he ever gets elected president, they'll have to reinforce the foundation of the White House, to assure that bearing the weight of Cruz's massive, massive ego won't do permanent damage to the building.On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton also had a good night in New York, but we'll address that further in the awards section. Team Clinton has to be very careful right about now, though, in all their calls for Bernie Sanders to somehow start treating Hillary nicer on the campaign trail -- because while not everyone currently remembers the bitter end of the 2008 Democratic primary campaign, if the cries for Bernie to tone it down continue, the pundits are indeed going to dig up some quotes from Hillary, circa exactly eight years ago. As we've mentioned previously, the one thing Hillary Clinton can never do during the primary season is to call for Bernie Sanders to drop out. After all, he's merely following in her footsteps.What with all the presidential campaign news as a distraction, Paul Ryan is not in the news nearly as much as he should be. Now, ""Paul Ryan"" doesn't have nearly enough letters to make funny anagrams, but if you begin with his full name (Paul Davis Ryan), you get a few gems, such as ""airy vandal pus,"" ""aid puny larvas,"" and our favorite by far, ""privy sauna lad."" We have no idea why that last one seems so fitting, but from now on whenever we see Ryan in the news, we will likely immediately think: ""What is the privy sauna lad up to these days?"" While we bring up Ryan here in the introduction solely so we can use phrases like ""airy vandal pus,"" we'll have a much more complete rundown of why he's (so far) been just as miserable a failure as John Boehner at getting anything done in the House of Representatives, which will appear later in the talking points section.To be scrupulously fair to Ryan and Priebus, we ran our own name through the anagram-maker. A few downright oddities popped up (""chewing is art,"" ""hi swinger cat,"" and ""cashew in grit""), as well as one that was completely odious (""hewing racist""), and one we sincerely hope nobody has ever thought after reading these columns (""writing aches""). So make of that what you will, in the interests of fair play.In non-anagram news, the United Nations is having a historic meeting on drug policy, which was almost completely ignored by the American media. Building up to this meeting, last week we noted the formation of the group ""Doctors For Cannabis Regulation,"" with former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders as a founder, and this week a rather extraordinary letter was released. The Washington Post had the story:The global war on drugs has proven ""disastrous"" and ""humankind cannot afford a 21st century drug policy as ineffective and counter-productive as the last century's."" So say more than 1,000 world leaders, including 27 members of the House of Representatives and six U.S. senators, in a letter to the United Nations ahead of a major international drug summit happening this week.You'd think that sort of thing would be a little more newsworthy (especially with Bernie and Hillary signing on to it), but it fell into the black hole of the rest of the non-coverage of the drug summit from America's broadcast news. Pretty much par for the course, really. Oh, which reminds us, we ran down all the presidential candidates' positions on marijuana policy earlier this week, to coincide with 4/20. Take a look, as there are some surprises there.Hillary Clinton didn't have as huge a night in New York as Donald Trump, but it was big enough to easily win her the Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week. Hillary outperformed her polling, and beat Bernie Sanders by an impressive 16 points on Tuesday. While Sanders took pretty much all the rural counties, Clinton's strength in the urban areas easily put her on top.Of course, winning your home state is almost expected in primary politics. If she hadn't won, it would have been very troublesome for the Clinton campaign (Bernie won Vermont by a whopping 72 points, 86-14, for comparison). But even though Bernie had built up a lot of momentum heading into New York, he failed not only to win the state but also to even make the margin close. The Sanders campaign was all ready to argue that it was ""almost a tie"" if Bernie had gotten within single digits, but they couldn't even make this argument when the votes were counted.Now, as we said before, Bernie certainly has the right to take his campaign all the way to the end. But after New York, the dream of him somehow emerging with more delegates than Hillary will remain precisely that: a dream. Clinton didn't secure the nomination by winning New York, but she is now clearly the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party. In fact, she could lose every single state from this point on and still win the nomination by only picking up a small percentage of the remaining delegates (the Democrats don't have any ""winner takes all"" states).That is what her New York win did for her, and that's pretty impressive. Bernie Sanders fell from ""longshot"" to ""no realistic chance"" this week. This has saddened many of Bernie's supporters, but it was always the most likely outcome. Bernie Sanders is still going to have a huge influence on the Democratic Party platform and on Hillary Clinton's campaign promises. That's not going to go away. Neither is Bernie.But by winning New York by such a comfortable margin, Hillary Clinton has now almost wrapped up the Democratic nomination. Next week, she's going to move even closer to that goal, as she's polling well among almost all the states that will vote next Tuesday. She won't get over the ""magic number"" of delegates for a while, but at this point it is almost a foregone conclusion. For achieving this status in her home state this week, Hillary Clinton is easily our Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week.[We have a blanket policy of not providing links to campaign sites, and Hillary Clinton is technically a private citizen at this point, so you'll have to look up her contact information yourself, to let her know you appreciate her efforts.]No prominent Democrat seriously annoyed us this week, so there will be no Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week award handed out.We suppose a case could be made to give it to Bernie Sanders, because his New York loss certainly disappointed millions, but this would seem too much like kicking him when he's down, so we refuse to pile on. Bernie himself didn't do anything disappointing, even if the vote count was, to Bernie supporters.Volume 388 (4/22/16)And now, as promised, we're going to pile on Paul Ryan, because he certainly does deserve it. We went into detail on this subject yesterday, so if you'd like to see a less-snarky version, you can check that out.But since it is Friday, we are fully opening the snark spigot. The first five talking points this week all are meant to highlight the fact that Paul Ryan is getting precious little done in the House of Representatives. In fact, the only time he's been in the news media's spotlight of late was when he formally made an announcement turning down a possible desperation move at the Republican convention to nominate him.Because most of the media has been giving Ryan's failures such a free pass, we thought it was time for some Democrats to start pointing it out -- because the failures are piling up, and it doesn't seem likely that Ryan will be breaking the legislative logjam any time soon. So point it out!And then at the end of the talking points, we've got two rather amusing statements from the non-Trump Republican candidates, just because. Ryan not living up to his billingPaul Ryan's chances of success were always more than a bit dubious, but as time goes on he's proving incapable of making good on any of the things he promised he'd achieve as speaker. Now's a dandy time to shine a spotlight on these failures, in fact.""Paul Ryan was supposed to be the savior of the Republican Party -- remember that? He was supposed to be the only person with the superhuman skills required to get the House Republicans to agree on anything (other than 'Obamacare bad!' of course). When he took over the speaker's gavel from the ousted John Boehner, he was going to turn things around and get the Tea Partiers on board with a broad new Republican agenda that would be such a shining monument to conservatism that all Republican office-seekers this election would be able to proudly run on a concrete and positive agenda. This agenda was supposed to be so wildly better than the Democrats' ideas that it would serve as a ready-made campaign platform for all Republicans running for office. Oh, and in the midst of all this, the House was going to return to 'regular order' and pass their budget bills on time. So far, not only has none of this happened, it now appears that none of it is likely to happen at any time before the election. Paul Ryan is going to be just as much of a failure as John Boehner, because (as an unnamed Republican admitted to Politico), House Republicans are, and I quote, 'unwhippable and unleadable.' This same Republican also admitted: 'Ryan is as talented as you can be: There's nobody better. But even he can't do anything. Who could?' When even Republicans are admitting things like this, the chance that the House will get anything at all done this year is roughly zero."" Where's your budget, Paul?So much for regular order....""Hey, Paul, where's your budget? You were going to usher in a new era of Republicans being fiscally responsible enough to get budgets passed on time, remember? Well, the deadline for the budget framework bill was last week, and you just missed it. You couldn't get the Tea Partiers to agree -- the same exact problem John Boehner repeatedly had. You refused to work across the aisle and bring Democrats on board to pass a budget bill, so you utterly failed to prove to America that Republicans could actually govern in an adult fashion. Now there's talk of -- perhaps -- Republicans passing the budget bill in May. Well, Paul, I'm not exactly holding my breath, if you know what I mean."" Party of politically treacherous ideas?The whole Washington Post article which provided these quotes and facts is worth reading, to see how low Ryan is now trying to set the bar for his agenda.""Paul Ryan has been promising for months now that he can prove that the Republican Party is the true 'party of ideas.' He quite accurately noted that while Democrats have a solid agenda for the future of America, Republicans had sunk to nothing more than sheer obstructionism -- the party of 'no.' They were notably against everything President Obama and the Democrats wanted to do, but Republicans didn't seem to be for much of anything anymore. Ryan was going to change all of that, and present to the world the positive Republican agenda for the future. He was going to pass this agenda in a number of bills, to prove the power of all these Republican ideas. Then, because the ideas would be so self-evidently better than the Democratic agenda, Republicans everywhere could use them to run for office on. But now Ryan's dialing expectations back significantly -- not only will none of these agenda items actually be voted on by the House before the election (because to do so would mean explaining them and their consequences in great detail to the American people), but most of them won't even be drafted into bills. The reason? Because to provide all the details would make the agenda 'politically treacherous.' That's a pretty stunning admission of the harm such a Republican agenda would cause -- rather than proudly running on a detailed agenda which passed the House, they are now planning to not provide details because to do so would jeopardize their chances for re-election. So much for being a 'party of ideas,' eh? They're pretty much admitting that the only ideas the Republican Party has are bad ones, in fact."" Whoops! Forgot one...One rather large issue is conspicuous by its absence from Ryan's wonderful GOP agenda. So point it out!""Paul Ryan's initial list of what was to be on the grand Republican agenda contained six items: health care, taxes, national security, regulatory reform, poverty and reasserting Congress's constitutional authority. Well, we've been waiting for about six years for Republicans to come up with their plan to replace Obamacare, and not a single bill has ever even made it to the House floor for a vote. Over 50 'repeal Obamacare' votes (and counting), but zero 'replace Obamacare' votes so far. So I'd be surprised to see them even manage to complete the first item on Ryan's list, personally. But what struck me most of all about that agenda list is one rather enormous omission. I guess Ryan believes that immigration policy doesn't need any changes whatsoever, because he's not even going to attempt putting that on the Republican agenda. You know what this omission will mean (even assuming they do get the other six items together at some point)? It will mean that the only strong Republican voice on what to do about immigration policy will either be Ted Cruz or (more likely) Donald Trump. So all those down-ballot Republicans won't have any answer at all about how their immigration policy differs from their party's presidential nominee. That seems pretty short-sighted to me."" Crisis mode no betterMaybe Paul Ryan is utterly failing to do regular business in the House, but surely he'd be effective if there were a true crisis staring him in the face, right? Well, no.""While pointing out Paul Ryan's utter failure to meet deadlines or make good on any of his vaunted Republican agenda is amusing, for the most part, the next deadline they're about to miss is not going to be funny at all. Puerto Rico is in the midst of a financial crisis, and bills are coming due at the end of this month. The House was expected to pass some sort of legislation dealing with the crisis before this deadline, but due once again to the Tea Partiers (who are going to call any such attempt a ""bailout"") so far it's looking like this deadline will tragically be missed. House Republicans are, pretty obviously, incapable of governing, even in the midst of a crisis. They are incapable of doing the bare minimum their job requires. They aren't even going to attempt passing any contentious bills before the election, and they're going to blow deadline after deadline in the mean time. We certainly hope the voters take note of this massive incompetence. You can change which Republican wields the speaker's gavel, but unless and until the American people change the actual makeup of the House, little if anything is going to get done."" GOP doesn't like ideasJohn Kasich had a shining moment of honesty this week, which just serves to reinforce the rest of these talking points.""You think I'm being harsh on Paul Ryan? Well, let's take a look at what one of the Republican presidential candidates has to say about the Republicans being the 'party of ideas.' Here is John Kasich, from a recent interview with the Washington Post, on that very subject:""If you don't have ideas, you got nothing, and frankly my Republican Party doesn't like ideas. They want to be negative against things. We had [Ronald] Reagan, okay? Saint Ron. We had [Jack] Kemp, he was an idea guy. I'd say Paul Ryan is driven mostly by ideas. He likes ideas. But you talk about most of 'em, the party is knee-jerk 'against.' Maybe that's how they were created. Lying down on the job?And finally, the most bizarre quote of the week, hands down. Or back down. Or something.""Can someone please explain to me exactly what Ted Cruz meant in his non-victory victory speech this week, after he massively lost New York state? He went with a very odd (and rather disturbing) metaphor for America, stating: 'America has always been best when she is lying down with her back on the mat and the crowd has given the final count. It is time for us to get up, shake it off and be who we were destined to be.' Um, OK. America is best when she's lying down with her back on the mat? Really? Somehow I don't think many Americans would choose such a metaphor to describe American strengths, but then again most Americans didn't just get shellacked by Donald Trump in yet another state, I suppose.""Chris Weigant blogs at: Follow Chris on Twitter: @ChrisWeigantFull archives of FTP columns: FridayTalkingPoints.comAll-time award winners leaderboard, by rank"

Prince, 57, was pronounced dead shortly after being found unresponsive yesterday at Paisley Park.

Although the shock and disbelief was instant, the lingering effect resembles that of an actual family member. I was a fan of his music and admired his talents, but I can't help think of the meaningful times that our career paths crossed and complimented each other dating all the way back to 1978. Because of Prince, I met my long time friend and business associate, J. Sharp, in 1979 while I was working as a promoter rep for Taurus productions (Q. Perry). Jeff and Quinten were co-promoting a Prince/Time/Vanity 6 Show before Prince was selling out full fledged arenas (although you knew it was coming) and we were all there in support of his vision. Also, back in the late '80s one of my best female friends ever (K. Krattinger) was Prince's longtime personal assistant. I remember so clearly her taking me on my first tour of his fabulous Paisley Park facility in Minneapolis...WOW what a visionary! Later in 1992 / '93, our paths intersected again when I managed the GRAMMY winning hip-hop group Arrested Development. Their first smash was called ""Tennessee"" and although it wasn't easy (LOL!), that was the first time a Prince song was allowed to be sampled and released on a recording. Then there was the day that I discovered the talents of Anthony Hamilton at a GRAMMY brunch in New York City put on by my good friend and Prince's longtime attorney, L. Londell McMillan, and Prince was seated next to me. I was so moved seeing Anthony for the first time that I jumped to my feet at the end of his performance, then Prince joined me, and the rest of the crowd of artists and music industry insiders followed suit in giving Anthony a much deserved standing ovation. Whether it was ""Lil Red Corvette,"" ""Purple Rain,"" ""I will Die For U"" or ""1999,"" Prince's music and legacy will be embedded in our memories until there is no tomorrow. So, on this day, Friday, April 22nd, I personally and professionally salute ""Prince Rogers Nelson"" for being one of the greatest musicians / artists to have ever performed on a live stage. I also want to take this opportunity to salute all of the music legends that my career has allowed me to touch. I give sincere thanks and praise to our Heavenly Father for bestowing such talent and greatness upon them and giving them the ability to influence generations to come, while gifting me with these precious relationships and experiences.""Like in the skys above - stars are made to look up to - but also: eventually stars truly do belong in heaven."""
