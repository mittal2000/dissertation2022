0,POLITICS,Billionaire To Spend $6.5 Million So Pennsylvania Millennials Will Vote,Max Greenwood,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tom-steyer-pac-pennsylvania-voters_us_57dac95ae4b0071a6e05be0d,Tom Steyer spent more than $74 million in the 2014 midterm elections.,2016-09-15,Tom Steyer's NextGen Climate PAC is prepared to spend more than $6.5 million to engage and educate millennials in Pennsylvania before the November elections.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57dac99d180000c706314ca2.jpeg?cache=3MvKnTu3XU&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Tom Steyer’s environment-focused NextGen Climate super PAC will spend $6.5 million before November to reach millennial voters in Pennsylvania.The group is already active on more than 70 college campuses in the state, and will announce plans to expand to 22 more on Thursday. The group said in a statement to The Huffington Post that it is ready to spend more than half of the $6.5 million on campus engagement, and $2.87 million on off-campus efforts.Steyer, a billionaire environmentalist and former hedge fund manager, said in April that NextGen Climate would spend about $25 million to register young voters across the country and educate them on climate and energy issues as well as the stances of presidential and senatorial candidates.“The opportunity is for NextGen Climate to be part of a process of turning out young voters, which is what we’re focused on this election, so we can put progressive champions in office,” said NextGen Climate press secretary Galen Alexander. “It’s really about [Pennsylvania] being a swing state and being in play this year.” The super PAC is targeting millennial voters in eight states, including the other battleground states of Colorado, Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, North Carolina and Ohio.NextGen Climate’s planned expansion in Pennsylvania would make the state the single biggest target of the political action committee’s youth voting efforts in 2016 in terms of money spent and people reached, with plans to get to 575,000 college students in the state.Steyer founded the super PAC in 2013 and spent more than $74 million in the 2014 midterm elections. But the billionaire’s efforts saw mixed results: only three of the seven Democratic Senate candidates he backed won. Millennials ― generally defined as people between the ages of 18 and 34 ― surpassed baby boomers as the country’s largest living generation earlier this year, according to a Pew Research Center report. That makes millennials an increasingly sought-after voting bloc for political campaigns. The generation helped propel Barack Obama to victory in 2008 and 2012.Republicans haven’t won a presidential election in Pennsylvania since 1988. But it has emerged as a key swing state in 2016. And with more than 400 institutions of higher learning, young voters are likely to play an important role in how the state votes."
1,POLITICS,Here's More Proof That Donald Trump Wants To Drive Out All Undocumented Immigrants,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-undocumented-immigrants-healthcare_us_57db0eb0e4b04a1497b34f71,In case you weren't convinced.,2016-09-15,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump appears on ""The Dr. Oz Show"" with Dr. Mehmet Oz.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump skirted a question on “The Dr. Oz Show” show this week about whether he believes the United States has a moral responsibility to help an undocumented immigrant who is dying in the streets. The reply demonstrated a few things, including Trump’s reticence to giving answers and Dr. Mehmet Oz’s failure to ask follow-up questions. More importantly, it showed that Trump, regardless of his efforts to muddy the waters on his deportation plans, is still arguing for driving all undocumented immigrants out of the country.“You mentioned you don’t want people dying on the streets,” Oz said during the episode that aired on Thursday, as CBS News’ Sopan Deb pointed out. “What if an undocumented immigrant collapses and needs life-saving therapy? Do we have a moral responsibility, do you believe, to help that person?” Trump rejected the premise ― under in his plan, he said, there would be no undocumented immigrants to help.“Well, under my plan the undocumented, or, as you would say, illegal immigrant wouldn’t be in the country,” he said. “They only come in the country legally.” Oz ― who, in fairness, is not a journalist ― let it go. “We’ll be right back,” he said, introducing a commercial break. This is a serious issue ― quite literally life and death ― and it’s telling that Trump declined to say whether he thinks there is a moral responsibility to save an undocumented immigrant’s life. There are an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country, and some of them need life-saving care. Many do not have health insurance, and they are barred from Obamacare, although California officials are asking the White House for approval to let undocumented immigrants in the state onto its public exchange. Hospitals are required to treat people in urgent need of care even if they don’t have the ability to pay, but the cost of that treatment is typically very high and is only sometimes partially reimbursed by Medicaid. Trump avoided saying whether he thinks undocumented immigrants should receive emergency care by saying he didn’t think they should be in the country. This would only be the case if his plan was to deport as many undocumented immigrants as possible and drive out the rest by restricting their ability to work and live ― self-deportation, as 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney put it. Trump’s comment indicates he means to drive out all ― not just most ― undocumented immigrants.Trump made inconsistent statements last month, leading many to believe he was not actually hoping to get every undocumented immigrant out of the country. He delivered a speech in early September reaffirming that it is his goal, but said the next day that “perhaps at a later date” he might do something about undocumented immigrants who weren’t, in his parlance, the “bad ones.” Some interpreted this to mean that Trump might allow some undocumented immigrants to eventually earn legal status, although he hardly said so explicitly: He said he might consider something, but only if the border was secure and unauthorized immigration had been resolved. The idea that Trump actually supports legal status for some undocumented immigrants was always far-fetched. But if you want more proof, it’s in the Dr. Oz interview: In his plan, there will be no undocumented immigrants in the country to save.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
2,POLITICS,"Uncertainty About Hillary Clinton's Health Is On The Rise, Poll Finds",Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/clinton-health-poll_us_57db0769e4b04a1497b3439f,Americans largely believe that politicians' medical records should be publicly available.,2016-09-15,More Americans are expressing concern about the candidates' health.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57db0e04180000113cbd1ba8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hillary Clinton is back on the campaign trail after a weekend bout with pneumonia, but the episode left many Americans unsure about the state of her health, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds.Clinton’s physician, Dr. Lisa Bardack, wrote Wednesday that the Democratic nominee “continues to remain healthy and fit to serve as President of the United States.”But just 39 percent of Americans currently believe that Clinton is in good enough physical condition to effectively serve as president for the next four years, according to the poll. A nearly equal 38 percent say she isn’t in good enough condition, and 23 percent say they are unsure. That marks a significant shift from just over a week ago, when an Economist/YouGov survey posing the same question found that 52 percent of Americans believed Clinton was in good enough shape, 33 percent didn’t think she was and 16 percent didn’t know. By a 14-point margin, 45 percent to 31 percent, those surveyed in the latest poll ― which predated Bardack’s letter ― said that Clinton had not provided enough information about her physical health. Republicans have long been willing to cast aspersions on Clinton’s health, but until recently, those attacks seemed to have little resonance beyond those already disinclined to vote for her.The latest survey, however, shows increased uncertainty among some of her supporters. Although 64 percent of Democrats said in the most recent poll that Clinton was in good enough condition, that’s down 20 points from the previous survey. Few believe outright that she is unhealthy, but more now say that they’re not sure. In contrast, 63 percent currently believe GOP nominee Donald Trump is in good enough condition, almost unchanged from the 62 percent who said so earlier this month.(The survey was also taken largely before Trump’s interview with Dr. Mehmet Oz on Wednesday, in which he discussed his love for fast food and shared that he considered emphatic hand-waving a form of exercise.)Even before Clinton stumbled while leaving a Sept. 11 commemoration event, she had long battled allegations from Trump and his surrogates that she was concealing a serious health problem. Her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), denounced such claims as “idiotic.”Thirty-six percent of Americans say they believe Clinton’s illness last weekend was a symptom of a larger problem with her health. Twenty-seven percent say that it was an isolated incident, and 21 percent say that speculating about her health is inappropriate.More broadly, 45 percent of Americans say that people are right to question whether Clinton may have a serious health condition, while 37 percent believe claims that she’s seriously ill are driven purely by politics.Opinions on both questions are divided deeply along partisan lines: 62 percent of Republicans, but just 13 percent of Democrats, believe that Clinton has a larger health issue. Three-quarters of Republicans view questioning Clinton’s health as valid, while 62 percent of Democrats see such questions as a nakedly political tactic. Independents fall somewhere in the middle ― 39 percent believe that Clinton is concealing a larger health problem and 46 percent say that people are right to raise questions.Politicians’ health wasn’t always believed to be a topic for public debate. In a 2004 survey conducted by Gallup for CNN and USA Today, 61 percent of Americans said that a president should have the same right as every other citizen to keep his medical records private, while just 38 percent believed a president should publicly release all medical information that might affect his ability to serve his term. That conviction was shared largely across party lines, with 57 percent of Democrats, 65 percent of Republicans and 60 percent of independents saying that a president had the right to keep medical records private.A similar question on the HuffPost/YouGov poll garnered very different results, underscoring the degree to which Republicans especially have seized on the issue, but also indicating a more widespread shift in expectations for transparency.Fifty-seven percent of Americans said that a presidential candidate should publicly release all medical information that might affect his or her ability to serve his term as president, while just 34 percent believed that a presidential candidate should have the same right as every other citizen to keep his or her medical records private.Democrats were about evenly split between the two positions, while large majorities of both Republicans and independents said they favored greater transparency. Similarly, 87 percent of Republicans, but a comparably small 52 percent of Democrats, said it was fair for the media to question a candidate’s health.While it’s clear that concerns about Clinton’s health have become more prominent, it’s less certain to what extent those concerns will affect the race.“The most likely outcome, of course, is that Democrats and others who are inclined to vote for Mrs. Clinton will stick with her,” political scientist Brendan Nyhan wrote Tuesday in The New York Times. He noted that past elections have shown that concerns about older candidates’ health came largely from voters who opposed them. “However, a modern precedent does exist for serious concerns about a candidate’s age and health. Ronald Reagan’s meandering closing statement in the first presidential debate during the 1984 campaign was widely perceived to have harmed him….For Mrs. Clinton, then, the goal is to quickly reassure voters, as Mr. Reagan appeared to do back in 1984, that she is in good health.”One possible effect of an increased focus on the candidates’ health could be to raise the profile of their vice presidential nominees ― a prospect raised inadvertently by former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland (D), who said during a rally that Kaine was “a wonderfully prepared person to be vice president, and to be the president if that ever became necessary.” On that measure, neither side holds much of an advantage. Thirty-two percent of Americans believe Kaine is qualified to serve as president, with 27 percent saying that he is not and 41 percent unsure. GOP pick Mike Pence fared almost identically, with 34 percent calling him qualified, 27 percent calling him unqualified and 40 percent not sure.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Sept. 12-Sept. 14 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling.

3,POLITICS,New Polls In Ohio And Florida Offer Worrying Results For Hillary Clinton,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ohio-florida-polls_us_57d9dea4e4b0071a6e05569e,Both states look increasingly like battlegrounds.,2016-09-15,Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton is trailing Donald Trump in Ohio and Florida in newly released polls.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d9e0271300002a0039c162.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ohio and Florida are both looking like close races in this year’s presidential election, according to new polling released Wednesday that gives Donald Trump the edge in both states.Polls from both Bloomberg Politics and CNN in Ohio give Trump a 5-point lead over Hillary Clinton. Bloomberg’s survey, conducted by Selzer & Co., finds Trump ahead 44 percent to 39 percent among likely voters when third-party candidates are included, and up 48 percent to 43 percent in a head-to-head match with Clinton. CNN/ORC gives Trump 46 percent to Clinton’s 41 percent, among likely voters, with Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson taking 8 percent and Green Party nominee Jill Stein 2 percent. In a two-way matchup, Trump led 50 percent to 46 percent.A second CNN poll, in Florida, finds Trump up by 3 points, 47 percent to 44 percent, with Johnson taking 6 percent and Stein 1 percent. In a head-to-head, Trump leads by 4 points.It’s rarely a good idea to look at any surveys in the absence of context ― even good pollsters can differ substantially, and it’s often difficult to predict whose picture of the electorate will be more on the mark. Both CNN’s and Bloomberg’s polls in Ohio, for instance, show an electorate that’s notably more Republican than that of some other recent surveys.But the results offer increasing evidence that polling has tightened since the days of Clinton’s more commanding leads over the summer.HuffPost Pollster’s averages have always shown a relatively close race in both Ohio and Florida, especially in comparison with Clinton’s far healthier leads in states like Wisconsin, Virginia and Colorado. But coming off a post-convention bounce, Clinton led in nearly every poll of Ohio and Florida taken during August.That’s no longer the case. In Florida, polls of head-to-head matchups taken since the beginning of September have all shown fairly narrow margins, ranging between a 2-point lead for Clinton and a 3-point lead for Trump. HuffPost Pollster’s model, reflecting a set of far better results for Clinton during August, puts her over Trump by just under 3 points, although that’s likely to drop if other surveys confirm CNN’s results.In Ohio, recent polls have shown everything from a 7-point Clinton lead to a 5-point Trump advantage, but four of the five newest surveys give the edge to Trump. HuffPost Pollster’s model shows Trump and Clinton effectively tied at about 43 percent.It’s not yet clear how much, if any, of the change is due to last weekend’s news cycle, during which Clinton walked back a comment describing half of Trump’s supporters as “deplorables” and then announced she’d been diagnosed with pneumonia.Another question is to what extent the swings represent genuine shifts in public opinion. One theory, called “differential nonresponse,” argues that shifts in public polling are overstated, and often reflect a change not in what voters think, but in how likely they are to answer a survey at that particular moment.“Some of the change may involve a small number of Republicans who, for whatever reason, are momentarily more inclined to be interviewed than they were a few weeks ago (or a small number of Democrats who are less inclined),” SurveyMonkey’s Mark Blumenthal wrote Wednesday. “Some involves less politically engaged voters shifting their opinions. The odds are good it’s some combination of the two.”Clinton still leads in national polls by an average of nearly 4 points, down from 8 points during the summer, but still on par with President Barack Obama’s widest leads over Mitt Romney during the 2012 presidential election. A Quinnipiac University survey, also released Wednesday, gave her a 5-point edge over Trump."

A Waller County officer, Brian Encinia, stopped Bland, who had just moved to Texas to start a new job, for failing to signal when changing lanes in July 2015. He forcibly arrested the Chicago native after she refused to put out her cigarette. Three days later, she was found dead in her jail cell.Authorities ruled her death a suicide, but her family said they don’t believe she killed herself. Waller County police received much backlash after reports showed that the guard neglected to do regular checks on the inmates. Bland’s arrest, which was caught on dashcam, raised many questions among social media users after it went viral, but no one was charged in her death. Encinia, however, was later fired and charged with perjury."

After chastising Republican leadership in the Senate for denying him a hearing and a vote, Clinton went on to describe how she would go about the job.“If I have the opportunity to make any Supreme Court appointments, I’m going to look broadly and widely for people who represent the diversity of our country, who bring some common-sense, real-world experience,” she said.Garland is one of the most qualified judges in the country, and Democrats and progressive groups have fallen behind Obama’s choice. But he’s not exactly a household name or someone to rally the base ― he’s white, older, a judicial moderate and relatively pro-prosecution on criminal justice issues.That context is key to understanding Clinton’s remarks ― delivered during a nationally syndicated radio show reaching a predominantly African-American audience.“You know, I’m still absolutely outraged by what the Supreme Court did to the Voting Rights Act,” she went on, referring to the court’s 2013 decision to strike down a part of the landmark law. “I was in the Senate. I voted to reauthorize it, as did 98 of my colleagues ― Republicans and Democrats alike. George W. Bush signed it. And then this Supreme Court, with this conservative majority at the time, said, ‘Oh, we don’t need the Voting Rights Act anymore.”“What a charade,” she continued. “And you can see what’s happening. I see it everyday. There’s a concerted effort to try to shrink the franchise. Make it difficult for people to vote. Stop them at the polls. And the only way to fix that is for a lot of people to turn out and just say, ‘We’re not going to stand for this.’”Then came Clinton’s pitch.“That’s why we need a Supreme Court that actually represents the people of this country and our more fundamental values.”Whether that means Garland’s chances are slim to none if a President Clinton takes office, no one knows. But that seems to be where things are headed, and even the White House is dancing around that possibility.White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest ducked a question Thursday about the prospect of Clinton not re-nominating Garland. “If Senate Republicans are willing to do their job, it’s not going to come to that,” Earnest said in his daily briefing. “If Senate Republicans do their job, Merrick Garland is going to be serving a lifetime appointment on the United States Supreme Court. And I know that’s an outcome that Secretary Clinton has indicated she strongly supports.”Jen Bendery contributed reporting."

But it was clear from a raft of new polls that Trump had halted a summer swoon after taking steps to give a less freewheeling, more polished performance on the stump.Clinton, 68, appeared in good health on a visit to her campaign plane’s press cabin while flying to Greensboro, North Carolina, for a rally where she sought to refocus her campaign on the plight of the working class - which has turned out to be a potent theme for Trump.Leaving the stage to the tune of James Brown’s “I feel good,” Clinton told reporters she kept her pneumonia diagnosis last Friday quiet, telling only senior staff, because she thought she would be able to “power through” the illness and keep campaigning.“From my perspective, I thought I was going to be fine and I thought that there was no reason to make a big fuss about it,” she said.On Sunday, Clinton nearly collapsed while leaving a ceremony marking the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in New York.Her illness coincided with a mini-surge by Trump, who has drawn even or taken a slight lead in national polls.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) wants to know why the FBI will publish records related to an investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email server, but not records related to the FBI’s investigation of bank executives during the 2008 financial crisis.“The DOJ’s inability to obtain meaningful convictions or settlements in the vast majority of these [Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission] referrals ― let alone in any other cases involving senior Wall Street executives ― suggests that the Department failed to hold the individuals and companies most responsible for the financial crisis and the Great Recession accountable,” Warren wrote in her letter to the FBI on Thursday.Warren noted that the FCIC referred 11 cases to the DOJ in which the commission found “serious indication of violation” of federal banking laws, implicating nine individuals in those violations. “Not one of these nine has gone to prison or been prosecuted for a criminal offense,” Warren said.Those named by the FCIC include top executives of some of the largest banks in the country and some of the most politically connected men on Wall Street, including Robert Rubin, former Bill Clinton treasury secretary and Citigroup chairman.Warren’s staff also found 14 corporations the FCIC referred to the DOJ that were never criminally prosecuted.Warren said the FBI’s recent decision to release details of its Clinton probe gives the agency “clear precedent” for providing more information about the financial crisis ― noting that, typically, the FBI doesn’t release details of investigations when it doesn’t recommend prosecution.But with FBI Director James Comey deciding to make previously undisclosed information available “in the interest of transparency,” Warren thinks these new standards should compel Comey to make the investigations into the FCIC referrals public, too.“If Secretary Clinton’s email server was of sufficient ‘interest’ to establish a new FBI standard of transparency, then surely the criminal prosecutions of those responsible for the 2008 financial crisis should be subject to the same level of transparency,” she wrote.Warren also wrote a similar letter to the DOJ inspector general asking the office to look into the DOJ investigations of the FCIC referrals.Former FCIC Chairman Phil Angelides applauded Warren’s pressure, saying the failure to prosecute top executives has “rightly bred anger and cynicism about the fairness of our legal system.” “It is in the vital public interest to know exactly what the DOJ did to follow up on and investigate on the matters and individuals referred to it by the FCIC,” Angelides said in a written statement Thursday. “How is it possible that banks engaged in such massive misconduct, but no banker was involved? Is it possible we have witnessed an immaculate corruption? It defies common sense.”You can read the letter to the DOJ here, and the one to the FBI here."

He suggested retrofitting an old Navy ship into a temporary shelter until enough permanent housing is made available for the city’s exploding homeless population.The idea may actually work considering that similar approaches have been implemented in the past.After the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake hit San Francisco, 300 homeless people who had nowhere to go lived on a small aircraft carrier called the USS Peleliu for two weeks, Agnos noted. It was equipped with sleeping quarters, kitchens, medical clinics, offices and recreation facilities.And other cities are currently employing such a solution or at least considering the idea.Dortmund, Germany, for example, is temporarily housing its overflow of refugees on cruise ships on the Emscher River, Agnos mentioned in his op-ed.Agnos’ suggestion comes at a time when San Francisco’s homeless population is increasing, Mayor Ed Lee is cracking down on homeless camps and there’s a dearth in affordable housing.

The program, which never launched, had hints of “housing first” elements to it.After undergoing an evaluation and getting services, homeless people would’ve been placed in transitional housing and then eventually would’ve segued into permanent housing.Since then, housing first has been widely embraced.

The scale of the recall is unprecedented for Samsung, the world’s largest smartphone maker.Samsung said on Thursday that new Note 7 replacement devices will be available at most retail locations in the United States no later than Sept. 21.Earlier this month, Samsung said it would recall all Note 7 smartphones equipped with batteries it found to be fire-prone and halted their sales in 10 markets, denting a revival of the firm’s mobile business.While recalls in the smartphone industry do happen, including for rival Apple Inc , the nature of the problem for the Note 7 is a serious blow to Samsung’s reputation, analysts have said.The CPSC said on Thursday that consumers should immediately power down and stop using the recalled Galaxy Note 7 devices.The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has asked airline passengers to switch off and unplug the recalled Note 7s during flights.Some 2.5 million of the premium devices worldwide need to be recalled, Samsung said.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d989631300002a0039bfad.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The House Committee on Science, Space and Technology held a hearing Wednesday seemingly with the goal of affirming that chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) has the authority to subpoena those investigating whether the oil industry covered up what it knew about climate change.But Democrats on the committee used the hearing to slam Smith and the GOP for what they say are embarrassing efforts to defend the oil industry.Before a lengthy back-and-forth in which many, including three expert legal witnesses, came to Smith’s defense, ranking committee member Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas) blasted the longtime climate change denier, calling his actions embarrassing, ironic and a brazen attempt to help ExxonMobil. Since being established 58 years ago, Johnson said, the House committee has effectively and appropriately used its oversight authority. That’s no longer true, she said, because of Smith.“Today the majority [party] seems to view its oversight powers as a political tool, and the committee’s investigative authority as unbounded,” Johnson said. “This hearing appears to be the culmination of a politically motivated ‘oversight’ agenda that has been applauded by oil, gas and mining interests and broadly condemned by the public, the media and the independent scientific community across the country and around the world.”In July, Smith subpoenaed the New York and Massachusetts attorneys general, along with several environmental groups who are investigating whether companies like Exxon Mobil committed fraud by covering up the risks of carbon emissions and climate change. At the time, Smith questioned the investigating groups’ motives, saying they want “companies to settle out of court so they can obtain funds for their own purposes.” Smith and other Republicans maintain that the probes threaten free speech rights ― an argument that has been a go-to defense for the industry.The irony, Johnson said, is that in issuing subpoenas aimed at protecting Exxon’s free speech rights, Smith is “unequivocally violating these [subpoenaed] groups’ First Amendment rights to petition the government.”The offices of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healy have refused to comply with Smith’s demands, calling them “unconstitutional,” “unprecedented” and “dangerous.”During Wednesday’s hearing, Smith said the documents he’s demanding in the subpoenas would inform the committee as to whether the investigations are having a “chilling impact on scientific research and development.” He said the AGs and environmental groups could face “consequences,” including depositions, contempt proceedings and legal action, if they do not turn over the information.“The committee wants the truth, Americans deserve the truth and the constitution requires that we seek the truth,” said Smith, who has received $684,947 in donations from the oil and gas industry since 1989. “The refusal of the attorneys general to comply with the committee’s subpoenas should trouble everyone sitting on this dais, everyone in this room, and every American.”Although many Republicans agree, Democratic members of the committee did not mince words Wednesday when describing their disgust with Smith.Johnson fired off an extensive list of times she says Smith has “abused” the committee’s oversight powers, including harassing NOAA climate scientists in an “attempt to undercut the notion of human-caused climate change.”The “latest embarrassment of the committee,” Johnson said, is Smith and the majority party’s “brazen attempts to assist ExxonMobil in the face of legitimate fraud investigations.”“The majority has claimed that their investigation is about protecting the First Amendment rights of ExxonMobil,” Johnson said. “However, the law is clear ― fraud is not protected by the First Amendment. If any companies in the oil industry defrauded the public or their shareholders in their well-documented disinformation campaign on global warming, then that is a matter for the state attorneys general and the courts, not the Committee on Science.”Rep. Paul Tonko (D-N.Y.) said he is concerned the subpoenas might interfere with legitimate investigations of fraud, set a bad precedent and damage the committee’s credibility. “There is an obvious political agenda here, I believe, and I hope that we will put an end to infringing on states’ rights so that our AGs can conduct their rightful enforcement of the law,” Tonko said. Of the four expert witnesses called for Wednesday’s hearing, three agreed the committee has the authority to issue subpoenas. One of those three, Jonathan Turley of George Washington University Law School, said that even though he agrees with the science behind climate change, the actions by state AGs “contravenes academic freedom and free speech.” The fourth expert witness, Charles Tiefer, of the University of Baltimore, warned that “no House committee has ever tried, or should ever try” to enforce a subpoena against state attorneys general.“Today, a House committee with no precedent is going squarely against a key component of state sovereignty,” Tiefer said. Just before Wednesday’s hearing, the #ExxonKnew campaign hosted a press conference on Capitol Hill in which a number of speakers blasted the committee’s ongoing efforts to interfere with their investigations.“This hearing may as well be sponsored by ExxonMobil,” May Boeve, executive director of 350.org, one of the subpoenaed groups, said in a statement. “The bottom line is that this hearing is nothing but Smith’s attempt to distract us from the real issue: Exxon knew the truth about climate change, and Exxon lied.”Watch Wednesday’s hearing in its entirety below.This article initially identified Rep. Paul Tonko by his middle name, David, and has been updated."

One of those three, Jonathan Turley of George Washington University Law School, said that even though he agrees with the science behind climate change, the actions by state AGs “contravenes academic freedom and free speech.” The fourth expert witness, Charles Tiefer, of the University of Baltimore, warned that “no House committee has ever tried, or should ever try” to enforce a subpoena against state attorneys general.“Today, a House committee with no precedent is going squarely against a key component of state sovereignty,” Tiefer said. Just before Wednesday’s hearing, the #ExxonKnew campaign hosted a press conference on Capitol Hill in which a number of speakers blasted the committee’s ongoing efforts to interfere with their investigations.“This hearing may as well be sponsored by ExxonMobil,” May Boeve, executive director of 350.org, one of the subpoenaed groups, said in a statement. “The bottom line is that this hearing is nothing but Smith’s attempt to distract us from the real issue: Exxon knew the truth about climate change, and Exxon lied.”Watch Wednesday’s hearing in its entirety below.This article initially identified Rep.

(Reuters) - Missouri lawmakers pushed through bills on Wednesday eliminating the need for permits to carry concealed weapons and requiring voters to show a photo identification before casting a ballot, overriding Democratic Governor Jay Nixon’s vetoes of the bills.Both votes by the Republican-controlled state House and Senate reached the two-thirds majority required to enact legislation over the governor’s veto.The weapons bill abolished a state law requiring a permit, training and background checks for people who want to carry a concealed weapon in the state.The House voted 112-41 to override Nixon’s veto and the Senate voted 24-6.Supporters of the bill said it will make the state safer by allowing more residents to carry firearms in self-defense, while still banning certain criminals and mentally incompetent people from having a gun.In vetoing the bill in July, Nixon said the measure struck an extreme blow to sensible safeguards against gun violence.Earlier on Wednesday, the state Senate voted 24-7 and the House 115-41 to override Nixon’s veto of a bill requiring voters to produce a government-issued ID instead of less official identification such as a utility bill or bank check.The bill would not take effect until 2017, after this year’s presidential election, and only if voters in November pass a state constitutional amendment in support of the new law. That is necessary because the Missouri Supreme Court ruled 10 years ago that such a statute violated the existing state constitution.Courts in recent months have blocked voter ID laws passed in several states by Republican-led legislatures after civil rights groups argued the measures were discriminatory against poor and minority voters.In Missouri, voters without a photo ID can still vote if they sign an affidavit swearing that they lack any type of identification. However, election officials can take their picture, and steps must be taken to get a photo ID for later use, with the state covering the cost.Supporters of the bill said it will help prevent voter fraud.“Why not have more certainty in the election process?” Republican Representative Justin Alferman, the bill’s main sponsor, said in a statement before the vote.Opponents had argued that the ID requirement places an undue burden on young, minority and low-income voters who tend to support Democratic candidates.“Putting additional and unwanted barriers between citizens and their ability to vote is wrong and detrimental to our system of government as a whole,” Nixon said in explaining his veto."

On Tuesday, the Republican presidential nominee presented a policy offering new mothers six weeks of maternity leave, but the details were murky. The campaign told The Huffington Post that fathers wouldn’t be included, but did they actually mean to exclude gay men who adopt? Or women who adopt? Would same-sex couples get the benefit at all?Ivanka Trump danced around these questions in an interview with Cosmopolitan magazine on Wednesday. When asked if her father’s plan would cover gay couples in which both partners are men, she didn’t answer. Instead, Trump emphasized the plan was intended to give women time to physically recover from childbirth.When pressed on the question of same-sex couples, she again dodged the issue. “The policy is fleshed out online, so you can go see all the elements of it,” she told Cosmo. “But the original intention of the plan is to help mothers in recovery in the immediate aftermath of childbirth.”When asked to confirm that gay men would not be included, Trump laughed ― it’s not entirely clear why. Read for yourself:The Trump campaign’s website confirms that only new birth mothers would get the six weeks off: “The Trump plan will enhance Unemployment Insurance (UI) to include 6 weeks of paid leave for new mothers so that they can take time off of work after having a baby.” The Trump campaign claims online that its plan is similar to one in place in California; however, that state’s plan covers all new parents ― including foster parents and those who adopt. Connecticut, New Jersey and Rhode Island all have paid parental leave that is inclusive of adoptive and foster parents.It’s not unusual for birth mothers to get more paid time off to care for a child than adoptive parents ― gay or straight. Some states fund maternity leave through disability insurance, which kicks in only for those who have a medical birth. For this reason, birth mothers may often wind up entitled to more leave than men or women who adopt. However, a public leave policy that completely ignores adoptive or foster parents is extremely unusual in the U.S.Current federal law provides 12 weeks unpaid time off for some full-time workers at large companies to care for a new baby or a seriously ill family member. The Family and Medical Leave Act, signed by Bill Clinton, makes no distinction between birth mothers and adoptive parents. The U.S. is the only developed country in the world that does not offer paid maternity leave to its citizens. Hillary Clinton’s paid leave proposal would offer 12 weeks of time off to new parents, including adoptive ones, as well as workers who need to care for seriously ill family members.Donald Trump has a mixed history on gay rights. He’s said in the past that he would appoint judges who would overturn marriage equality, and has given his support to North Carolina’s passage of a bill that discriminates against LGBTQ people.Yet he also told the audience at the Republican National Convention this summer, “As your president, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology, believe me.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

It also came at a frantic time. The attacks had happened just days earlier, and Americans’ fear and anger were high. People were grieving the loss of loved ones.The 2001 AUMF was written quickly and runs just 60 words. When it came up in the Senate, not a single senator opposed it. The House passed it by a 420-1 vote. There was next to no debate.That lone holdout was Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.). Her fear was that Congress was signing a blank check for endless war. Lee’s voice cracked with emotion as she spoke in the House on Sept. 14, 2001, trying to make sense of the devastation even as she explained why she couldn’t support giving a president such unchecked power.“However difficult this vote may be, some of us must urge the use of restraint,” Lee said. “Our country is in a state of mourning. Some of us must say let’s step back for a moment, let’s just pause and think through the implications of our actions today so that this does not spiral out of control.”Watch her speech here:Lee was clearly in the minority when the vote came down that day, but 15 years later, she appears to have been right.Since the 2001 AUMF took effect, it has been used to justify 37 military actions in 14 countries, as well as indefinite detention of individuals at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.President Barack Obama says it covers attacks on Islamic State militants without new authorization. The Islamic State, or ISIS, is an offshoot of al Qaeda, the group behind the 9/11 attacks, the administration argues, so the 2001 AUMF applies. Nearly 5,000 U.S. military personnel are in Iraq and Syria helping to fight ISIS under that authority. Billions of dollars have been spent battling the extremist group without a debate or vote in Congress on the parameters of the war.Future presidents can unilaterally send in more U.S. troops and launch additional attacks, too, if they make the case there is a connection to al Qaeda.Lee’s moment of dissent is perhaps her proudest vote to date. She frequently cites it in war-related debates, and on Wednesday, she launched a petition campaign urging Congress to repeal the 2001 AUMF and debate the proper parameters for a new AUMF specific to the war against ISIS. Congress has shown little willingness to take on the issue, but the California Democrat isn’t ready to stop pushing.“The Constitution is clear: Congress has an obligation to give the American people a voice on matters of war and peace,” Lee said in a statement. “How can we ask our brave men and women in uniform to fight a war that Congress lacks the courage to even debate?”"

Across the whole of Fujian province, where Xiamen is located, 1.65 million homes had no electricity, state television said.Large sections of Xiamen also suffered water supply disruptions and some windows in tall buildings shattered, sending glass showering onto the ground below, state news agency Xinhua said.The report said it was the strongest typhoon to hit that part of the country since the founding of Communist China in 1949 and the strongest so far this year anywhere in the world.Tens of thousands of people had already been evacuated as the storm approached and fishing boats called back to port.One person died and 38 were injured in Taiwan, the Central Emergency Operation Centre there said, as the typhoon hit the southern part of the island on Wednesday.Meranti was a Category 5 typhoon, the strongest classification awarded by Tropical Storm Risk storm tracker, before it made landfall on the mainland and has since been downgraded to Category 2.Typhoons are common at this time of year, picking up strength as they cross the warm waters of the Pacific and bringing fierce winds and rain when they hit land.Meranti will continue to lose strength as it pushes inland and up toward China’s commercial capital of Shanghai, but will bring heavy rain."

The law was signed by President George W. Bush in 2008 and forced companies to safely discard the toxic metal in the United States rather than sending it to poorer nations, mostly in Asia, where mercury poisoned people and the environment after ending up in dump sites.With four months left in his presidency, Obama may want to do the same for electronic waste. Even when they’re recycled, many old printers and computer monitors wind up places like China, where they are crudely dismantled and release hazardous chemicals, according to a report released on Thursday.Earlier this year, California-based nonprofit watchdog Basel Action Network, or BAN, placed GPS trackers on 205 printers and LCD monitors, then dropped them off at recycling companies and charities. Of the 152 devices donated to U.S. recycling companies, 40 percent ended up in junkyards in rural Hong Kong. “Instead of taking care of these things at home and doing it properly and having the recycling done and having jobs in the U.S. to do it right, the industry has been trained to get away with just dumping and externalizing the real costs that should be in place to make things more responsible and less harmful,” BAN chief Jim Puckett told The Huffington Post on Wednesday.The U.S. remains the only developed country that has not ratified the 1989 Basel Convention, a United Nations treaty barring the export of hazardous waste. Instead, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency encourages recyclers to apply for one of two voluntary third-party certifications ― R2 and e-Stewards ― for meeting recycling standards.That isn’t working so well. On Monday, Washington state officials fined the Seattle-based electronics recycler Total Reclaim Inc. $444,000 for illegally shipping flat-screen televisions and monitors containing mercury to Hong Kong for disposal. The company holds e-Stewards certification.“They confessed and said they were very sorry,” Puckett said.Total Reclaim, for its part, says it has upgraded equipment to better process flatscreen devices and contracted independent third-party auditors to monitor its supply chain.Puckett doesn’t entirely blame Total Reclaim for taking shortcuts. He blames the federal government for not putting better restrictions in place to curb such exports.In February, the EPA recommended in a study that companies certified by either of the two standards should “regularly review their programs and build-in necessary improvements.”“While EPA realizes that these certification programs are not the only solution to ensuring proper management of used electronics, the study’s findings suggest that the certification programs overall have led to improved management practices and a greater awareness of the environmental, health and safety risks associated with managing used electronics at their end of life,” Melissa Harrison, an EPA spokeswoman, told HuffPost by email on Thursday.Two months ago, BAN launched a petition demanding the Obama administration curtail its own e-waste dumping. The petition, hosted by Change.org, had more than 9,700 signatures by Thursday afternoon.“We want Obama to at least control the federal government’s own e-waste,” Puckett said. “It’s the largest single generator of e-waste on the planet, if you count the Defense Department and all the other agencies.” "

The movie, about a 1950s fashionista who returns to her hometown seeking vengeance after being wrongfully branded a murderer, earned five Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts Awards last year, including one for Winslet. After the film’s premiere at the 2015 Toronto Film Festival, Variety called it “lively and propulsive,” while The Hollywood Reporter praised its “manic energy and straight-up weirdness.”Still, much of the hype glosses over a surprise queer aspect to “The Dressmaker.” The film features a humorous subplot involving Sergeant Farrat (played by Hugo Weaving), a police officer with a flair for cross-dressing. Weaving, whose credits include “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy and “The Matrix,” is no stranger to gender-bending on film. In 1994, he starred as Mitzi Del Bra, an Aussie drag queen, in the cult hit, “The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.” This time around, however, the costumes proved to be a fun challenge. In the film’s production notes, Weaving said, “Everything needed to be grounded in a reality and a truth but at the same time there’s a heightened reality to it, so it’s slightly surreal.”Noting that the characters are “very specific types,” he added, “A lot of them are larger than life and the costumes need to somehow reflect that.”Throw in an award-winning performance by Winslet and Liam Hemsworth as a swoon-worthy love interest and we’re on board! “The Dressmaker” opens Sept. 23.

Jackson-Locklear, said her daughter’s suicide came less than two months after she was raped at the school’s Sigma Pi fraternity house in late September.Locklear had previously attempted to kill herself on Oct. 15, 2015, about three weeks after the attack, and was hospitalized for five days, her mother said. A few weeks later, she died by suicide.The sex discrimination lawsuit notes that Locklear didn’t report the rape to the university police department until November. But once she did, the school failed to perform “an appropriate and thorough investigation,” according to the suit.The man Locklear accused of rape was neither “confronted nor charged” by responding officers, the suit alleges.The university, its police force, as well as several school officials and the school’s Sigma Pi fraternity chapter are named as defendants in the case.Sigma Pi said in a statement that the accused student was not a member of the fraternity at the time of the alleged attack, and had been expelled for unrelated reasons in 2014.“However, given that the incident occurred at an off-campus property where active members lived, once we learned of this incident, we took immediate action, including initiating an internal review and working with the University during its investigation,” Jason Walker, the executive director of Sigma Pi Fraternity International, stated in an email to The Huffington Post.“The safety and security of our members and all those within the campus community remains our top priority and we will continue to take aggressive action in response to any allegations of sexual assault,” he added.In a statement released to the university community on Wednesday, William Paterson University’s vice president for student development, Miki Cammarata, said the school has yet to be served with the lawsuit but that they “deny the accuracy of many of the statements reported in the media.”“At William Paterson University, we encourage our students to report allegations of sexual assault and we follow all federal and state laws and guidelines for reporting and investigating allegations of sexual assault,” the statement reads. “We do not and will not ignore or fail to thoroughly investigate reported incidents of sexual assault. The safety and well-being of our students is our primary concern.”A university spokeswoman did not provide further comment when reached by HuffPost.If you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

Initially, Samaria Rice, was reluctant to conserve the gazebo altogether after she and the city of Cleveland agreed to demolish it, according to Rice’s family Attorney Billy Joe Mills. However, eventually, Mills told ABC News that Tamir’s mother “and those around her began to realize its historical significance and importance of preserving it.” Rice was shot and killed at the site in November 2014 after officer Timothy Loehman fired shots immediately upon arriving at the scene. Rice, who was holding a toy BB gun, died almost instantly. His death prompted protests that demanded accountability on behalf of the officers involved and even more outrage followed when the officers were acquitted by a grand jury in December 2015. Rice’s family filed a lawsuit over his death which resulted in a $6 million settlement from the city of Cleveland. Despite the arrangement, the gazebo, which has since been transformed into a makeshift memorial honoring Rice, still stands as a “symbol of pain,” as another attorney for the family described. “[The gazebo] is one of the strongest national symbols of the current era of civil rights and police brutality,” Mills said.“We hope that it will continue to serve as that symbol but that by installing it at prominent institutions it will be elevated further in importance and power.”This move to preserve the memory of Rice isn’t the first time the victim of a police shooting has been memorialized in a museum in Chicago. In July 2015, an exhibit at Gallery Guichard displayed a life-sized mannequin of Michael Brown’s dead body, which was condemned by visitors and Brown’s father himself.However, Mills said the gazebo’s move made in Rice’s honor was embraced by all. “All sides have positive feelings about the loan and partnership,” Mills said.

The pitch for the museum came two days ahead of Hispanic Heritage Month, which begins on Sept. 15.Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.) and Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), both longtime supporters of building the museum, are hoping to ride the momentum surrounding the opening of the NMAAHC on Sept. 24.The proposed National Museum of the American Latino would give Latinos a long-awaited space on the National Mall, Becerra said. The legislation would establish the museum in the Arts and Industries Building on the southern end of the Mall.“A lot of people do not know that there are American Latinos who couldn’t walk into restaurants in the last century,” Becerra said in a statement to The Huffington Post. “People like my dad would run into signs that read, ‘No dogs or Mexicans allowed.’ A museum gives people a sense of our history and culture and makes it clear how proud we are to be Americans.”The House and Senate bills have so far received bipartisan support. But if Congress votes to establish an American Latino museum, the project would likely be years away from a grand opening. The NMAAHC was established by Congress in 2003, and has been more than 13 years in the making.Becerra began his efforts to establish an American Latino museum in 2003, introducing a House bill that created a commission to explore the prospect of such a museum in Washington. In 2011, a report by the commission estimated that opening the museum would cost $463 million.Following the report, Becerra and Menendez introduced legislation to create the museum, but the measures failed in both chambers. Another measure died in 2013. “The National Mall should be the space where we get to tell our American story,” Becerra said. “It’s bad enough that we’re missing from TV and the books we read in school. The more we give people the chance to see what it means to be an American Latino, the better off we are.”"

She's now Donald Trump's campaign manager.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d86b0d1800006c32bd137e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Donald Trump’s new campaign manager, Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway, was recently tapped to help the loose-lipped candidate repair his reputation and defeat Hillary Clinton, the first woman to be nominated for president by a major party in U.S. history.Conway is an interesting choice for that role. Just two years ago, she defended Clinton against unfair media coverage of her appearance and questioned why reporters didn’t cover the “bad combover” of male politicians instead.“The coverage of female candidates, particularly at the national level, when Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin ran, was disgraceful,” Conway said at a panel on women in politics. “To have a 746-word article in a major newspaper discussing Hillary Clinton’s cleavage, and about five months later, having a major commentator on a major cable station say, ‘The best way ― this is brilliant to pick Sarah Palin, because that’s a great way to market her. I want to get in bed next to her’ ― where are, where is the comparable coverage, ladies?” Conway asked.“Where is the comparable coverage about the beer belly, paunchy beer belly and the bad combover? Where is that? You know, you’re never going to read those articles.”Conway, of course, did not realize then that she would run the campaign of the presidential candidate with the most notorious (and likely the most expensive) combover in history. And her wish came true, sort of: Vanity Fair published an illustrated history of Trump’s combover. Gawker investigated how much its upkeep costs. Yahoo assembled a slideshow of cats with Trump’s hair. The real estate mogul has even had to defend his signature hairdo on social media.“As everybody knows, but the haters and losers refuse to acknowledge,” Trump tweeted, “I do not wear a ‘wig.’ My hair may not be perfect, but it’s mine.”Of course, Trump is also known for his numerous sexist comments about female politicians and other public figures. He said in a recent interview with ABC News that Clinton doesn’t have “a presidential look,” and he criticized former GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina last year for her appearance. “Look at that face!” he said of Fiorina in an interview. “Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?” Trump later defended his comment about Fiorina by comparing it to negative coverage of his hair. “When I get criticized constantly about my hair, nobody does a story about, ‘Oh, isn’t that terrible? They criticized Donald Trump’s hair,’” he told “Fox & Friends.”Studies show, however, that media coverage of male politicians’ looks does not do as much damage to them as it does to female candidates. One 2013 survey by the Women’s Media Center found that any mention in the news of a female candidate’s appearance, whether positive or negative, made voters less likely to vote for her. Men “paid no price for the same kind of coverage,” the survey found. Conway’s advice to female candidates in 2014 was to call out sexist media coverage of their looks and shift the focus to other traits that give women an advantage over men. “Play to our strengths as being seen as less corruptible, more ethical, more able to negotiate, to forge consensus, to listen,” Conway said. “And also, to work on issues, you know, I call them the ‘she cluster issues.’ Social security, health care, education.”The Huffington Post asked Conway whether she has a problem with Trump’s jabs about his female opponents’ looks. She did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Johnson, took his colleagues to task for not treating the Ohio voting requirements as a naked effort to suppress the black vote.“By denying the most vulnerable the right to vote, the Majority shuts minorities out of our political process,” wrote U.S. Circuit Judge Damon Keith in a remarkable 38-page dissent in the case, Northeast Coalition for the Homeless v. Husted. “I am deeply saddened and distraught by the court’s deliberate decision to reverse the progress of history,” he added.On a 2-to-1 vote, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit tossed claims that the restrictions ― which impose a series of technical rules on those casting provisional and absentee ballots ― violate the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.At issue in the case were two Republican-backed laws that required county election officials to invalidate provisional and absentee ballots that did not correctly list a voter’s address or date of birth. The laws also limited poll-worker assistance to voters and shortened the time after Election Day that citizens casting provisional ballots have to certify their identity.A coalition of homeless rights advocates and Ohio Democratic groups challenged the laws in court, and a federal judge in June ruled that erecting these voting barriers was unconstitutional and a burden on the right to vote of a subset of African-American voters.But the 6th Circuit on Tuesday reversed that ruling in significant respects, noting that the lower court judge used the wrong legal standard when deciding the case.Keith, who became a federal judge in 1967 and 10 years later was nominated to the 6th Circuit by President Jimmy Carter, protested that the majority’s reasoning “takes us several steps back” in the struggle toward “a society free of racial discrimination” ― the kind the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection and federal civil rights laws sought to advance.“The utter brutality of white supremacy in its efforts to disenfranchise persons of color is the foundation for the tragedy that is the Majority’s effort to roll back the progress of history,” Keith wrote.Perhaps the most striking part of Keith’s dissenting opinion was an 11-page section where he sought to place the 6th Circuit’s conclusions “in full light of their historical context” ― one he knows well as the circuit’s longest-serving judge and a jurist steeped in civil-rights tradition.“I will not forget. I cannot forget ― indeed America cannot forget ― the pain, suffering, and sorrow of those who died for equal protection and for this precious right to vote,” wrote the 94-year-old Keith. “I add the following publicly available historical statements to humanize the struggle for the right to be equal participants in the democratic process.”What followed is likely unprecedented in a published judicial opinion: Keith included a picture gallery of those who died fighting for equal rights, who in a footnote he acknowledged were but “a mere fraction of the martyrs of the struggle for equality.”Among the more than two dozen martyrs Keith eulogized in chronological order were 14-year-old Emmett Till, the four black schoolgirls killed in the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama, and Martin Luther King Jr.But from there the judge jumped a few decades forward to the election and re-election of President Barack Obama ― which he called an “important historical occurrence that cannot be separated from efforts to abridge minorities’ right to vote.”The suggestion there is inescapable, if not stunning for a federal judge to make: that the electoral victory of the nation’s first black president somehow goes hand-in-hand with Republican efforts to disenfranchise African Americans.Keith’s conclusion, which followed about 20 pages of legal analysis, is worth reprinting in full, if only to illustrate his dismay with the state of voting rights even in the age of Obama.The birth of this Nation was founded upon the radical principle that we, as a people, would govern ourselves. And voting is the ultimate expression of self-government. Instead of making it easier for all persons, unrestrained and unfettered, to exercise this fundamental right to vote, legislators are making it harder. States are audaciously nullifying a right for which our ancestors relentlessly fought and—in some instances—even tragically died. From that struggle came the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and later, the Voting Rights Act. It is this court’s responsibility to enforce both the Constitution and the statute, and thereby safeguard this precious right to vote. In my opinion, the Majority has failed to do just that. The Majority takes the position that unless a rule affects non-minorities, it does not run afoul of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This baffling position distorts the Equal Protection Clause so much so that the clause becomes unrecognizable, unenforceable, and fundamentally, unequal. For years, states have been (both stealthily and overtly) erecting hurdles to the right to vote. And the votes of those who are actually able to surmount those hurdles are often diluted through Gerrymandering. These states’ actions of implementing rules and redrawing districts in an effort to restrict minorities’ access to the ballots is another reminder that history repeats itself.

Husted, issued Sept. 13.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d8bd661300002b0039bd3f.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A divided appeals court on Tuesday largely rejected a challenge to a set of voting requirements that will quite likely make it harder for poor, black Ohioans to have their ballots counted this election cycle.But the ruling likely won’t be remembered for how the majority ruled, but for how a long-serving federal judge, first appointed to the bench by President Lyndon B. Johnson, took his colleagues to task for not treating the Ohio voting requirements as a naked effort to suppress the black vote.“By denying the most vulnerable the right to vote, the Majority shuts minorities out of our political process,” wrote U.S. Circuit Judge Damon Keith in a remarkable 38-page dissent in the case, Northeast Coalition for the Homeless v. Husted. “I am deeply saddened and distraught by the court’s deliberate decision to reverse the progress of history,” he added.On a 2-to-1 vote, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit tossed claims that the restrictions ― which impose a series of technical rules on those casting provisional and absentee ballots ― violate the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.At issue in the case were two Republican-backed laws that required county election officials to invalidate provisional and absentee ballots that did not correctly list a voter’s address or date of birth. The laws also limited poll-worker assistance to voters and shortened the time after Election Day that citizens casting provisional ballots have to certify their identity.A coalition of homeless rights advocates and Ohio Democratic groups challenged the laws in court, and a federal judge in June ruled that erecting these voting barriers was unconstitutional and a burden on the right to vote of a subset of African-American voters.But the 6th Circuit on Tuesday reversed that ruling in significant respects, noting that the lower court judge used the wrong legal standard when deciding the case.Keith, who became a federal judge in 1967 and 10 years later was nominated to the 6th Circuit by President Jimmy Carter, protested that the majority’s reasoning “takes us several steps back” in the struggle toward “a society free of racial discrimination” ― the kind the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection and federal civil rights laws sought to advance.“The utter brutality of white supremacy in its efforts to disenfranchise persons of color is the foundation for the tragedy that is the Majority’s effort to roll back the progress of history,” Keith wrote.Perhaps the most striking part of Keith’s dissenting opinion was an 11-page section where he sought to place the 6th Circuit’s conclusions “in full light of their historical context” ― one he knows well as the circuit’s longest-serving judge and a jurist steeped in civil-rights tradition.“I will not forget. I cannot forget ― indeed America cannot forget ― the pain, suffering, and sorrow of those who died for equal protection and for this precious right to vote,” wrote the 94-year-old Keith. “I add the following publicly available historical statements to humanize the struggle for the right to be equal participants in the democratic process.”What followed is likely unprecedented in a published judicial opinion: Keith included a picture gallery of those who died fighting for equal rights, who in a footnote he acknowledged were but “a mere fraction of the martyrs of the struggle for equality.”Among the more than two dozen martyrs Keith eulogized in chronological order were 14-year-old Emmett Till, the four black schoolgirls killed in the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama, and Martin Luther King Jr.But from there the judge jumped a few decades forward to the election and re-election of President Barack Obama ― which he called an “important historical occurrence that cannot be separated from efforts to abridge minorities’ right to vote.”The suggestion there is inescapable, if not stunning for a federal judge to make: that the electoral victory of the nation’s first black president somehow goes hand-in-hand with Republican efforts to disenfranchise African Americans.Keith’s conclusion, which followed about 20 pages of legal analysis, is worth reprinting in full, if only to illustrate his dismay with the state of voting rights even in the age of Obama.The birth of this Nation was founded upon the radical principle that we, as a people, would govern ourselves. And voting is the ultimate expression of self-government. Instead of making it easier for all persons, unrestrained and unfettered, to exercise this fundamental right to vote, legislators are making it harder. States are audaciously nullifying a right for which our ancestors relentlessly fought and—in some instances—even tragically died. From that struggle came the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and later, the Voting Rights Act. It is this court’s responsibility to enforce both the Constitution and the statute, and thereby safeguard this precious right to vote. In my opinion, the Majority has failed to do just that. The Majority takes the position that unless a rule affects non-minorities, it does not run afoul of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This baffling position distorts the Equal Protection Clause so much so that the clause becomes unrecognizable, unenforceable, and fundamentally, unequal. For years, states have been (both stealthily and overtly) erecting hurdles to the right to vote. And the votes of those who are actually able to surmount those hurdles are often diluted through Gerrymandering. These states’ actions of implementing rules and redrawing districts in an effort to restrict minorities’ access to the ballots is another reminder that history repeats itself. It is yet another reminder that many people hold the misguided belief that only the privileged majority should be granted access to political power and adequate representation.The 6th Circuit majority ― U.S. Circuit Judges Danny Boggs and John Rogers, both of whom are white and were appointed by Republicans ― could barely muster a response.“We deeply respect the dissent’s recounting of important parts of the racial history of our country and the struggle for voting rights, and we agree that this history may always be appropriately borne in mind,” the judges said."
