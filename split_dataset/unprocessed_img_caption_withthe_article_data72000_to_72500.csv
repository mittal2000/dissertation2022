0,POLITICS,The U.S. Is Depressingly Good At Putting Women Behind Bars,Melissa Jeltsen,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/women-imprisoned-america-report_us_56547970e4b0d4093a591fa1,"""Most women are in prison for crimes directly related to social inequity -- poverty, addiction, mental illness, domestic violence and trauma.""",2015-11-24,America puts more women behind bars than almost any other country.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56549fef2100004a005ab8b6.jpeg?cache=1CxZOtwjjd&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The United States puts women behind bars at a higher rate than every other country in the world, save for Thailand.Though the U.S. has only 5 percent of the world's female population, it accounts for nearly 30 percent of incarcerated women globally, according to a new report by the non-profit Prison Policy Initiative.""[Women] make up a small portion of our prison population, but they are a growing one,"" said Aleks Kajstura, legal director at Prison Policy Initiative and co-author of the report. Currently, the U.S. incarcerates women at a rate of 127 per 100,000. Approximately 206,000 women are in the country's prisons and jails, according to U.S. Census data. Over the past four decades, the rate of women imprisoned in the U.S. has risen sharply. The Sentencing Project calculated that the number of women in prison is increasing at nearly double the rate of men. The report also broke down the incarceration rate for each U.S. state, and compared those rates to countries around the world. West Virginia incarcerates more women than any other jurisdiction on earth, with a rate of 273 women incarcerated per 100,000. Illinois' incarceration rate, at 88 women per 100,000, is about equal to that of El Salvador, where, the report notes, abortion is illegal and women can be jailed for having miscarriages. ""What was surprising is the degree to which the U.S. treatment of women was out of sync with the rest of the world,"" Kajstura said. ""Compared to the incarceration of men in the U.S., the women's rate is a lot lower. But if you look at how other countries incarcerate women, it's still completely out of whack what the U.S. does.""She pointed to Rhode Island, which is praised as having the lowest incarceration rate of women in the U.S. But if it were a country, Rhode Island would boast the 15th highest incarceration rate in the world. ""Within the U.S., talking about state to state policy, we might look to some place like Rhode Island or Massachusetts or Vermont as a model, but we really need to look well beyond that,"" Kajstura said. ""You can't treat something that is 15th worst in the world as a model if you want to really reduce incarceration to a level that's appropriate.""Tamar Kraft-Stolar, co-director of the Women and Justice Project, said it is critical to understand not just how many women the U.S. puts in prison, but who is incarcerated and why. ""It's not just any woman we lock up in the country,"" she said, adding that a disproportionate number of women in prison are women of color and women from low-income communities -- the majority of whom are mothers. ""Most women are in prison for crimes directly related to social inequity -- poverty, addiction, mental illness, domestic violence and trauma,"" she said. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, in 2014, 59 percent of women in federal prison were serving time for drug offenses and 4 percent were in prison for violent offenses. In state prisons, 24 percent of women in 2013 were incarcerated for drug offenses, and 37 percent were imprisoned for violent offenses.The majority of incarcerated women have histories of physical or sexual abuse prior to their incarceration. While black women represent only 13 percent of the total U.S. female population, they make up 30 percent of incarcerated women.""Those realities are not a coincidence: It's a direct reflection of our criminal justice system's racism and exclusive targeting of marginalized communities, and it's a direct reflection of our society's destructive over-reliance on incarceration as a response to problems that are social and economic at their core,"" Kraft-Stolar said. ""Truly tackling the mass incarceration of women requires us not only to understand the staggering numbers, but also the underlying reasons why the numbers have exploded.""______Melissa Jeltsen covers domestic violence and other issues related to women's health, safety and security.

The Lakers won, 104-98.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56532d661b0000270029e60f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For years, Kobe Bryant’s inclination has been to play the role of hero, to shoot his Lakers team back into the game whenever it has fallen behind. Now, embracing a new role a month into his 20th NBA season, Kobe Bryant has begun to stress the importance of sharing the ball -- of passing the rock to get the best shot, even at the expense of one’s own stats.Even the most casual NBA fan can identify that this switch is, of course, hilarious. And no, the irony is not lost on him.“When I've become the voice of 'ball-movement reason,' you know you have an issue,"" Bryant said after the Lakers fell to the Toronto Raptors on Friday. ""I never thought I'd see the day when I'd be the one preaching that stuff. That's crazy ... I can't believe I'm saying this shit. Are you kidding me? Like a kid that grows up and just starts sounding like his parents."" One of the most telling stats of Los Angeles’ season is that Bryant -- who’s been relegated to the small forward position to accommodate a developing backcourt -- leads the team in assists. And he's only averaging 3.7 dimes per game. The next-best on the squad is Marcelo Huertas, who plays only about a dozen minutes per night. Rookie point guard D’Angelo Russell -- the heir apparent to Kobe Bryant’s throne -- is averaging just 2.9 assists per game. Jordan Clarkson, Lakers fans’ other prayer for the future, is totaling two dimes a contest. Meanwhile, Los Angeles is off to one of the worst starts in franchise history, sitting on a 2-11 record. For the sake of the team’s future, Purple and Gold fans better hope that players like Russell, Clarkson, Huertas and Lou Williams follow Bryant’s lead, learning from a notoriously shoot-first player to spare the jumper and share the ball -- LA doesn’t want to find out what the future will look like if they don’t follow this unexpected advice.Also on HuffPost:"

These use hydrogen in a process that creates electricity but not carbon dioxide. Automakers plan to offer these cars in California, although the rollout will be limited.Hyundai says it has already leased its fuel-cell Tucson to about 85 customers, and Toyota says it has received expressions of interest from more than 2,000 people. Honda’s Clarity sedan will only be available in late 2016. Fuel-cell technology is expensive, and hydrogen fueling stations are still rare. Hyundai's Tucson can be leased for $499 per month and sold only in Southern California, where there are about nine fueling stations.Toyota's new Mirai can run for 300 miles between charges. Bill Fay, general manager for Toyota brand sales in the United States, told Reuters that a concerted public-private push is needed to build more refueling stations.""We need the government to support the investment in this and we hope that Honda and Hyundai will be coming in and provide some support,"" Fay said. ""Then I think we have some critical mass to build from and take off from there.""California provides as much as $100 million a year to fund alternative fuel and vehicle projects, including hydrogen refueling stations.Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk and other Tesla executives have taken shots at fuel cells and the tax-funded subsidies used to promote them. Fuel cell vehicles compete with Tesla's electric cars as generators of credits that could help conventional automakers meet California's complex zero emission vehicle quotas.Tesla has benefited from, and repaid, government loans. It sells clean car credits. Tesla has also built its own recharging network.“Fuel cells are dependent on public infrastructure in a way electric vehicles will never be,” Tesla’s vice president for business development, Diarmuid O’Connell, said Friday at an appearance before the Automotive Press Association. And because much of the hydrogen used in fuel cell vehicles will be derived from fossil fuels, he said, “fuel cell vehicles are not even zero emission vehicles.”Battery electric cars rely on an electric grid that in many regions of the United States is fueled by coal and gas, but O’Connell said the U.S. grid is getting cleaner.Public subsidies and regulations are the key forces driving the competition between fuel cell vehicles and battery electric vehicles in California, where state regulators have mandated that up to 16 percent of vehicles, or 1.5 million cars, sold in the state by 2025 be zero emission. Currently, about 2 percent of the vehicles sold in California are electric cars.Both fuel-cell cars and battery electric cars have limitations that discourage many would-be buyers.Most electric battery-powered cars on the market run for fewer than 100 miles between recharging stops. Tesla’s Model S sedan and Model X sport utility can run for more than 200 miles between charges, but the average Tesla sells for over $70,000.Low gas prices undermine demand for both technologies. Only about 67,700 electric vehicles were sold in the United States last year - about 0.4 percent of the 16.5 million new cars and trucks sold.""The electric car that has earned one dime for its maker hasn't been created yet,"" said Johan de Nysschen, president of General Motors Co 's Cadillac luxury brand, on the sidelines of the show.Still, GM plans a new electric Chevrolet model with a projected 200-mile range, and is experimenting with fuel cell technology.(Reporting by Alexandria Sage; Additional reporting by Joseph White; Editing by Joseph White and Leslie Adler)"

It’s the small details that have an enormous effect,” he said, according to The Local.The king's comments came as he prepares to attend the United Nations climate change talks in Paris next week, where world leaders will work on a pact to try to rein in greenhouse gas emissions.The 69-year-old monarch, who has attended several U.N. conferences on the environment, said he came up with the bathtub idea when he was staying in a room that only had a tub and no shower.""It took a lot of fresh water and energy,"" he said. ""It struck me so clearly: It's not wise that I have to do this.

""While this is significant progress, it is still not enough,"" he said. ""The challenge now is to move much further and faster to reduce global emissions so we can keep the global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius."" He stressed that the Paris conference ""must mark the floor, not the ceiling, of our ambition.""Associated Press reporter Edith M.

10,SPORTS,Jameis Winston Is Even Better Than We Thought,Jordan Schultz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jameis-winston-better-than-we-thought_us_56534f00e4b0879a5b0bc27c,The former No. 1 overall pick is flashing record-setting greatness.,2015-11-23,"On the road in Philadelphia on Sunday, the 21-year-old Winston tied the NFL's all-time rookie record with five touchdown passes.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/565362531700004b00e1a609.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Jameis Winston's NFL debut for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in September admittedly went less than swimmingly.Against Tennessee in Week 1, the polarizing No. 1 overall pick was hit, battered and confused. Despite tossing two touchdowns, Winston amassed a woeful quarterback rating: under seven. He threw two interceptions -- his first pass was a pick-six -- and completed a wretched 48.5 percent of his passes.Making matters worse was the fact that the Titans' Marcus Mariota, selected second behind Winston in the draft, was downright sensational, tying the NFL rookie debut record with four touchdown passes in the first half en route to a perfect 158.3 passer rating. But Winston, as he tends to do, stayed above water even under the most dire of circumstances. ""I believe we're going to bounce back,"" he said following the Buccaneers' 42-14 defeat. ""That's what we'll do. ... It's not the end of the world.""To be sure, the rookie was true to his word. Despite a makeshift offensive line with two new additions, both of whom are rookies, Winston has largely been able to avoid the rush and stay away from the typically egregious errors we see from young signal callers.With only two interceptions since Week 4 to go along with 19 total touchdowns (15 passing), Winston is among the best in pro football. And just as was the case during his Florida State days, Winston isn't merely dinking and ducking his way down the field, throwing short, non-risky passes. His 7.66 yards per pass attempt rank him ninth in the league. And, on the road in Philadelphia on Sunday, the 21-year-old tied the league's all-time rookie record with five touchdown passes.One of the crucial questions about Winston during the entire draft process -- and even during his Heisman-winning collegiate days -- was his maturity, or lack thereof. Was this a guy a team could legitimately build its franchise around? Was this a guy who would show up and lead -- even when it wasn't convenient, when he was struggling and losses were piling up?We often hear coaches talk about how even the most talented of players may be able to fool the fans or even the coaching staff, but can't ever fool his teammates. Those are the guys who see it everyday, and in reality, they're really the only people that matter. To that point, Winston's youth hasn't been a liability -- at least, not yet -- and his teammates believe in him as a result.""We are watching a young quarterback grow before our eyes,"" second-year wide receiver Mike Evans -- a rising star in his own right -- said after the Buccaneers' dominant win over Philly. ""He is a hard worker, fun to be around and has great leadership. And it shows every day, on and off the field.""Now Tampa is on a quest to end its eight-year playoff drought. After the team's shocking Week 8 overtime win in Atlanta to improve its record to 5-5, head coach Lovie Smith said of his quarterback: ""He is going to be our leader. He's not a captain yet. But he is in that role.""And that's just the thing. It's easy to lead when you're winning. It's convenient.

11,SPORTS,Jameis Winston Is Even Better Than We Thought,Jordan Schultz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jameis-winston-better-than-we-thought_us_56534f00e4b0879a5b0bc27c,The former No. 1 overall pick is flashing record-setting greatness.,2015-11-23,"Jameis Winston throws a pass in the fourth quarter against the New York Giants on Nov. 8, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5653628b1b0000270029e6b7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Jameis Winston's NFL debut for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in September admittedly went less than swimmingly.Against Tennessee in Week 1, the polarizing No. 1 overall pick was hit, battered and confused. Despite tossing two touchdowns, Winston amassed a woeful quarterback rating: under seven. He threw two interceptions -- his first pass was a pick-six -- and completed a wretched 48.5 percent of his passes.Making matters worse was the fact that the Titans' Marcus Mariota, selected second behind Winston in the draft, was downright sensational, tying the NFL rookie debut record with four touchdown passes in the first half en route to a perfect 158.3 passer rating. But Winston, as he tends to do, stayed above water even under the most dire of circumstances. ""I believe we're going to bounce back,"" he said following the Buccaneers' 42-14 defeat. ""That's what we'll do. ... It's not the end of the world.""To be sure, the rookie was true to his word. Despite a makeshift offensive line with two new additions, both of whom are rookies, Winston has largely been able to avoid the rush and stay away from the typically egregious errors we see from young signal callers.With only two interceptions since Week 4 to go along with 19 total touchdowns (15 passing), Winston is among the best in pro football. And just as was the case during his Florida State days, Winston isn't merely dinking and ducking his way down the field, throwing short, non-risky passes. His 7.66 yards per pass attempt rank him ninth in the league. And, on the road in Philadelphia on Sunday, the 21-year-old tied the league's all-time rookie record with five touchdown passes.One of the crucial questions about Winston during the entire draft process -- and even during his Heisman-winning collegiate days -- was his maturity, or lack thereof. Was this a guy a team could legitimately build its franchise around? Was this a guy who would show up and lead -- even when it wasn't convenient, when he was struggling and losses were piling up?We often hear coaches talk about how even the most talented of players may be able to fool the fans or even the coaching staff, but can't ever fool his teammates. Those are the guys who see it everyday, and in reality, they're really the only people that matter. To that point, Winston's youth hasn't been a liability -- at least, not yet -- and his teammates believe in him as a result.""We are watching a young quarterback grow before our eyes,"" second-year wide receiver Mike Evans -- a rising star in his own right -- said after the Buccaneers' dominant win over Philly. ""He is a hard worker, fun to be around and has great leadership. And it shows every day, on and off the field.""Now Tampa is on a quest to end its eight-year playoff drought. After the team's shocking Week 8 overtime win in Atlanta to improve its record to 5-5, head coach Lovie Smith said of his quarterback: ""He is going to be our leader. He's not a captain yet. But he is in that role.""And that's just the thing. It's easy to lead when you're winning. It's convenient. Everyone is happy, meetings are fun and guys want to work.Winston, on the other hand, debuted with the Buccaneers as they lost three of their first four games, the last of which culminated in a four-interception outing. For someone who won a national championship and became the only quarterback in college football to win his first 26 starts since the 1964-65 season, Winston has handled himself and his newfound leadership role brilliantly.Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com"" target=""_hplink"">jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com"
12,MEDIA,Here's Why It Seems Like Donald Trump Never Tells The Truth,Nick Wing,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-factcheck_us_565374b4e4b0d4093a58bf19,"A fact checker finds 74 percent of his biggest claims are false, and none are entirely true.",2015-11-23,"He Called Latino Immigrants ""Criminals"" And ""Rapists""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55e0e21714000077002e4580.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Facts are not Donald Trump's strong suit, according to an independent analysis of the billionaire reality TV show host's most controversial statements.That conclusion might not exactly surprise anyone who's followed the narrative of Trump's campaign, which has kept him atop the polls with a heavy dose of anti-immigrant flame-throwing and overt xenophobia. But over at PolitiFact, a project run by the Tampa Bay Times, Trump's rhetoric looks more than just a bit dishonest.With zero ""true"" rulings, Trump's most accurate statements have been those rated ""mostly true"" -- like the time he attacked GOP primary rival and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for having ""the worst voting record there is today."" Rubio has missed a large number of Senate votes since announcing his presidential run and has faced criticism from other GOP candidates over his absenteeism.Trump's most absurd statements have been rated ""pants on fire,"" and include his recent claim that he watched ""thousands and thousands"" of people in New Jersey -- mostly Arabs, he said -- cheering as the Twin Towers collapsed on Sept. 11. There is no evidence that this ever happened, but Trump has used this supposed account to support his calls for shutting down certain mosques and even possibly registering American Muslims in a database.Over the weekend, Trump also shared a conservative meme about crime rates in the black community, which incorrectly suggested that black perpetrators were responsible for 81 percent of homicides of white victims. The Federal Bureau of Investigation puts that number at closer to 15 percent. The Crime Statistics Bureau, cited as the source of graphic's data, doesn't actually exist. Another ""pants on fire"" for Trump.In total, 21 percent of the Trump statements judged by PolitiFact have earned ""pants on fire"" grades. On Monday, Trump's habit of just making stuff up led NBC News to call him ""the post-truth 2016 candidate."" Of course, this doesn't mean that Trump has literally never told the truth. But when he says something that sounds like it needs a fact check, it almost always does.Despite Trump's mendacity, another GOP candidate actually takes the top prize for playing fast and loose with the facts, according to PolitiFact. Neurosurgeon Ben Carson similarly has a grand total of zero ""true"" statements checked by PolitiFact. And while 25 percent of Trump's statements are at least ""half true"" or ""mostly true,"" just 17 percent of Carson's meet that mark. PolitiFact has reviewed fewer total statements by Carson, and only three -- or 13 percent -- have been been ruled ""pants on fire.""Democratic candidates also sometimes struggle to tell the truth, according to PolitiFact. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, whose record goes back much further, has earned two ""pants on fire"" ratings, including for her notorious 2008 claim that she came ""under sniper fire"" in Bosnia in 1996. But 71 percent of the Clinton statements checked by PolitiFact have earned ratings of at least ""half true."" Twenty-eight percent have been deemed ""true.""Meanwhile, Clinton's primary opponent, independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, has zero ""pants on fire"" ratings from PolitiFact. Seventy-two percent of his statements have gotten ratings of at least ""half true"" -- and 17 percent have been deemed ""true"" -- while 28 percent have been ranked ""mostly false"" or ""false."""
13,ENTERTAINMENT,Should These NYC Subway Seats Be Covered In Nazi Flags Right Now?

A representative from Amazon shared the following statement with The Huffington Post:Amazon Studios creates high-quality, provocative programming that spurs conversation. The Man in the High Castle, based on an acclaimed novel, explores the impact to our freedoms if we had lost World War II. Like Transparent and the movie Chi-Raq, stories that society cares about often touch on important, thought-provoking topics. We will continue to bring this kind of storytelling to our customers.PREVIOUSLY: Select New York City subway cars are currently wrapped with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority-sanctioned insignia of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. On purpose.The stunt is part of an ad campaign by Amazon to promote awareness of its new streaming series, ""The Man in the High Castle,"" which reimagines a future where Nazi Germany emerged victorious from World War II.The show is very good, according to reviews. The ads are ... questionable.""Man in the High Castle"" is based very loosely on a 1962 novel by Philip K. Dick. The new series, which landed on Amazon's streaming service Nov. 20, has been praised for the depth of the creators' imagined world, with Nazi mottos and symbols peppered with thoughtful care throughout even mundane scenes. For a seemingly contentious show, the subway cars' smack-in-your-face quality is a strange fit. An MTA representative confirmed to Gothamist that the ads -- spotted on 42nd street shuttles -- were approved and conform to the organization's advertising guidelines. Response on Twitter has been disapproving.So, is this OK? Is an impossible-to-ignore reminder of a horrific period of assault on human rights disrespectful to the city's large Jewish population? Is it worth the uptick in traffic on one company's website?Also on HuffPost:"
14,POLITICS,Senator Pushes For $600 Million Response To Heroin Epidemic,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeanne-shaheen-heroin-congress_us_5652744be4b0258edb31f21e,"""The opioid crisis is spiraling out of control.""",2015-11-23,New Hampshire's senior senator is introducing a robust response to heroin and opioid abuse.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/565276e52100004a005ab621.jpeg?ops=crop_89_183_1941_968%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"The senior senator from one of the states hit hardest by heroin and opioid abuse will call on Monday for Congress to spend $600 million immediately to address and curtail the epidemic.The Opioid and Heroin Epidemic Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, being introduced by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), would spread money to various government agencies tasked with research, intervention and recovery. It is the most robust legislative response yet to what Shaheen and others deem a “national public health emergency.”“The opioid crisis is spiraling out of control,” Shaheen said in a statement. “This should be an all-hands-on-deck moment, not just for New Hampshire, but for our country. We are losing lives daily and our first responders, healthcare providers and criminal justice system are overwhelmed. To stem the tide, we urgently need additional funding for prevention, treatment and recovery efforts, and this legislation would provide resources to those on the frontlines.”The specifics of the bill, which were shared with The Huffington Post, make clear that Shaheen doesn’t view the fight against the epidemic strictly through a law-and-order lens. The Department of Justice would receive $200 million to fund local and state programs related to law enforcement as well as prevention and education. But the biggest tranche of funding, $250 million, would be devoted to the Department of Health and Human Services to support state programs related to prevention, treatment and recovery.Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institute on Drug Abuse would receive $50 million and $35 million, respectively, to monitor prescription drug programs and do targeted research on drug addiction. Other money would be set aside for community service programs, school safety measures and local law enforcement agencies in areas with heavy addiction levels.As a whole, the $600 million would represent a major investment toward battling a growing epidemic. (Other bills have called for less costly measures, such as creating interagency task forces, advancing alternative treatments or focusing specifically on mothers and newborns.) And as an emergency supplemental, the money in Shaheen’s bill would not have to be offset with cuts elsewhere. According to CDC data, heroin use has more than doubled among adults ages 18 to 25 in the past decade, while 45 percent of people who use the drug are also addicted to prescription opioid painkillers. Each day, according to Shaheen’s office, 120 Americans die of a drug overdose. The problem has been particularly acute in New Hampshire, where heroin deaths surpassed highway fatalities earlier this year. In the state’s largest city, Manchester, there were 79 heroin and opioid-related deaths and 653 overdose-related emergency calls this year, as of mid-November. According to the city’s fire department, that is already well more than double the 300 calls from the prior year. Last week, a group of activist New Hampshire mothers affected by the crisis, including Kriss Blevens, a makeup artist for the presidential candidates swinging through the state, launched a petition encouraging HHS to declare a public health emergency.“This important designation will allow our government to immediately begin deploying resources to New Hampshire and other states in the grips of this epidemic,” the petition read. “We now know that Substance Abuse Disorder is a disease with widespread suffering and fatalities and is progressing at a rapid and unanticipated rate. This is a disease that can be treated through detoxification, abstinence and long-term recovery support. To stem this tide, we need the full breadth and depth of our government’s capacity to respond in times of crisis.”Also on HuffPost:"
