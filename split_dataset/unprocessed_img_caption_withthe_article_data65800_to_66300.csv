0,POLITICS,Republicans Start To Acknowledge They Might Face Bernie Sanders,Amanda Terkel and Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-iowa-caucuses_us_56b02cb9e4b0b8d7c230691d,It's a major shift.,2016-02-02,Republicans are now starting to treat Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) as a potential threat.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_0_301_5097_2777%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"The GOP field has rarely acknowledged any Democratic presidential candidate besides Hillary Clinton, expecting that she will be their opponent in November. That started to change Monday night.""If Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton get elected -- if they were to win, we would be a great nation in decline. ... We will defeat Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders or whoever they nominate,"" Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) told supporters after his third-place finish in the Iowa caucuses. ""We will go on to easily beat Hillary or Bernie or whoever the hell they throw up there,"" Donald Trump, the second-place finisher, added in his speech later in the night.Sure, both the Republican candidates were bashing Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). But that shows they are now seeing him as a potential competitor in the general election. Both men made their remarks as Sanders and Clinton were locked in a close battle, with the results still too close to call. In the last Republican debate, Sanders' name came up only briefly, in a mention by Rubio.""It better not be Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders is a socialist. I think Bernie Sanders is a good candidate for president of Sweden,"" Rubio said. Clinton, meanwhile, came up over and over again -- as she always does. Republicans have consistently focused their attacks on her, even running TV ads against the former secretary of state. Sanders has a considerable lead in polls for the New Hampshire primary, which is taking place on Feb. 9. And if he continues to gain momentum, he will likely face more and more attacks from Republicans.Sanders, for his part, was thrilled with the results Monday night.""Nine months ago, we came to this beautiful state. We had no political organization, we had no money, we had no name recognition and we were taking on the most powerful political organization in the United States of America,"" Sanders said to a raucous crowd of supporters. ""And tonight, while the results are still not known, it looks like we are in a virtual tie ... [and] we'll have about half of the Iowa delegates.""Also on HuffPost:"
1,POLITICS,Jeb! Comeback Watch: Former AIG Failure To The Rescue,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeb-comeback-watch-hank-greenberg_us_56afef58e4b09214b14f5062,Hank Greenberg is doubling down on his Jeb bets. What could go wrong?,2016-02-02,"Former AIG chief executive Maurice ""Hank"" Greenberg donated $10 million to Jeb Bush's super PAC this quarter, for some reason",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For a few months now, Jeb Bush's campaign has been insisting that the Jeb! Comeback is on, and that the media should get in on the ground floor of this amazing narrative. Tonight we'll find out if he's got anywhere to go after the Iowa Caucuses. Here's how the comeback is going.Tonight, Jeb Bush finds out what fate the voters of Iowa have in store for him. And if his New Hampshire travel itinerary is any indication, it looks like he reckons he'd better write off the Iowa caucuses and build his beachhead in the Granite State. These are pretty dismal times for the candidate who thought winning the nomination simply required him to build an army of big-dollar donors -- the theory being that he could ""shock and awe"" the rest of the field into surrendering as soon as those old Bush Pioneers were mobilized.Why Bush thought this was possible in this age of goofy billionaires bankrolling pet candidates is anybody's guess. What seems a lot more certain is that the largesse of his high-rolling connections has all but dried up. According to the most recent round of financial disclosures, the cash flowing into the coffers of Jeb's super PAC has slowed considerably -- the last quarter saw them raising just a shade over $15 million.And that total is only as high as it is because one donor in particular doesn't have the Bush candidacy properly marked-to-market. Per Mother Jones:In July, when the super-PAC's first-half numbers were released, we counted at least 23 donors who gave $1 million or more to Right to Rise. This time, there was just one donor who gave more than $500,000—former AIG chairman and CEO, Hank Greenberg, who donated a whopping $10 million.Greenberg is widely credited with greenlighting AIG's conversion from a major insurance company to a credit-default swap engine that made trillions of dollars in one-directional, wrong-way bets on the housing market.Although Greenberg had been ousted from power by the time the company got its federal bailout, he literally sued the government claiming that it was treated unfairly by the rescue process. Now, he's giving Jeb Bush's super PAC $10 million to set on fire. Hank Greenberg: smart with money.This has been the Jeb! Comeback Watch for Feb. 1. Jeb Bush is currently in fifth place in Iowa (3.9 percent), fifth place in New Hampshire (8.6 percent) and fifth place nationally (5.6 percent)."

Raul Labrador (R-Idaho) told The Huffington Post Monday night. ""This is the Boehner budget.""At the end of October, as one of the last acts of John Boehner's speakership, Democrats and Republicans agreed to a new fiscal 2017 number roughly $30 billion above the topline spending cap set under sequestration.That budget in October passed with the support of 91 Republicans and all but two Democrats, meaning 152 Republicans voted against that legislation. And if you listen to Labrador, that vote doesn't portend well for adopting that budget number this year.""Everybody who voted against the budget has a problem with turning around and voting for the budget,"" Labrador said.Conservatives have been pushing leadership to go back on the October budget agreement to adopt the lower number set under sequestration in 2011. And while Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told Budget Committee members in January that ""the number is the number,"" according to a senior GOP aide, Freedom Caucus members simply don't buy it.""Can I support the Boehner budget?"" HFC member Tim Huelskamp asked Monday. ""Absolutely not! We just kicked him out as speaker.""Huelskamp repeated a common line Monday night -- that the budget is ""in trouble"" -- and he said GOP leadership already didn't have many votes to spare. So what does leadership do now?""They'll probably head over to Nancy, I guess,"" Huelskamp said, referring to Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).""They won't vote for the budget,"" Huelskamp said of Democrats, ""but will they vote for a resolution to deem the number they voted for last fall?""Asked about that possibility Monday night, Ryan's office said they had no further comment beyond what they told HuffPost last week, that members want to get back to a regular order appropriations process, that the budget is an important first step to achieving that goal, and that ""the best path ahead"" would be determined in the coming weeks.But Freedom Caucus members don't seem to buy Ryan's argument that a budget will make a difference on the appropriations process.""Let's do the appropriations at the lower number,"" Labrador said.""Isn't that how it's supposed to work,"" Labrador continued. ""We can vote bills out of the House, and the Senate votes bills out of the Senate. I don't know, maybe something in the Constitution talks about that?"" Labrador said sarcastically, adding that he ""may be confused though.""Yet another HFC member, Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), was a little more sympathetic to Ryan's argument. ""I understand it,"" he said. ""I just wish we didn't have so many examples of the Senate just absolutely thumbing their nose at us when it comes to the appropriations process. If there was any credibility on the other side of the building, that argument might carry a lot more weight.""But with so much doubt that the Senate will take up appropriations bills, with doubt that they'll even pass their own budget, conservatives don't seem to think it makes much sense for Republicans to vote for a blueprint with more spending -- especially in light of new baselines from the Congressional Budget Office that show growing deficits.It's those baselines which had already given GOP leadership a difficult challenge. To get the budget to balance in 10 years, which has traditionally been the Republican goal, it was going to take drastic cuts to popular programs -- something many vulnerable Republicans aren't ecstatic to do in an election year. And, on the other side, defense hawks could look at the budget as an opportunity to advocate for more money for the Overseas Contingency Fund, as they did last year.The truth is the budget was already in trouble before conservatives ever started making problems. And if leadership figures out that there's no coalition of 218 Republican votes, they may start to see the conservative insurrection as a blessing.On Monday night, as Labrador slammed the spending document, Budget Chairman Tom Price (R-Ga.) walked by Tortilla Coast, holding a pile of dry-cleaned shirts. Labrador looked at Price. Price looked at Labrador. And the two congressmen waved at each other.Also on HuffPost:"

According to The New York Times, Davidson was allegedly fired for ""making disparaging comments about senior campaign leaders to third parties and breaking a nondisclosure clause in her employment contract."" Davidson, however, denies saying anything negative about campaign leaders to the media.The 26-year-old was fired the day after a New York Times article was published which criticized Trump's campaign leadership and quoted Davidson during a Jan. 9 campaign rally as she tried to enlist volunteers.

Davidson added that when she and another female volunteer met Trump for the first time last summer, he said to them: ""'You guys could do a lot of damage,' referring to their looks.""A full copy of the discrimination complaint, obtained by ThinkProgress, also states that Davidson has ""suffered lost wages, mental anguish and damage to [her] career."" The Huffington Post reached out to Trump and Davidson's attorney but did not hear back by the time of publication. Davidson was classified as a part-time staffer because she also worked as a paralegal. She was paid $2,000 a month, while several other male field organizers for Trump's campaign were paid between $3,500 and $4,000 a month, according to public records. Some of these male staffers were also part-time. Trump told The New York Times on Jan. 31, that he never met Davidson but “my people tell me she did a terrible job.” He also denied making the ""you guys could do a lot of damage"" remark and said, ""That is not the worst thing that could be said, but I never said it. It's not in my vocabulary.""Trump did not acknowledge Davidson's other allegations of unequal pay and sexist discrimination within his campaign. Davidson's lawyer Dorothy O’Brien told ThinkProgress: “Davidson's a very intelligent, capable young woman who worked her heart out for the Trump campaign. And they treated her badly.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) pulled off an upset win in Iowa over not only Donald Trump but also the polls, which almost universally showed him behind….Monday's voting brought both record turnout and a victory for Cruz….This year, surveys of the Republican race overstated Trump's ability to turn out voters. While Trump voters were deeply certain of their support, many were only loosely attached to their party, and unfamiliar with caucusing. Compared to Cruz supporters, Trump voters were less likely to have previous caucus experience and more likely to say they planned to show up alone….The record turnout included occasional voters who supported Trump's rivals, but not enough of the new voters he needed to win, Monmouth University pollster Patrick Murray said in an email….Cruz's underlying strengths, meanwhile, shone through on nearly every measure but the horse race, according to the final Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics poll. Cruz was considered more knowledgeable, more internationally respected and more likable, and won in a one-on-one matchup against Trump.” [HuffPost]Late-deciding voters and momentum favored Cruz and Rubio - Philip Bump and Scott Clement: “Nearly half of Republican caucus-goers report making their final decision in the week before the caucuses, and the entrance poll shows Rubio performed best among this group. Nearly 3 in 10 of final-week deciders supported Rubio; he garnered about as much support among those deciding in January, but only about 1 in 10 of those who decided earlier than that backed Rubio. Equally stark was Trump’s weakness among late-deciding voters. Just 14 percent of Republicans who decided in the final week supported Trump, compared with 23 percent of those who decided earlier in January and 40 percent who made their decision in December or earlier.” [WashPost]Some patterns in Iowa polling misses - Justin Sink: “Pollsters were nervous entering Monday’s contest in Iowa because the Republican field featured elements that have tripped up past surveys: a large group of candidates and an unorthodox frontrunner whose support was largely rooted in voters who hadn’t previously participated in the caucuses. Cruz’s surprise victory was actually in line with some past polling misses. Polls conducted by the Register in 1988, 1996, and 2012 all significantly underestimated the candidate who would earn the backing of evangelical voters -- the very group that appeared to have pushed the Texas senator to victory.” [Bloomberg]Pollsters take to Twitter to express their thoughts on Iowa's outcome.DEMOCRATIC RACE IS STILL TOO CLOSE TO CALL, BUT POLLS FARED BETTER - Steven Shepard: “The tied race between Clinton and Bernie Sanders represents their standing in state delegate equivalent, not raw vote count. The best estimate of raw vote, at this point, is the Democratic entrance poll, which shows Clinton leading by about 3 percentage points. So why is she tied with Sanders in the results? That’s likely because of former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, who ended his campaign Monday night after failing to earn even 1 percent of state delegate equivalents. But the entrance poll indicates O’Malley won about 3 percent of the vote – suggesting that O’Malley was not viable in many precincts, and many of his supporters chose Sanders in a second round of voting.” [Politico]Clinton leads, but by a razor-thin margin - Vote tallies as of this publication show Clinton taking 49.9 percent to Sanders’ 49.6 percent with 99 percent of precincts reporting.

Those who say health care is the most important issue facing the country also largely went for Clinton, as did those over the age of 65….Looking at Sanders' supporters, we see different segments of Democratic voters in Iowa. Young voters went for Sanders overwhelmingly, and he was supported by 83% of voters who value honesty and trustworthiness most in a candidate. Sanders won 61% of the support among those who think income inequality is the top issue facing the country, and 58% of those who identified as very liberal. Sanders also received considerable support from first-time caucus-goers and those who say they want the next president to have more liberal policies than the Obama administration. [NBC]WHAT’S NEXT?

But that's what Larry Fink, chairman and CEO of Blackrock, which manages $4.6 trillion, is doing.Fink sent a letter to every CEO of every company in the Standard & Poor's 500, telling them to stop giving estimates of how much they will earn every quarter. Companies would still report earnings every quarter as required by the Securities and Exchange Commission, but they wouldn't release estimates of those earnings to investors ahead of time.Fink's reasoning: Giving out that information pushes investors to further focus on the ups and downs of that three-month reporting cycle, which in turn pushes executives whose pay is increasingly tied to stock performance to run their businesses to meet short-term demands.Those short-term demands, according to Fink, distract from long-term strategy and keep companies from making investments like research and development.Fink wants to change that dynamic. In the letter, which was not released publicly but was obtained by The Huffington Post, he writes that ""today’s culture of quarterly earnings hysteria is totally contrary to the long-term approach we need. To be clear, we do believe companies should still report quarterly results -- 'long-termism' should not be a substitute for transparency -- but CEOs should be more focused in these reports on demonstrating progress against their strategic plans than a one-penny deviation from their [earnings-per-share] targets or analyst consensus estimates.""BlackRock declined to comment.Fink is not new to this debate. He's long advocated that investors take a long-term approach. And he's not alone: His letter coincided with a private meeting of corporate executives, including JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and legendary investor Warren Buffett, to discuss how to improve corporate governance in a way that encourages long-term planning.Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has made attacking what she calls ""quarterly capitalism"" a key part of her financial reform agenda and wants to cut long-term capital gains taxes relative to short-term rates. Corporate lawyer extraordinaire Martin Lipton and management consulting behemoth McKinsey have also weighed in against short-termism -- and it should be noted they were speaking out in support of their corporate clients.The business case for Fink's campaign against short-termism is less obvious. If information is the fuel that powers the market, Fink may be betting that his firm, with unmatched research resources, doesn't need companies to release earnings estimates because his teams can generate that information internally.Indeed, a little less public information could give BlackRock even more of a competitive advantage. The focus on short-termism gives more weight to the perspective of corporate managers over public markets, and BlackRock is in a position to gauge and influence that perspective. (Fink's letter is itself partial evidence of that.)But the most important issue with Fink's letter is not that it may be partially self-interested. It's that it doesn't go far enough. If you really want to deal with short-term financial planning, the most effective solution is not to fiddle with capital gains taxes or ask companies to stop giving earnings estimates.It's to get rid of mandatory quarterly earnings reports altogether, and allow companies to publish financial results once a year if they want to. The U.K. made that shift, and it doesn't seem to have bothered many people.Also on HuffPost:"

Prince Harry, being the nice guy he is, rushed to her aid.

The prince, who has long been a supporter of veterans, came over and not only helped Pollock out, but joked around with her. ""Harry said to me 'What did you do that for?' I said, 'To show you how not to do that,'"" she said, recalling the conversation she had with the royal after she fell, according to The Telegraph.

Ted Cruz of Texas got a favorable decision from the Illinois Board of Elections, which ruled that he met the citizenship criteria to appear on the state's primary ballot.Two objectors, Lawrence Joyce and William Graham, had challenged Cruz's presidential bid with the board, contending that his name should not appear on the March 15 ballot because his candidacy did not comply with Article II of the Constitution.Adopting the recommendations of a hearing officer who considered the matter last week, the board of elections on Monday rejected both objections, ruled Cruz eligible and ordered that his name be certified for the election.""The Candidate is a natural born citizen by virtue of being born in Canada to his mother who was a U.S. citizen at the time of his birth,"" the board said, reasoning that Cruz met the criteria because he ""did not have to take any steps or go through a naturalization process at some point after birth.""Both objections, which on their face seemed to carry little weight, had forced lawyers for Cruz to formally respond and offer appropriate counterarguments.In response to the filings, Cruz's lawyers relied on Supreme Court precedent, legal history and articles from noted constitutional scholars to defend the view that he is in fact ""natural born"" within the meaning of the Constitution.The lawyers also pointed to the valid candidacies of two former Republican hopefuls, Sen. John McCain of Arizona and former Michigan Gov. George Romney, as examples of presidential runs that received the blessing of Congress, courts and other means to proceed, despite the fact that both men were born abroad and raised eligibility questions.These and other sources of authority, the lawyers said, ""all command the same conclusion"" that Cruz complies with the ""natural born"" requirement.Agenda minutes for the Illinois Board of Elections -- which include its determinations in the two challenges to Cruz's eligibility plus a separate one Graham filed against Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) -- can be found here.Reached by phone on Tuesday, Joyce -- who is listed as an attorney in Illinois but doesn't actively practice law -- told The Huffington Post he's not planning an appeal of the board's determination due to lack of resources. He said, however, that he hopes ""somebody else takes up the cause"" against Cruz.A deafening birther debate over whether Cruz satisfied the constitutional standard for the presidency emerged in the months leading up to Monday's Iowa caucus -- fueled in large part by attacks from fellow Republican candidate Donald Trump, who wouldn't let up mere days before voting began.As if addressing the magnate directly, the Illinois Board of Elections was conclusive in its findings: ""Further discussion on this issue is unnecessary.""But a New Hampshire ballot commission in January was a little more tentative.In rejecting a similar challenge to Cruz's eligibility to appear on the ballot for the state primary, which is scheduled for next week, the commission recognized that a suitable court should settle the matter -- ""so that all election officials and the American people know once and for all the definition of 'natural born citizen.'""That, the commission said, ""would be helpful in avoiding uncertainty.""H/T Excess of Democracy blog"

The hallowed awards show has become a focal point in the call for true diversity across the entertainment industry. On Monday night, producer and actress America Ferrera weighed in on what influencers need to do to fix the problem.Ferrera, during a talk with Gloria Steinem on the opening night of the 2016 MAKERS conference, called for ""multi-pronged solutions"" that address the entire Hollywood pipeline -- from idea inception to the Academy Awards. ""You have this group of people, who is largely old, white men, deciding what is going to be deemed good, valuable, watchable, interesting, worth your time -- that is a problem and that should be dealt with,"" said Ferrera. ""[But] it starts all the way back with, whose stories are we telling? Whose stories are we supporting? How do we get more diverse voices to join an industry that seems so unfriendly to them? The playing field isn’t level and equal.""The ""Superstore"" star suggested that influencers need to use their time and resources to seek out and lift up creative voices who don't already have the resources to get their foot in the door:At the moment, both in TV in film, the voices of young and diverse and unique storytellers are not being given the support they need to get into the room. For me, as a producer, that is something I strongly believe. We have to be reaching out and giving a helping hand to people who have the unique stories. The men who’ve been running the studios for years don’t know how to tell the stories we want to see about ourselves.But, as Ferrera pointed out, the fight can't stop at inclusion of people of color in Hollywood. Solidarity across social movements is absolutely key if there's any hope of creating a more equitable society on a larger scale. ""Something I’ve been thinking about a lot lately is all these different little fights for social justice happening: Black Lives Matter, diversity in Hollywood, women's representation in Congress and business,"" said Ferrera, ""and I can’t help but get frustrated at how siloed our energies are.""Because, ultimately, the fight for racial equality and gender equality are inextricably linked. Ferrera rounded out her comments with a rousing call to action:We’re all fighting for social justice, we’re all fighting to be seen as human beings even if we’re not white men... How do we come together? How do we say the fight for diversity in movies and television is not a black and white thing? It’s a black thing. It’s a woman thing. It’s a Latino thing. It’s an Asian thing. It’s a Native American thing. It’s all the rest of us. It’s no surprise that the best thing to be in this country is white and male. So what about all the rest of us? And instead of sectioning our energies, how do we harness our energy? How do we come together and say, we’re all fighting the same fight?Activist squad, unite. Also on HuffPost:"

That charge, for which Keepers faces 20 years to life in prison, follows her previous felony charge of concealing a dead body and a misdemeanor charge of accessory after the fact.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) conducts a Caucus Day rally on Monday in Jefferson, Iowa. Cruz defied the polls to pull off a victory.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56b0339b1f00007f002171e5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) pulled off an upset win in Iowa over not only Donald Trump but also the polls, which almost universally showed him behind.That miscall is a strike against surveys' accuracy, but it doesn't come as a total surprise to most pollsters and political forecasters, who issued their final predictions under a minor avalanche of caveats and hedging.""[T]he uncertainty associated with forecasting tonight’s Iowa Republican caucus is about as high as it gets in a major American election,"" FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver wrote before voting started Monday afternoon.In the runup to the caucus, many analysts predicted that lower turnout would favor Cruz, while an influx of new voters would augur a Trump win. But instead, Monday's voting brought both record turnout and a victory for Cruz.What happened?Part of the uncertainty inherent in the caucuses is due to voters' propensity to make up their mind last-minute. In 2012, Rick Santorum won despite never having led in a poll. A similar last-minute shift could help to explain the better-than-expected numbers for Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). Rubio's numbers ticked up modestly in the final pre-caucus polls of the state, suggesting the start of a rising trend. Preliminary exit polls show Cruz and Rubio significantly outperforming Trump among the 45 percent of voters who decided sometime in the last week.Cruz also benefited from superior campaign organization. Cruz also won nearly a third of those who said they'd been personally contacted by a get-out-the-vote effort, a larger share than any other candidate.""Cruz ground game looks like it came through big time,"" Marist pollster Lee Miringoff said in an email, noting that Trump's decisions to skip the final Republican debate may have backfired.Pollsters may have erred beyond just missing a late-breaking shift. Figuring out whose voters will actually show up is always a challenge for pollsters. That's especially true in races like the Iowa caucus, where interest varies wildly from year to year and only a sliver of eligible voters actually make it out. This year, surveys of the Republican race overstated Trump's ability to turn out voters. While Trump voters were deeply certain of their support, many were only loosely attached to their party, and unfamiliar with caucusing. Compared to Cruz supporters, Trump voters were less likely to have previous caucus experience and more likely to say they planned to show up alone, according to the pollsters at Monmouth University, making them a weaker bet to actually turn out on Election Day.The record turnout included occasional voters who supported Trump's rivals, but not enough of the new voters he needed to win, Monmouth University pollster Patrick Murray said in an email.""Cruz and Rubio actually turned out a lot of 'lapsed' caucus goers who only show up sporadically,"" Murray said. ""That was the key.""Cruz's underlying strengths, meanwhile, shone through on nearly every measure but the horse race, according to the final Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics poll. Cruz was considered more knowledgeable, more internationally respected and more likable, and won in a one-on-one matchup against Trump.“The drill-down shows, if anything, stronger alignment with Cruz than Trump, except for the horse race,” pollster J. Ann Selzer told The Des Moines Register when the survey was released.Turns out, that went for the horse race too."

25,POLITICS,Bernie Sanders Exploits Hillary Clinton's Flaws In A Way Most Republicans Can't,Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-vulnerable_us_56b10ac2e4b0fbfdd6158525,What Iowa revealed about her election prospects -- and what it didn't.,2016-02-02,"Hillary Clinton can't match Bernie Sanders' progressive bona fides, but that wouldn't be a problem in the general election.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56b10f681a00002d00ab1dac.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The tally from the Iowa caucuses shows that Hillary Clinton got more delegates than Bernie Sanders. But nobody outside of Clinton headquarters thinks she won anything. Clinton took 701 “state equivalent delegates” from the caucuses, according to the Iowa Democratic Party, while Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont, took 697. Basically, they tied. The result represents a remarkable achievement for Sanders, who entered the race with virtually no name recognition and who once trailed in the polls by 50 percentage points. It’s also a blow to Clinton, the presumptive front-runner who now faces an extended fight for her party’s nomination, with her liabilities as a candidate on full display.But it's easy to get carried away with results like this -- to assume that votes from supporters of one party, in one unrepresentative state, reveal how the rest of the party will pick a nominee or how the rest of the country will pick a president. In this case, they may not.Most experts think Clinton remains the strong favorite to win the nomination, that she will begin to win contests once the campaign moves past New Hampshire -- and onto states where the electorate is more diverse and less liberal. And while Clinton has some serious vulnerabilities, at least some of those vulnerabilities would matter less in the fall, when she would be running against a conservative rather than a fellow progressive.Within the Democratic primaries, Sanders seems to be a pretty good foil for Clinton. One reason is that he holds the same essential priorities that she does, but can promote himself as more of a true believer. Both favor a higher minimum wage, for example, but he would raise it to $15 an hour while she would bump it to just $12. Both believe in universal health care, but he favors creating a single-payer system while she prefers incremental improvements to the Affordable Care Act. Both want to help families struggling with tuition bills, but Sanders would make college free while Clinton would distribute assistance more selectively and with work requirements. These positions are exactly what liberals, like the kind who dominate the Iowa caucuses, want to hear.In a general election matchup, against a Republican, the contrast would look different. Clinton would be the one arguing for the higher minimum wage, because her opponent would oppose any increase at all. She’d be calling to provide people with more protection from medical bills, while her opponent would be seeking to yank insurance away from millions. She’d be the one talking about helping families with tuition bills, or giving new parents paid leave, while her opponent would be the one promising to slash taxes for the rich.And on all of these issues, she would be closer to the public’s views than the Republican would be. Elections don’t simply turn on policy positions, of course, and Sanders' agenda is not the only reason he’s made such inroads with Democratic voters. Like Donald Trump in the GOP primaries, Sanders has mastered the “meta-message” -- conveying, through his affect and willingness to pick fights, that he is a champion of the little guy and scourge of the elites. Clinton, a creature of Washington who abides by its political conventions, cannot pull that off. That really could hurt her in the general election. But all candidates have liabilities and the Republicans, unlike Clinton, seem to be acquiring new ones. Thanks to Iowa, the GOP contest is shaping up as a three-way race, pitting Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (who won Iowa) against Trump (who came in second) and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (who finished third). The GOP establishment is celebrating the strong showing from Rubio, the supposed moderate and most electable of the three. But to survive politically, Rubio has disavowed his earlier support for immigration reform, vowed to appoint Supreme Court justices that would roll back same-sex marriage, and taken a position on abortion -- no exceptions for rape and incest -- that puts him to the extreme right even of the GOP field.Exit polls showed a sharp generational divide among caucus-goers. Clinton's big weakness, as HuffPost's Zach Carter notes, was among young voters -- and the margins were lopsided, with Sanders winning 84 percent of voters ages 17 through 24. But Rubio’s positions on immigration and same-sex marriage, which Cruz and Trump more or less share, would be positively toxic in this generation. In other words, the college students who stood up for Bernie in Iowa caucus halls last night probably won’t hesitate to pull Clinton’s lever in the fall. Throw in the support Clinton is likely to get from African-Americans and Latinos, two groups that hold her in high regard, as well as her very real assets as a candidate and potential president, and suddenly it’s easy to remember why so many people thought she was formidable in the first place.It’s still possible that Clinton could lose to Sanders, who has his own skills as a campaigner and whose position on certain issues, like trade, might even win over some Republicans. It's also possible Clinton could lose a general election matchup to Rubio -- or to Cruz or even to Trump. The U.S. electorate is sharply divided, after all. The economy is creating jobs, but a majority of people think the country is headed in the wrong direction. It wouldn’t take much to tip the final result one way or another.But the candidates in one party are getting weaker as the nomination contest unfolds and it’s not the Democrats. If anything, a hard-fought, substantive contest between Sanders and Clinton might actually make better campaigners out of them both, leaving the party with a candidate in a strong position to win this fall."

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) says he doesn't listen to hip hop and rap as much as he used to since it's inappropriate for his young children to hear.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56b129e51f00000d01217355.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio says Hollywood has ""bigger problems"" than trying to create more opportunities for people of color.Asked by CNN on Tuesday to weigh in on the controversy surrounding this year's Academy Awards, in which all 20 nominated actors are white, the Florida senator admitted that because of his busy campaign schedule, he was not up to date on the issue, dubbed #OscarsSoWhite.“I don’t know, what does that mean?” Rubio asked.Rubio argued instead that the larger issue in the entertainment industry concerns the values that it promotes.“Hollywood has bigger problems than that,” he said. “I think the bigger problem with Hollywood is the values they are trying to ram down our kids’ throats and how hard it’s made it on parents.""Rubio has frequently cited his love of hip hop and rap as evidence of his relative youth compared to some of his competitors. Some of his favorite artists include Eminem, Tupac, Nicki Minaj, Pitbull and N.W.A. -- the latter group the subject of ""Straight Outta Compton,"" a movie whose lack of Oscar acting nominations was cited by many critics as an example of the awards' overwhelming whiteness.But on Tuesday, Rubio said he no longer listens to those artists very much because the lyrics are inappropriate for his children.""Over the last couple of years I’ve gotten really into electronic dance music, so Avicii and Calvin Harris,” he said. “The lyrics are clean, so I can listen to it in front of my kids without worrying about it.”Republicans often turn to values-based arguments to criticize pop culture. Last year, GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson, the only black candidate in either party, accused ""the hip-hop community"" of damaging the black community.This year's #OscarsSoWhite controversy created a wave of protest against the awards, particularly given that it was the second consecutive year they featured all-white acting nominees. In response, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which awards the Oscars, revised some of its membership procedures and voting rules, and announced an initiative that would double the number of women and minorities in the Academy by the year 2020.Critics have noted that the controversy reflects a larger problem in the entertainment industry: a lack of opportunities for people of color, both in front of and behind the camera.One culprit? The people who determine which movies get made are overwhelmingly white and male. A UCLA study of diversity in Hollywood noted that in 2013, a whopping 92 percent of studio executives and 94 percent of senior management, such as producers, were white.In addition, most major movies do not feature actors of color. Scholars at the University of Southern California analyzed 700 popular movies released between 2007 and 2014, and discovered that about 75.2 percent of speaking roles were filled by white actors.Addressing the issue last week, President Barack Obama told reporters that it represents a broader problem in society.""Are we making sure that everybody is getting a fair shot?"" he said. ""Look for talent and provide opportunity to everybody.""Also on HuffPost:"

But the five-second rule is actually a real thing when the item and the surface it falls onto are dry, according to the Discovery Science Channel's ""The Quick and the Curious"" show.As an experiment, NASA engineer Mike Meacham offered up cookies to strangers in a park. He then dropped the sweet treats onto the ground. Only one man ate the gift, to the annoyance of the woman he was with.The show's narrator said he'll be alright, though. That's because although small amounts of bacteria do hop onto food as soon as it hits the ground, the problems only really begin when the food and the surface are wet.""Moist foods left longer than 30 seconds collect 10 times the bacteria than those snapped up after only three,"" the narrator said.""E-coli, salmonella and listeria love wet environments.

Rick Snyder (R) to testify.""No one should have to worry about the water that their kids will drink,"" said House Democratic Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra (Calif.). ""While I know we are having a hearing here in Congress, we hope that this Congress will probe deeply into what's going on in Flint.""Becerra said he hopes ""heads will roll"" and that those responsible will be prosecuted. One of the first things Congress should do, he added, is bring Snyder before lawmakers to explain how the state and local government ""allowed families, including children, for months to drink contaminated water.""House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) joined the chorus, saying there is ""no doubt"" Snyder is ""culpable"" and that he hopes to see more ""empathy"" from members of Congress. Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.), vice chairman of the caucus, piled on, calling on Republicans to open a special committee to investigate the water crisis, such as the groups Republicans established to look into the Benghazi, Libya, terrorist attack and videos attacking Planned Parenthood.""We had a select committee based on a fabricated video,"" Crowley said. ""Where is the public outcry here in Washington to create a select committee to focus on what took place in Flint, how it happened, why it happened, and who is responsible?""A spokesman for the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which is holding the hearing on Flint this week, defended Snyder's absence, saying ""the state of Michigan is conducting its own investigation.""Crowley doesn't see it that way.""I think they bankrupted their ability to investigate themselves,"" Crowley told reporters on Tuesday. ""They need the federal government. The people of Michigan need the federal government -- someone else to come in and investigate and find out how this could have happened and bring those responsible to justice.""But the federal government isn't completely blameless when it comes to Flint either. The Environmental Protection Agency downplayed a memo from one of its officials that detailed a preliminary investigation into lead levels. And the EPA's Midwest administrator, Susan Hedman, resigned late last month amid the fallout. A few weeks prior, Hedman had told The Huffington Post that the EPA kept quiet about the memo because it included information identifying a private citizen whose children had been exposed to high lead levels.In the Senate, however, Republicans pushed back on Tuesday.Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) countered that Democrats shouldn't ""put the cart ahead of the horse"" and let ""local and state government address what is a local and state problem.""Senate Democrats proposed an amendment to the energy bill currently on the chamber floor that would provide as much as $400 million in federal emergency funding to help Flint fix or replace its water supply infrastructure. An agreement has yet to be reached on whether Republican leadership will allow a vote on the amendment. This post has been updated with information about the Senate's plans.Related on HuffPost:"

Not the classic romances you had in mind?""I’m a sucker for romantic stories coming from places you don’t expect,"" artist Nan Lawson told The Huffington Post in an email. Her new solo show at Gallery1988 in Los Angeles was, she explained, inspired by its proximity to Valentine's Day. ""I immediately thought ... how fun it would be to do an entire series of couples,"" she said.The show is titled ""Meet Cute,"" after the term used to denote a fictional scene from film or television, in which the two parts of a fated romantic duo meet for the first time."" Lawson's pop culture-inspired portraits, created digitally using a Wacom Cintiq tablet, arise out of her desire to tap into a shared excitement about pop obsessions like the meet cute and more.""There is something so satisfying about creating portraits of characters that people will recognize,"" she told HuffPost. ""Because when they do recognize them, their faces light up! They love these characters so much.""Though these couples, depicted in Lawson's distinctive manga-inflected, soft-hued style, will inspire cries of recognition from geeks, their poses aren't traditional romantic ones or scenes pulled from the source material. Instead, each pair floats back to back, their bodies slightly mingling transparently, like human Venn diagrams.""I love the idea of two characters overlapping one another as if they are two parts to one whole, like there is a certain symbiosis to being part of a pair,"" explained Lawson. ""It’s ... like they are facing the world together.""There's nothing more romantic than that.Catch Lawson's full show at Gallery1988 (East) in Los Angeles from Jan. 29 through Feb. 13.Also on HuffPost:"
