Even though Republicans opposed getting rid of the filibuster when Democrats controlled the Senate, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said the party should do so now.""I don’t think going nuclear when you have 57 percent of the Senate voted for the Collins amendment that would take away the president's action,"" McCarthy said on NBC's ""Meet The Press,"" referring to the amendment introduced by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) that would not fund the president's recently announced executive actions on immigration, but would leave in place the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.""That's not nuclear, when 57 percent of the American representation says it's wrong. That's not in the Constitution,"" McCarthy said. ""I think they should change the rules.""Current Senate rules allow senators to stymie votes on legislation unless 60 members of the upper chamber support it. Democrats eliminated the filibuster for executive office and federal court nominations, except for the Supreme Court, in 2013. The process requiring a 60-vote threshold remains in place for votes on legislation, but House Republicans have been pleading with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to change the rules.Despite his call to get rid of the filibuster, McCarthy has supported the practice in the past. In 2013, he said that a 13-hour filibuster by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) during the confirmation of CIA Director John Brennan was ""fantastic."""

In the end, the most enduring legacy of jihadist violence will not be terrorism or even murder, but chaos.",2015-03-01,"BLOOMINGTON, MN - FEBRUARY 23: An exterior view of Mall of America during a media tour of its security systems on February 23, 2015 in Bloomington, Minnesota. In a newly released video, Somali militant group al-Shabaab called for terror attacks at a number of sites, including Mall of America, the largest shopping mall in the United States. (Photo by Adam Bettcher/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8eb5f260000300183c138.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On February 22, the Somali based al-Shabaab jihadist group issued a six-minute video where it called on Muslim men to attack shopping malls in western countries. Three locations in particular were singled out in the video: Mall of America in Bloomington Minnesota; West Edmonton Mall in Edmonton, Alberta; and the Oxford Street shopping district in London. The latter is not a mall but a heavily trafficked shopping area, what in British parlance is often called a ""High Street"". The video went on to show stark images of the attack on the Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya by al-Shabaab militants in 2013. That attack left 60 people dead and caused several million dollars of damage to the shopping complex.On the one hand there is something almost laughable at the idea of shopping, that most exalted of activities in western consumer culture, will now become the next battlefield of the jihadist struggle. What comes next, Buffalo wings and beer? Can Monday Night Football be far behind? Will ""holy war"" be reduced to attacking the most visible emblems of western consumerist culture? On the other hand, the success of al-Shabaab's attack on the Westgate Mall is reason for concern. They have done it before, with deadly consequences. Shopping Malls have little in the way of security and lots of soft targets. Moreover, it has already happened in the United States once before. On December 11, 2012, Jacob Tyler Roberts attacked shoppers at the Clackamas Town Center just outside the city of Portland, Oregon. The location is precisely the kind of large enclosed regional mall cited by al-Shabaab. Armed with a Bushmaster XM15-E2S M4 semiautomatic carbine and wearing tactical clothing and a hockey mask, Roberts ran into the mall and began shooting at shoppers. He fired a total of 17 shots, killing two people, and seriously injuring a third person. When confronted by an armed civilian, the gunmen took his own life. The incident lasted just 22 minutes and was over before police could even respond in force. Roberts had no jihadist links or any political agenda, and the attack was described as a random act of violence.Jihadist threats against targets in the United States are bound to get heavy media attention. Such threats are seen as underscoring the growing power and reach of international jihadism and its supporters. The fact that an attack can occur literally in our own communities drives home the point that the front line of the jihadist struggle is literally in our own neighborhoods. In reality, however, such threats are a measure not of the strength of the jihadist movement but of its weakness. Moreover, it underlines the fact that the public posture of jihadist groups is often shaped by their competition with other jihadist groups for financing and militants.Harakat al-Shabaab al-Mujahedeen (Movement of Striving Youth or Mujahedeen Youth Movement) typically contracted to just al-Shabaab or ""The Youngsters"" is a Somali based, Jihadist militant group that began in 2006 as a splinter group of the Islamic Courts Union. It's possible that its founding could date back as early as 2004. Historically, both its rank and file and its leadership have drawn heavily on foreign jihadists from North Africa and the Persian Gulf. Most of its financing was from external sources supplemented by revenue from a large trade in illegal elephant ivory. Moreover, largely as a result of the broad diaspora of Somalis around the globe, it was among the first jihadist organizations to recruit heavily among westernized Muslims. Since 2007, more than 40 Americans have joined the ranks of al-Shabaab. The group declared its allegiance to al Qaeda in a 15 minute video on February 9, 2012Over the last several years, the group has steadily lost ground to Somali government forces supported by African Union troops (African Union Mission to Somalia or AMISOM). In addition, the United States has employed drone strikes to attack al-Shabaab's leadership. It has retreated from the major cities, although it still has cells that operate there, and the territory under its control is now limited to rural areas. Its total strength is estimated at approximately 8,000 militants. It has claimed that it is cooperating with the, Algerian based, al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and Boko Haram but there seems little practical result from this. Its military setbacks and the loss of significant portions of its senior leadership has created significant dissension in its ranks and it is believed that the group may split up into different militant factions.One of the consequences of the civil wars in Iraq and Syria has been a significant drop off in material support, both financing and new militants for al-Shabaab. The current jihadist struggle in the Middle East, framed between Baghdad and Damascus, is occurring in the very cultural and historical heart of the Arab Middle East. This region is the heart and soul of Arab civilization. By comparison, what is happening in Somalia and the attempt of al-Shabaab to extend the jihadist struggle to Kenya and Uganda is, at best, a side show. Al-Shabaab has found it hard to compete against the ""main event"" and its capabilities have suffered accordingly. Hence the need for heightened visibility in order to recruit new militants and financial support.Moreover, this competition for support among jihadist groups will increase as new groups emerge and as the landscape of international jihadism continues to grow more fractured. The success of the United States in attacking al Qaeda has decimated the organizations senior ranks and its ability to operate but it has not eliminated violent jihadism. Moreover, by reducing al Qaeda's control and command capabilities the U.S. has inadvertently contributed to the continued fragmentation of the international jihadist movement. Today we can see a broad arc of jihadist violence and instability that extends from West Africa across North Africa and the Middle East all the way to the foothills of the Hindu Kush in South Asia. There are literally hundreds of different jihadist organizations operating within this broad swath of violent instability, all of which compete with each other for material and financial support. From a practical standpoint al-Shabaab has little capability for organizing or staging terrorist attacks against the American homeland. For that matter, neither does Islamic State or the remnants of al Qaeda. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) is probably the best equipped to carry out such attacks but even its capabilities have been significantly reduced. Instead both al-Shabaab and Islamic State have resorted to exhorting would be supporters to independently mount their own attacks against targets in the United States and Europe. The terrorist attack at the Canadian parliament in Ottawa and the Paris attacks against the offices of Charlie Hebdo and the Hypercacher supermarket are examples of this kind of strategy. It is likely that these kind of random, ""attacks of opportunity"" will increase over the next several years as jihadist organizations like al-Shabaab and Islamic State find themselves being steadily rolled back. Such attacks, represent both a low cost way of attacking its opponents in the west while at the same time highlighting their effectiveness and their continued relevance on the front line of the jihadist struggle in their search for material and financial support. Fundamentally, it is a sign of weakness -- not of strength -- and the weaker these organizations become the more they will exhort would be sympathizers to engage in such acts of terrorism.This type of terrorist violence is difficult to anticipate and control. Unlike complex operations it does not require a great deal of planning. It does not generate travel or chatter that tips off security agencies of an imminent threat. These attacks do not represent an existential threat to the United States, but they contribute to a climate of fear and apprehension. They may well produce a counter reaction against Muslim communities in the United States and may result in the radicalization of some members. That is certainly one of the primary results that jihadist groups are hoping for. The attack at the Clackamas Town Center in Oregon is, unfortunately, a perfect template for how these kind of spur of the moment, ""lone wolf"", attacks might play out. Moreover, while the collateral damage of such attacks is low, though no less tragic, a sustained pattern of such attacks, especially if they are clustered during key shopping periods could have a measureable impact on the U.S. economy. While governments speak of ""defeating"" jihadist terrorism, the reality is that this phenomenon will continue to metastasize into other forms, some more virulent other less. Regardless of our effectiveness in waging war against jihadism, however, it will continue to persist. In the end, the most enduring legacy of jihadist violence will not be terrorism or even murder, but chaos."

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8eb64240000500098fc44.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Secretary of State John Kerry on Sunday sought to downplay the growing diplomatic rift between the United States and Israel, telling ABC's ""This Week"" that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is ""welcome to speak in the United States,"" and that the U.S. has ""a closer relationship with Israel right now in terms of security than at any time in history."" As Kerry spoke, Netanyahu was en route to Washington, where he will deliver a controversial address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday. The speech was arranged by Netanyahu and Republican House Speaker John Boehner without informing the White House, and will take place just two weeks before Israelis vote on whether or not to reelect the prime minister. For this reason, President Barack Obama has said he will not be meeting with Netanyahu during his three-day visit. ""Obviously, it was odd, if not unique, that we learned of [the speech] from the speaker of the House and that the administration was not included in this process,"" Kerry said Sunday. ""But the administration is not seeking to politicize this."" In his speech, the prime minister is expected to criticize the Obama administration's ongoing negotiations with Iran and other world powers over Iran's nuclear program. Instead of focusing on Netanyahu, however, Kerry underscored how much America has done recently to help its longtime ally in the Middle East -- a not-so-subtle reminder to Israel of how much it relies on the U.S. ""We have intervened on Israel's behalf, in the last two years, more than several hundred -- a couple of hundred times in over 75 different fora in order to protect Israel,"" Kerry said, adding, ""I talk to the prime minister regularly, including yesterday. We don't want to see this [visit] turned into some great political football.""For many in Washington and Tel Aviv, however, Netanyahu's upcoming speech is already overtly political. Specifically, it offers Republicans a chance to jab the president by putting one of Obama's most powerful critics on a major podium. It also gives Netanyahu a ready-made campaign ad with which to woo voters back home, where he faces a strong challenge from the left.""We want to recognize the main goal here is to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon,"" Kerry said, ""and on that, Israel and the United States agree."" Netanyahu is expected to preview his speech to Congress on Monday, when he is slated to speak before a friendly crowd at the annual meeting of AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. "

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., is projected on a large video screen as he speaks at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) Policy Conference in Washington, Sunday, March 1, 2015. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8eb61240000300098fc42.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Speaking to the annual American Israel Public Affairs Committee policy conference Sunday morning, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) threatened to cut funding to the United Nations, who he believes is alienating Israel in the international community and tolerating anti-Semitism in Europe. His promise was met with applause and a standing ovation by the nearly 15,000 AIPAC members in attendance.Though it wasn’t mentioned explicitly, a majority of lawmakers in Congress are protesting the Palestinian Authority's recent ascension to the International Criminal Court, the body responsible for prosecuting war crimes. The court, which has retroactive jurisdiction back to June 13, 2014, in Palestinian territories, would be able to investigate possible violations of the laws of war during last summer’s Gaza-Israel conflict. Graham was one of 75 senators who signed a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry in January, urging for a cessation of U.S. funding to the Palestinian Authority. Graham also expressed his skepticism about the ongoing nuclear negotiations between Iran and the six-country team known as the P5+1. While Graham conceded that history would frown upon a Republican lawmaker who voted against a “good deal,” he expressed doubts in the negotiators’ ability to bring about an agreement that would be acceptable to Congress.“I don’t really have a lot of faith in the Russians to get us to the promised land,” Graham said, referring to Russian membership in the P5+1.As for the Iranians, “they lie, they cheat, they aren't trustworthy, they kill Americans, they would destroy Israel tomorrow if they could,” claimed Graham. According to Graham, a “bad deal” is one that would allow Iran to maintain any enrichment program that is monitored only by the United Nations. “How does it make you feel,” he asked the audience, “that the only thing between Israel and Iran with a nuclear weapon is the UN?” As a member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Iran is allowed to maintain a peaceful nuclear enrichment program, as long as it complies with safeguards to verify compliance, such as inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN’s nuclear watchdog. Graham is one of four senators who introduced new legislation on Friday that would prohibit the Obama administration from lifting sanctions against Iran within two months of reaching an agreement, in order to give Congress time to review and debate the deal. Meanwhile, sanctions relief has been a key requirement for any nuclear deal from the Iranians, whose economy has been heavily strained by years of international sanctions and plummeting oil prices. Though he claimed support for a peaceful nuclear agreement with Iran, Graham repeated his opposition to restoring Iran’s economy. “As we have negotiated with the Iranians, they have toppled four Arab capitals,” he said, referencing what he believed was Iranian support for the Houthis in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon, President Bashar al-Assad in Syria, and Shiite militias in Iraq. “What do you think they would do with sanction relief? Build schools and hospitals?"" Graham asked. ""They would fund their military to wreak more unrest in the region.” What Graham failed to mention is that Washington and Tehran are tacitly fighting side by side in Iraq and Syria against the Islamic State. In an unusual talking point, the senator pointed to Israel as an example of why Iran’s nuclear program should be restricted. “It’s common knowledge that Israel has a nuclear arsenal, yet not one Arab nation has felt the need to get a nuclear weapon as a result,” said Graham. He explained that if Iran possessed nuclear weapons, the Middle East would erupt in a nuclear arms race. Though Israel has never officially confirmed its nuclear weapons program, it is widely believed that it developed weapons in the 1960s. Because it is not party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, its program is not subject to international inspection. In 2003, The Guardian learned that Saudi Arabia conducted a strategic review to determine if it was comfortable remaining under the nuclear umbrella protection of the U.S., or if it should develop nuclear weapon capabilities of its own. In addition to concern about Iran’s nuclear program, the Saudis expressed concern over Israel’s secret nuclear weapons and the lack of international pressure on Israel over their program. "

Scott Walker (R) admitted on Sunday that he had completely changed his stance on immigration and that he now has a much tougher position on undocumented individuals living in the United States.""I don't believe in amnesty, and part of the reason why I've made that a firm position is I look at the way this president has mishandled that issue,"" Walker said during an interview on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""I think the better approach is to enforce the laws and to give employers, job creators the tools like E-Verify and other things to make sure the law is being upheld going forward,"" he said. But pressed by host Chris Wallace on how Walker could reconcile that with his past support for comprehensive immigration reform  and 2013 comments in which he said that he supported a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, Walker admitted that his position had shifted.""My view has changed, I'm flat out saying it. Candidates can say that, sometimes they don't,"" Walker said. ""I look at the problems we’ve experienced over the last few years. I talked to governors on the border and others out there, I’ve talked to people all across America, and the concerns I have is that we need to secure the border.

But these pharmaceuticals are only fully effective roughly 30 percent of the time, and often come with troublesome side effects. In a controversial new paper published in the journal Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews, psychologist Paul Andrews of McMaster University in Ontario argues that this failure of medication may be based in a misunderstanding of the underlying chemistry related to depression. Andrews surveyed 50 years' worth of research supporting the serotonin theory of depression, which suggests that the disease is caused by low levels of the ""happiness"" neurotransmitter, serotonin. But Andrews argues that depression may actually be caused by elevated levels of serotonin. And this fundamental misunderstanding may be responsible for inappropriate treatment: The most common form of antidepressants are selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which operate by targeting serotonin receptors in the brain in an effort to amplify serotonin production. Currently, scientists are unable to measure precisely how the brain releases and uses serotonin, because it can't be safely observed in a human brain. But Andrews points to research on animals which suggests that serotonin might work just the opposite from what we've assumed. In this scenario, elevated serotonin levels that are released and used by the brain during depressive episodes trigger processes that promote rumination -- the obsessive negative thinking that is the hallmark of depression. Then, because they facilitate the production of serotonin, SSRI treatments exacerbate rumination and actually worsen symptoms of depression, especially at first, Andrews explained. Over time, in some cases, the SSRIs can reverse ruminative processes and reduce symptoms -- but this is in spite of the medication, not because of it. Of course, anti-depressants do help many people who are struggling with depression. However, the research points to the need for a greater understanding of the many factors that may contribute to the development of this common mental health disorder. HuffPost Science spoke to Andrews about why we may have gotten anti-depressants ""backwards"" -- and what the future of depression treatment might hold. HuffPost: Where did the low-serotonin hypothesis originate? Andrews: The hypothesis didn't originate because anybody measured serotonin in depression or in any depressed-like state in an animal. It's really based on circumstantial evidence. Researchers back in the '40s and '50s happened to find that certain drugs that were trying to treat tuberculosis and schizophrenia had depression-relieving properties, and they wondered, why were they relieving depressive symptoms? They eventually figured out that the drugs increased serotonin in rodent models.... They reasoned that if these drugs relieved depressive symptoms in humans -- and, as best as we can tell, they increased serotonin -- then depression must be a state of low or reduced serotonin transmission. There have been problems with the low-serotonin hypothesis for a while. If you look to any serious neuroscientist, they'll all acknowledge that there are serious problems with it. It still is, nevertheless, the backbone of research on depression in neuroscience. What evidence is there to suggest that the low-serotonin hypothesis of depression may not be accurate? There is no way to be absolutely certain for two reasons. First, we cannot directly measure how fast serotonin is released, or transmitted. You can't do that even in a rat. You can measure the concentration of serotonin in a particular brain region, but you can't measure the transmission of it. The transmission would be to measure the release of the serotonin into the synapse. The only thing we can measure is a marker of transmission, which reflects what happens to serotonin after it is released into the synapse and metabolized. Second, it is currently impossible to study this issue in humans without cutting holes in their skulls. But these studies can be done in animals. In these studies, there is abundant evidence that this marker of transmission is elevated.We reviewed 15 different models of depression that are used in neuroscience research that had measured this particular marker that we're concerned with. Of those 15 studies, 13 were consistent with the high-serotonin hypothesis, and the other two were not inconsistent with it. If you extrapolate to humans... that would strongly suggest that the evidence is in favor of the high-serotonin hypothesis of depression. OK, so how do anti-depressants work then? Another problem with the low serotonin hypothesis is that these drugs increase serotonin pretty rapidly, within minutes to hours. You'd think that if the low serotonin hypothesis was true, the anti-depressant drugs would work rapidly too. But they don't -- it takes three to four weeks for their symptom-reducing effects to kick on. So there's always been this disconnect between the onset of the pharmacological effects of the anti-depressants and their therapeutic effects. So what's actually happening to depressive symptoms when you first start taking these drugs? Well, it's extremely common for people to start saying ""I feel worse"" rather than getting better. That's theoretically important because these drugs are working very quickly in terms of increasing serotonin. So what's happening to serotonin in the brain as those three or four weeks pass? It's falling.... As time goes on [after the initial peak], serotonin dips below the baseline and that's when you actually start feeling better. But things will eventually smooth out again and the brain will return to its steady state. That's what happens over prolonged anti-depressant use. Even when taking the drugs, people experience relapses. They might have that initial worsening of symptoms, then they'll feel better, and over prolonged period of use, they'll tell the doctor that the drugs aren't working anymore... And commonly the doctor will increase the dose or add on another drug. But the brain is always fighting these drugs and trying to bring itself back to its homeostatic equilibrium. Antidepressants are known to cause many side effects. What are some of the most common? Limited efficacy at reducing depressive symptoms, sexual difficulties, difficulty concentrating, and problems with the digestive system are the most common. But many other types of problems can occur, including increased risk of relapse, a decrease in bone mineral density, abnormal bleeding, stroke, suicidal behaviour. Some of these problems can cause death -- several studies have shown that anti-depressants, especially in older people, are associated with an increased risk of death.You add them all up, and they all can be potentially serious things. What do you think is the future of depression treatment? As people and physicians become more aware that antidepressants only work for a limited period of time, and are less safe than they have been supposed, the use of antidepressant medications will decline and the use of psychotherapies will increase.I would suggest that the attempt to pharmacologically reduce depressive symptoms is not likely to produce lasting effects. You can get these temporary effects, but they're not likely to be lasting effects, and they can cause a whole lot of problems.Psychotherapy is more likely to produce lasting effects, and can help people cope with the things that actually triggered their depressive episodes, and that's why these therapies are more productive in the long run.
