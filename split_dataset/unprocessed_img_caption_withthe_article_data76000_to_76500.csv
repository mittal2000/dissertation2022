0,RELIGION,Religion Scholar Says Spiritual Revolution Begins In Nature,"Jennifer Preyss, Religion News Service",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/diana-butler-bass-grounded_us_5616a197e4b0e66ad4c6cc11,Diana Butler Bass' new book explores finding God in the physical world.,2015-10-10,"Author Diana Butler Bass, whose new book, “Grounded,” was released on Oct. 6, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5616a4691400002200c797a3.jpeg?cache=sLJjzblf4e&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(RNS) Four mornings a week, in the tranquil, blushing hours of morning, Diana Butler Bass drives to a familiar walking trail along the Potomac River and embarks on a two-mile stroll.Creeping sunlight peppers the wooded scene. And the babble of active water silences the jangle of daily life.Some days she finds a comfortable bench along the river where she can journal. Other days, she observes creation.For Bass, a learned nature connoisseur, ardent gardener and noted religion academic, God does not merely exist inside reverent, adorned church spaces.God also lives in the soil and exists in the elements.“I have learned to love the dirt,” said Bass, a Christian progressive and author of nine books on American religion. “The dirt is a miniature universe. When I scoop up dirt in my hand I immediately think that I’m holding a universe. And then you can look up in the sky and there’s that universe above us.”Her latest book, Grounded: Finding God in the World, a Spiritual Revolution, champions a return to nature and an embrace of hospitality. It also begs a frequent question, “Where is God?”“’Grounded’ is my attempt to flesh out what I call a spiritual revolution — the spiritual awakening that’s happening — so that people can see it more clearly and see that it’s not that depressing of a time spiritually, or religiously,” she said. “But that we’re really moving toward an exciting new place.”Many Christians practicing in mainline churches have long approached statistical findings of denominational decline with pessimism and hopelessness. But Bass’ reverie about the future of American Christianity stands out for this scholar — she holds a Ph.D. from Duke University — and believer.“She’s seen in many ways by most of the mainline as carrying a torch for them,” said Scott Thumma, professor of sociology of religion for the Hartford Institute for Religion Research.He notes that Bass’ credentials as an academic, Christian practitioner and lay theological communicator frequently help bridge the gap between those who practice Christianity and those who research it.“What makes her an unusual voice among commentators in American religion right now is that she’s a proponent of hopeful religion,” said Thumma. “That’s not so common in what we study. The approach of her books and the research she’s done is focused on looking at what is working, looking for pockets of vitality and hope.”In the past half-dozen years, Christian mainline churches have decreased in size and activity, attributed in part to married couples’ having fewer children, delayed childbearing, and competition and a general societal slide toward secularism.And though many have exited church in recent years, or redefined themselves as religiously unaffiliated, Bass, who lives in Alexandria, Va., said she never desired to leave God or church behind.That does not mean she has walked a linear Christian path. Bass was reared in the United Methodist Church, but as a teen she switched to an evangelical Bible church she remembers as mildly fundamentalist (it taught end times theology, or premillennial dispensationalism.)In her late 20s, she heard a sermon from an Episcopal bishop identifying God as love. She had never known God described that way, and it was about that time she began asking herself questions about what she believed, and where she believed God to be.“Faith journeys are always about growing up and maturing and seeing the world with new eyes,” said Bass, who today attends an Episcopal church but isn’t quite reconciled to an Episcopalian identity. “But they’re also about encountering God in new ways. It’s not just about a developmental or psychological maturing process, but it’s literally about having our hearts open toward where the sacred is present in the world.”Rather than participate in the dialogue about the future of the mainline church in America with a naysayer’s attitude, Bass chooses to focus on the change.She said participating in the spiritual revolution begins with an appreciation of God in nature and making a choice to practice simple and much-needed hospitality toward one’s neighbors.“When you practice hospitality you immediately have walked into a territory of diversity or pluralism, or trying to include the other. So hospitality and diversity are intimately related,” she said. “I think there are Christian groups, and Jewish groups and Hindu groups and Muslim groups and all kinds of different religious communities, that practice it quite well. But as a country, we really struggle.”Longtime friend and Christian author Brian McLaren, a similarly prominent voice in progressive American Christianity, said he and Bass have been kindred spirits for many years.After reading “Grounded,” he said, he was moved by Bass’ elegant message to quit viewing religion as a holy elevator — a term used in the book — where God is sent down, and when people behave, they move up.Instead, McLaren said, he likes Bass’ attempts to redefine God as creator and redirect the perspective on the beauty and heaven already on Earth.“Grounded,” McLaren believes, will appeal to people who have left organized religion as well as people who know that something about their practice isn’t working.He acknowledges, however, that some readers may put Bass in a liberal Christian box.“A lot of people want to classify the world in terms of left and right, but you could say there are people trying to engage with God from deep to shallow,” he said. “I think the left-right conversation is shallow, and I think what Diana is trying to do is take people beyond left and right.”So while the world debates politics and religion, liberal and conservative, heaven and hell, Bass points her attention to the church, to the Potomac and to her flower and vegetable garden, where she just planted broccoli on raised beds. In that place where seedlings grow and mature from the dirt, she will look to the soil and water to teach her about God.Also on HuffPost:"
1,WEIRD NEWS,You Shouldn't Criticize Those Vegetarians Who Eat Meat When Drunk,Hilary Hanson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/vegetarians-eat-meat-drunk_us_56193168e4b0dbb8000ece70,They're still doing more good than people who don't cut back on meat at all.,2015-10-10,Actual drunk vegetarian covertly eating meat not pictured.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/561935151400002b003c7f0f.jpeg?ops=crop_0_181_1948_1162%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"It seemed carnivores were having the last laugh this week after a U.K.-based survey found more than a third of vegetarian responders ate meat when drunk, but advocates for animals and the environment say we shouldn’t be so critical of those so-called “drunk-etarians.”“When it comes to meat consumption, I think our obsession with perfection and purity hinders us from making sustainable and meaningful behavioral change,” Brian Kateman, co-founder and president of the Reducetarian Foundation, told The Huffington Post. “Small changes lead to big impacts, and it's not all or nothing. It's foolish to discount the benefits of all the meatless meals and to instead focus on the occasional meaty meal.”Kateman’s organization educates the public about the benefits of reducing meat consumption, while emphasizing that someone does not have to give up meat entirely to make an impact. Criticizing those who mostly eschew meat but occasionally indulge in a carnivorous meal is missing the point, he said.“Why should we criticize the growing number of individuals who occasionally eat meat, say, 10 pounds per year, when many of us are eating way too many hamburgers and drumsticks? The difference between 200 and 10 pounds of meat per year is far greater than the difference between 10 and zero pounds of meat per year,” he explained.Kristie Middleton, senior director of food policy at the Humane Society of the United States, said she sees a growing number of people who choose to cut back on animal products to some degree, noting that the trend applies to both the United States and some European countries.“Whether going vegetarian or vegan, eating vegan before 6 p.m., or simply enjoying Meatless Mondays, meatless eating is undoubtedly on the rise,” she said.And she agreed that self-described vegetarians who occasionally make exceptions should not be booted from the movement.“Being a vegetarian isn’t a personal purity test,” she said, adding, “The meat industry isn’t concerned about whether self-described vegetarians choose vegetarian 99 percent or 100 percent of the time.”In case anyone needs a refresher on why someone might want to cut back on meat, two of the big reasons are concern for animal welfare -- in factory farms or otherwise -- and the environment. In 2010, the United Nations advocated for worldwide reduction in meat and dairy consumption, noting those industries were environmentally unsustainable at the levels of current production. And a 2014 report found that cutting meat and other animal products drastically reduces a person’s carbon footprint. Additionally, many people opt to reduce meat for health reasons, or simply because meat can be expensive.And while the survey, which was conducted by U.K. deal-hunting website VoucherCodesPro, certainly suggests that at least some portion of “vegetarians” are opting to eat meat when drunk, it’s tough to say how representative the findings are of the general population.VoucherCodesPro PR account executive Scott Salter explained to HuffPost that the 1,789 respondents came from a database of VoucherCodesPro newsletter subscribers who had opted in to participate in surveys. The company contacted folks in the database via email and gave them the option of anonymously participating in the survey. Respondents who had identified as vegetarian were then chosen at random, Salter said, but the company didn’t collect any other demographic data.Also on HuffPost:"

They said his actions fundamentally altered American operations in Afghanistan and called for him to be held accountable.Bergdahl, 29, was charged earlier this year with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. He faces up to life in prison if convicted of the more serious offense of misbehavior.Lawyers for Bergdahl would like Visger to recommend a punishment under Article 15, they said. Visger's recommendations have not been publicly released.Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, Article 15 punishments include reduction of one grade in rank or a requirement that the soldier perform additional duties.Visger will recommend the course of action for resolving Bergdahl's case, such as whether it should proceed to a court-martial or be handled in some other manner. The final decision will be made by the Commanding General of the U.S. Army Forces Command at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.Major General Kenneth Dahl, who led the military's investigation into Bergdahl's disappearance and capture, told last month's hearing Bergdahl should not be imprisoned, saying he was not a Taliban sympathizer.Dahl characterized Bergdahl as an unrealistically idealistic soldier who left his post to report concerns about his unit's leadership to a general at another base. He added that none of the soldiers sent to look for Bergdahl had been killed.Bergdahl disappeared on June 30, 2009, from Combat Outpost Mest-Lalak in Paktika Province, Afghanistan, and was captured by the Taliban, where he suffered years of abuse and torture.He was freed five years later in a prisoner swap that sent five Taliban leaders who were being held at Guantanamo to Qatar.(Writing by Jon Herskovitz; Editing by Helen Popper)"
3,LATINO VOICES,How To Deport 11 Million People Humanely*,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-mass-deportation_us_561676f8e4b0dbb8000d4694,*It might require not deporting people.,2015-10-10,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump plans to deport all undocumented immigrants ""humanely.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/561831c912000026007e4cd7.jpeg?cache=8hle47pDOx&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump says he has a plan to deport or drive out every single undocumented immigrant in 18 to 24 months. He's not offering many details -- but he's said repeatedly that the process will be ""very humane.""There are many reasons why this idea would be unrealistic in practice. More than 11 million undocumented immigrants are scattered around the U.S., and it would take a massive amount of money and agents to track them all down. Many of them have American family members. And some industries, such as agriculture, rely on their labor and might be left temporarily without workers.But what about the ""humane"" aspect? Is it possible to craft a mass deportation policy that would be humane? Since Trump has eschewed specifics on how his proposal would function, The Huffington Post reached out to several experts and activists -- some who think undocumented immigrants should benefit from a pathway to citizenship, others who don't -- to see if they could answer that question. Those opposed to a pathway to citizenship said mass deportation was feasible, in part because they believed many people would leave on their own if the administration would simply enforce existing laws.To most others, the question was absurd on its face. ""There's no way you can do this without being inhumane,"" said David Leopold, an Ohio immigration attorney who previously served as president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. ""It's an inhumane concept."" Many people HuffPost interviewed declined to discuss mass deportation at all. But a few gave some ideas for how the current deportation system could be made more humane and more fair. Unfortunately for Trump, many of those ideas would lead to a large number of undocumented immigrants staying in the U.S.Here's what it would take to make deportation proceedings more ""humane,"" according to the experts:Ensure Due Process For Everyone In Deportation ProceedingsAll people charged with a crime have the right to an attorney, but the same isn't true in deportation hearings -- though people facing deportation are still up against a trained government attorney arguing for a life-altering penalty. Even children go before immigration judges alone, and they win their cases less frequently if they don't have legal representation. Greg Chen, director of advocacy for AILA, said humane mass deportation is impossible. But he said the overall existing system could be improved by ensuring that everyone had an attorney, and by adding more judges and ending expedited removal processes that lead to people being deported without time to pursue legal options. ""The system could be made more fair if this were done, because it would not necessarily result in the deportation of all of these people,"" Chen said. ""Many of these people are eligible for humanitarian protection or other relief under immigration law, and that needs to be figured out.""Limit Immigrant DetentionCurrently, the U.S. maintains space to detain 34,000 immigrants at a time. This includes controversial facilities that house mothers and children while they undergo deportation proceedings. Some of the people detained have been convicted of crimes, although they've typically already served their time. Others are there simply for being in the country without legal authorization.People in detention facilities are separated from their families and are sometimes far away from the immigration lawyers who are working to help them. So, to make detention more humane, it should actually be replaced with something else -- such as bond, orders of supervision or deferred action, according to Leopold. ""You could use much less intrusive methods of detention,"" he said.Increase Discretion In Deportation ProceedingsMost undocumented immigrants have lived in the U.S. for more than a decade, and 4 million undocumented adults live with a U.S. citizen child, according to a 2012 report from Pew Research Center. Deporting parents can have serious implications for those kids.More discretion -- to account for factors like time spent in the U.S. and family living in the country -- would allow for a more humane system, said Marc Rosenblum, a deputy director of Migration Policy Institute. ""When you're talking about mixed-status families and people who have been here a long time, I don't think there is a way that they can humanely be deported,"" he said. ""So when you talk about making the system more humane, I think it has to involve building in discretion for judges to take that into account.""Unlike Rosenblum and the other experts above, however, there are people who think the possibility of ""humane"" mass deportation is conceivable, and that it's something worth pursuing. Below are a few of their proposals:Send A Message That Unauthorized Immigration Won't Be Accepted Trump isn't alone in his aim to drive out the undocumented population. Boosting enforcement and trusting that a large number undocumented people would leave on their own might be a solution, said William Gheen of the Americans for Legal Immigration PAC, or ALIPAC, which strongly opposes unauthorized immigrants.Simply having Trump as the Republican presidential nominee could convince some undocumented immigrants to leave, Gheen said. He has previously advocated for ""safe departure"" checkpoints along the border that allow undocumented immigrants to leave without being detained.""If [Trump] sticks to his pledge about deporting all illegal immigrants, I think many will start to leave before November of next year,"" Gheen said.Ramp Up EnforcementMark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, said in an email that he had ""no idea"" what Trump has in mind in terms of deportation, but had some suggestions ""to get a significant share of the illegal population to leave, and none of it is 'inhumane' by any non-advocacy-group definition.""That would include increasing deportation to 2013 levels, requiring employers to use the E-Verify system to check new hires' immigration status, and making local law enforcement coordinate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Krikorian also suggested pushing states to stop issuing driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants. At the same time, he said, the government could crack down on people who overstay their visas, and prosecute all unauthorized border-crossers. ""Do all that, and you'll see the illegal population shrink significantly, mainly through attrition,"" Krikorian wrote. "

The market is on fire right now,"" said one security source present in the town.Niger, Cameroon and Chad have all suffered a spillover of violence from Boko Haram's north Nigerian strongholds.Chad spearheaded a regional offensive earlier this year that drove the Islamist fighters from many of their bases. However, the group has fought back, launching a wave of cross-border attacks and suicide bombings.Niger, Nigeria, Benin, Cameroon and Chad have agreed to establish an 8,700-strong multinational force to take on the militants, though its formation has been delayed.Chadian President Idriss Deby has said the force could begin operations later this month."

He instead argues that fiercer Jewish resistance to the Nazis, while futile in itself, would have preserved in Jews a more courageous “mindset.”“The mindset that Jews surrendered with their guns is far more important than the hardware they turned over: They surrendered the demonstrated intention, at all costs, to resist being deprived of liberty,” he wrote. “If Jews in Germany had more actively resisted the Nazi party or the Nazi regime and had diagnosed it as a malignant and deadly cancer from the start, there would, indeed, have been a chance for the people of that country and the world to be moved to action by their bold refusal to be enslaved.”Ablow’s column is filled with caveats. He discloses that he has held a fundraiser for Carson. And he acknowledges that he was “not there” during the Holocaust and “hindsight is 20/20.”But because he was “born a Jew,” studied the Holocaust and has spoken in front of the Anti-Defamation League, he deems himself qualified to weigh in on the matter. “It was a bad idea for any Jew to have turned over a gun,” Ablow continued. “It was a bad idea for any Jew to have boarded a train. It was a bad idea for any Jew to have passed through a gate into a camp. It was a bad idea for any Jew to do any work at any such camp. It was a bad idea for any Jew to not attempt to crush the skull or scratch out the eyes of any Nazi who turned his back for one moment.”Ablow concludes by reaffirming that the Jewish experience during the Holocaust should serve as a warning that present-day gun control efforts -- which he calls “a government that insists its citizens disarm” -- presage “an epidemic of enslavement of one kind or another.”In reality, many Jews and other groups targeted by the Holocaust resisted Nazi brutality. It took the Nazis a month to completely subdue Jewish fighters during the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto uprising. They then leveled the ghetto, killing its inhabitants or deporting them to death camps.Thousands of Jews were also active members of national underground movements to resist Nazi rule in Poland, France, Italy, Yugoslavia, Greece and Slovakia.Even assuming European Jewish communities had been capable of mounting a greater defense against the Nazis as they were being ghettoized and taken in cattle cars to death camps, it is not at all clear that would have “moved” the world to come to their rescue.In some countries, local inhabitants were enthusiastic participants in the systematic murder of Jews.Others, like the United States, were merely unwilling to do much about it. The U.S. government refused a request by American Jewish leaders in 1944 to bomb the train tracks into Auschwitz, considering it a distraction from its main war objective of defeating the Nazis.The U.S. also did not open its borders to Jewish refugees, famously turning away the St. Louis, a ship with hundreds of mostly German Jews seeking entry in 1939.(For a detailed explanation of why gun control did not enable the Holocaust, read this excellent piece by HuffPost's Nick Baumann.)

Hundreds had traveled from around the country to take part in the peace march.A video from Turkey's Dogan news agency showed a line of protesters dancing and chanting arm in arm at the rally outside Ankara's train station before they were hit by a powerful explosion. The two blasts took place about 50 meters (54 yards) apart, within seconds of each other. Warning: Graphic images below.""I tried to help but everyone was in pieces,"" Ismet, a 56-year-old Turkish animator who survived the attacks, told The WorldPost at the scene, still covered in the blood of other people. ""I tried to help the man next to me but there were no limbs to carry him.""Seconds after the blast, Ismet stumbled around in confusion, going from body to body to see if anyone was still alive. He frantically searched for his wife and child, both of whom he found unharmed in the carnage.Following the explosions, police doused people scrambling to help the wounded with tear gas, several survivors told The WorldPost.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks. Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told a news conference there were ""strong signs"" the attacks had been carried out by suicide bombers, and indicated that the Islamic State militant group or Kurdish separatists could be to blame. Photos and videos from the scene showed streets scattered with dead bodies and wounded blast victims, while tear gas billowed in the background.People used the flags and banners brought to the rally to bandage up victims' wounds, or as makeshift stretchers, according to a video by The Associated Press. Police later prevented journalists from accessing the blast site. A video posted by an activist group called Student Collectives appeared to show protesters breaking up a police barricade that was preventing ambulances from passing. Protests erupted outside hospitals around Ankara, as survivors and the victims' relatives expressed outrage at the government's response to the blasts. Some demonstrators chanted ""Murderer Erdogan!"" referring to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to the AP.Hundreds of people gathered outside the entrance of the Ankara Numune hospital, demanding information on the condition of their loved ones. Many were not allowed to go inside. ""Sister, he's gone!"" a middle-aged woman cried outside of the emergency room entrance. ""It can't be him! We shared our bread in the morning."" She was led away as the crowd looked on in silence.Mevlut, a 30-year-old Turkish man, walked through the crowd outside the hospital with a plastic bag filled with 300 sandwiches he had bought for grieving and anxious relatives. ""I'm just here to support,"" he told The WorldPost, saying he planned to donate blood as soon as people were allowed into the hospital.Another woman held a crumpled sheet of paper with the names of six friends wounded in the blast. She told The WorldPost five of them were missing and one had died, before breaking down in tears, holding on to the paper tightly.Demonstrations against the government and the attacks took place around the country throughout Saturday, Turkey's Dogan news agency reported.The largest was in Istanbul, where some 10,000 people marched through the city to protest the explosions, according to Agence France-Presse. Some protesters held banners blaming the government for the bombings, the news agency said.Turkish authorities ordered a media blackout on images that showed the moment of the blasts, gruesome or bloody pictures or ""images that create a feeling of panic.""

Hundreds had traveled from around the country to take part in the peace march.A video from Turkey's Dogan news agency showed a line of protesters dancing and chanting arm in arm at the rally outside Ankara's train station before they were hit by a powerful explosion. The two blasts took place about 50 meters (54 yards) apart, within seconds of each other. Warning: Graphic images below.""I tried to help but everyone was in pieces,"" Ismet, a 56-year-old Turkish animator who survived the attacks, told The WorldPost at the scene, still covered in the blood of other people. ""I tried to help the man next to me but there were no limbs to carry him.""Seconds after the blast, Ismet stumbled around in confusion, going from body to body to see if anyone was still alive. He frantically searched for his wife and child, both of whom he found unharmed in the carnage.Following the explosions, police doused people scrambling to help the wounded with tear gas, several survivors told The WorldPost.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks. Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told a news conference there were ""strong signs"" the attacks had been carried out by suicide bombers, and indicated that the Islamic State militant group or Kurdish separatists could be to blame. Photos and videos from the scene showed streets scattered with dead bodies and wounded blast victims, while tear gas billowed in the background.People used the flags and banners brought to the rally to bandage up victims' wounds, or as makeshift stretchers, according to a video by The Associated Press. Police later prevented journalists from accessing the blast site. A video posted by an activist group called Student Collectives appeared to show protesters breaking up a police barricade that was preventing ambulances from passing. Protests erupted outside hospitals around Ankara, as survivors and the victims' relatives expressed outrage at the government's response to the blasts. Some demonstrators chanted ""Murderer Erdogan!"" referring to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to the AP.Hundreds of people gathered outside the entrance of the Ankara Numune hospital, demanding information on the condition of their loved ones. Many were not allowed to go inside. ""Sister, he's gone!"" a middle-aged woman cried outside of the emergency room entrance. ""It can't be him! We shared our bread in the morning."" She was led away as the crowd looked on in silence.Mevlut, a 30-year-old Turkish man, walked through the crowd outside the hospital with a plastic bag filled with 300 sandwiches he had bought for grieving and anxious relatives. ""I'm just here to support,"" he told The WorldPost, saying he planned to donate blood as soon as people were allowed into the hospital.Another woman held a crumpled sheet of paper with the names of six friends wounded in the blast. She told The WorldPost five of them were missing and one had died, before breaking down in tears, holding on to the paper tightly.Demonstrations against the government and the attacks took place around the country throughout Saturday, Turkey's Dogan news agency reported.The largest was in Istanbul, where some 10,000 people marched through the city to protest the explosions, according to Agence France-Presse. Some protesters held banners blaming the government for the bombings, the news agency said.Turkish authorities ordered a media blackout on images that showed the moment of the blasts, gruesome or bloody pictures or ""images that create a feeling of panic."" A government spokesman warned news organizations they could face a ""full blackout"" if they did not comply.People across the country found themselves unable to use social media such as Twitter and Facebook Saturday evening.

Chaos reigns in the House Republican Caucus, reflecting the chaos from the Republican presidential campaign trail. The question is what will emerge from this maelstrom?",2015-10-10,"WASHINGTON, DC - OCTOBER 8: House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, with wife Judy McCarthy, left and surrounded by family, friends and staff, speaks to journalists when leaving the Republican House Leadership conference meeting and stepping away from running for the House Speakership, on Capitol Hill Thursday, October 8, 2015. (Photo by Melina Mara/The Washington Post via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb915c82400005100578543.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Two weeks ago, we wrote one of these columns and snarkily subtitled it: ""New Job Vacancy: Chief GOP Cat-Herder."" This week, we really should have gone with: ""Babysitting Experience STRONGLY PREFERRED,"" but Salon had already used it (we'll explain that joke in a bit, promise). Instead, we chose to feature the word which appeared in too many headlines to accurately count over the past two days, because describing what is going on in the Republican Party these days is pretty downright hard to do without using the word ""chaos"" in some fashion or another.Chaos is king. Chaos reigns in the House Republican Caucus, reflecting the chaos from the Republican presidential campaign trail. The question is what will emerge from this maelstrom -- a beautiful phoenix-like rebirth of the Grand Old Party, or perhaps such a wide split that the Republican Party fractures the same way the Democrats and the Dixiecrats did over half a century ago. At this point, either outcome seems equally possible. We are in chaotic and uncharted waters, folks. In fact, you can almost hear the Discordians chanting ""Hail Eris!"" at this point (that was an obscure Robert Anton Wilson joke, just because it seemed like the perfect week to toss it into the mix).Here's how Karen Tumulty of the Washington Post summed up what's going on: ""Less than a year after a sweeping electoral triumph, Republicans are on the verge of ceasing to function as a national political party. The most powerful and crippling force at work in the -once-hierarchical GOP is anger, directed as much at its own leaders as anywhere else."" Others are more sanguine, predicting that some sort of moderate will emerge to drag the House Republicans back to respectability, in the same fashion Denny Hastert did after the Newt Gingrich and Bob Livingston fiasco. So perhaps this week's fracas over the speaker of the House will be seen later as nothing more than an intra-party squabble, but then again perhaps not. Even if they do finally select some hapless fool to take the job, the dynamics of the situation aren't going to change one bit.To review how we got here: John Boehner had an impossible job, and he finally got fed up dealing with the lunatics in his own party. He announced he was stepping down. The consensus candidate was supposed to be Kevin McCarthy, who immediately went out and baldly admitted a deeply-held Republican secret: the Benghazi hearings were designed purely to destroy Hillary Clinton's chances of becoming president. Whoops! You're not supposed to admit stuff like this out loud, much less in a nationally-broadcast television interview. Whether this mattered or not to the Tea Partiers in the House (who are now known as the ""Freedom Caucus,"" naturally), they indicated that they wouldn't be voting for McCarthy on the House floor. To put this another way, they may have tanked McCarthy even if he had never made his infamous gaffe -- McCarthy is, after all, Boehner's hand-picked successor. When McCarthy saw that he was unlikely to get the necessary 218 votes, he immediately withdrew his name from consideration.The Tea Partiers, as usual, had no ""Plan B."" 'Twas ever thus.So we now find ourselves at an interesting (and, of course, chaotic) juncture. There seem to be four main possibilities as to what's going to happen next. Of course, there are other things that could happen (such as Nancy Pelosi convincing 30 or so moderate Republicans to vote her in as speaker once again), but we're trying to limit them to things we consider likely.The first is perhaps the stupidest. Some are speaking of bringing in a ""caretaker"" speaker (or ""interim"" speaker), whatever that means. The idea is to find some House Republican who has already announced they'll be stepping down next year, and convince them to run the place until they leave. In other words, get a doddering old warhorse up there to hold the place together for another year. This would display the weakness of the Republican Party in starker fashion than any of the other options, though, because they'd be essentially campaigning on: ""We got nothin' -- elect us for another two years!"" So much for all of that talk of the ""Republican deep bench,"" eh?The second option is to have a savior part the waves and lead the party to safe ground. Currently, there is only one name that has even been mentioned for this role: Paul Ryan. The only problem is, Ryan is not a fool and can see how doomed to failure any speaker is going to be right now. He's said over and over again that he's not running for speaker, no matter how much everyone is begging him to do so. Ryan knows that accepting the job might just be the end of his political career, and it's no surprise that he's got his sights set higher than ""ended his career as a disastrous speaker of the House.""The third option is to have someone else swoop in and save the House Republicans from themselves. The speaker of the House does not actually have to be a sitting House member, so in theory they could elect anyone to the job. Which has given rise to much high-spirited speculation about who could come in as some sort of enforcer to whack some heads and get some things done. Think this is an impossibility? Well, consider one name being batted around: Dick Cheney. That'd be interesting, that's for sure. The showdown between Darth Cheney and the backbenchers could raise a lot of money on pay-per-view, don't you think? Heh. Others seriously (or unseriously) proposed include Newt Gingrich (no stranger to unruly Houses) and Mitt Romney. Why not Michele Bachmann or Sarah Palin? They don't seem to be doing much of anything, and would likely relish the fun of being speaker. Oh, you betcha!Snark aside, that leaves what is now looking more and more like the most likely outcome: Speaker John Boehner goes nowhere. He is forced to keep his leadership position because there is nobody else House Republicans can agree upon. Holding the vote for the next speaker is entirely at the discretion of the sitting speaker, so Boehner is simply not going to have such a vote until his caucus can guarantee one candidate will indeed get 218 votes. Until that happens, Boehner will remain in charge, whether he likes it or not.Which leads us straight into a bout of conspiratorial thinking. We have absolutely nothing to base this on, we're just offering the meme up to the wider online world to see where it goes. What if this was all some sort of brilliant move by Boehner to show the Tea Partiers that not supporting Republican leadership leads straight to chaos? ""See -- you can't even agree among yourselves,"" Boehner (in this scenario) is pointing out. ""How are you going to take on Obama and the Senate Democrats when you can't even get your own act together?!?"" It'd be awfully Machiavellian of Boehner to have engineered this chaos as an instructional tool, but it certainly could free him of ever paying any attention to the Tea Partiers again.Maybe Boehner is actually going to be the Denny Hastert figure. By showing the world the Tea Partiers' chaos and impotence, Boehner could be free to begin operating the House in an entirely new fashion. Budget bill due? Boehner could -- from the very start, and not waiting until the last minute -- sit down with Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, and Mitch McConnell, and hash out some bill that is acceptable enough to both sides to gain the necessary votes in both houses. Boehner might let the Tea Partiers have a few tantrums on the House floor, but then he'd quickly move on to passing bills in a timely fashion. By doing so, he'd actually wind up advancing the conservative agenda a lot further than the Tea Partiers have ever managed to do, since he'd be able to write these bills weighted heavily with Republican priorities (but without deal-killing measures like defunding Planned Parenthood or overturning Obamacare). The Tea Partiers would scream and gibber, but they'd have no power to change the outcome.This is what John Boehner has wanted to do all along, it should be noted. He's always wanted to engage in such deal-making, because he thinks he's pretty good at it (and he thinks that's what the speaker of the House is supposed to do). He has been stymied at every turn, but if he now shifted the way the House operated back to its historical role in legislating, there'd be nothing the Tea Partiers could do, at least not until they came up with their own candidate who could get the necessary 218 votes.Do we really think Boehner is capable of such a Machiavellian plot? Not really, if truth be told. If this does come to pass -- Boehner moving into the Hastert role -- then it is likely just coincidence. By all reports, Boehner was shocked that McCarthy had to withdraw yesterday. Unless he's a lot better actor than we've so far seen, it's hard to argue that he would have been so shocked if this was all some master plan of his.Anyway, that's where we're at in the heart of the chaos. Either Paul Ryan is going to magically save the House Republicans by riding to the rescue on his flying unicorn, or John Boehner is going to remain speaker of the House until at least December of 2016. The safe bet right now would (we suppose) be on Boehner keeping his job, but in these chaotic times, your guess is as good as ours as to how this is all going to play out.As can be expected in such a time of Republican chaos, many Democrats and their fellow travelers were more than happy to point out the ludicrous nature of Republicans not being able to come up with a single candidate for what is supposed to be one of the most prestigious and powerful jobs in Washington. Being speaker of the House is (or used to be) an honor, a position of leadership, and a much-sought-after job. Not these days.While many stood out in their reactions to the Republican chaos, there was one response that perfectly captured the situation. Representative Mark Takano, a Democrat from California, put together a hilarious draft ""for hire"" Craigslist posting. The mix of snark and normal job posting language makes it an instant classic in the world of political satire. Our favorite (as mentioned previously) is the ""Babysitting experience STRONGLY PREFERRED"" bit, since that one phrase sums Boehner's past problems up better than we've yet heard anywhere else.Here's the text of the Takano's fake job vacancy ad:SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE (Washington, D.C.)Brilliant! A hilarious bit of icing for the chaos cake we've all been served up, this week. For gloriously using satire to point out the collapse of the House Republican Party, Mark Takano has more than earned himself a Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week award.[Congratulate Representative Mark Takano on his House contact page, to let him know you appreciate his efforts. And his sense of humor, of course.]Hillary Clinton moved further towards progressivism this week, when she kind-of sort-of came out against the Trans-Pacific Partnership free-trade deal. This is a tough sell for Clinton, since a lot of the negotiations towards writing the agreement happened while she was running the State Department. But what struck us was the monstrous amount of wiggle room she left herself while supposedly announcing she wouldn't support the deal. Here's the quote, from an interview on PBS: ""As of today, I am not in favor of what I have learned about it."" So, she's not in favor of the deal? Well, not really -- that can be parsed as she's not in favor of what she just learned about it, but would support the deal with a few changes. Also note that ""as of today"" qualifier. For such a lawyerly answer, Clinton at least deserves a (Dis-)Honorable Mention. Contrast her statement to just about anything Bernie Sanders has said on the subject during the past six months, to see why.But our Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week award goes to a political action committee this week. The ""Draft Biden"" group was formed (unsurprisingly) to draft Joe Biden to run for the presidency. Pretty self-explanatory. However, the group made news this week when it announced it would begin airing a television ad to convince Joe that the time had come to throw his hat in the ring. That's not all that controversial, as similar groups have launched similar efforts in the past to convince politicians that they already have a support team behind them.What was controversial was the ad itself, which was a pretty naked bit of emotional manipulation. The entire spin of the ad was, in essence, that Joe Biden has tragically lost family members -- multiple times -- and because of this, he'd make a great president. Sound cynical? Watch the ad and decide for yourself.By week's end, the ad was hastily shelved, after Biden let it be known that he didn't exactly approve that message. Joe Biden still hasn't made up his mind. It's nice that there's a group of people devoted to trying to convince him to do so, but they need to seriously readjust how they're going about it. Emotional propaganda probably isn't going to help Joe make up his mind, one way or another.For their ham-handed first ad, the group Draft Biden is this week's Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week. Back to the drawing board, guys.[We routinely refuse to provide links to campaign web sites, and we're extending this ban to political action committees supporting candidates, so you'll have to look up Draft Biden's contact information on your own, to let them know what you think of their actions.]Volume 365 (10/9/15)Obviously, this was a one-subject week, after Kevin McCarthy's stunning announcement. So this week's talking points are all centered on the ongoing circus in the House Republican caucus. As James Carville once famously said: ""When you're opponent's drowning, toss him an anchor.""All of these are, in one form or another, designed to get people thinking about why they'd ever want to vote for a Republican if this is the best they can manage to do when they get to Washington. More and more, the 2016 election is shaping up to be one for Democrats to score a record victory, due to the Republican strategy of self-immolation.I mean, seriously, when the best answer to a crisis is to return to the status quo which created the crisis in the first place, it's pretty easy to point out the intellectual bankruptcy being displayed by the other side. ""Babysitting experience STRONGLY PREFERRED"" is still the best way to put it, but here are seven other suggestions. What deep bench?Is it too late in the year for baseball metaphors?""For quite some time, Republicans have been bragging about how 'deep' their 'bench' is -- how they had more qualified people to draw upon to run for president than the Democrats did. Well, Republicans have more House seats than they have in almost a century. So where is this vaunted 'deep bench' in the House? Nobody wants to lead the House Republicans? Nobody? Wow. So much for that deep bench -- in the end, that bench looks pretty darn shallow."" Speaker Trump?Here's another fun one to try out.""Maybe the House Republicans can use the vacant speaker's chair to do a test drive of all their presidential prospects. Put each of them in charge of the House for two weeks, to see what they'd get done. Of course, this might horrify some Republicans, when they consider what Speaker Trump or Speaker Carson would actually do. This brings up an interesting point -- if you can't imagine Donald Trump or Ted Cruz leading the House of Representatives, why should the rest of us give them the job of leading the country?"" Boo!A timely reference if ever there was one.""I think that for Hallowe'en this year, I'm going to dress up as a Freedom Caucus member and go around to all the House Republicans' offices. I can't imagine a scarier costume for them to see standing on their porch than that, personally. Boo! I've come to eat your brains! Everybody run!"" Why not throw them under the nearest bus?This one really cuts to the bone. To be asked of a non-Tea Party Republican in the House, of course.""Why don't you guys grow a spine and just throw the Freedom Caucus under the nearest bus? They've done nothing for you or your party except make you look like clowns and fools to the entire nation, after all. We Democrats know there are still House Republicans left who want to actually get on with the business of governing the country, so why don't you just walk away from the Freedom Caucus crazies? Why not reach across the aisle so we can both get some things done and solve a few problems? You've seen what they have to offer -- pointless and suicidal political grandstanding that accomplishes precisely nothing. Whenever you get tired of that, Democrats are more than willing to help you make the Freedom Caucus completely irrelevant. At this point, you seem like you don't have much of anything left to lose."" How about Nancy?If that last one wasn't snarky enough, go for the gold!""Nancy Pelosi has around 190 solid votes to make her the next speaker. Unlike pretty much every Republican I see, from John Boehner on down, it now looks like there are no Republicans at all who want the job. I don't blame them, really. But seeing as how that's the case, if 30 Republicans decided they were tired of watching a Republican speaker do an impossible job of trying to keep all their party's factions happy, they could just shift their votes to Pelosi. If some House Republicans care more about hating whoever is speaker than they care about advancing any kind of agenda, then why not give them a Democratic speaker to hate? They'd really be much happier hating Pelosi, and with a few dozen Republicans willing to work across the aisle, the country would be happier because there would be no more shutdowns or debt defaults on the horizon. The more I think about it, the more I see Speaker Pelosi as the answer to all the House Republicans' problems."" What, exactly, was the point?Have this one handy if Boehner announces he won't be stepping down, after all.""So after all that chaos, we're going to wind up right back where we started from? Really? Wow. John Boehner wants to retire as speaker, but now he can't because there is nobody else to do the job -- that's just stunning when you think about it. So what exactly was the point of all this drama? Boehner's still got a faction he can't control, and the faction wants to blow up everything if they don't get 100 percent of their way. The Tea Partiers are incapable of leading, and they refuse to follow. Sounds like a recipe for not a whole lot getting done in the next year."" We'll prove it!An oldie but a goodie, to end on.""You know, Democrats like to make a joke about a mythical Republican campaign slogan, and the events of this week seem to prove it more than anything else in recent memory. Republicans gained control of the House and the Senate, and they seem absolutely incapable of getting anything done -- they can't even find anyone willing to lead them in the House. It all goes to show that even though they don't actually use the slogan when they campaign, it is precisely what Republicans are all about: 'Government doesn't work -- elect us and we'll prove it!'""Chris Weigant blogs at: Follow Chris on Twitter: @ChrisWeigantBecome a fan of Chris on Huffington PostFull archives of FTP columns: FridayTalkingPoints.comAll-time award winners leaderboard, by rank"

(Photo by John Bulmer/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb29859260000cf0081dfff.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"My life began with one perplexing question: Who is daddy?Let me explain. From my earliest recollections, adults, when first meeting me, would invariably ask the question, ""Do you know who your father is?"" The query came from musicians and fans alike. I didn't really understand the question at first, because the answer seemed so obvious. My father was my daddy. Of course, they would follow up with statements like, ""You know he's a genius,"" which really meant nothing to a five- or ten-year-old. They would add proclamations like, ""He changed the music,"" and/or ""His music will be here for the next 300 years."" That also meant absolutely nothing to me. However, though I couldn't imagine 300 years, I could imagine one. So when told he would be a bigger name in 50 years, that did seem like a long, long time from then, so I chalked it up to nonsense, in my own toddling way. It seemed to me that in fifty years, I would be an old man -- and surely dad would've been forgotten by then.In my early teen years, having by then seen a lot of major artists come and disappear into obscurity, I was convinced these proclamations from ardent fans were pure hyperbole. But at fifteen, I began my love affair with drums. My understanding and views of music changed, and I clearly realized dad was a true badass. But so were his buddies Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, Art Blakey, and, of course, Max Roach (my teacher), and many others. I was clear on the huge influence of artists like Duke Ellington and Charlie Parker, and the impact they made on western music. I figured dad was definitely in the crowd, but I also noticed that even those greatest of artisans pretty much said the same things about my dad. The author's father, mother (Nellie Monk) and sister (Boo Boo). (Photo published in Time Magazine, Feb. 1964)Now you must understand that to me, Thelonious Sphere Monk was just daddy. He took me and my sister, Boo Boo [nickname], everywhere, and taught me how to treat girls, spin tops and change my sister's diapers, among many other things -- he did all of that Mr. Mom stuff. I can't recall even one time in my life when I ever called him Thelonious, or Monk, or pop, or anything other than daddy. I was far more focused on getting a chance to play with him, than who he was to the world. My first real clue about how admired my father was as a musical innovator came on the occasion of my mother's birthday. My dad decided the family should go see Duke Ellington and his orchestra at the Rainbow Grill in the Waldorf Astoria. When we entered the packed supper club, the band was wailing. With the colorful lighting, it all looked magical. And a magical moment it was. Without hesitation, Duke Ellington stopped his orchestra abruptly, went to the microphone and said ""Ladies and gentlemen, the baddest left-hand in the history of our music (obviously alluding to Thelonious' harmonic innovations) just came in -- Thelonious Monk."" There was a huge roar, and I knew this was special stuff. This was Duke Ellington talking, the Duke -- the greatest jazzman I knew. Soon after that, in the summer of my nineteenth year on earth, it happened. It was 1969, the year of my enlightenment. I was still living with my parents, and practicing my drums seven or eight hours a day. I was dedicated, focused and broke. Thelonious Monk performing with Art Blakey (Photo by David Redfern/Redferns/Getty)When my dad was home from touring, he would lay his head on his headboard resting against a wall that was, maybe, eight inches thick, with me practicing right on the other side. From the day I started practicing, until I was twenty years old, he never said a word about my playing, but that's another whole story.I was in my own world. There were no listening restrictions in the Monk household, so I was listening to dad, Duke, Jimi Hendrix, the Beatles, the Supremes, and Frank Sinatra -- everything, no limits. Then along came the music industry's move from Hi-Fi to stereo. I wanted a stereo, and decided to build one myself. I went to Lafayette Electronics in downtown Manhattan and purchased parts to build a speaker, though I was not fully familiar with the needs of a stereo system, I purchased parts for only one speaker -- a profoundly knuckle-headed move. However, on that hot summer day, I chose to build that one speaker, despite my technical mistake. Once it was completed, I needed to test it, but had a dilemma. It was big, 15 inches, plus a huge wooden cabinet. I wanted to go big. I was afraid to play a loud pop record, like my new Sly and the Family Stone album or something from a Motown group, but I wanted something I could turn up so I could hear this new speaker but not blow it up. So I decided on a quiet, smaller sounding group -- a trio record by my father. I can clearly remember lying down with my ear to the speaker and pressing the button for the automatic changer to drop the record. It was a recording that featured Art Blakey on drums and the great bassist, Oscar Pettiford, filling out the trio. They were playing my father's composition, ""Work."" I had never heard it before. It is one of his most difficult improvisational vehicles. I could easily hear it, but it was so difficult and different that I was amazed. I was savvy enough to tell it was special, extremely special.It was so special, I couldn't stop playing the melody over and over for the next hour, and the melody was only about a minute long. I was stunned at the genius of his rhythm, his harmonics and his precision. It all came together for me that hot summer afternoon. Right then, I realized that the guy resting in the room next to me, and listening to my practicing, was, in fact, a timeless genius named Thelonious Monk, the man that changed the music -- the man everyone had been talking about all my life. My dad was Thelonious Monk. And that was my name too. And it was humbling.My life changed just like the music. He'd done it to me too. That fifty-year thing was clearly conservative, since I'm now 65, and I see the 300-year thing is truly possible, if Beethoven and Mozart are any indicators. I got scared, but I got proud, and have been so ever since.I could have been born on a hilltop in another country with nothing, but instead, I was born to Thelonious and Nellie, and given a wonderful heritage. How lucky was I. God bless you daddy. I know exactly who you are, and I will always love you! Happy Birthday!Thelonious Sphere Monk, III (T.S.

We can disagree with our adversaries, even passionately, without attributing sinister motives or magical powers to them.  Having ""I'm right and you're wrong"" factions is hardly a new thing. Remember Buffalo Springfield's great 1967 anthem, For What It's Worth (by the great Steven Stills)? ""There's battle lines being drawn/ Nobody's right if everybody's wrong ... Singing songs and carrying signs/ Mostly say, hooray for our side.""  Almost 50 years later our signs still ""Mostly say hooray for our side."" Yet there are two sides to most everyone's two cents. (OK, not Donald Trump. Just in general.) As Stills suggested polarization really doesn't work out so well.   There is another, starker, description of polarization: Paranoid Style. In 1964 Richard Hofstadter wrote a now-classic article in Harper's Magazine entitled The Paranoid Style in American Politics. Hofstadter begins this essay: American politics has often been an arena for angry minds. In recent years we have seen angry minds at work mainly among extreme right-wingers, who have now demonstrated in the Goldwater movement how much political leverage can be got out of the animosities and passions of a small minority. But behind this I believe there is a style of mind that is far from new and that is not necessarily right-wing.He goes on: I call it the paranoid style simply because no other word adequately evokes the sense of heated exaggeration, suspiciousness, and conspiratorial fantasy that I have in mind. Hofstadter inventories many instances, from Joseph McCarthy's rabid anti-communism, to an 1895 Populist Party manifesto against the gold standard, to an 1855 anti-Catholic movement, followed by a litany of other examples: In the anti-Masonic movement, the nativist and anti-Catholic movement, in certain spokesmen of abolitionism who regarded the United States as being in the grip of a slaveholders' conspiracy, in many alarmists about the Mormons, in some Greenback and Populist writers who constructed a great conspiracy of international bankers, in the exposure of a munitions makers' conspiracy of World War I, in the popular left-wing press, in the contemporary American right wing....The Paranoid Style leads to many problems in our ability to seize opportunities, many of which are only available if most of us participate ... together. (The Paranoid Style, humorless, also is just a drag.)  Looking for an Exit Ramp?  Exit here to Post-Paranoid Politics.   There are a number of great people and groups seeking an end to the Paranoid Style in Politics. I myself -- a certified member of the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy, nobody to the right of me! -- am intimately involved with arch-progressive Joan Blades's LivingRoomConversations.org. Another member of its leadership, Debilyn Molineaux, also is national head of the Coffee Party that propounds a civility pledge ""to conduct myself in a way that is civil, honest, and respectful toward people with whom I disagree. I value people from different cultures, I value people with different ideas, and I value and cherish the democratic process.""  There are other groups, some calling themselves ""transpartisan,"" many constituting themselves into a ""Bridge Alliance"" committed to ""come together in civility, respect, and goodwill to solve problems together. Together, we can become a powerful and positive voice in the American political landscape advocating 'Country Before Party.'""  Is this news to you? It should be! The News Business thrives on reporting conflict. Joan Blades calls LivingRoomConversations.org a ""domestic peace initiative."" Peace is really bad for newspaper circulation so ... don't be shocked if this is the first you have heard of this.  Might not be the last. Thanks to the Huffington Post we've chipped a tiny hole in the Big Media Blackout. Yes, peace makes for boring blogs ... like this very one. Yet Peace is Healthy For Children And Other Living Things. We're unrepentant.  If you love being in an ""arena of angry minds,"" if ""animosities and passions"" are your idea of a good time, congratulations! Look around. The media is glutted with animosities. Feast on!  If, rather, you're curious about the rumored secret Exit Ramp from the Pain Lane of Paranoid Style Politics Freeway ...you just found it. Now you are in on the secret of this Very Underground Movement for Post-Paranoid Style Politics. Secret stuff. Powerful stuff. Now you know.  Take the Exit Ramp. Find us. Welcome home."

The former is made public immediately, but the latter is only accessible to the few who are gathered in the courtroom on the day a decision is announced.You could take a trip to the National Archives and listen to the the audio files there. Or you could wait until each fall and find them online.This week, The Oyez Project, an initiative at the IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law, posted audio for the opinion announcements for all the major cases the Supreme Court heard in its October 2014 term, which ended in June.That means you can now hear, download and share what happened inside the courtroom the moment every big case was handed down -- including what Chief Justice John Roberts said when he saved Obamacare a second time, when Justice Anthony Kennedy announced it's a constitutional right for same-sex couples to marry, and how Justice Samuel Alito affirmed Oklahoma's lethal injection protocol.But decision days are also noteworthy because the justices sometimes deviate from the script. They may occasionally note their dissents orally -- like Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who did so for the first time last year in an affirmative action case. Or they may even screw up, like when Justice Antonin Scalia mistakenly referred to his colleague Ruth Bader Ginsburg as ""Justice Goldberg.""""What did I say? Goldberg's gone!"" Scalia said to laughter from the courtroom. ""Sorry about that, Ruth."" That's also at Oyez.You can relive other memorable dissents from the past term, such as when Scalia called the Affordable Care Act ""SCOTUScare."" Or when Roberts chastised the court when it ruled for gay marriage, retorting, ""Who do we think we are?"" Or Justice Stephen Breyer's historic call for a challenge to the death penalty.If you're feeling resourceful, you can use the audio to re-enact your favorite case with puppies:For now, this is the next best thing to cameras inside the courtroom, so have at it.Also on HuffPost:"

Some shocked party members were said to be crying after his announcement.The prospect of holding the speaker’s gavel with a fractious caucus looks like an increasingly unpopular job, with top Republicans quickly issuing statements they would not seek the position. Some members have floated the idea of a “caretaker” speaker to preside temporarily. Other leadership options being discussed include current candidates, like the House Freedom Caucus’s Rep. Daniel Webster (R-Fla.), House Chaffetz Caucus candidate Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), and Rep. Lynn Westmoreland (R-Ga.).Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), has declined to seek the job, which for now leaves relative backbenchers as the only contenders.That creates a major problem for House Republicans ahead of the 2016 elections. The speaker is not only the leader of the Republican caucus and the House of Representatives, but also is the chief party fundraiser. In an age when politics is inseparable from the money funding it, House Republicans may find themselves in a financial bind if they don’t have a friend to the donor class in charge.To see the importance of the speaker to the party bottom line, take a look at how much money the departing (he hopes) Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) raised.Since becoming the party’s minority leader in 2007, Boehner has raised and donated at least $57 million for the National Republican Congressional Committee, according to Federal Election Commission records. He also helped raise large amounts for individual candidates across the country.Boehner also holds tight ties through his large network of former aides-turned-lobbyists to two outside groups spending big money to support House Republican candidates: the super PAC Congressional Leadership Fund, and the non-disclosing nonprofit American Action Network.Both of the congressmen who at one point were in line to succeed Boehner -- former Rep. Eric Cantor (R-Va.) and McCarthy -- are (or were, in Cantor’s case) also substantial fundraisers with connections to Wall Street and the Washington lobbying scene. Cantor operated his own super PAC and dark money nonprofit group to raise large donations.House Democratic Party leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Boehner’s predecessor as speaker, is an even more prolific fundraiser. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said Pelosi helped the party raise $100 million in 2014 elections.The current crop of announced speaker candidates don’t exactly have the same fundraising pedigree. The four-term Webster has raised just $4.7 million over his career. Chaffetz raised just $3.2 over five terms. And Westmoreland has raised a little more than $7 million over 12 years.Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.), a former National Republican Congressional Committee chairman, has floated himself as a possible interim speaker, but not a long-term solution. Walden is a good fundraiser, with more than $10 million raised since 2007 and a history of courting big donors through the NRCC.But there are others that GOP leadership would like to see in the top position. The most sought-after is Ryan. The former vice presidential nominee and current chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee issued his disinterest in pursuing the position within minutes of McCarthy’s withdrawal.Ryan is one of the party’s best fundraisers. Even before his stint as Mitt Romney's running mate, Ryan was a favorite of top Republican donors. The $9.4 million he raised in the 2014 election cycle was the second-most of any House candidate, behind only Boehner.It’s no surprise then that multiple reports say Boehner is pushing Ryan to reconsider and take the job. Ryan is said to have canceled multiple fundraisers he was set to attend this week to hear the party’s entreaties.So far, reports show that he remains uninterested.Also on HuffPost:"

Kate Brown (D), who appeared with him on Friday, he would do everything he could to help prevent other shootings from happening.""I've obviously got very strong feelings about this,"" Obama said, according to a White House pool report.""We're going to have to come together as a country, but today is about the families,"" Obama added.Several gun-rights activists protested Obama's appearance by carrying signs and handguns along the road the president took to meet with family members.After the Oregon shooting on Oct. 1, Obama expressed frustration with lawmakers for not taking action to strengthen gun laws, saying mass shootings have ""become routine.""""We've become numb to this,"" Obama said in a statement given from the White House.Obama has given statements on at least 15 mass shootings, including the UCC massacre, during his time in office. He has continually called for tighter gun control laws, something many Americans agree with. According to a HuffPost/YouGov poll, nearly half of Americans think laws governing the sale of handguns should be stricter, and a majority of Americans favor requiring a background check to be completed before all gun sales.Senate Democrats unveiled plans for gun control reforms, including a stronger background check system, less than one week after the Oregon shooting. The reforms are modeled after the Manchin-Toomey bill proposed in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook shooting, where 20 children and six adults where killed by a gunman at an elementary school in Connecticut. That bill failed in the Senate.A HuffPost/YouGov poll shows 40 percent of Americans know someone who was fatally shot or who committed suicide using a gun. Twenty-two percent of American adults say they personally know someone who was killed by another person with a gun, with 6 percent saying the victim was someone in their family.Also on HuffPost:"

Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to be the next speaker.It was all they could talk about after a GOP conference meeting on Friday morning.""I would love to see Paul Ryan run,"" said Republican Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.).""Yes. I want Paul Ryan,"" said Rep. Hal Rogers (R-Ky.), chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. ""I think he can unify the conference.""""Definitely my No. 1 pick,"" said Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.). ""He's considered very smart. Very hard-working. Very honest. He ran for vice president of the United States. So people who attack him, it would look as if they just won't accept anyone.""Even one other speaker candidate, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) and one potential candidate, Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), said they'd prefer Ryan.""I'm going to keep working on Paul Ryan,"" Issa said.""I would not run against Paul Ryan,"" Chaffetz said.The Wisconsin Republican, who chairs the House Ways and Means Committee, could also help to bring in money for the party, said Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.), chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee.""He is certainly known around the country. From an NRCC perspective, he'd be terrific,"" said Walden. ""He's a dear friend. I think he'd be a great speaker."" Mitt Romney, who tapped Ryan to be his vice president in his 2012 White House bid, also reached out to urge him to run for speaker.If only Ryan seemed interested.""Chairman Ryan appreciates the support he's getting from his colleagues, but is still not running for speaker,"" said Ryan's spokesman, Brendan Buck.Republicans are scrambling to find someone to lead the House after Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) unexpectedly dropped out of the speaker race on Thursday. He was widely expected to win, and there wasn't a backup plan. GOP lawmakers have to elect someone soon -- Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) wants to leave Congress by the end of the month, though he said he'll stick around through the speaker race debacle.Not everyone is so sure they want Ryan to run. Backers of tea party favorite Rep. Daniel Webster (R-Fla.) still want him to be speaker instead. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) told reporters the decision to delay Thursday's election after McCarthy dropped out made the GOP caucus look like a ""banana republic.""And fellow members of Ryan's Ways and Means Committee said he'd be a great speaker, but that he had important things to do as leader of the tax-writing panel.""I would love to see tax reform accomplished, and I think it can best be accomplished if Paul is the chair,"" said Rep. Dave Reichert (R-Wash.).Another Ways and Means Committee member, Rep. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.) allowed that at least Ryan was thinking about it, despite Ryan's own all-but-complete rejection of the idea.""Obviously, being a vice presidential candidate, there's a calling to serve,"" Reed said. ""I think what he's going through is making the analysis of how best can he serve the country, how best can he serve the American people. And that's why this is a tough decision for him.""Some veteran lawmakers thought Ryan could still change his mind.""I know Paul Ryan pretty well, and I think so highly of him. He always does the right thing,"" said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.). ""I'm sure he'll think it through and do the right thing here. And in my opinion, the right thing is for him to run.""For now, it comes down to Ryan deciding for himself. His colleagues are watching for signs that maybe, maybe, he'll come around and run.""He's smiling today, so that's good,"" said Rep. Kristi Noem (R-S.D.)."
