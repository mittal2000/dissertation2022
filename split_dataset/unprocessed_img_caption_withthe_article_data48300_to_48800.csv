2,TRAVEL,"Top Things To Do In Kona, Hawaii","Shannon Ullman, ContributorWriter, blogger, teacher",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-top-things-to-do-in-k_b_11569170.html,Kona and the Big Island itself are absolutely stunning both on the ground and in the air.,2016-08-20,A large sea turtle silhouetted against the warm summer sun of hawaii and its deep clear waters.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9b1cbd1f0000500020bd86.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Once the home of ancient, Hawaiian kings, Kona has never lost its sought after status even to this day. Protected by mountains and rarely seeing poor weather, this city on the Big Island of Hawaii is full of adventure, experience and an ideal way of life for people who have come to live and travel here over the years. More of a tiny sea port than a city; Kona has a laid back atmosphere and is well known for snorkeling, coffee plantations, sport fishing and soaking up the sun rays. If you plan on visiting Kona on your next trip to the Big Island, here are some of the top things to do. Manta Ray DivingManta Rays; they are one of the sea's most friendly creatures with their cute underbelly faces, playful nature and what seems to be a willingness to be around people. With a tendency to come out at night, one of the most popular ways to see Manta Rays is on a night dive. Big Island Divers has been operating in Kona since 1984 and has been offering tourists the chance to get up close and personal with these gentle giants after dark. Using light beams in the water to attract the Manta Rays to plankton, the experience allows divers to watch these creatures in their element without having to search too hard for them. Whale WatchingSurrounded by sea, Kona is one of the top places to see marine life on the island. Aside from the Manta Rays, another popular sea life encounter involves the much bigger and harder to spot whale. Humpback whales are frequently spotted along the Big Island coast as they migrate through the Hawaiian Islands during the Winter months and Dan McSweeney's whale watching tours allows visitors to not only view these giants but also to learn about them. This personalized tour is led by McSweeney himself who has worked as a dedicated whale researcher for many years and uses part of his profits to actually help the whales in the process. Sport Fishing Kona is renowned as one of the top sport fishing destinations in the world, so heading out on a trip dedicated to the sport is highly recommended for all of the budding fishermen out there. A Kona fishing trip is a very popular activity that can make your trip to the Big Island memorable and may be the perfect activity for couples, family or individuals who just want to get out on their own and experience the adventure of reeling in a big one off the coast of Hawaii. Family owned and operated for more than 40 years, Humdinger Sportfishing is a great option for first timers or seasoned anglers who want to connect with a giant Blue Marlin, Yellow Fin Tuna or Wahoo. TripAdvisor shows off their excellent reviews and the company has earned a Certificate of Excellence in 2016 as a top provider of Kona fishing charters.Helicopter Tours Kona and the Big Island itself are absolutely stunning both on the ground and in the air. The Big Island of Hawaii is rare in that 13 of the 15 climate zones on earth can be found here, and due to its size and diverse topography, it's hard to take in all the island has to offer from the ground. For a way to see the sights a little bit differently, a helicopter tour is a great way to cover a lot of ground in a short period of time. With a bird's eye view, you can check out the waterfalls, volcanoes and tropical forests during a thrilling journey through the clear blue skies. Blue Hawaiian Helicopter Tours is a reputable company who has been showing their guests a different side of Hawaii for over 25 years. Get the best views of Waipio Valley, Mauna Kea and the spectacular Hamakua Coast."
3,TASTE,Teeling Whiskey: The Irish Phoenix,"Joseph V. Micallef, ContributorBest Selling Military History and World Affairs Author and Key...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/teeling-whiskey-the-irish_b_11556552.html,,2016-08-20,2016-08-17-1471402197-8345126-TeelingBirthday48.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-08-17-1471402197-8345126-TeelingBirthday48-thumb.jpg,"The Teeling Whiskey Company, Dublin's newest distillery The logo of the Teeling Whiskey Company is a phoenix - that mythical bird which is periodically consumed by fire only to be reborn from its ashes. It is a fitting symbol for Teeling Whiskey, the Teeling family and for the revival of the Irish whiskey industry; an industry with which the Teeling family has had a long association.The Teelings has been distilling Irish whiskey since 1782, when Walter Teeling set up a craft distillery on Marrowbone Lane in the area of Dublin known as the Liberties. This period was the beginning of the first Irish whiskey boom and would at its height see over 37 independent distilleries in Dublin alone. The industry peaked in 1900, when it produced around 12 million cases of Irish whiskey. World War I, Prohibition in the United States, the Irish War of Independence and subsequent civil war, poorly thought out Irish government regulations, plus ongoing trade disputes with Great Britain, all combined to steadily erode the whiskey industry's sales over the following three-quarters of a century. By the end of 1972, production had fallen too just under 500,000 cases and there were only two operating distilleries left, Midleton and Bushmills, both owned by Irish Distillers Ltd. (IDL). This was the nadir of Irish whiskey. Two events would mark the start of the Irish whiskey revival, the purchase of IDL by the French wine and spirits conglomerate Pernod Ricard in 1988 and the founding of the Cooley Distillery in 1987 by John Teeling. When it opened, Cooley was the first new whiskey distillery in Ireland in over a century. Beam Incorporated purchased Cooley on January 17, 2012, and since renamed it Kilbeggan after its flagship brand. Suntory in turn purchased Beam on April 30, 2014. Since 1989, Irish whiskey production has soared; surpassing seven million cases in 2014, and is expected to surpass the old record of 12 million cases by 2018. The staff at Teeling Whiskey celebrate the distillery's first birthday The Teeling Whiskey distillery was opened in 2013, only a short walk from where the original Teeling distillery was set up in 1782. The distillery was the first new distillery in Dublin in 125 years and the first distillery to produce whiskey there since 1976. The company's three copper pot stills pay tribute to the Dublin tradition of triple whiskey distillation, while continuing with the innovative cask finishing techniques used by Cooley Distillery.Currently, Teeling offers three separate categories of Irish whiskey: a single malt range, a grain whiskey and a blended Irish whiskey. The Teeling single malt range features a blend of single malt whiskies that has been finished in barrels that previously held sherry, port, Madeira, white Burgundy or Cabernet Sauvignon. The company does not disclose the source of the malt whiskey. Most of the whiskey came from stocks at the family's Cooley Distillery before it was sold. Some of the older whiskies feature the pronounced stone fruit taste and aroma profile that usually points strongly to Bushmills, due to its use of crystal malts in the production process, as the likely source. Crystal malts are made from malted barley that is cooked prior to drying. The heat from the kilning caramelizes some of the sugars in the barley and, for reasons that are not entirely clear, produces a distinctive stone fruit flavor in the resulting whiskey.The single malt expressions range from a premium bottling comprised of a vatting of malt whiskeys that have been aged on five different types of wine casks, and that carries no age statement, to a range of specialty bottlings ranging in age from 13 to 30 years. There is also a Teeling Revival 13-year-old (YO) bottled at 46% alcohol by volume (ABV), which has been finished for a year in a cask that previously held Calvados, an apple brandy from Normandy, and a 24 YO double distilled single malt bottled at 48.3% ABV. There is also a 23 YO sherry cask finish expression, 52.5% ABV, that is available only at the distillery as a custom bottling. Teeling single malt Irish whiskey Teeling Single Malt, No Age Statement, 46% ABV, 70 clAppearance: The whiskey has a bright gold color and consists of a blend of malt whiskies that have been separately finished in casks that previously contained sherry, port, Madeira, white Burgundy and Cabernet Sauvignon. The vatted malt includes stocks up to 23 years old. Nose: On the nose there is a pronounced ""grapeiness,"" like grape jelly, followed by cereal notes, a hint of shortbread and some butterscotch. There are pronounced tropical fruit aromas of melon and fig as well as ripe apple and some red fruits, sort of a fruit cocktail, followed by some citric orange notes and just a hint of chocolate.Palate: On the palate the tropical fruit flavors of mango, melon and pineapple are even more pronounced, especially with the addition of a little water. There are baking spice notes of cinnamon, cloves as well as a bit of ginger pepperiness, followed by notes of chocolate, some orange marmalade and some vanilla. There is a hint of smoke in the background, more wood smoke than peat, and a bit of woodiness.Finish: The finish is medium length, well balanced, featuring tropical fruits, spice and just a hint of bitterness. The tropical fruit notes tend to persist giving the finish a slight sensation of sweetness. Conclusion: This is an excellent whisky, offering a complex array of fruit and spice notes. It is well integrated, nicely balanced, with a satisfying finish. Rating: Appearance: 8/10, Nose, 26/30, Palate 27/30, Finish 27/30 Overall Score: 88/100Teeling 23 YO Irish malt whiskey Teeling Single malt, 23 YO, 52.5 ABV, Sherry Cask Finish, Single Cask Bottling #6836.Appearance: The whiskey has a rich, brown mahogany color typical of sherry cask aged whiskies. Nose: On the nose there are ripe apple and pear notes, followed by some caramel and some dried fruit aromas of fig, a little apricot and some raisin. Palate: On the palate there is a thick, smooth, creamy sensation typical of sherry cask finished whiskies. There is a pronounced stone fruit taste of ripe peach, some raisin, followed by light tropical fruit notes. There are some spice notes with a hint of pepperiness, and just a touch of wood. There is a slight, dried fruit sweetish note that hangs throughout.Finish: The finish is long, with a distinctive caramel and peppery notes, and interlaced with dried fruit sweetness and a creamy texture on the mouth.Conclusion: This is an outstanding whiskey, extremely well integrated with a complex range of ripe and dried fruit flavors. The sherry cask influence is unmistakable and contributes the sweetness and creamy texture typical of sherry cask finishing. The pepperiness is a nice counterpoint to the sweet note that hangs in the background.Rating: Appearance: 9/10, Nose: 28/30, Palate: 29/30, Finish: 28.30 Final Score 94/100Additional bottlings, now hard to find, but which occasionally turn up, include a Revival 15 YO rum cask finished bottling and a 21 YO, 26 YO and 30 YO Vintage Reserve single malt bottlings.Teeling also offers a Single Grain Red Wine Cask Finished bottling, which is completely matured in Cabernet Sauvignon wine barrels from California. The expression carries no age statement, but is believed to be around five years old and is bottled at 46% ABV. The grain whiskey is sourced from the Cooley Distillery. The mash bill is 95% corn and 5% malted barley. Teeling Single Grain Irish whiskey Teeling Single Grain Red Wine Cask Finish, NAS, 46% ABV  Appearance: The whiskey has a rich golden bronze color with a slight orange tint.Nose: On the nose there is a distinctive bourbon-like corn sweetness, followed by red fruit and kirsch notes with vanilla, coconut and baking spices.Palate: On the palate there is a soft, creamy honey sweetness, vanilla, a bit of buttery shortbread, and pepper. There are red fruit notes throughout, with a bit of a wood note hanging in the background.Finish: The finish is long, peppery, with a caramel sweetness throughout. Conclusion: This is an interesting whiskey. It's smooth, and offers a broad array of flavors but like most Irish grain whiskies lacks the intensity of pot still malt. It's easy to drink and its fruity notes would make for an excellent aperitif. Rating: Appearance: 7/10, Nose 24/30, Palate 25/30, Finish 26/30 Final Rating: 82/100 Finally, the company has a Small Batch whiskey offering that consists of a blend of Irish grain (65%) and malt whiskies (35%), which are married in Flor de Cana rum casks for six months and bottled at 46%  ABV. The expression carries no age statement but is believed to contain whiskies between four and seven years of age. Teeling Small Batch Irish whiskey Teeling Small Batch, NAS, 45% ABVAppearance: The whiskey has a rich golden color. Nose: On the nose there are distinct ripe fruity aromas featuring, apricot and a bit of peach, followed by apple and pear notes. There is a bit of a cooked sugar, caramel, cotton candy sweetness throughout. There is also a very slight medicinal, herbal note in the background.Palate: On the palate the whiskey is sweetish, featuring a creamy mouthfeel. There are flavors of apricot and apple, with some vanilla and spice and peppery notes, as well as cooked sugar notes of caramel and a bit of molasses.Finish: Medium length, featuring sweet and fruity notes initially, with some woodnotes and a bit of dryness at the end.Conclusion: This is a good whiskey. The rum cask finish adds some additional flavors and complexity as well as a cooked sugar sweetness. Rating: Appearance 7/10, Nose, 26/30, Palate 26/30, finish 25/30 Final Rating: 84/100As the Teeling family enters its third century of whiskey distillation, its new namesake distillery is well poised to continue a long-standing tradition of producing superb, finely crafted whiskies that bridge both the traditions of traditional Irish whiskey and contemporary production and finishing techniques. The Irish whiskey revival is still in its infancy, and both it and Teeling whiskey will no doubt have many more interesting and flavorful surprises in store for Irish whiskey enthusiasts."

Kiev had signed the Ukraine-European Union Association Agreement on June 27, 2014, with high hopes that it would eventually lead to a full application to join the European community by 2020. Petro Poroshenko, Ukraine's then newly elected president, had described the 2014 agreement as a ""first but most decisive step"" toward joining the EU. The initial agreement had been followed by Ukraine joining the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area on January 1, 2016. That agreement gives selected Ukrainian business sectors access to the EU's internal common market. It also guarantees European investors in those sectors the same regulatory environment that currently exists within the EU. Similar agreements have been signed with Moldova and Georgia. The agreement is designed to bring the Ukrainian economy, its political governance and the legal system up to EU standards, and to pave the way for formal entry into the EU.Now, in the wake of Brexit, any hope of becoming a full-fledged member of the EU has receded into the indefinite future.In the meantime, of late, Moscow has been reminding Kiev of its strategic vulnerability by ratcheting up tension with Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin, on August 11, accused Ukraine of staging two ""incursions"" into Crimea to infiltrate ""trained saboteurs"" in order to target ""critical infrastructure"" over the weekend of August 5. Russia has claimed that one of its soldiers and an employee of the FSB security agency were killed. Putin used the alleged incident to cancel Russian participation in scheduled talks in Normandy, France to discuss the implementation of the Minsk Peace Accord between Russia and Ukraine.The Ukrainian government labeled the Russian claim ""a fantasy,"" and accused Putin of deliberately escalating tensions in the two-year-old conflict between the two countries. In the meantime, the Kremlin announced that the Russian Navy would be staging ""war games"" in the Black Sea. Several days later the Kremlin also announced that it would deploy the advanced S-400 Triumph air-defense missile system in the Crimea, as well as stage additional military exercises along its eastern border with Ukraine.According to Pentagon sources, Russia has deployed approximately 40,000 troops, along with tanks, armored personnel carriers and air force units, in eight separate staging areas along Ukraine's eastern border. In addition, an unspecified number of troops in adjoining rear areas are slated to also participate in the exercises. Unmarked Russian soldiers blocking access to the Ukranian Perevalne military base in the Crimea, March 9, 2014Russian intentions are unclear. The announced exercises could be nothing more than saber rattling on Moscow's part or a prelude to a future invasion of Ukraine. Russia conducted similar military exercises prior to its seizure of Crimea on February 27, 2014. Moreover, the Kremlin has a long history of such saber rattling, both as a prelude to negotiations and as a prelude to a military intervention. The upshot is that Kiev finds itself increasingly in an economic and diplomatic no-man's-land, dangerously perched between Russia and the EU, dependent on both but not formally within either bloc. Currently, about a sixth of Ukraine's external trade is with Russia, a third is with the EU, and the balance with a variety of other countries. For the Kremlin, Ukraine is simply too important strategically to ever allow it to become a full-fledged member of either the EU or NATO. Ideally, Russia would want a pro-Russian government in power, but it could live with a neutral government. A pro-Western government integrated into the EU and NATO, as has happened with the other former Warsaw pact states in Eastern Europe, would be simply unacceptable. The Kremlin has made it clear that a NATO membership for Ukraine would immediately precipitate a Russian invasion. That threat would persuade most NATO members to defer a Ukrainian request for membership rather than risk finding the organization being called on to defend its newest member from a Russian invasion.Is Russia considering a second invasion of Ukraine? Perhaps eventually, but probably not for the moment. To begin with, the Russian military simply lacks the manpower to invade and occupy Ukraine. Such an invasion would also kill any prospects of lifting the economic sanctions against Russia imposed by the EU and the United States. It would also breathe new life and resolve into NATO at a time when the organization is uncertain about its ongoing role and mission. A more limited invasion, say the seizure of Odessa, and/or the portions of the Black Sea coast between Odessa and Crimea, or the coastline along the Sea of Azov, would be more attainable militarily but would still precipitate the same consequences as a full-fledged invasion. Pro-Russian seperatists in Sloviansk with armored perrsonel carrierInstead what is more likely is that the saber rattling is part of a broader Russian strategy of keeping Ukraine unbalanced by alternating between the possibility of peace and the prospect of renewed fighting, while at the same time giving the EU and NATO a not so subtle warning that cozying up to Kiev will draw them into the middle of a hot war zone. Moreover, the lack of a strong response by either NATO or the U.S. to the Russian escalation of tensions allows the Kremlin to send an equally unsubtle message to the former Soviet states and clients in the ""Near Abroad"" that they cannot rely on Europe, the United States or NATO should their security be threatened. Vladimir Putin's hold on the Kremlin may also be an issue here. In recent weeks Putin has made significant changes to his inner circle, in what some intelligence analysts have described as a purge. He abruptly replaced his longtime Chief of Staff and close confident, Sergei Ivanov, with Anton Vaino. Additionally, a raft of high-level officials has been removed, some on the pretext of criminal activity, over the last few weeks. Saber rattling in Ukraine allows Putin to project an image of power and authority, even if in the end it proves to all be a bluff.Among the Russian elite, privately, Putin is blamed for seriously mishandling the situation in Ukraine. Between 2012 and 2016, Kiev went from a pro-Russian government to a pro-Western government. Russia was left with control of just Crimea and the eastern portion of the Donbas basin. There is little doubt that the U.S. and its allies were responsible for encouraging and partially funding the Euromaidan protests that precipitated the 2014 revolution. Those protests would never have started, however, had the Kremlin and the pro-Russian government of Viktor Yanukovych not overreached in trying to bring Ukraine into closer ties with the Russian Federation.Beyond keeping tension in the region high, Russia has not managed to accomplish much in Ukraine since its 2014 invasion. The Ukrainian Army has effectively contained the separatists from further expansion, even though it has not been able to roll them back in a significant way. Only with significant ground support from the Russian military can the separatists hope to expand their enclaves. In the meantime, the imposition of economic sanctions against Russia came at a time when the Russian economy was already reeling from the collapse of crude oil prices. The sanctions have lasted longer than the Kremlin imagined they would and, coupled with ongoing low petroleum prices, their impact on the Russian economy has been profound. Pro-Russian demonstrators in Odessa, April 13, 2014 Over the last two years the dollar-ruble exchange rate has gone from 36 rubles to 63 rubles to the dollar. Foreign investment has virtually dried up and the economy and the standard of living has been contracting. Ultimately, the Russian strategy toward Ukraine will be shaped by two, at times conflicting, objectives: the need to eliminate the economic sanctions against Russia and the need to ensure that the government in Kiev is ideally a pro-Russian or, at worst, a strictly neutral government. A military intervention at this time may solve the governmental issue at the expense of aggravating the economic one. For that reason, a military solution is the least desirable option and would only be used if Moscow saw Kiev slipping irreversibly from its grasp, i.e., joining NATO or a full membership in the EU. Alternatively, if a political or diplomatic solution can't be found, Russia's elite might opt to offer its own version of a ""reset button,"" ousting Putin and blaming him for the Ukrainian debacle and offering to ""normalize"" relations with Ukraine, Europe and the United States. It's unlikely that the Kremlin would ever give up its control of Crimea. Some compromise over the status of the Russian separatists in the Donbas basin and a full implementation of the Minsk Peace Accords in return for keeping Ukraine out of NATO and stopping short of a full membership in the EU common market, might, however, lead to the elimination of the sanctions.A more aggressive deployment of U.S.air forces in Eastern Europe and the prospect that they might be deployed to counter a Russian invasion of Ukraine would go a long way to taking the Russian military option off the table. Such a move might prompt the Kremlin to find a political and diplomatic solution. It would also be seen as a significant escalation by the United States, however, and could well precipitate a preemptive Russian military response before the U.S. deployment was operational. In the end, it will be all about who blinks first. So far Vladimir Putin has refused to blink. Europe and the United States have followed suit, despite the wavering of a few countries. Whether Russia's elite, whose pocketbook is certainly being decimated by the impasse, will prove to be as steadfast as Putin remains to be seen."

Kiev had signed the Ukraine-European Union Association Agreement on June 27, 2014, with high hopes that it would eventually lead to a full application to join the European community by 2020. Petro Poroshenko, Ukraine's then newly elected president, had described the 2014 agreement as a ""first but most decisive step"" toward joining the EU. The initial agreement had been followed by Ukraine joining the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area on January 1, 2016. That agreement gives selected Ukrainian business sectors access to the EU's internal common market. It also guarantees European investors in those sectors the same regulatory environment that currently exists within the EU. Similar agreements have been signed with Moldova and Georgia. The agreement is designed to bring the Ukrainian economy, its political governance and the legal system up to EU standards, and to pave the way for formal entry into the EU.Now, in the wake of Brexit, any hope of becoming a full-fledged member of the EU has receded into the indefinite future.In the meantime, of late, Moscow has been reminding Kiev of its strategic vulnerability by ratcheting up tension with Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin, on August 11, accused Ukraine of staging two ""incursions"" into Crimea to infiltrate ""trained saboteurs"" in order to target ""critical infrastructure"" over the weekend of August 5. Russia has claimed that one of its soldiers and an employee of the FSB security agency were killed. Putin used the alleged incident to cancel Russian participation in scheduled talks in Normandy, France to discuss the implementation of the Minsk Peace Accord between Russia and Ukraine.The Ukrainian government labeled the Russian claim ""a fantasy,"" and accused Putin of deliberately escalating tensions in the two-year-old conflict between the two countries.

And in a stunning development -- are you sitting down? -- he then did not stomp all over his message by saying monumentally stupid things for the rest of the week. No, really!",2016-08-20,"Republican U.S. presidential nominee Donald Trump attends a campaign rally at the Erie Insurance Arena in Erie, Pennsylvania August 12, 2016. REUTERS/Eric Thayer",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb826ac3c000032000dbecd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Some weeks, it's tough coming up with a subtitle for these columns. Some weeks, not so much. This is one of the latter, because the juxtaposition of a colorful (to say the least) description of Donald Trump with a soap opera's title just naturally presented itself.The quote comes in response to Trump's campaign shakeup, which we'll get to in a moment. One of the new people Trump hired comes from Breitbart News, and former Breitbart editor Ben Shapiro was being interviewed by CNN's Brianna Keilar for his response to the shakeup. Here is the transcript, for everyone's edification:SHAPIRO: I mean, as you probably know, I think Donald Trump's a turd tornado, but I also understand that he has no capacity whatsoever to control himself and be this staid politician that everyone wants him to be. Telling him to double down is not necessarily terrible strategy. If he's gonna go down, he's gonna go down being Trump.Thanks for clearing that up, Ben! We'll just add that to the images we never thought we'd have to think about in the world of politics (a list which has grown to epic proportions during this presidential race, it's worth pointing out). With such an auspicious metaphor to work with, let's see just how the turd tornado (turdnado?) turned last week.The week began with a speech Donald Trump read off a TelePrompTer. And in a stunning development -- are you sitting down? -- he then did not stomp all over his message by saying monumentally stupid things for the rest of the week. No, really! True, his message was stomped all over by the shakeup news from his campaign, but this is actually an improvement for Trump. There wasn't a single tweet or off-the-cuff statement at a rally that derailed Trump's message this week -- which has got to be a new record for him. How many days can he keep this up? We certainly don't know, as evidenced by the fact that on Monday we wrote of the inevitability of it already happening by the end of the week -- which we have to admit turned out not to be the case at all.Before we get to the shakeup, a word about Trump's messaging this week. He actually read three TelePrompTer speeches this week, and he seems to be improving (somewhat) on his delivery with each one. The first was on the subject of defeating terrorism and foreign policy in general. The Morning Joe program helpfully put together a mashup video of just a few of the things he said in Monday's speech that utterly contradict what he's said about the subjects in the past, which is pretty amusing to watch. The second was a law-and-order speech in front of a mostly-white audience, warning of the dangers of urban crime (which has been par for the course for Republicans since Richard Nixon's time, it's worth noting). By week's end, Trump had made some astonishing news in the third speech, but we'll get to that in a moment.The campaign shakeup news was rather ominous for Republicans, since Trump pushed aside the only guy running his campaign who has had actual experience running campaigns before, and replaced him with two additions -- a woman who worked for Todd Akin's campaign (in the ""outreach to women"" job -- you just can't make this stuff up), and a guy who ran Breitbart News, a website for those who think that Fox News is just another part of the mainstream media's liberal conspiracy. Yes, there are people out there who think Fox isn't rightwingy enough, and they all apparently get their news from Breitbart. They also get plenty of conspiracy theories, but that almost goes without saying. The new theme for the campaign, as Shapiro referenced above, is going to be returning to ""letting Trump be Trump."" Hoo boy. Buckle up, boys and girls!Little-noticed in the midst of all this news was the very first poll Breitbart ever commissioned, which was intended to ""unskew"" all that liberal polling saying Trump wasn't beating Clinton. The only problem was that even after all this unskewing, Clinton still beat Trump by five points. Guess they'll have to rework that unskewing formula, eh?But back to the Trump campaign. With Trump adding a Breitbart executive to his campaign, the rest of the Republican Party spent the entire week waiting for the other shoe to drop. Nobody knew what form it would take, but this morning that shoe hit the ground with a thump, with the announcement that Paul Manafort would be stepping down from the Trump campaign. All week long, the Trump campaign had insisted that they weren't going through a shakeup at all, they were instead expanding the campaign by hiring more people to run things. This falsehood was exposed with Manafort's resignation. The Trump campaign is now being run by people who have never run a national campaign for anyone before. And it's worth pointing out that this isn't the first such top-level shakeup in Trump's campaign (and likely won't be the last).All of this news has led to noticeable glee over in the Clinton camp (and among Democrats in general). It's easy to understand such giddiness, since Clinton's recent polling is so strong, both in battleground states and in previously-deep-red states as well. Tim Kaine is campaigning in places like Wyoming, Idaho, and Missouri (to be fair, the first two aren't realistic for Clinton to even hope for, as he was just fundraising there from wealthy Democrats). People are beginning to ask whether Trump's defeat will rival Barry Goldwater's -- and it's only August. With Trump doubling down on ""being Trump,"" things look pretty rosy for Hillary Clinton right now.But there's a cautionary tale running through the week that few inside-the-Beltway pundits have so far noticed. Could Trump actually be successfully pivoting, in the midst of the shakeup? He gave three TelePrompTer speeches, and had zero blowups this week. He didn't say (or tweet) anything so radical it dominated the news cycle in a negative way -- this during a week when naked Donald Trump statues mockingly appeared in multiple U.S. cities (more on that in the awards). He introduced his first two television ads of the general election. This is all new, for Trump. To end the week, Trump decided to pay a visit to flooding victims in Louisiana -- an opportunity for him to show some compassion and ""look presidential."" And in the third of those speeches he read this week, he kind-of sort-of apologized for all his previous outrageous statements. Here's what he read off the screen:Sometimes in the heat of debate, and speaking on a multitude of issues, you don't choose the right words or you say the wrong thing. I have done that. And believe it or not, I regret it. I do regret it, particularly where it may have caused personal pain. Too much is at stake for us to be consumed with these issues. But one thing; I can promise you this: I will always tell you the truth.Laughable as that might sound (especially that last line), this appears to be the first time Donald Trump has ever even remotely admitted any sort of mistake he's made during the campaign. So, to review: three speeches read from prepared texts, two new television ads that will run in battleground states, one presidential-looking photo op, zero speeches ad-libbed at rallies, zero new controversial statements, and one semi-apology. That's a much more focused Trump than we've yet seen. So perhaps all the Democratic celebration about his new campaign team might be a wee bit premature. Has Trump truly pivoted? Has he ridden out his own personal poopstorm? Time will tell. Perhaps this is all the final influence of Manafort, on his way out -- perhaps next week Trump will return to form. But even with all the campaign shakeup news, Trump had a better week on the campaign trail than usual.Finally, before we move along to the awards, we have to say a formal goodbye to John McLaughlin, who died earlier this week. The McLaughlin Group was a pioneer in political television, and for many (without cable subscriptions) was the only view into the contentious world that cable political shows have regularly become. With regulars on the right like Pat Buchanan and on the left people like Clarence Page, the show was always pretty freewheeling and interesting to watch. Countless political shows were inspired by their format, and McLaughlin had actually been trained as a Jesuit priest, which includes formal training in forming an argument (pro or con), so he was always able to examine strange angles and odd views that others routinely missed. OK, occasionally this veered into conspiratorial thinking, but McLaughlin usually seemed to be playing devil's advocate (rather than ""true believer"") by bringing such subjects up.We'll miss seeing John, and we'll miss his show. Every year in this space, we run our year-end list of ""McLaughlin awards,"" since his categories were so complete and well-thought out. So we have a personal connection to the show (even if they never knew about it). So, in homage, there is only one possible way to salute John McLaughlin: with the final phrase he used to close each of his shows, to show how we will miss his presence.""Bye-bye.""Occasionally, we redefine our awards, and this seems a dandy week to do so. Rather than handing out a Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week this week, we are handing out a Most Impressive Anarchist Collective Of The Week award instead. We thought that changing it to the MIACOTW award would be more appreciated by an anarchist group, who might be offended by being linked to any official political party (even in an award).The group INDECLINE had already made a name for itself by creating the largest-ever piece of illegal graffiti, by painting a political statement on a deserted military landing strip in the Mojave Desert. That's pretty cool, we have to admit, especially when you consider that they spent $20,000 creating it.But this week, INDECLINE outdid themselves, by placing a rather unflattering statue of a naked Donald Trump in five American cities (New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Cleveland, and Seattle). Being anarchists, they didn't ask anyone's permission, just set the statue up (and epoxied it to the ground, to make it harder to remove). This bit of political theater was even given a name: ""The Emperor Has No Balls."" Reportedly, the statue didn't, but it's hard to tell from the available photos.The artist, a guy from Las Vegas who goes by ""Ginger,"" reportedly ""has a long history of designing monsters for haunted houses and horror movies."" That certainly seems like experience enough to create such monstrous statues, at least in our humble opinion.The people behind the political theater knew their installations would be temporary. Reportedly, Cleveland was the fastest to remove it, while some in San Francisco are looking to preserve the statue in a suitable place. No real surprise there, we suppose.Regular readers of this column will know that we are suckers for political theater (good, bad, and indifferent). As always, such theater must be judged on how amusing it is and how effective it is. On both these scales, ""The Emperor Has No Balls"" has to rate somewhere near the top end. It's funny, it made a huge splash online, and now millions of people have laughed at a naked Trump provided by a group that few had ever previously heard of. All around, that's pretty impressive, and well worth our special Most Impressive Anarchist Collective Of The Week award. Well done![Congratulate INDECLINE on their official contact page, to let them know you appreciate their efforts.]This one wasn't hard to select this week. Former Pennsylvania state attorney general Kathleen Kane easily wins the Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week award for being convicted of nine criminal charges, two of them felonies. It's pretty disappointing when any Democrat is convicted of crimes, but when it is the person who is in charge of the entire state's justice and law enforcement divisions, it reaches a whole 'nother level.The whole story is convoluted and rather sad. It began with the Jerry Sandusky/Joe Paterno scandal, widened to sexist and racist emails, and wound up in a personal vendetta Kane waged against a political rival. The scandal not only shook up the Penn State's athletic department but also brought down two justices on the state supreme court, and even Kane's twin sister (who, it turned out, had sent some of the emails).At the heart of the charges against Kane was a leak of grand jury evidence that she later tried to pin on a scapegoat rather than admitting to leaking. Not only did Kane commit the crime, she also tried to cover it up, to put it more bluntly.Kane was once considered a rising star among Pennsylvania Democrats, but not any more (to put it mildly). Among her other woes this week, we simply have to add our own Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week. This was a shameful episode in the midst of an investigation of an even-more-shameful crime, and there's simply nothing good to say about it.[Since Kathleen Kane has quit her office, she is now a private citizen, and our longstanding policy is not to provide contact info for people not currently serving in office.]Volume 404 (8/19/16)We should really just be able to write ""Volume 404 -- Talking Points Not Found"" here, but we fear few would get the joke (and it'd be awfully lazy to do so). Kidding aside, we actually do have to admit we have been rather lazy in putting together the talking points for the past month or so. This was due to the fact that all it took was repackaging what Republicans were saying about Donald Trump. No Democratic input was even necessary -- just repeating the scathing things Republicans were saying was enough.This week, we're going to try to wean ourselves off this habit, by only providing a mere three (less than half!) of our talking points directly from Republicans slamming Trump. And we promise, our last talking point is one of the funniest we've come across yet, so there's that to look forward to.As always, use these talking points responsibly, and refrain from operating heavy machinery while doing so. Heh. The middle fingerThe Washington Post set the tone for what was going on this week, most notably in a headline to an article run immediately after the first news of the Trump campaign shakeup:Donald Trump's Hire Of Breitbart News Chief Is A Middle Finger To The GOP Establishment Right back atcha...Of course, to be fair, the number of Republicans giving Trump the finger has been growing for weeks, now.""You can't really blame Trump for turning his back on the GOP establishment, because they've been running away from his campaign in droves. The letter begging the R.N.C. to pull all money from Trump in a desperate attempt to salvage Congress, which was released last week, was initially said to have 70 signatures of Republicans on it. Now it's got more than 100. Maybe by next week it'll have another 50, who knows? Also last week, a member of George W. Bush's cabinet came out in support of Hillary Clinton. Will the last Republican to leave Trump's campaign please turn out the lights?"" Divine intervention necessaryGeorge Shultz weighed in on Trump this week, too.""When George Shultz -- one of the most-respected Republican foreign policy voices around -- was asked recently about the prospect of a Trump administration, his response was brief and personal: 'God help us.' Shultz is right -- if Donald Trump is elected president, this country is going to need all the divine intervention it can possibly get."" Sorry, you can't come inEven right-wing pundits are getting in on the act.""What with all the news about Trump's campaign shakeup, the content of his Monday TelePrompTer speech was all but ignored. But Washington Post conservative columnist Jennifer Rubin (whose column is even called 'Right Turn,' so you know where she's coming from) hilariously took Trump to task for his concept of 'extreme vetting.' Rubin pointed out that Trump might just be a victim of his own program, if his 'extreme vetting' idea were ever to become law. Trump would fail on the metrics of 'shares American values and respect for the American people,' as well as falling short on being one of 'those who we expect to flourish in our country and to embrace a tolerant American society.' Be careful what you wish for, Donald, as you might not pass your own test quite as easily as you might think."" What, precisely, was Trump apologizing for?The list is a long one.""Donald Trump issued a blanket 'apology' this week. It was actually a non-apology, merely that he 'regretted' having said some things which 'may have caused personal pain,' but it's as close to saying 'I'm sorry' as we're ever likely to get. But his remarks were generic, with no specifics. The Washington Post then helpfully compiled a list of two dozen things he might have been referring to. Somebody needs to ask Trump which items on this list his non-apology apology covers, just to clear things up. With so many to choose from, inquiring minds want to know precisely what Trump actually 'regrets' having said so far."" A conspiracy theory that makes senseThe facts do seem to fit....""Since Donald Trump began running, I've heard a lot of wild-eyed conspiracy theories from the left over what his plans actually were going to turn out to be. Most of these involved reading Trump's mind and figuring out what his next move would be. Almost all of them have so far been proven hilariously wrong. My personal favorite was: 'Trump will drop out of the primaries the minute he loses his first state.' Or maybe: 'Bill Clinton talked Donald into destroying the Republican Party' -- that was a fun one, right? But there's a new conspiracy theory on the scene which actually could make a whole lot of sense. Is Donald Trump merely using a run for the presidency to launch his own branded media empire? Will 'Trump News' soon be on the air, competing with Fox News? Trump has reportedly been cozying up to Roger Ailes, and now he's got the head of Breitbart News running his campaign, so it's pretty easy to see how the effort could morph into 'Trump TV,' right after he loses in a landslide to Hillary Clinton. I mean, it could all make a twisted sort of sense, don't you think?"" Score one for NYC ParksIssuing dry press releases all day in a mundane local government department must get pretty boring. And then a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity crosses your desk....""The funniest thing I've heard this week was the official New York City parks department response, after they removed a nude statue of Donald Trump which had been illegally mounted in Union Square. Whoever came up with this gem deserves a raise, or a promotion to a P.R. job where they can better utilize their obvious skills. After removing the statue, an official statement was then released: 'NYC Parks stands firmly against any unpermitted erection in city parks, no matter how small.' NYC Parks certainly rose to that occasion, as it were.""Chris Weigant blogs at:Follow Chris on Twitter: @ChrisWeigantFull archives of FTP columns: FridayTalkingPoints.comAll-time award winners leaderboard, by rank"

In a state which may vote blue this November, Ayotte goes to great lengths to sound independent, almost like a Democrat. But is she? For instance, does she support her party's Presidential candidate?Her answer is complicated.Ayotte states: first, she will stand up to Donald Trump when he is wrong; second, she will not endorse him; third, she will not campaign by his side; and fourth she does intend to give him her vote, and has widely shared that decision.So is that a yes, or a no?Governor Hassan's position is easier to follow. She is for Hillary. She stands beside Secretary Clinton, speaks in favor of her, and proudly campaigns at the candidate's side.Well, what about the issues? Is there a significant difference?On the question of the Supreme Court vacancy, (President Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland is currently being blocked by a Republican Senate), Ayotte sat down for a meeting with Judge Garland, and called a press conference about it. But then she also announced her support of Senate Leader Mitch McConnell (R)'s denial of Garland's nomination--until the new President comes to power. Governor Hassan's position? Straightforward: the Republican-controlled Senate should do to its Constitutional duty, and hold a vote on Merrick's nomination.Social Security? Judging by her vote for the Republican budget as offered by Paul Ryan, Ayotte wants to cut federal funding for this crucial program, privatize it, and replace it with vouchers.Hassan? she is committed to ""fight any attempt to privatize Social Security"".Medicare? Again, look to Ayotte's vote in support of the Ryan budget, which ""would end Medicare as we know it"".Hassan? She ""will always fight for medicare.""Obamacare? Ayotte voted numerous times to delay, diminish, or do away with it altogether. Her party's position would deprive an estimated 21 million Americans of their newfound medical care coverage.Hassan says: ""Obamacare helps working American families afford health insurance"", and strongly supports its medical benefits for her state.And my key issue, the embryonic stem cell research restricted by former President George W. Bush, but approved by President Obama?According to her August 11, 2010 statement on the Christian Coalition Survey, Kelly Ayotte would ""prohibit... human embryonic stem cell research...(and) would ban such research."" To be clear on Governor Hassan's position, I contacted her office and received the following statement:""Governor Hassan supports President Obama's 2009 Executive Order that removed barriers to responsible scientific research involving stem cells and the Governor will work to ensure that this critical research can continue going forward.""--personal communicationThis is not small. Right now, my paralyzed son Roman Reed's best hope of ever walking again is the stem cell research Hassan supports, and Ayotte would ban.And did you hear about Ayotte's hearing on the Sandy Hook school massacre?Among the speakers was Erica Lafferty, daughter of slain Sandy Hook Elementary School Principal Dawn Hochsprung. Ms. Lafferty confronted Ayotte over her vote against expanding background checks for gun purchases.Referring to Ayotte's comment that expanded background checks would be a burden on gun store owners, Lafferty asked:""I am wondering why the burden of my mother being gunned down in the halls of her elementary school isn't more important than that.""Ms. Ayotte, who has received $81,905 from the gun lobby as well as earning an ""A"" rating from the National Rifle Association, responded with sympathetic comments--but her position remained unchanged.Ms. Lafferty turned and walked away, leaving the meeting room.Asked why she was leaving, she responded:""I have had enough.""Let us hope New Hampshire voters feel the same.To find out more about Maggie Hassan, visit her website: http://maggiehassan.com/Chip in a few bucks if you can, try to balance the overwhelming financial advantage held by Republicans.Why should you care? Above all else: the Supreme Court. If Hillary Clinton achieves the Presidency, she will need four new Democratic Senators--without whom the Republican blockage of Supreme Court nominees may go on.Maggie Hassan could bring us to a balanced Senate: 50 Democrats, 50 Republicans. With the Vice President presiding, President Hillary's Supreme Court nominees would be guaranteed a hearing. And a strong Supreme Court could sweep away the webs of campaign contribution corruption, which presently defile our electoral system. And the alternative, re-electing Republican Kelly Ayotte?That would be promising dinner to a hungry child--but giving only empty words instead. Don C.

There is no shortage of stories where host cities spend billions of dollars building venues for the games only to have these venues become abandon and useless when the Olympics leave town. Many of the two dozen facilities built for the Games in Athens are now surrounded with chain-linked fence and covered in graffiti. Billions of dollars were wasted to bring the games to Athens. Greece has fallen into a deep economic recession and the Olympics have become symbolic of government waste. In Beijing, the Chinese government spent $480 million to build a stadium. Today, that stadium costs $11 million annually to maintain yet cannot find a regular tenant.The estimated cost of hosting the Olympics is staggering. The Sydney games cost $4.7 billion, Beijing $42 billion, London $11 billion, and Rio $15 billion. These costs include building new infrastructure at the expense of urban areas. In China, over a million people were forcibly evicted from their homes, receiving only minimal compensation if any. In Rio, neighborhoods were torn down and residents moved far from family and work. The 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal were projected to cost $124 million. This figure underestimated the cost of hosting the Games by $2.6 billion. City taxpayers took nearly thirty years to pay off the billion dollars of debt. Independent research that included metrics like tourism inflows and foreign investment showed that cities did not benefit in the short or long term by hosting the Olympics. Dr. Robert Baade, an economics professor at Lake Forest College stated, ""The number of applicant cities now is in decline in part because people are beginning to see these mega-sports events as mega-bad deals."" The ""legacy benefits"" are difficult for emerging economies to capture because remote countries that sometimes host the Olympics are less likely receive repeat tourists. Vancouver was left with $630 million of debt after the 2010 Games. ""I think Vancouver, which is typical for the Olympic Games, overestimated the benefits from hosting and underestimated the costs,"" Baade said. The lack of redeemable qualities of the Olympics that place such an unfair burden on so many people while benefiting relatively few is appalling and in my opinion makes the Olympics expendable. As soon as I had convinced myself that the 2016 Olympics should be the last, I learned about the story of the swimmer from Singapore, Joseph Schooling. Schooling is a 21-year-old swimmer who was born and educated in Singapore and moved to Florida as a teenager to train. His Olympic debut in 2012 was less than memorable. Schooling failed to pass the heat phase because his swim cap and goggles were determined to be unsuitable. Michael Phelps was there in 2012 to console a dejected Schooling. Incidentally, Phelps who is the most decorated Olympian in history has more gold medals than Singapore has medaled in all of the Olympics combined. Schooling's time in 100-meter butterfly finals was less than a half-second faster than the legend himself, Michael Phelps and any other swimmer. Joseph Schooling had successfully overcome disappointment in 2012, and won gold in 2016. Of even more significance is that Schooling won the first-ever gold medal for Singapore. Schooling was greeted by several hundred people at the airport in Singapore before dawn on Monday. He not only returned home with a gold medal but returned a sense of national pride to his home country. Fire trucks gave the Olympian's Singapore Airlines flight a water salute that was a wall of mist for the plane to taxi to the gate. Schooling spent nearly an hour soaking in the environment, meeting fans, taking pictures and signing autographs. The significance of Schooling's gold medal cannot be overstated. Businesses offered discounts or free items, schools gave presentations to their pupils using Schooling as an example of what can happen with hard work and perseverance. The Parliament in Singapore presented a motion to congratulate their national hero. Tan Chuan-Jin, who serves as Singapore's Social and Family Development Minister said, ""I believe for years to come, Singaporeans will remember this moment."" Schooling idolized Phelps. ""As a kid I wanted to be like him. A lot of this is because of Michael. He's the reason I wanted to be a better swimmer,"" said Schooling. What Phelps did for Schooling, Schooling can now do for an entire country. Singapore has been starved of Olympic medals but now has their spokesperson and advocate for Olympic gold. The true value of gold like this is immeasurable and we will not likely know the significant impact of his performance in Rio for possibly another eight years, but as Schooling said himself, ""It's crazy to think of what happens in eight years.""Despite inspirational stories like Joseph Schooling, the Olympics is an international event that negatively impacts the lives of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of citizens of the host country. There should be a way to continue the Olympics and continue creating Joseph Schoolings for the world to aspire to be without causing irreparable harm to other people. One suggestion is to host the Olympics in the same city, instead of moving it from country to country every four years. This may not be fair to other countries but is our current corrupt system fair? Whatever the solution, the world needs the next Joseph Schooling."

Fearing the flounce factor, perhaps, or the ""pretty in pink"" moniker, women sometime steer clear of this color. Which is a real shame. The burst of pink on the runways, part of the designers' liking for feminine shapes and shades, is a trend we can get excited about. It may not be a traditional Fall color, but never mind that.  Pink is super flattering. With your complexion in mind, choose your hue--whether it's a vibrant coral or a palest pearl or anything in between--and you'll be tickled by the results.On the runways:Carolina Herrera Nothing babyish about this pale pink stunner. The sensuous lines and plunging neckline of this cocktail dress are tempered by the soft pearly hue.Delpozo The subtle tea-rose shade of this sophisticated jacket and pants almost appears neutral when paired with a bright yellow blouse and an unexpected, artful mix of colorful accessories.Oscar de la Renta A romantic column in a vibrant shade of cyclamen pink benefits from the seductive addition of black straps. Ooh la la.Hugo Boss The architectural cut of this striking azalea sheath dress is underscored with deep burgundy folds that flutter like flower petals. Mesmerizing.Chanel A statement-making suit if there ever was one. The delicious combination of watermelon and berry will stand out among the usual array of autumnal tweeds in the months to come.When picking your pinks, keep this in mind:  Going for the classic: For women with cooler complexions, the more pastel-ish pinks, the classic hues, work well. We love the A.L.C. ribbed turtleneck sweater in peony, the T by Alexander Wang off-the-shoulder dress in blush, the Ann Taylor polished T in soft lotus.Embrace the power: For warmer-toned complexions, go for the stronger shades, even the one and only hot pink. Check out the Milly one-shoulder top in rose or the Elie Tahari willow-pleated silk blouse in a bright shade. And how about these Etro cigarette-leg satin trousers in strawberry pink!  Structure is the answer: If you're still a little wary of pink, then choose a structured piece for wearing the shade: It creates an interested contrast. We like these coats from Theory and Helmut Lang. And the Basque lace off-the-shoulder dress from Nicholas, in blush, is simply exquisite.Shop the trend at Apprécier"

It depends on your country of residence, but citizens of the UK and U.S have quite an advantage",2016-08-20,Female tourist walking with luggage at Big Ben in London. See my other photos from London: http://www.oc-photo.net/FTP/icons/london.jpg,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9b1ba0250000360035953d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When asked about travel, most people say that it's something they want to do more of but aren't able to afford. For years, traveling has been looked at like a luxury; something expensive that revolves around resorts, tropical cocktails and shopping sprees in world famous boutiques. However, as more and more of today's youth are figuring out, long term traveling is all about experiencing new places, other cultures and learning to love the journey along the way. Instead of deciding that long term travel is too expensive or out of your reach, try reaching your travel goals through these affordable ways to travel for a longer and more rewarding period of time.Find a Volunteer ProgramVolunteering abroad is one of the most rewarding ways to dive into extended travel. While you are getting to live and work in a new place and culture, you also are giving back to communities and helping individuals at the same time. Since volunteer programs typically allow you to engage with the locals, there is a higher chance of you making connections, seeing aspects of a place that you would never see as a tourist and gaining a broader perspective of life around the world as a whole. Volunteer work can not only help you see the world for low costs but also allow you to gain valuable skills for your resume that could help you find jobs in the future. Despite your skills or experience, there is bound to be volunteer work that you can do from building houses and helping with environmental efforts to teaching English, working with non-profits and providing health care. Get a JobPart of the reason why long term travel seems so unrealistic is due to financial reasons. However, there are plenty of opportunities to both travel and have the money to afford it. Getting a job in another country can actually be easier than you think and allow you to earn an income, use it to further your travels, save a bit for a rainy day and gain valuable skills and connections with people to further your future career. There are various jobs in the tourism industry like tour guides, group leaders and staff at tourist sites to other options like becoming an English teacher, working at a hotel or hostel, waitressing or making coffee in a city café. Focus on the skills and experiences you already have and see what kind of jobs you can find.Get a Second PassportOK, this option isn't for everyone, but getting a second passport can allow you to live in another country as a resident; no visa fees or hassle. While it doesn't apply to all, some people are able to get a second passport if they have a family heritage from a certain country, have an investment or even marry someone from a different country. Some countries have specific citizen programs such as places in the Caribbean, U.S.A, Belgium, Austria and the E.U that have various guidelines which eventually allow for citizenship to be granted and a second passport to be given. Look Into Work & Visa ProgramsTaking in foreign employees is often so sought after that entire countries have established visa programs that make it easy. It depends on your country of residence, but citizens of the UK and U.S have quite an advantage when it comes to work programs with other countries. Places like Australia and New Zealand have specific work visas just for foreigners that allow for interesting jobs that range from wait staff to grape picking in wineries, horticultural work and career based jobs in various fields."

Because of my busy schedule I hadn't regularly weeded around the marigolds in the bed surrounding the fountain. The little nitrogen rich weed invaders had not only taken over but had woven themselves within the marigolds. As I attempted to pull them out, their massive growth uprooted the flowers. I spent hours trying to untangle the roots with no success. The dirt there is rich and loose so I gave up and pulled all fifty little marigolds out of the ground and laid them to the side. With the flora protected, I was able to quickly and easily hoe out all the weeds. Then I replanted each marigold. Without the distraction and life robbing weeds the marigolds went on to thrive. Although they were pretty for the garden tour, today-unencumbered, they are thick, full and beautiful.  Raising children can be like growing marigolds. The tender plants can be easily over-whelmed by negative circumstances. Hands-on parenting requires us to daily watch for the destructive influencers and pull them away until our children's roots are strong enough to withstand on their own. As much as I'd love to be able to pluck them out of every disabling situation (sometimes it's necessary) and rip the uglies away from them, it is impossible to yank every intruder. It's essential we guard them when they're young, but as they mature, they are better equipped by us inspiring them to be strong and well-rooted.  Along the way, and more in hind-sight, I've learned some tricks that help to inspire sturdy growth: • Say no only when there are no more options.  • Listen more than talk.  • Talk with them not at them.  • Make adventures often and out of nothing--those are the things they'll remember.  • As often as possible ask their opinions and do it their way.  • Pay them for discovering something new: a new word from the dictionary, a science fact, or setting goals just beyond their reach rather than for chores they should be doing because they are part of a family.  • Be intimately involved and familiar with their education--know what they know, their strengths and weaknesses, and be certain they're challenged and advocated for.  • Say to them often: You can be anything you want to be; it just depends on how hard you are willing to work at it.  • That's a great or interesting idea, let me think about it and get back to you.  • Respond rather than react.  • Praise them often (even if today it's just for breathing well!)  • Find 100 ways to say I love you, but ALWAYS also say I LOVE YOU!  • Remind them they are family and family goes through the good, the bad and the ugly together. Bring the problem home and use the strength of many to solve it.  • Play together.  • Share your mistakes with them and the process you learned to make it right.  • Don't take yourself so seriously: laugh often together.  Although there are times we'll wish we could just pluck them out of difficult situations, we need to remember another lesson my garden taught me--Wild growth is only showy growth; fruit only bears out on the branches that are challenged or cut back. Protect them but better yet, equip them to fight the tests of character growth."

This means that all of us screwed up, our entire judicial system is wrong"".He talks about a 15 years old girl being executed because she liked her brother who was also executed. Amnesty International estimates that in the summer of 1988, the overall number of people executed were 4,500. Some estimates reach as high as over 30,000 people. He adds ""In Esfahan, a pregnant woman was among them [those massacred]. In Esfahan they executed a pregnant woman.... [In clerical jurisprudence] one must not execute a woman even if she is a mohareb (enemy of God). ""I reminded [the Supreme Leader] of this, but he said they must be executed.

All that’s left to do are some finishing touches, including mixing and final packaging. The upcoming set (release date to be determined) would mark her first new studio effort since 2009’s “My Turn.” And by the sound of it, she’s pretty proud of the result. “I think it’s the best I’ve done … What makes me say that is that I’ve been involved in every part of it … every intricate detail, I’ve been there. I’ve been involved with this album more than I’ve ever been with a record,” she told The Huffington Post during an AOL Build interview on Monday. But what she really wants to tackle next is a duets album. The 57-year-old country singer has already talked to Bob Dylan about recording something together.  “I’ve yet to really do the collaborations that I really want to do. I’m really looking forward to taking that on … I’m thinking Tom Petty. I always wanted to do something with Merle Haggard, and of course time ran out on that,” she said about working with the late singer, who died in April. “But different people ... Eric Clapton is one of my favorites … These guys aren’t getting any younger and neither am I so we need to get to it!”She also has her eyes on some younger country talent.  “I’d love to do something with maybe one of the new boys,” she added, tossing out names like Keith Urban and Blake Shelton.Clearly, the singer, who joined the country music scene at the tender age of 13, isn’t ready to hang up her cowboy hat any time soon. She has a slew of tour dates lined up this year and, later this month, she’ll receive the Cliffie Stone Pioneer Award during the 10th annual ACM Honors. “I still have a lot left to do,” she said. “There’s always going to be something new. You’re never at the top of the mountain. I always feel like I’m looking at Mount Everest and putting my hiking boots on … I never feel like I’m there yet. It’s always a journey.”For more from Huffington Post’s AOL Build interview, check out the video below."

Even as Gov. Pat McCrory (R) is imploring the Supreme Court to put the ruling on hold, the North Carolina Republican Party is acting as if the decision never happened.In striking down the law, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit effectively restored seven days of early voting that North Carolina lawmakers had taken away ― bringing the total to 17 ― thus benefitting minority voters. Many of them take advantage of features such as Sunday voting, same-day registration and extended voting hours ahead of Election Day.But the appeals court didn’t tell North Carolina what to do with the restored days ― only that they needed to be restored. And the state’s board of elections went along, setting Oct. 20 as the start for early voting in North Carolina but leaving it up to each of North Carolina’s 100 county boards to specify what rules to follow on those days.That left an opening for Republicans. And on Sunday, they struck: County election boards should “make party line changes to early voting,” the state GOP’s executive director, Dallas Woodhouse, wrote in a memo sent to GOP election officials and later obtained by The News and Observer.“Our Republican Board members should feel empowered to make legal changes to early voting plans, that are supported by Republicans,” Woodhouse wrote in emails sent to county board members, the majority of whom lean Republican because they’re appointed by party leadership. “Republicans can and should make party line changes to early voting.”The Supreme Court and election law experts have long struggled to set guidelines for when race and party affiliation, which are closely linked, may or may not be used when changing the rules of elections.And for Woodhouse ― who calls himself “an unabashed partisan” ― it seems as though tweaking the rules of early voting is nothing more than kowtowing to party interests, not an exercise in invidious racial discrimination. (His own partisan brother appears to think otherwise.)You be the judge ― these are some of the legal changes Woodhouse suggested to election officials:Limited hours and thus fewer opportunities for same-day registration, which Woodhouse said is “ripe for voter fraud.” Yet the 4th Circuit said that claims of in-person voter fraud in North Carolina are “merely imaginable.”No Sunday voting, which African-American voters favor as part of “souls to the polls” drives after church on Sunday. The GOP leader justified this move as a favor to poll workers who need at least one day off after working tirelessly for six days.No early voting at campus sites, because college students are apparently not “entitled to their own voting site.” But the measure benefits them because college students often don’t drive.This is precisely the kind of tinkering ― benign on paper but discriminatory in practice ― that could have subjected North Carolina to federal government oversight under the Voting Rights Act of 1965. But in 2013, the Supreme Court struck a key part of it, lifting that oversight requirement from North Carolina and other states and localities with a history of voter discrimination.In a statement, Woodhouse defended himself and his party’s positions, which seek “to preserve the integrity of the voting process so everyone’s vote is properly counted” ― a rationale for North Carolina’s restrictive law that the 4th Circuit all but discarded.“The county board members are an independent body, and we have the right to lobby them as much as anybody else, for Republican positions,” Woodhouse said.Perhaps. But all of this scrambling is happening just as the Supreme Court is weighing an emergency request from North Carolina to reinstate the law ― including its reduction of early voting to only 10 days. McCrory, the state governor, has called this measure, the voter ID requirement and the other provisions of the law a “model” for other states to follow.But will the Supreme Court ― and Chief Justice John Roberts, who in 2013 said that “things have changed dramatically” in the South ― go along?Roberts earlier this week asked the civil rights groups challenging the law to respond to the state’s request to reinstate the law by next week ― around the same time county boards in North Carolina are due to submit their local early voting plans to the State Board of Elections for approval.Irving Joyner, a law professor and lawyer who is representing the North Carolina chapter of the NAACP in the litigation, told The Huffington Post that he and his team are monitoring what is happening at these county board meetings and collecting data. So far, he said, some counties have bucked the GOP’s wishes and offered Sunday and on-campus early voting, as well as extended hours of operation at polling sites.But with 100 counties to keep track of, the data collection will continue until right before the advocacy groups make their case to the high court. And the more they gather, the better the picture they’ll paint for Roberts and his bench-mates.“That will be a part of our response to the Supreme Court — to give a county by county breakdown of what is going on,” Joyner said."

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) says there is a ""cartel"" of higher education.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b761591700001108c744b5.jpeg?cache=ZffNqJRruT&ops=crop_0_39_1280_817%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said Thursday that if the nation wants to rein in college costs, it needs to break up the “higher education cartel.” And a key way to do that would be to have more DVDs and fewer teachers. “We haven’t even come close to taking advantage of the power of technology in education,” Johnson said at a WisPolitics forum. “We’re still working on the exact same model ― almost the exact same model. ... The way to really bust up the higher education cartel is move to a certification process versus a diploma process because a diploma process maintains that cartel within these institutions of higher education.”Johnson also touted the benefits of online education and suggested that teachers really weren’t all that necessary anymore: JOHNSON: We’ve got the internet ― you have so much information available. Why do you have to keep paying differently lecturers to teach the same course? You get one solid lecturer and put it up online and have everybody available to that knowledge for a whole lot cheaper? But that doesn’t play very well to tenured professors in the higher education cartel. So again, we need destructive technology for our higher education system.Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers ― a union with more than 1 million members ― sharply criticized Johnson for his remarks.“Leave it to someone from a party led by a reality TV star to confuse videotape with the learning experience of a classroom,” she said. “What Ron Johnson doesn’t get is that education happens when teachers can listen to students and engage them to think for themselves ― and that can include using Ken Burns’ masterful work. But this is typical for a party with an education agenda as out of date as Johnson’s Blockbuster Video card.”“We know Ron Johnson graduated from college 40 years ago, but we assumed it was from a university here on planet Earth,” said Scot Ross, the executive director of the liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now, which flagged Johnson’s remarks. “Not only does Ron Johnson oppose common sense measures like student loan refinancing that would immediately reduce costs for 515,000 hardworking Wisconsin borrowers, but he apparently thinks the solution to the nation’s higher education student debt crisis is getting rid of diplomas and watching more television.” Johnson is running for re-election against former Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wis.), who lost the seat to Johnson in 2010. HuffPost Pollster, which tracks publicly available polling in the race, shows Feingold with a lead: Johnson has come under scrutiny in the past for his remarks on higher education. In March, he said students were taking longer than four years to graduate because they were able to easily get student loans and it was fun to party.“Today, there are different studies on this, but somewhere between five and a half to six years is the average length of time it takes somebody to get a four-year degree. Why is that? I’d argue, well, loans are actually pretty easy to get and college is a lot of fun,” Johnson said, noting he had worked his way through school and wanted to be done as soon as possible. “It’s kind of free money, young people don’t necessarily understand finance,” he added.Feingold then ran an ad last month going after the senator for those remarks: “Sen. Johnson’s so extreme that he calls student loans ‘free money’ and would do away with all federal student loans if he had his way. ... The true cartel Wiconsinites face is Sen. Johnson’s blind allegiance to Donald Trump and corporate CEOs, who want him to stay in Washington for another six years to protect their interests,” Feingold spokesman Michael Tyler said in response to the senator’s comments at the WisPolitics forum.Wages for the typical recent college graduate working full time have risen just 1.6 percent over the last 25 years, while student debt burdens for the typical bachelor’s degree recipient have increased about 163.8 percent. Federal data show that roughly 42 million Americans collectively owe more than $1.3 trillion on their student loans.UPDATE: Aug. 23 ― Burns tweeted on Tuesday that he disagreed with Johnson’s proposal, saying his work should not replace teachers.This story has been updated with comment from Weingarten.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story said Feingold lost his seat to Johnson in 2012; in fact, it was 2010."

Chris Christie (R) vetoed a bill Thursday that would have made it easier for people to register to vote, claiming the measure would increase voter fraud.The bill, passed by the state legislature, would automatically register voters when they apply for or renew their driver’s license, driver’s permit or state identification, unless they specifically opt out of registering.Supporters of the legislation argue simplifying the process will increase voter participation, save money and decrease errors on voter rolls, which can lead to disenfranchisement. Christie, however, argued the bill would only open up opportunities for cheating at the polls ― despite the extreme rarity of voter fraud.“This is just like a cocktail of fraud,” Christie said of the bill Tuesday, according to the Asbury Park Press. “I don’t think it’s a lot to ask someone if you want to exercise your right and the privilege to vote to actually register.”In his veto message, Christie also said the bill should be called “The Voter Fraud Enhancement and Permission Act.” He suggested changing the bill to instead inform driver’s license applicants of their options for registering to vote, and proposed notifying victims of domestic violence and/or stalking that they can register without disclosing their address.“I continue to fully support efforts to increase voter registration,” he wrote.Five states ― California, Connecticut, Oregon, Vermont and West Virginia ― currently automatically register voters, and many more states are considering adopting that process. A bill introduced in Congress earlier this year would implement automatic registration nationally, adding an estimated 50 million voters to the electorate. The idea has also drawn support from Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.Republican nominee Donald Trump, however, is in favor of requiring voters to show ID before casting a ballot, a requirement found to disproportionately impact people of color, who are less likely than white voters to have a government issued photo ID. In recent weeks, he’s raised concerns about voter fraud, warning he believes the election will be “rigged” in Clinton’s favor. (Christie has endorsed Trump and is a key adviser on his campaign.) Christie vetoed similar legislation last year, and in 2013 rejected a bill to expand early voting. He also vetoed a bill Thursday that would have allowed 17-year-olds to vote in primaries if they will turn 18 by the general election."

From her new book The Girl With The Lower Back Tattoo to a recent controversy surrounding one of her show’s writers, Schumer has been going non-stop. This past week, comedian and “Inside Amy Schumer” writer Kurt Metzger went on a lengthy tirade about rape allegations, which was widely criticized as misogynistic and victim-blaming. Schumer was forced to comment on the mess because of her close connection with Metzger. On Aug. 17, Schumer tweeted that she “couldn’t be more against [Metzger’s] recent actions.” On Thursday night, she spoke in greater detail about the matter during an interview with PBS’ Charlie Rose.Although she made it clear that she considers Metzger to be a good friend and feels that his differing perspectives are an asset in the writers room, Schumer also reiterated that Metzger’s commentary on women and rape is not her own. Schumer explained to Rose: Kurt’s my friend, I love him, I’m not on Facebook so I don’t read his crazy rants… he gets something from going after people and making them mad that is not representative of me at all. I’ve asked him, “can you just stop because it comes back to me.” Because he writes for the show it becomes a bigger story, because of our connection. Whatever tangent he’s gone off on, I have not agreed with and it’s been really upsetting to see someone I care about hurt themselves like this.She added that she wishes fans would not attach her to to his Facebook and Twitter rants. “I think people want his head, they want to burn him at the stake,” she said. “And I want them to not attach me to what he’s writing.”Watch a clip from her interview with Charlie Rose below. Schumer explained she wishes the entire conversation could be refocused away from Metzger and onto rape and the importance of consent. “[Metzger] baits people, he’s the problem no question,” she said. “But the focus is on him rather than on what the real, main problem is.”The topic of sexual assault and rape is a personal one to Schumer, since the 35-year-old comedian recently revealed that her first sexual encounter was not a consensual one. In a July interview with Marie Claire, Schumer described the moment she realized she had been assaulted ― something she also writes about in her new book, The Girl With The Lower Back Tattoo.“My first sexual experience was not a good one. I didn’t think about it until I started reading my journal again,” she told Marie Claire. “When it happened, I wrote about it almost like a throwaway. It was like, And then I looked down and realized he was inside me. He was saying, ‘I’m so sorry’ and ‘I can’t believe I did this.’” Schumer explained to Rose that she hopes the conversation surrounding Metzger’s comments can be shifted to help victims of rape and sexual assault.“I was sexually assaulted, I encourage women to come out and I want men to hear what happened so that there’s no confusion,” she said. “Because people have different understandings of what sexual assault is, what rape is. So let’s all get on the same page so it happens less.”In an Aug. 19 interview with NPR, Schumer described why it was so hard to write about her assault in The Girl With The Lower Back Tattoo. “Just talking about being sexually assaulted in any way, you know, for women, it’s never like, ‘Oh, I’m really sorry that happened to you.’ Which is really how it should be, and how you would think it would be,” Schumer said. “But it’s more, we look for problems we have with how that woman has spoken about her sexual assault.”Schumer also spoke about the need for people to understand that cases of sexual assault and rape don’t always play out in super clear cut ways, which is why she decided to tell her story:I call it “grape,” because it’s this gray area. Not of whether or not it was rape, but it’s not the way we think of, like, a “Law and Order” episode. And when it’s not as black and white for everyone, it makes it harder for them to digest. So it’s this very personal thing to me, that I decided to share. And I’m only looking for people to feel less alone reading it, and maybe for a guy to read it and think, “Oh.” Maybe that’ll stop somebody in their tracks, I don’t know.

Harris Funeral Homes, after it fired its funeral director, Amiee Stephens, a transgender woman who was undergoing transition.Stephens, who had worked at the funeral home for six years and was known as Anthony Stephens until 2013, was fired after she sent a letter to her boss and coworkers announcing that she had gender dysphoria and was undergoing treatment, with plans for sex reassignment surgery at a later date.“The first step I must take is to live and work full-time as a woman for one year,” she told coworkers. “At the end of my vacation on August 26, 2013, I will return to work as my true self, Amiee Australia Stephens, in appropriate business attire.” But Stephens never went on vacation or made it back to work. Her boss, Thomas Rost, fired her soon after receiving her letter. “Anthony, this is not going to work out,” Rost told her at the time, according to a later deposition. He also said he fired her because Stephens “wanted to dress as a woman” and because “we have a dress code that is very specific that men will dress as men.”Stephens filed a complaint with the EEOC, and the agency later sued in federal court, alleging the funeral home discriminated against her on the basis of sex and her gender identity in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The law protects against discrimination in the workplace.On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Sean Cox said that the funeral home deserved an exemption from complying with the law because compliance “would impose a substantial burden on its ability to conduct business in accordance with its sincerely-held religious beliefs.”That language is lifted from the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a federal law that protects individuals from government action that may “substantially burden” their religious tenets. Rost had raised it as a defense in the litigation.Rost, it turns out, is a longtime Christian, and in an affidavit he said that he operates his business “as a ministry to serve grieving families.” The funeral home, he said, “administers its dress code based on our employees’ biological sex, not based on their subjective gender identity.”According to Rost’s affidavit, “the Bible teaches that it is wrong for a biological male to deny his sex by dressing as a woman,” and that allowing Stephens to do so “would be violating God’s commands.” Curiously, Rost also said he wouldn’t have a problem with Stephens dressing as a woman if she did so during non-work hours.In light of these and other beliefs, Cox ruled for the funeral home and found that requiring it to not discriminate against Stephens for living as a woman would impinge on those beliefs.The court relied in great part in the Supreme Court’s decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, which made waves in 2014 for allowing a religiously owned arts-and-crafts corporation to be exempted from providing contraceptive coverage to its female employees under the Affordable Care Act. Brian Hauss, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union ― which filed a legal brief in support of Stephens ― said in an email that the ruling was “way, way out there” and could have serious repercussions down the road.“I’m not aware of any court holding that an employer has a religious right to ignore Title VII’s prohibition against sex discrimination,” he said. “If allowed to stand, this decision would seriously jeopardize federal anti-discrimination protections for transgender people, women and people of color.”A spokeswoman for the EEOC said the agency is disappointed in the ruling and that it’s evaluating whether to appeal.According to the Transgender Law Center, only 20 states plus the District of Columbia have employment non-discrimination laws protecting transgender individuals. And even Title VII, which covers the entire country, doesn’t explicitly cover gender identity discrimination, but relies on court rulings to provide such coverage.“Because there is no federal law explicitly banning discrimination against transgender people ... allowing employers to use religion to discriminate would put transgender people across the country ― people like Aimee Stephens ― at an even greater risk of losing their jobs just for being who they are,” Hauss said."
27,BUSINESS,Uber To Begin Testing Fleet Of Self-Driving Cars In Pittsburgh This Month,"Bernie Woodall, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/uber-self-driving-car-pittsburgh_us_57b7197fe4b0b51733a2e9a5,The vehicles will see regular public use.,2016-08-19,Downtown Pittsburgh is seen in this undated Getty file photo. Uber says it will launch a fleet of self-driving cars in the city by the end of August.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b71baa1700001108c74382.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(Reuters) - Ride service Uber Technologies Inc said on Thursday it acquired self-driving trucks startup Otto and formed a $300 million alliance with Volvo Car Group to develop self-driving cars.Uber’s moves reflect its eagerness to advance self-driving technology. If its ambitions are realized, these vehicles could over time reduce its biggest cost, paying drivers.Uber would also be positioned to expand into the trucking industry, which had revenue of about $726.4 billion in the United States in 2015, according to trade data.Carpooling firms have formed alliances with large automakers, such as General Motors Co and ride-hailing service Lyft, to accelerate those efforts, which depend on software and hardware working together to give a vehicle the right reflexes in traffic.“Partnership is crucial to our self-driving strategy because Uber has no experience making cars,”Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick wrote in a blogpost.“To do it well is incredibly hard, as I realized on my first visit to a car manufacturing plant several years ago.”Uber, which has a research center in Pittsburgh, will by the end of this month begin a pilot program in which trusted Uber customers will be able to use their phones to summon a self-driving car for use in a downtown Pittsburgh, according to a source with knowledge of Uber’s plans.It will be the first time members of the public will be able to use self-driving vehicles. A driver trained to handle the autonomous cars will be behind the wheel to step in if needed.The purchase of Otto, a start-up company less than a year old with fewer than 100 employees, will be for 1 percent of Uber’s valuation, if certain technical targets are met, said the source.Recently, that valuation was about $68 billion, placing the value of the deal at about $680 million. Current Otto employees would get a fifth of profits Uber earns from a self-driving trucking business, if those targets are met, the source said.Current Otto employees would get a fifth of profits Uber earns from a self-driving trucking business.Anthony Levandowski, one of Otto’s co-founders, will lead Uber’s self-driving efforts in San Francisco, Palo Alto and Pittsburgh, Kalanick said on the company’s website.That includes personal transportation such as ride-hailing services, as well as delivery services and trucking, Kalanick said.Levandowski was one of four founders of Otto, each of whom worked at Alphabet Inc’s Google and its self-driving program.VOLVO DEAL FOCUSES ON SUVThe Uber-Volvo partnership will allow Uber to pool resources with the Swedish-based carmaker, owned by China’s Geely, into initially developing the autonomous driving capabilities of Volvo’s flagship XC90 SUV model. The investment will be shared roughly equally by the two companies..There was no timeline given for the alliance, but the source said the goal is to develop a fully self-driving car by 2021, and that Uber, which does not plan to make its own vehicle, will align with other automakers over time.Uber will buy Volvos and then install its own driverless control system. Some of the Volvos will join a handful of Ford Motor Co Fusion sedans that will be used to start the pilot program that combines self-driving and ride-hailing in downtown Pittsburgh.So far Otto has tested self-driving trucks for highway use only.Developers hope for productivity gains with the new technology that will enable trucks to drive around the clock, leaving humans to rest, do paperwork and take controls only while going on and off highways.Over the long-term, Uber and rivals such as Lyft could cut the cost of paying drivers if they can gradually incorporate self-driving cars into their fleets. But at least for now, said the source familiar with the Uber-Otto agreement, Uber will expand its driver network, which now stands at 1.5 million globally in more than 450 cities.A spokesman for U.S. safety regulator National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it “continues to engage with all entities that are developing, testing and deploying automated technologies to ensure that they are advancing road safety.”Federal guidelines will be issued soon on development and testing of “highly automated vehicles,” he said."

The NBA had originally planned to hold next year’s All-Star Game in Charlotte, North Carolina, but withdrew the city’s selection in July in protest of North Carolina’s anti-LGBT law.Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) actively courted the NBA in a July letter to Silver, noting the state’s “diversity of heritage, culture, cuisine and people.”Louisiana is one of the few Southern states not to pass so-called bathroom legislation allowing private entities to restrict transgender individuals’ ability to use the facilities of the gender with which they identify. Edwards signed an executive order in April barring discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation. “By moving the 2017 All-Star Game to New Orleans, the NBA and Commissioner Adam Silver have sent a clear message to lawmakers in North Carolina and across the country that discrimination against LGBTQ people has consequences and will not be tolerated,” Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said in a statement. North Carolina has faced a massive backlash from businesses and state and local governments over the anti-LGBT law it passed in March. A number of major corporations have canceled plans to expand or invest in North Carolina in response to the law, and progressive governors and mayors have issued travel bans to the state. North Carolina’s legislation bans discrimination on the basis of race, gender and other criteria, but does not forbid discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. It also precludes municipalities like Charlotte from establishing their own ordinances to protect LGBT people against discrimination.This will be the third time since the founding of the New Orleans Pelicans in 2002 that the Big Easy has hosted the All-Star Game. The game took place in New Orleans in 2008 and 2014 as well."

In June, he resigned as chancellor, but stayed on as law professor.His law professor job was his remaining position at Baylor, the world’s largest Baptist university.The investigation found that actions by Baylor administrators directly discouraged students from reporting sexual assaults.Universities around the country have adopted policies in recent years to prevent sexual assaults on campus and to provide more support for victims, after a number of cases involving light punishment for offenders or stigmatizing of victims stirred national outrage.(Reporting by Fiona Ortiz in Chicago)"

It was one of the agency’s first lawsuits on behalf of a transgender worker.Following milestone achievements in gay rights including same-sex marriage becoming legal nationwide in 2015, transgender rights have become an increasingly contentious issue in the United States.The EEOC said Harris violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of gender stereotyping. Harris said it had a religious right to fire Stephens and that she was also biologically male and violated a dress code requiring men to wear suits.Cox agreed on Thursday with Harris on both points. The company’s owner, Thomas Rost, is a devout Christian whose life’s work stems from his religious beliefs, including that shunning one’s biological sex is an affront to God, the judge wrote.“Rost operates the funeral home as a ministry to serve grieving families while they endure some of the most difficult and trying times in their lives,” Cox wrote.An EEOC spokeswoman said: “We are disappointed with the decision and reviewing next steps.”Douglas Wardlow of the Alliance Defending Freedom, a Christian legal group representing the funeral home, applauded the ruling, saying in a statement: “The feds shouldn’t strong-arm private business owners into violating their religious beliefs, and the court has affirmed that here,”Cox based his ruling largely on a 2014 U.S. Supreme Court decision that granted craft-store chain Hobby Lobby a religious exemption from providing employees with insurance coverage for contraception. But Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the court in that case, said the ruling did not necessarily apply to cases involving discrimination.Several U.S. appeals courts have held that federal law prohibiting gender bias applies to transgender people, but none have addressed the issue of religious freedom in those cases.Jillian Weiss, executive director of the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund, which was not involved in the funeral home case, said that under Cox’s decision: “People could be forced to conform to outmoded masculine and feminine stereotypes in order to keep their jobs.”The case is Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v.

Hamid, a flight attendant who lives in Charlotte, drew national attention in January when she stood up in silent protest at a Trump rally in South Carolina and was promptly expelled, drawing cheers from the crowd.Anantha said he felt singled out for the color of his skin, since he saw throngs of white people being allowed to enter after he was ejected.“I thought (Trump) was for all people. I don’t believe he is for all people anymore,” he told the Observer. “Why are all these white people allowed to attend and I’m not?”Trump’s staff is legally permitted to control who comes into his rallies since they are private events typically held in private venues.Anantha, whose grandparents immigrated to the United States from India, recalled defending Trump to critics, claiming the candidate’s offensive rhetoric was an appropriate way to express frustration with unauthorized immigration and jihadism.Now Anantha may cast the first presidential vote of his life for Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson.Clinton currently leads Trump by nearly 4 percentage points in North Carolina, according to HuffPost Pollster. The state voted for GOP nominee Mitt Romney in 2012 and with 15 electoral votes, it is considered a must-win for Trump.During the primary, the real estate mogul became known for goading the crowds at his events against protesters, many of whom were people of color ― including by musing about beating them up. In several instances, rally attendees physically attacked demonstrators. At least one event in Chicago infiltrated by liberal demonstrators descended into an all-out violent brawl between pro-Trump and anti-Trump activists.Trump’s openly racist rhetoric has ensured that he enjoys record low support for a Republican candidate among communities of color. Among African Americans, he is trailing not only Clinton, but Green Party nominee Jill Stein and Johnson. Only 1 percent of African Americans plan to vote for him, according to HuffPost Pollster. A Trump spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

And Donald Trump may be losing support among even his strongest demographics This is HuffPollster for Friday, August 19, 2016.DON’T FALL FOR ARGUMENTS THAT CROWD SIZE MATTERS MORE THAN POLLS - HuffPollster: “[R]allies couldn’t possibly be more indicative of vote preference than polls. In a 2012 survey from Pew Research, 10 percent of Americans reported having attended a political rally or speech. Compare that to 58.6 percent of eligible Americans who voted in that year’s presidential election. Way more people will vote than attend rallies. Pollsters talk to both enthusiastic rally-goers and couch potatoes because they try to achieve a representative sample ― meaning they try to interview a cross-section of Americans that roughly matches the demographics of the American population. Then they use vote history, ask questions of the respondents or use some combination of those techniques to determine who is most likely to vote. These are the ‘likely voters’ that you hear about.” [HuffPost]Which polls show Donald Trump ahead? These ones. [HuffPost]Attending a rally is very different from voting - John Sides: “The benefits you might get from a rally — a chance to express your passion for a candidate, be inspired or entertained by their speech, enjoy the company of other supporters — depend on going to the rally. If you don’t go, at best you’ll hear a few soundbites from the speech on the news. You won’t feel the excitement. You won’t get to see the show, as it were. You’ll lose out. But voting is entirely different. Perhaps the key benefit you’ll get from an election — seeing your preferred candidate win — doesn’t really depend on whether you vote. Obviously your one vote is very unlikely to determine the outcome of the election. You won’t necessarily lose anything if you stay home on Election Day. You could stay at home and still be cheering after the returns come in. In other words, the free rider problem looms large when it comes to voting, but much less so when it comes to attending a rally.” [WashPost]HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

Voters’ answers were divided along a number of demographics….There’s a much wider gulf, though, along political lines. Hillary Clinton’s supporters say by a 40-point margin that life has gotten better for people like them in the last 50 years, according to a Pew Research survey released Thursday. Trump supporters say by a 70-point margin that it’s gotten worse…. Partisans, perhaps reacting to their party’s cues, are increasingly divided as well ― in March, Republicans were 38 points likelier than Democrats to say things were getting worse for people like them. The margin is now 49 points.” [HuffPost] Most think the country is on the wrong track ― could that help Trump? - David Byler: “Right now, 28.8 percent of Americans think that the country is going in the right direction, and 64.6 think it’s on the wrong track….Taken at face value, these numbers might seem bad for Clinton ― she has clearly tied herself to the current administration… I tested whether direction-of-country had a statistically significant effect on the overall election results after accounting for presidential approval. It’s dicey to make strong inferences on such a small data set, but the results showed (after accounting for presidential approval) that direction-of-country did not have a statistically significant effect on the incumbent’s popular vote margin….Still, it’s worth asking: What if this time is different?... [I]f Bill Clinton or George W. Bush registered a zero net job approval, about 15 percent more Americans would say the country is on the wrong track rather than going in the right direction. But when Obama is at around a zero net job approval, that gap is closer to 30 percent.” [RealClearPolitics] DONALD TRUMP MAY BE LOSING SUPPORT AMONG WHITE MEN - Jeremy W. Peters: “Donald J. Trump’s support among white men, the linchpin of his presidential campaign, is showing surprising signs of weakness that could foreclose his only remaining path to victory in November. If not reversed, the trend could materialize into one of the most unanticipated developments of the 2016 presidential campaign: That Hillary Clinton, the first woman at the head of a major party ticket and a divisive figure unpopular with many men, ends up narrowing the gender gap that has been a constant of American presidential elections for decades. Surveys of voters nationwide and in battleground states conducted over the last two weeks showed that Mr. Trump was even with or below where Mitt Romney, the Republican Party nominee four years ago, was with white men when he won that demographic by an overwhelming 27 percentage points….’If you set out to design a strategy to produce the lowest popular vote possible in the new American electorate of 2016, you would be hard-pressed to do a better job than Donald Trump has,’ said Whit Ayres, a pollster who has advised Republican presidential and Senate candidates for more than 25 years. ‘This is an electoral disaster waiting to happen.’” [NYT]Winning blue-collar white men might not be enough - Greg Sargent (D): “Based on how this campaign has gone so far, there really might not be enough blue collar white men in America to elect Trump president, even if all of them come out to vote. That’s the actual finding of a new analysis conducted by demographer William Frey of the Brookings Institution….’If the voting on election day is in line with the Washington Post poll, even if all non-college white men show up on Election Day to vote, it would be difficult for Trump to win,’ Frey told me. To make this worse for Trump, Frey added, it is far-fetched to begin with to assume that non-college white men will turn out at larger rates than college-educated whites overall will. The opposite is more likely to be the case, Frey said.” [WashPost]  FRIDAY’S ‘OUTLIERS’ - Links to the best of news at the intersection of polling, politics and political data:-A plurality of Americans say the media is biased toward Hillary Clinton.

A woman identifying herself as Allison Moss tried to sign up as a volunteer at Feingold’s office in Madison, Wisconsin, this week, claiming she had been involved in College Democrats at the University of Minnesota. But after some vetting turned up suspicious information, the campaign brought Moss back in on Wednesday to ask her questions about her background. Moss actually appears to be Allison Maass, a former correspondent for Campus Reform whose author page says she “exposes liberal bias and abuse in the Land of 10,000 Lakes.” The group is a project of the Leadership Institute, an organization committed to building up conservative activists that spawned provocateur James O’Keefe and his Project Veritas. Maass initially tried to deny to the Feingold campaign that she was a wolf in sheep’s clothing, but eventually simply stopped answering questions: FEINGOLD CAMPAIGN: Can you tell us if you’re working for anyone in particular?Campus Reform said Maass is no longer affiliated with the group, and a call to the phone number she provided to the Feingold campaign was not returned. Project Veritas has said it does not reveal the identify of its operatives. But this isn’t the first time Maass has attempted to infiltrate a campaign.After The Huffington Post reported on the Feingold infiltration attempt in Wisconsin, two former Sanders campaign staffers immediately recognized Maass as the woman who tried to do the same thing in Nevada. Jordan Barbeau and John Gagain Jr. said they confronted Maass when she tried to volunteer at their headquarters in Las Vegas ahead of the February caucuses. Maass, who also used a fake name in February, said she was from the Bay Area and flew out with a friend to help Sanders win, Barbeau told HuffPost. She first noticed something was amiss when Maass provided not a California phone number, but a New York one ― just as she did to the Feingold campaign. “It seemed weird to me that she had a New York phone number when she had been telling me she was a California native, and I’m from the Bay Area and I’ve lived in New York,” Barbeau told HuffPost Friday. “She didn’t seem to want to talk about it and was weirdly vague. It just seemed odd to me.”Maass, who had brought along a friend, was particularly interested in issues of voter registration ― particularly whom the Sanders staffers were trying to get to caucus. “She was asking things like, ‘Do you have to show ID? What if you’re out of state?’ ‘What if you just moved here?’ She was asking various staff whether they were from Nevada, whether they were from other states, whether they were going to be caucusing in Nevada. ... She was asking these questions over and over again of multiple staffers and multiple volunteers, and that’s what really threw up the red flag,” Barbeau said.Barbeau added that the campaign policy was that people who did not live in Nevada prior to being hired by the campaign could not caucus there. Staffers were on alert because O’Keefe operatives had earlier showed up at Sanders’ New Hampshire offices. Maass came back to Sanders’ Vegas office to volunteer again later in the week. This time, Gagain approached her and asked her why she was there. According to Gagain, she initially tried to claim she was with the campaign ― until he informed her that he was with the campaign and didn’t know her. She then claimed she knew people there, throwing out random first names of people who didn’t exist. Gagain then encouraged her to leave, snapping a photo of her on her way out: The man sitting in the chair in the burgundy shirt appears to be Christian Hartsock, a conservative filmmaker who has worked with O’Keefe on his stings. Hartsock did not immediately return a request for comment. Maass was also involved in an undercover sting attempt against Hillary Clinton last year, trying to entrap supporters in Iowa. She and two other women tried to pass a cash donation to Clinton volunteers and asked whether they could refuse to register voters who weren’t Clinton supporters. (The answer was no.) In March, one of O’Keefe’s plots went astray when he called up the liberal Open Society Institute and left a voice message under the name “Victor Kesh,” saying he was a Hungarian-American man representing a foundation. The problem was that O’Keefe forgot to hang up the phone before he proceeded to talk about his plot with his colleague. This piece has been updated with information about Hartsock."

The athletes claimed officers confronted them in their taxi while stopped at a gas station in Barra da Tijuca, a western suburb of Rio.Reports say the athletes have been “indicted” ― but while indictments in the U.S. indicate formal charges have been filed after a grand jury has determined there’s sufficient evidence to proceed, the term is used differently in Brazil. BuzzFeed Brazil notes a Brazilian “indiciamento” is a “preliminary conclusion of the investigation by police,” after which prosecutors decide whether to pursue charges and a judge decides whether to validate the case. The International Olympic Committee denied the robbery in question happened, and the swimmers’ claim soon unraveled after they gave conflicting accounts of the incident to authorities. Surveillance footage further contradicted the swimmers’ narrative and indicated they may have been drunk and disruptive. News of the situation gained traction after Lochte, 32, allegedly lied to his mother about the nature of the ordeal and she repeated his account to the press. Brazilian officials, citing surveillance footage from the gas station, said the Americans had vandalized a restroom and fought with a gas station security guard on the night of the alleged incident. The gas station owner told the O Globo newspaper he directed the swimmers to the bathroom but that at least one of them urinated on the wall instead.Reports differ on whether an armed security guard pulled a gun on the swimmers before police arrived, but Reuters reported the athletes paid for the damage on the scene in Brazilian and U.S. currency, leaving the equivalent of about $50. Lochte on Sunday described the incident to NBC’s Bill Bush Sunday as such: “The guy pulled out his gun, he cocked it, put it to my forehead and he said, ‘Get down,’ and I put my hands up, I was like, ‘Whatever.’ He took our money, he took my wallet — he left my cell phone, he left my credentials.”But on Wednesday, the 12-time Olympic medalist told Matt Lauer the gun was just pointed in his direction. Lochte also revised the lead-up to the scene, saying the swimmers had stopped at a gas station to use the bathroom when the incident occurred, after first claiming the armed men pulled them over. Bentz and Conger were pulled off their return flight home on Wednesday to be questioned by police. A Brazilian judge ordered police on Wednesday to seize Lochte and Feigen’s passports so they could be questioned, but Lochte had flown back to the U.S. Monday on a commercial flight.In a statement released Thursday night, the U.S Olympic Committee said Bentz and Conger had given statements to local officials and recently departed Rio. Feigen also gave a revised statement in hopes of reclaiming his passport, which was seized.Early Friday morning, Feigen agreed to make an $11,000 donation to a Brazilian charity in exchange for his freedom, his lawyer in Rio, Breno Melaragno Costa, announced. According to ABC News, once Feigen makes the donation to the Reaction Institute, his passport will be returned and he will be free to leave the country.The USOC said its understanding of the incident was the account given by Brazilian police: an act of vandalism at a gas station in Rio, an argument with security and the monetary payment. “The behavior of these athletes is not acceptable, nor does it represent the values of Team USA or the conduct of the vast majority of its members,” the statement from the organization said, promising to review the incident and any possible consequences for the swimmers.“On behalf of the United States Olympic Committee, we apologize to our hosts in Rio and the people of Brazil for this distracting ordeal in the midst of what should rightly be a celebration of excellence,” it concluded.The false account from the Americans has hit a nerve with many Rio residents, who chafed at the way the foreigners fed the characterization of the city as a dangerous, crime-ridden place. Despite the mounting evidence against the swimmers’ original claims, Lochte’s lawyer on Thursday still insisted that a robbery occurred. Chief of Civil Police Fernando Veloso said in Thursday press conference that potential charges of false communication of a crime and damaging private assets were unlikely to stick since the swimmers paid for the damage and the gas station owner was not pressing charges, CNN reports.This story has been updated with a statement from the U.S. Olympic Committee and news about Feigen’s deal with authorities."

Lochte also revised the lead-up to the scene, saying the swimmers had stopped at a gas station to use the bathroom when the incident occurred, after first claiming the armed men pulled them over. Bentz and Conger were pulled off their return flight home on Wednesday to be questioned by police. A Brazilian judge ordered police on Wednesday to seize Lochte and Feigen’s passports so they could be questioned, but Lochte had flown back to the U.S. Monday on a commercial flight.In a statement released Thursday night, the U.S Olympic Committee said Bentz and Conger had given statements to local officials and recently departed Rio. Feigen also gave a revised statement in hopes of reclaiming his passport, which was seized.Early Friday morning, Feigen agreed to make an $11,000 donation to a Brazilian charity in exchange for his freedom, his lawyer in Rio, Breno Melaragno Costa, announced. According to ABC News, once Feigen makes the donation to the Reaction Institute, his passport will be returned and he will be free to leave the country.The USOC said its understanding of the incident was the account given by Brazilian police: an act of vandalism at a gas station in Rio, an argument with security and the monetary payment. “The behavior of these athletes is not acceptable, nor does it represent the values of Team USA or the conduct of the vast majority of its members,” the statement from the organization said, promising to review the incident and any possible consequences for the swimmers.“On behalf of the United States Olympic Committee, we apologize to our hosts in Rio and the people of Brazil for this distracting ordeal in the midst of what should rightly be a celebration of excellence,” it concluded.The false account from the Americans has hit a nerve with many Rio residents, who chafed at the way the foreigners fed the characterization of the city as a dangerous, crime-ridden place. Despite the mounting evidence against the swimmers’ original claims, Lochte’s lawyer on Thursday still insisted that a robbery occurred. Chief of Civil Police Fernando Veloso said in Thursday press conference that potential charges of false communication of a crime and damaging private assets were unlikely to stick since the swimmers paid for the damage and the gas station owner was not pressing charges, CNN reports.This story has been updated with a statement from the U.S. Olympic Committee and news about Feigen’s deal with authorities."

42,THE WORLDPOST,Syrian Boy With Meningitis Evacuated From Besieged Town,Rowaida Abdelaziz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/syrian-boy-with-meningitis-evacuated-from-besieged-town_us_57b73aabe4b0b51733a329db,"Eleven-year-old Yaman, who was suffering for weeks, is now finally receiving help.",2016-08-19,"Yaman Ezzedine, 11 years old, was suffering from severe meningitis in the weeks prior his evacuation.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b741481700001108c7441f.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For nearly a month, 11-year-old Yaman Ezzedine has been suffering from horrible pain caused by meningitis that his doctors in Madaya, Syria, lack the equipment and medicine to treat. Madaya is under siege by the Syrian government, so Yaman’s family in Syria and the United States have pleaded for help from aid organizations and lawmakers so he could leave the town to get treatment elsewhere. On Friday, their prayers were finally answered as the Syrian Arab Red Crescent evacuated Yaman and 12 other children out of the besieged town and took them to Damascus for needed medical attention, Yaman’s doctor said. The news came less than 24 hours after The WorldPost first reported on Yaman’s condition. The Syrian Arab Red Crescent said in a tweet that it was evacuating a total of “36 humanitarian cases” from Madaya and two government-held towns, Kafraya and Fuaa, in northwestern province of Idlib.A local Syrian doctor, Mohamed Darwich, who had diagnosed Yaman, told The WorldPost that Yaman was among those evacuated to Damascus to receive treatment, along with children suffering from malnutrition and two babies with blood poisoning, according to AFP. Yaman’s uncle, Yousif Jabir, who lives in Allentown, Pennsylvania, has been appealing to local organizations for help. He said he was overcome with emotion at the news. “I am not able to express what I want to say from my heart and how much gratitude I have,” Jabir said. Yaman’s mother, Khawala Jabir, said Friday from Madaya that she only wished she could go with her son to Damascus. “But I am very thankful,” she said.For Khawala Jabir and others in Madaya, a rural town on the outskirts of Damascus, starvation and a severe lack of medical and humanitarian aid are a part of daily life. An estimated 40,000 residents have been affected by food and medicine shortages in the town. The starvation and blockades persists despite multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions aimed at ensuring the delivery of aid to those in need, regardless of who controls the territory.There are 4.5 million people who live in regions of Syria that are hard to reach for aid groups, 400,000 of whom live in besieged areas, according to the United Nations."
