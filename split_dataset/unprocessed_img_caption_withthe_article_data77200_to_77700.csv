Elizabeth Warren spoke Sunday about three major areas in which black people still face injustice.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/560845291900002f00fde7ce.jpeg?cache=4UFOuouQxg&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on Sunday forcefully called for a renewed focus on the fight for racial justice, arguing that “we have not made enough progress” since the civil rights movement of the 1960s and outlining three main policy areas in which black people continue to face discrimination, including her signature issue of economic inequality.Speaking at the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate in Boston, established by her late predecessor, Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.), Warren’s speech was tied to the legacy of the monumental 1960s civil rights laws that Kennedy championed.“These laws made three powerful declarations: Black lives matter. Black citizens matter. Black families matter,” she said, according to her prepared remarks.But she said it is clear that “we have not made enough progress,” organizing the speech around three major areas in which black people still face injustice: police violence, voting restrictions and economic inequality.Linking her long-standing fight for the middle class to the fight for racial justice, Warren conceded that “economic justice is not and has never been sufficient to ensure racial justice.” However, Warren pivoted back to her signature issue throughout her speech, noting that African-Americans continue to face diminished economic prospects and discrimination in housing, education and employment.She also reminded the audience that the March on Washington with Martin Luther King Jr. in 1963 was as much about economic justice as it was about racial justice.“When Dr. King led hundreds of thousands of people to march on Washington, he talked about an end to violence, access to voting and economic opportunity. As Dr. King once wrote, ‘the inseparable twin of racial injustice was economic injustice.’”Warren acknowledged that economic reforms are not enough to combat the racism that still persists in America. “Owning a home won’t stop someone from burning a cross on the front lawn. Admission to a school won’t prevent a beating on the sidewalk outside,” she said.Citing the recent deaths of African-Americans in police custody, such as Michael Brown, Sandra Bland and Freddie Gray, as well as the aggressive tactics police used during the protests against these deaths, she lamented that black people continue to experience disproportionately unfair treatment from police. In proposing solutions, she echoed the recent calls for police reforms, including the need to create more diverse police forces that “look like, and come from, the neighborhoods they serve” and the demilitarization of police.“This is America, not a war zone, and policing practices in all cities, not just some, need to reflect that,” she said.Warren also railed against the continued assault against voting rights for minorities, particularly in the South, where lawmakers have resorted to more subtle tactics for keeping voters off the rolls, such as gerrymandering, voter ID laws and more complicated voting procedures. She scolded congressional Republicans for holding out on legislation to restore the Voting Rights Act, parts of which were struck down by the Supreme Court in a 2013 ruling. She also called on states to implement automatic voter registration to reduce the procedural hurdles of voting.She tied the central argument of her speech back to her message of economic inequality, citing persistent housing discrimination against blacks, the high black unemployment rate, and how the housing bubble and economic recession disproportionately gutted economic opportunities for the black middle class. Warren hailed what is perhaps her most famous policy achievement, the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as the first step in curtailing discriminatory mortgage and banking policies.“It’s time to come down hard on predatory practices that allow financial institutions to systematically strip wealth out of communities of color. One of the ugly consequences of bank deregulation was that there was no cop on the beat when too many financial institutions figured out that they could make great money by tricking, trapping and defrauding targeted families,” she said.Warren acknowledged that as a white politician, “I speak today with the full knowledge that I have not personally experienced and can never truly understand the fear, the oppression, and the pain that confronts African-Americans every day,” she said. “But none of us can ignore what is happening in this country. Not when our black friends, family, neighbors literally fear dying in the streets.“It comes to us to once again affirm that black lives matter, that black citizens matter, that black families matter.”The speech drew praise from Black Lives Matter activists, like DeRay Mckesson, who has prominently called for lawmakers to make direct policy proposals that address police violence. ""Warren, better than any political leader I've yet heard, understands the protests as a matter of life or death — that the American dream has been sustained by an intentional violence and that the uprisings have been the result of years of lived trauma,"" Mckesson told The Washington Post.

The,2015-09-27,"Pope Francis blesses a family during an open-air mass at the Benjamin Franklin Parkway in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on September 27, 2015. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56085a991b00003000dfda1c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Pope Francis celebrated Mass before a crowd of almost one million on Philadelphia's Benjamin Franklin Parkway on Sunday. The event marked the conclusion of the World Meeting of Families and Francis's final public address in the United States before departing for Rome.Read the pope's homily below, as provided in English by the Vatican: Today the word of God surprises us with powerful and thought-provoking images. Images which challenge us, but also stir our enthusiasm.In the first reading, Joshua tells Moses that two members of the people are prophesying, speaking God’s word, without a mandate. In the Gospel, John tells Jesus that the disciples had stopped someone from casting out evil spirits in the name of Jesus. Here is the surprise: Moses and Jesus both rebuke those closest to them for being so narrow! Would that all could be prophets of God’s word! Would that everyone could work miracles in the Lord’s name!Jesus encountered hostility from people who did not accept what he said and did. For them, his openness to the honest and sincere faith of many men and women who were not part of God’s chosen people seemed intolerable. The disciples, for their part, acted in good faith. But the temptation to be scandalized by the freedom of God, who sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous alike (Mt 5:45), bypassing bureaucracy, officialdom and inner circles, threatens the authenticity of faith. Hence it must be vigorously rejected.Once we realize this, we can understand why Jesus’ words about causing “scandal” are so harsh. For Jesus, the truly “intolerable” scandal consists in everything that breaks down and destroys our trust in the working of the Spirit!Our Father will not be outdone in generosity and he continues to scatter seeds. He scatters the seeds of his presence in our world, for “love consists in this, not that we have loved God but that he loved us” first (1 Jn 4:10). That love gives us a profound certainty: we are sought by God; he waits for us. It is this confidence which makes disciples encourage, support and nurture the good things happening all around them. God wants all his children to take part in the feast of the Gospel. Jesus says, “Do not hold back anything that is good, instead help it to grow!” To raise doubts about the working of the Spirit, to give the impression that it cannot take place in those who are not “part of our group”, who are not “like us”, is a dangerous temptation. Not only does it block conversion to the faith; it is a perversion of faith!Faith opens a “window” to the presence and working of the Spirit. It shows us that, like happiness, holiness is always tied to little gestures. “Whoever gives you a cup of water in my name will not go unrewarded”, says Jesus (cf. Mk 9:41). These little gestures are those we learn at home, in the family; they get lost amid all the other things we do, yet they do make each day different. They are the quiet things done by mothers and grandmothers, by fathers and grandfathers, by children. They are little signs of tenderness, affection and compassion. Like the warm supper we look forward to at night, the early lunch awaiting someone who gets up early to go to work. Homely gestures. Like a blessing before we go to bed, or a hug after we return from a hard day’s work. Love is shown by little things, by attention to small daily signs which make us feel at home. Faith grows when it is lived and shaped by love. That is why our families, our homes, are true domestic churches. They are the right place for faith to become life, and life to become faith.Jesus tells us not to hold back these little miracles. Instead, he wants us to encourage them, to spread them. He asks us to go through life, our everyday life, encouraging all these little signs of love as signs of his own living and active presence in our world.So we might ask ourselves: How are we trying to live this way in our homes, in our societies? What kind of world do we want to leave to our children (cf. Laudato Si’, 160)? We cannot answer these questions alone, by ourselves. It is the Spirit who challenges us to respond as part of the great human family. Our common house can no longer tolerate sterile divisions. The urgent challenge of protecting our home includes the effort to bring the entire human family together in the pursuit of a sustainable and integral development, for we know that things can change (cf. ibid., 13). May our children find in us models and incentives to communion! May our children find in us men and women capable of joining others in bringing to full flower all the good seeds which the Father has sown!Pointedly, yet affectionately, Jesus tells us: “If you, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!” (Lk 11:13). How much wisdom there is in these few words! It is true that, as far as goodness and purity of heart are concerned, we human beings don’t have much to show! But Jesus knows that, where children are concerned, we are capable of boundless generosity. So he reassures us: if only we have faith, the Father will give us his Spirit.We Christians, the Lord’s disciples, ask the families of the world to help us! How many of us are here at this celebration! This is itself something prophetic, a kind of miracle in today’s world. Would that we could all be prophets! Would that all of us could be open to miracles of love for the sake of all the families of the world, and thus overcome the scandal of a narrow, petty love, closed in on itself, impatient of others!And how beautiful it would be if everywhere, even beyond our borders, we could appreciate and encourage this prophecy and this miracle! We renew our faith in the word of the Lord which invites faithful families to this openness. It invites all those who want to share the prophecy of the covenant of man and woman, which generates life and reveals God!Anyone who wants to bring into this world a family which teaches children to be excited by every gesture aimed at overcoming evil – a family which shows that the Spirit is alive and at work – will encounter our gratitude and our appreciation. Whatever the family, people, region, or religion to which they belong!May God grant to all of us, as the Lord’s disciples, the grace to be worthy of this purity of heart which is not scandalized by the Gospel!Also on HuffPost:"

14,HEALTHY LIVING,How To Build Resilience Every Day,"meQuilibrium, ContributorPersonalized Stress Management",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-to-build-resilience-every-day_b_8183384.html,Here are three ways to make resilience a practice in your life right now -- and reap the benefits of being able to ride out any storm (or surf through it).,2015-09-27,Group Of Friends Standing By Car On Coastal Road At Sunset,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9f00021f00005000223e31.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Resilience is not just the ability to survive challenging times; it's the ability to thrive in them. Those who learn to build their own resilience can enjoy their work, their relationships, and the daily bustle more than someone who gets knocked down by stress over and over again. Anyone can learn to do this. But it takes practice. And stress is the ultimate catch 22. The more stressed you are, the less able you are to make the changes that would alleviate it. That's why we view building resilience as a practice--something that you do daily, a little at a time, until the wellspring of resilience is part of you. That steady practice is what provides the big payoff. Here are three ways to make resilience a practice in your life right now -- and reap the benefits of being able to ride out any storm (or surf through it).1. Put resilience on the calendar. The late Steven Covey said, ""don't prioritize your schedule, schedule your priorities."" When you want to make something consistent in your life, you want to build your life around it rather, than trying to shoehorn it in. What activities make you feel good? Energized? Positive? A friend of mine loves taking her dog to the local park every Saturday and doing laps around the track, rain or shine. It helps her clear her mind and get a little movement in. A co-worker spends 10 minutes in the morning at a cafe journaling. Whatever activity loosens the grip of stress should be part of your weekly routine. 2. Practice tuning into your emotion radar. When something in your life goes badly, what emotion do you tend to feel first? For example, if you're in a long line at the grocery store at the end of the day, do you feel frustrated? Angry? Sad? Or guilty, thinking you're a bad parent because you're missing dinner time with your kid? When you regularly feel a negative emotion, you likely have what we call an ""emotion radar"" for it. You've learned to scan for that emotion, even if there's not really a reason to feel it! The good news is that awareness breaks their chokehold. Ask yourself: Is this a habitual response I'm having, and is it making the situation worse? This will help you pause and see if it's truly warranted. 3. Use mistakes as a chance to practice resilience. Ironically, the very moments when you feel your resilience waning are the perfect times to practice it. The next time you lose your cool, snap at your spouse, stay up too late, or start emotional eating--resist spiraling into self-blame or disgust, and instead, choose to do something that will ease your stress and feed your resilience, such as talking a walk or calling a supportive friend. Of course, there will be times when stress gets the best of you The key is to remember that practice makes perfect. Every single action your take towards feeling more resilient and positive, however small, is a win.-----------HuffPost's GPS for the Soul app is based on two truths about human beings.

At the same time, antitrust laws have been relaxed for corporations with significant market power, such as big food companies and the largest Wall Street banks.",2015-09-27,Fast food and other arganisations strike action for a living wage.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb9137a2100005002c97776.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"You often hear inequality has widened because globalization and technological change have made most people less competitive, while making the best educated more competitive.There's some truth to this. The tasks most people used to do can now be done more cheaply by lower-paid workers abroad or by computer-driven machines.But this common explanation overlooks a critically important phenomenon: the increasing concentration of political power in a corporate and financial elite that has been able to influence the rules by which the economy runs.As I argue in my new book, Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few (out this week), this transformation has amounted to a pre-distribution upward.Intellectual property rights -- patents, trademarks, and copyrights -- have been enlarged and extended, for example, creating windfalls for pharmaceutical companies.Americans now pay the highest pharmaceutical costs of any advanced nation.At the same time, antitrust laws have been relaxed for corporations with significant market power, such as big food companies, cable companies facing little or no broadband competition, big airlines, and the largest Wall Street banks.As a result, Americans pay more for broadband Internet, food, airline tickets, and banking services than the citizens of any other advanced nation.Bankruptcy laws have been loosened for large corporations -- airlines, automobile manufacturers, even casino magnates like Donald Trump -- allowing them to leave workers and communities stranded.But bankruptcy has not been extended to homeowners burdened by mortgage debt or to graduates laden with student debt. Their debts won't be forgiven.The largest banks and auto manufacturers were bailed out in 2008, shifting the risks of economic failure onto the backs of average working people and taxpayers.Contract laws have been altered to require mandatory arbitration before private judges selected by big corporations. Securities laws have been relaxed to allow insider trading of confidential information.CEOs now use stock buybacks to boost share prices when they cash in their own stock options.Tax laws have special loopholes for the partners of hedge funds and private-equity funds, special favors for the oil and gas industry, lower marginal income-tax rates on the highest incomes, and reduced estate taxes on great wealth.Meanwhile, so-called ""free trade"" agreements, such as the pending Trans Pacific Partnership, give stronger protection to intellectual property and financial assets but less protection to the labor of average working Americans.Today, nearly one out of every three working Americans is in a part-time job. Many are consultants, freelancers and independent contractors. Two-thirds are living paycheck to paycheck.And employment benefits have shriveled. The portion of workers with any pension connected to their job has fallen from just over half in 1979 to under 35 percent today.Labor unions have been eviscerated. Fifty years ago, when General Motors was the largest employer in America, the typical GM worker, backed by a strong union, earned $35 an hour in today's dollars.Now America's largest employer is Walmart, and the typical entry-level Walmart worker, without a union, earns about $9 an hour. More states have adopted so-called ""right-to-work"" laws, designed to bust unions. The National Labor Relations Board, understaffed and overburdened, has barely enforced collective bargaining.All of these changes have resulted in higher corporate profits, higher returns for shareholders, and higher pay for top corporate executives and Wall Street bankers - and lower pay and higher prices for most other Americans.They amount to a giant pre-distribution upward to the rich. But we're not aware of them because they're hidden inside the market.The underlying problem, then, is not just globalization and technological changes that have made most American workers less competitive. Nor is it that they lack enough education to be sufficiently productive.The more basic problem is that the market itself has become tilted ever more in the direction of moneyed interests that have exerted disproportionate influence over it, while average workers have steadily lost bargaining power -- both economic and political -- to receive as large a portion of the economy's gains as they commanded in the first three decades after World War II.Reversing the scourge of widening inequality requires reversing the upward pre-distributions within the rules of the market, and giving average people the bargaining power they need to get a larger share of the gains from growth.The answer to this problem is not found in economics. It is found in politics. Ultimately, the trend toward widening inequality in America, as elsewhere, can be reversed only if the vast majority join together to demand fundamental change.The most important political competition over the next decades will not be between the right and left, or between Republicans and Democrats. It will be between a majority of Americans who have been losing ground, and an economic elite that refuses to recognize or respond to its growing distress.ROBERT B. REICH's new book, ""Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few,"" will be out September 29. His film ""Inequality for All"" is now available on DVD and blu-ray, and on Netflix.

Things have just been too damned busy! There are so many things to do around the house -- laundry to be folded, papers to be graded, kids to be driven places -- and on top of that I don't like to wait in line. In the meantime, I don't see why that should stop me from posting a review. Dozens of other art writers, critics and bloggers have been writing about the Broad since it opened last week, and after having actually ""seen"" it, some have made prose of its alleged deficiencies. They have obviously enjoyed having the chance to apply their opinions to a freshly-minted institution. I'm honestly a bit jealous of that. Why should I miss out on an opportunity to do some clever writing and get my name out there, just because I haven't actually seen the place? I have enough innate biases and pre-formed opinions to write something that might actually come across as substantial. By looking at photos online and tossing in a few well-worn anecdotes I'm sure I can write something opinionated and even semi-informed that will earn some Facebook shares. A good slam or a clever turn of phrase always brings attention. Besides, I have also been reading the early reviews, so my expectations have already been shaped: the collection is apparently nothing special. Eric Gibson, writing in the Wall Street Journal, says that The Broad is ""a safe, predictable mirror of the art-world status quo."" Why spend three hours on the freeway to see ""status quo"" art? I appreciate both your jadedness and the heads-up Eric. Image by Alissa Walker for GizmodoThen, there is the building. Oliver Wainright of ""The Guardian"" says that it has ""the look of a supersized cheese grater - ready to shred any other building that dares come close."" As if that vignette of the exterior isn't chilling enough, here is what Rainey Knudson, blogging for Glasstire, says of the passage from the Broad's lobby to its galleries: ""Imagine being a microbe passing through the shell of an armadillo up into its gray vagina, and you get the gist."" That truly gives me pause... But that's not all. Philip Kennicott, the Pulitzer Prize winning critic of the Washington Post, has done me the additional favor of insinuating that Eli Broad, isn't a nice man: ""Ask around,"" Kennicott cautions, ""and no one seems to like him."" I wish someone had warned years ago that J. Paul Getty and Norton Simon weren't nice men and then I wouldn't have wasted all those hours in their museums. Kennicott also isn't a fan of the Broad's collection. ""More than 250 works are on display,"" he reports, ""and too many of them are the usual high-end trash.""Having taken these and other negative reviews to heart I am going to go out on a limb and add my voice to the chorus of clever condemnations. Here goes:The Broad is the worst thing to happen to Los Angeles since its electric streetcar system was shut down through the evil machinations of General Motors. It is a Trojan gift-horse and a giant Bose speaker masquerading as a temple of culture. Add to that, the man who founded it was born in Canada and started his career as an accountant. Those facts alone should concern us. Image by BoxCakeNinja for GizmodoAt the opening of The Broad, Eli Broad told the crowd: ""This museum is our gift to Los Angeles and we hope you enjoy it."" Let's be real: nobody is actually that generous. Plus, the Broads are known billionaires, and the art they have donated to their eponymous museums tends to be very, very expensive. Clearly, the Broad's munificence is motivated only by their need to impress, and they can't possibly actually care about art. Why? They are simply too rich, and that negates the possibility that their passions are genuine or that they truly care about the city of Los Angeles. I genuinely feel sorry for the long lines of Angelenos who waited in the blazing sun to visit the Broad on its opening day. Maybe it was the heat, but they missed the obvious faults that so many critics have cleverly pointed out. For example, artist Ralph Loynachan, who attended the opening told the LA Times: ""The whole museum -- it's absolutely stupifying, it's glorious."" Had Mr. Loynachan done what I did -- stayed home -- he could have perhaps avoided being swayed by his openness to actual experience. When I visit the Broad, I'm not going to make the same mistake. I'm going to make sure to use my personal visit to the Broad as an opportunity to show that I'm just a bit too cool for the place, a bit above the fray. To simply step back and say ""This is a great thing for Los Angeles"" would be just too obvious and uninformed. Even when I am actually standing there in the building, I'll be careful not to see it."

He became an assistant counsel for Cuomo in 2011 after working in finance.A police spokeswoman said on Saturday that no arrests have been made in the case. Police released a surveillance video two weeks ago that shows two men apparently armed with handguns running into a building near the site of the shooting.Police also released a sketch of a suspect who is wanted for questioning in connection with the shooting. The suspect was described as a 19- to 20-year-old black man wearing a white T-shirt, black pants and a Jamaican flag around his neck.""I met Pope Francis this week, and a big part of me wanted to ask Pope Francis the same question: Pope, why?

It's been called ""seriously misjudged"" and ""terribly offensive,"" with many indictments claiming the film whitewashes the history of the 1969 gay-rights riots that are said to have launched the modern LGBT movement.The framework of ""Stonewall"" belongs to Danny Winters, a Midwestern kid (the ""straight-acting"" Jeremy Irvine) who flees to New York to escape his homophobic parents and attend Columbia. Upon arriving in Greenwich Village, he encounters a crew of hustlers who take him under their wing while evading bigoted police and the corrupt manager of the titular watering hole, which seems like one of the few safe havens for gay crowds. Along the way, he finds a boyfriend (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) and carouses with a fleet of gender-fluid denizens escaping horrible home lives. That places a young, white, cisgender hunk at the center of ""Stonewall"" amid only a few women, people of color and transgender activists, à la Marsha P. Johnson, who drifts through the movie's periphery despite some saying she chunked the first brick into the Stonewall window and launched the uprising.Earlier this week, The Huffington Post sat down with Emmerich, who is best known for disaster movies like ""Independence Day"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow."" The German director seemed to be taking the controversy in stride. The owners of Stonewall must endorse this movie, since the press junket is taking place here at the bar.I don’t know. [Laughs]You made this on a soundstage in Montreal. Why not shoot in New York?Well, we wanted to do it first in New York because we wanted authenticity for everything. We wanted to actually shoot it here in front of Stonewall, but it was just too difficult. It’s hard to get permits in New York because of the traffic. It’s not like the ’69 Village anymore, so it was pretty clear that we had to do something else. Then we tried somewhere else in the area of New York, finding streets which look similar, but we couldn’t find it. And then I actually had that idea, and it’s a little bit because I’m actually more used to doing stuff like that. I said, “Why don’t we build it, but build it indoors?” We can really light it exactly like we want, and what you can do these days with digital cameras is you can work on the exposure, which is much more friendly for lower-budget films because we don’t need so much light. And then there was a decision made to go to Montreal. I had shot like two movies already in Montreal, and I knew a facility which was perfect for it. I knew there were a couple of streets in Old Montreal that have cobblestone that you can use for New York in the late ‘60s. And on top of it, there’s a huge gay population in Montreal.Having shot a lot of big-budget movies on soundstages, were you more comfortable with that setup?I would not say comfortable. All of these decisions are solutions. You have problems and you try to find solutions for them. The good thing was it created safe haven for the extras and the crew and the actors. This was their square. It was indoors and it was relatively comfortable. There was a sort of family feel because it was in an existing bubble. It was a very friendly atmosphere and at one point I decided to only use gay extras because we tried it the other way and it didn’t mix really. You felt it.So you started shooting and then decided to hire only gay extras?Yes, and after one or two days, I said, ""Let’s make this our rule."" And this was at the very beginning because, like in the club, I want to only have gay people there because, first of all, they behave differently -- you feel it.How do you manage that? Surely you can't post casting notices that ask for gay people only. No, this was carefully done because you can’t ask people, “Are you gay or not?” What you do is you go to gay places and recruit there. They had casting people go every night to clubs and talk to people because, on top of it, they had to have certain hairstyles for the period. We would work with some wigs, but for the most part people needed to have certain hairstyles.Was ""Stonewall"" less pressure than, say, ""2012"" or another disaster film?Not necessarily, but it was more fun. The filmmaking process is very similar -- you’ll have a camera and actors and lights and a sound guy. Also, when I make my big films, I’m always relieved when I read my schedule for that day and it only includes dialogue. I’m always super happy. Everything has a certain schedule, and it was a tough schedule. We shot for 42 days, half of what I normally have and the script was very long. But it was fun and what I liked about it the most was how we grew together as a family, in a way. I’m very into that. On the weekends, I would always organize dinners and everybody was invited.You've said that no studio wanted to finance ""Stonewall,"" so how did the resources come together? Putting together this budget seems like a cinch compared to making movies for upwards of $100 million.Yeah, well, that’s kind of super easy for me to get that kind of money for those kinds of films. For this one, it was super hard. I had to pre-sale a lot of territories and put my own money in and find friends who put their money in. But it all came together. That feels like something a first-time filmmaker experiences.Yeah. But I’m used to it a little bit because my very first four films I also put my own money in.But those were your first four films. You’re one of the highest-grossing directors of all time. Is there a sense of, ""Why can’t I just make the movie that I want to make even if it isn’t associated with my usual brand?""Yeah, I was totally saying, “I make all these movies for them and they make all this money, and now they kind of don’t support me.” Totally.I’m curious whether you saw Larry Kramer’s response to the ...The craziness?Right. What was it like to hear from him?First of all, I admire this man. I think “The Normal Heart” is one of the best plays out there, and it was made into an HBO film. I was happy that somebody kind of said, “Guys, what is this here?” But on the other hand, I have a real deep sympathy for black transgender women because they have it the hardest. And I think it’s their year right now, or their two or three years. It was the lesbians for two or three years when Ellen went on the air as an openly lesbian woman. It’s just their time right now, and here we come with this trailer that shows the white kid throwing the brick. I always said, “Well, nobody knows who threw the brick anyways, so it’s kind of totally open.” And I felt it was appropriate to have it be Danny, but that’s just my artistic whatever.Would the movie’s response have been different three years ago? There’s been a tipping point with gay rights over the past 12 years, and now folks aren't just going to say, ""Well, at least there's something depicting LGBT people on the big screen.""Yeah, totally. But it’s also interesting for me because the transgender movement is mainly carried right now by Caitlyn Jenner. She’s white, she’s rich. She is furthest away from a black, transgender girl who’s kind of poor. Also, I have to say, I’m aware of how difficult it is for even a white transgender woman because I’ve been really good friends with Candis Cayne over the years and I’ve heard horror stories. But I also say go into a gay center and see how many homeless LGBT youths there are and how tough their life is. That, for me, was an eye-opener. When I was going to the gay and lesbian center in Los Angeles and just got a normal tour, they said, ""Here is our homeless youth program. And you have to know the following: First of all, of all homeless youths, 40 percent are LGBT."" I said, “40 percent!” And then they kind of tell you, “Well, it’s really bad because if somebody is homeless and gay, they are selling their body in the first week, they take drugs in the first week and they get robbed in the first week.” And then you kind of say, “Oh, my God,” because you have this comfortable life. Yes, we have gay marriage and all these things, but what about these kids? So as a society we must take more care of them. And then you learn from some sort of studio executive that, “Well, you have to understand, Roland, this is all these kids, but what we need is a central character where we can have a famous star and he can hopefully win an Oscar or something like that.”Did studios actually tell you that, or were you just expecting them to?No, I was told that. I also did a fundraiser for the homeless-youths program, and it was so interesting how hard it was to get people to buy tables.What year was that?That was last year.Wow. Yet you seem even-keeled about the movie’s controversy. Do you feel like it’s just the name of the game after so many years in the business?I’ve been doing this quite awhile. I understand people’s criticisms, but I also understand that when you make movies you always have people critize you and people who like it. I always have to test movies with audiences, so because I have to do it, I did it also with this film. I didn’t have to do it, but I did it, and I learned so much about what I do and who likes it and who embraces the movie. What I learned, actually, was it was very evenly liked by gay and straight people, which does not happen so often in these kinds of films. And that was more something that I care about. You feel really nervous and vulnerable in that moment, and then when it’s done and you know that you have a movie that everybody likes, then if someone criticizes me, it’s like, it’s one person’s opinion -- it’s not the majority.""Stonewall"" is now in theaters.

27,RELIGION,Pope Francis' Message To Philadelphia Catholics At The Cathedral of Sts. Peter and Paul,Carol Kuruvilla,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pope-francis-message-to-pennsylvania-catholics-at-the-cathedral-of-sts-peter-and-paul_us_5606ad28e4b0af3706dc7869,"The pope praised Philadelphia's religious history in front of 1,600 people.",2015-09-26,"People hold up religious items while waiting for Pope Francis at Independence Hall on September 26, 2015 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5606b6de1b00002f00dfd9c3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Pope Francis celebrated Mass at The Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul on Saturday, delivering a homily that lifted up Philadelphia's Catholic history and encouraged those listening to continue building the faith in the city.About 1,600 people attended the service inside Philadelphia's main cathedral according to the AP. The only other pope to visit Philadelphia was Pope John Paul II, in 1979.Francis has a busy day ahead of him. At 4:45 p.m., he's scheduled to speak at Independence Mall. In the evening, he'll visit World Meeting of Families Festival of Families on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway.Read the full text of Francis' speech at the cathedral below. This morning I learned something about the history of this beautiful Cathedral: the story behind its high walls and windows. I would like to think, though, that the history of the Church in this city and state is really a story not about building walls, but about breaking them down. It is a story about generation after generation of committed Catholics going out to the peripheries, and building communities of worship, education, charity and service to the larger society.That story is seen in the many shrines which dot this city, and the many parish churches whose towers and steeples speak of God’s presence in the midst of our communities. It is seen in the efforts of all those dedicated priests, religious and laity who for over two centuries have ministered to the spiritual needs of the poor, the immigrant, the sick and those in prison. And it is seen in the hundreds of schools where religious brothers and sisters trained children to read and write, to love God and neighbor, and to contribute as good citizens to the life of American society. All of this is a great legacy which you have received, and which you have been called to enrich and pass on.Most of you know the story of Saint Katharine Drexel, one of the great saints raised up by this local Church. When she spoke to Pope Leo XIII of the needs of the missions, the Pope – he was a very wise Pope! – asked her pointedly: “What about you? What are you going to do?”. Those words changed Katharine’s life, because they reminded her that, in the end, every Christian man and woman, by virtue of baptism, has received a mission. Each one of us has to respond, as best we can, to the Lord’s call to build up his Body, the Church.“What about you?” I would like to dwell on two aspects of these words in the context of our particular mission to transmit the joy of the Gospel and to build up the Church, whether as priests, deacons, or members of institutes of consecrated life.First, those words – “What about you?” – were addressed to a young person, a young woman with high ideals, and they changed her life. They made her think of the immense work that had to be done, and to realize that she was being called to do her part. How many young people in our parishes and schools have the same high ideals, generosity of spirit, and love for Christ and the Church! Do we challenge them? Do we make space for them and help them to do their part? To find ways of sharing their enthusiasm and gifts with our communities, above all in works of mercy and concern for others? Do we share our own joy and enthusiasm in serving the Lord?One of the great challenges facing the Church in this generation is to foster in all the faithful a sense of personal responsibility for the Church’s mission, and to enable them to fulfill that responsibility as missionary disciples, as a leaven of the Gospel in our world. This will require creativity in adapting to changed situations, carrying forward the legacy of the past not primarily by maintaining our structures and institutions, which have served us well, but above all by being open to the possibilities which the Spirit opens up to us and communicating the joy of the Gospel, daily and in every season of our life.“What about you?” It is significant that those words of the elderly Pope were also addressed to a lay woman. We know that the future of the Church in a rapidly changing society will call, and even now calls, for a much more active engagement on the part of the laity. The Church in the United States has always devoted immense effort to the work of catechesis and education. Our challenge today is to build on those solid foundations and to foster a sense of collaboration and shared responsibility in planning for the future of our parishes and institutions. This does not mean relinquishing the spiritual authority with which we have been entrusted; rather, it means discerning and employing wisely the manifold gifts which the Spirit pours out upon the Church. In a particular way, it means valuing the immense contribution which women, lay and religious, have made and continue to make, to the life of our communities.Dear brothers and sisters, I thank you for the way in which each of you has answered Jesus’ question which inspired your own vocation: “What about you?” I encourage you to be renewed in the joy of that first encounter with Jesus and to draw from that joy renewed fidelity and strength. I look forward to being with you in these days and I ask you to bring my affectionate greetings to those who could not be with us, especially the many elderly priests and religious who join us in spirit.During these days of the World Meeting of Families, I would ask you in a particular way to reflect on our ministry to families, to couples preparing for marriage, and to our young people. I know how much is being done in your local Churches to respond to the needs of families and to support them in their journey of faith. I ask you to pray fervently for them, and for the deliberations of the forthcoming Synod on the Family.Now, with gratitude for all we have received, and with confident assurance in all our needs, let us turn to Mary, our Blessed Mother. With a mother’s love, may she intercede for the growth of the Church in America in prophetic witness to the power of her Son’s Cross to bring joy, hope and strength into our world. I pray for each of you, and I ask you, please, to pray for me.  "

It moved to a local United Methodist Church instead and is operating simultaneously, but with vastly smaller numbers than the 17,000 people on hand for the main event at the Pennsylvania Convention Center.Then, just as the single session on homosexuality at this Vatican-approved meeting of Catholic families was to begin on Thursday afternoon (Sept. 24), a conference official took the stage in the main hall, capable of seating at least 10,000, and announced the location had been moved.Thousands of people got up and made their way up one floor to another room capable of seating only about 1,000. Hundreds of others were turned away, the doors shut on them by convention center officials citing fire code regulations.Inside the session, it was standing room only, with some people sitting on the floors and in the aisles. All were silent as Ron Belgau, the sole openly gay man allowed to make a presentation here, took the microphone and, with his mother Beverley, described how he follows a “traditional Christian sexual ethic” that says homosexual activity is sinful.“Some people have described me as the official face of gay celibate Catholics,” Belgau, 40, said from a small podium at the front of the room. “But the last thing I want after this session is people looking at me. Every parish has gay kids, every family has a member suffering with same-sex attraction. I hope that when you return to your parishes you will be able to accompany them in whatever struggles they face and speak up” against the stigma of same-sex attraction.At that, the crowd broke into applause — something they did multiple times throughout the session. They seemed especially absorbed when Belgau’s mother, Beverley, took the podium and described her son’s coming out at age 21 as “the worst day of my life.”“You may think the fact that he is celibate makes my life easier, and in some way it does,” she said. “But to be attracted to the same sex and publicly celibate in a sexually free society is no easy road to walk.”World Meeting of Families organizers were not immediately available to answers questions about the last-minute move to another room.But for members of Equally Blessed, a coalition of several groups supportive of LGBT Catholics who are not celibate, the move was an echo of the earlier rebuffs.“We are just trying to understand and give them the benefit of the doubt,” said Ryan Hoffmann, director of communications for Call to Action, one of the groups in Equally Blessed.Hoffmann was there with several members of Equally Blessed. He characterized Ron Belgau’s appearance as “generous,” “sincere” and “courageous.”But he added: “The frustration is that he didn’t speak to the many expressions of love LGBT Catholics and their families experience every day.”Still, he said, the fact that so many were turned away is a positive sign.“This just speaks to the fact that people want to talk about LGBT Catholics and their relationship with the Catholic Church,” Hoffmann said.Also on HuffPost:"

And they know that if they leak things and say things that that is catnip to the people who get bored talking about what's your position on student loan relief or dealing with the shortage of mental health care or what to do with the epidemic of prescription drugs and heroin out in America, even in small towns in rural America, or how you're going to get jobs into coal country given how much they've lost in the last 20 years.”Bill Clinton compared the Republicans’ efforts to the protracted, partisan investigations he endured as president. “We're seeing history repeat itself,” Clinton said. He noted that the Whitewater investigation, which exhausted $70 million over eight years investigating some of his financial deals in Arkansas, found he had done nothing wrong but allowed Republicans to erode his reputation.The former president also blamed a superficial news media for indulging Republicans’ hype about the private server. Clinton said he was impressed by the number of “really reputable press people” who have explained the weakness of the allegations against Hillary, but said those journalists get inadequate exposure.“There have been a lot of really fine things,” he said. “It's just that they don't seem to show up on television very much.”Bill Clinton’s comments mark the latest attempt by Hillary Clinton’s supporters to limit the political damage of a controversy that increasingly clouds her campaign. Hillary Clinton apologized for using a private email server earlier this month, after her previous attempts to address the matter failed to assuage public doubts. Once the overwhelming favorite for the Democratic presidential nomination, Clinton now trails Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in some Iowa and New Hampshire polls, but remains ahead among Democratic voters nationally.The inspector general of the intelligence agencies said in August that Clinton had received classified information on her private email server, but the candidate insists that it was deemed classified after the fact. The FBI is investigating whether any State Department aides violated the law by knowingly sending classified information to Clinton’s personal address.House Republicans revealed the private server use while investigating Clinton's handling of the attack on the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012. Last November, a bipartisan investigation by the House Intelligence Committee cleared Clinton of deliberate wrongdoing related to the attack. Despite that finding, the House Select Committee on Benghazi has continued its investigation of Clinton, shifting focus to possible misconduct related to her email use.Also on HuffPost:"

During one of his signature slithering dribbles into the penalty box, Messi collided with Las Palmas defender Pedro Bigas in the third minute. He received treatment from team doctors on the pitch and tried to play for two minutes thereafter, but was unable to continue. He asked to be substituted in the eighth minute of the match.

Xi arrived in Washington, the second stop of his state visit to the United States, on Thursday after a busy two-and-a-half-day stay in Seattle. (Xinhua/Pang Xinglei via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5605d3441800002b0083103d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The leaders of the world's two most powerful countries just spent more than four hours together, with visions of their countries' futures on their minds and their most trusted aides at the ready.They walked out without much to show for it.U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping invited reporters to the White House Rose Garden on Friday to describe what they had discussed during meetings that morning and the night before.They stood side by side, trying to project some level of intimacy despite their wooden body language. An accompanying White House fact sheet featured unsurprising announcements -- minor moves on issues ranging from cooperation in building a stable Afghanistan and preventing Iran's development of a nuclear weapon to expanding bans on the ivory trade and being more transparent in military actions, including the launch of ballistic missiles.Two developments stood out.The progress the two leaders made on combating climate change -- by introducing a cap-and-trade system of carbon emissions in China and underscoring the U.S. focus on reducing its own emissions -- topped their list of accomplishments.Their movement on regulating cyberwarfare was a distant second -- which meant it largely met close observers' expectations.Yes, Chinese hackers' penchant for digging through the computer systems of American businesses and government institutions has worried Washington for years. And yes, the Obama administration has faced increasing pressure to act following its announcement last year that it believed five Chinese army officers had tried to pilfer U.S. companies' trade secrets, and its suggestions that China was behind the recently revealed hack of millions of government employee records.""We made very clear to China our deep concerns about certain cyberactivities,"" Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser, told reporters on Tuesday prior to Xi's arrival in Washington.But Friday's press conference showed that those concerns would not be met immediately, in part because China is loath to acknowledge its role in the cyberattacks.Instead, the leaders reached a symbolic agreement -- one that matters because of its language, rather than any action it implies. ""Neither country’s government will conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information,"" the two leaders pledged, according to the White House.Committing to this agreement in principle does not guarantee any change of behavior, Obama emphasized. ""The question now is, are words followed by actions?"" the president said. ""We will be watching carefully to make an assessment as to whether progress has been made.""Yet it brings Beijing closer to tacitly acknowledging that state-sponsored cyberassaults on American business targets are possible -- which means it is one step closer to acknowledging that it may have initiated or at least encouraged such attacks.Xi didn't make that kind of admission Friday, though he did condemn the theft of business information.The Obama administration's dialogue with China about belligerence in the cybersphere has focused on the interests of American industry. It has retained that focus, even as officials like National Security Agency chief Michael Rogers warn that state-on-state cyberwarfare is a greater threat to the U.S. than attacks on the private sector. That's largely because shielding non-government actors is a more feasible battle for Washington. When it hears complaints about attacks on the U.S. government, Beijing is fond of pointing out that government-on-government espionage is de rigeur for most international players, including the U.S. The U.S. believes China ultimately will realize that targeting American firms will be a self-defeating strategy, Rhodes told reporters on Tuesday. ""So we want to make very clear that this puts at risk China’s ability to continue on its economic growth if businesses don’t have confidence that they’re not going to be subjected to cybertheft,"" Rhodes said.The two presidents spent little time talking about their points of disagreement, though they repeatedly said such disputes will not be settled any time soon. On contentious issues, they stuck to oft-heard talking points. Consider the globally important, resource-rich South China Sea. Obama mentioned U.S. concerns about China's expansion there. Xi argued that the Chinese have for millennia thought of themselves as owning a number of strategically located islands in the region.Despite the dearth of earth-shattering progress, Obama's focus on engaging with Xi and encouraging what he describes as the rise of a peaceful, internationally oriented China has, the Chinese president said, left the two countries making ""important progress.""Skeptics of the U.S.-China relationship say that progress is possible because Obama is willing to overlook China's regressive approach to human rights.Influential members of Congress held a bipartisan ""stateless"" breakfast on the Hill Friday, around the time Xi reached the White House, hoping to push human rights issues higher on the summit agenda. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Republican presidential hopeful Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) attended the event, led by Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), Rep. Joe Pitts (R-Pa.) and Rubio.“We want to build a constructive relationship with China as a partner on the world stage, but the human rights abuses that continue there cannot be ignored,"" McGovern said. ""Today, we are giving a voice to all those who China has tried to silence.”By partnering with civil society organizations like Human Rights Watch, the lawmakers featured testimony from six activists working on various human rights issues in China, including freedom of expression, women's rights, arbitrary detention and the targeting of the communist state's Muslim population.Their entire message may not have made it all the way to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, but echoes of it did. Scores of protesters, their numbers swelling as the time of the Rose Garden press conference approached, chanted messages like ""Xi Jinping is a terrorist"" and ""murder murder Chinese government."" Reporters could hear the activists in the Rose Garden before the press conference began, and whenever one of the leaders paused during remarks. But sure enough, camera shutters and lofty talk of China's success largely drowned them out -- relegating the talk of regime abuses to the status of an easily ignored addendum to Friday's historic summit.Ali Watkins contributed reporting."

That is an increase of 52 on the previous figures,” Saudi health minister Khalid al-Falih told a news conference.“Those are the ones who died in various hospitals since the event,” he said, adding that 934 people were wounded.Shi’ite Muslim Iran, which is locked in a series of proxy wars in Arab countries around the Sunni Muslim kingdom, says that at least 136 Iranians are among the dead, sparking protests and outrage in the Islamic Republic on Friday.Over 300 other Iranians remain unaccounted for, including former ambassador to Lebanon Ghazanfar Roknabadi, Fars news agency reported.“We will urge international courts and circles to start the trial of the Saudis for their crimes against haj pilgrims,” Iran’s Prosecutor General Ebrahim Raisi was quoted as saying by student news agency ISNA on Saturday“This is not incompetence, it’s a crime,” Raisi told state broadcaster IRIB.At the U.

Rocca’s mother is Colombian. “I am deeply grateful and humbled to have delivered a reading at a Mass celebrated by @Pontifex,” Rocca tweeted afterward.Joe Sudbay, a veteran LGBT rights activist and writer, interpreted Rocca’s reading as a sign that Pope Francis has followed through on his rhetoric implying he would make the Church more welcoming to gays and lesbians.“Having openly gay @MoRocca do first reading at MSG seems to confirm” Rocca's argument that Francis' July 2013 statement expressing tolerance of gay people was “big,” Sudbay said on Twitter. In 2013, the pontiff famously said, “Who am I to judge a gay person of goodwill who seeks the Lord?”Tony Varona, an American University law professor and LGBT activist, called Rocca's reading “lovely.”Rocca came out in 2011, when he was 42. He insists that his Catholic family members have been very supportive.""Everyone assumes (including my Anglo friends) that it's hard to be gay if you have a parent who is a religious Catholic, and especially a Latin American Catholic -- all I can tell you that wasn't the case with me,” Rocca told the Latin Post in November 2013. “My parents were great."" New Ways Ministry, which calls itself a “gay-positive ministry of advocacy and justice” for LGBT Catholics, was pleased to see the Church include Rocca, but remains skeptical of the institution's overall progress on LGBT rights. Rocca’s starring role comes as LGBT men and women “find themselves unwelcome in many U.S. parishes and more than fifty church workers have lost their jobs in LGBT-related disputes since 2008,” Bob Shine, a staff associate at the ministry, wrote in a blog post.One of the pope's speaking stops on Saturday -- the four-day, Vatican-backed World Meeting of Families -- demonstrates the challenges facing LGBT Catholics seeking greater acceptance in the church. The conference limited attendance to its only session on homosexuality on Thursday and has taken measures to stifle LGBT activism at the event. UPDATE:  Dignity USA, an advocacy group for LGBT Catholics, applauded Mo Rocca's participation in the Friday Mass. ""Mo Rocca’s being chosen to proclaim the first reading at the Papal Mass in New York highlights the presence of LGBTQ people in all aspects of the Catholic church’s ministry,"" Marianne Duddy-Burke, executive director of Dignity USA, said in an emailed statement Monday. ""We are members of the church, lectors, Eucharistic ministers, Catechism teachers, choir members and directors, musicians, priests, nuns, even bishops and cardinals. In some places, we can live and serve and be open about who we are and who we love; in other places, we must remain closeted or risk being fired.""I hope that Mr. Rocca’s visible role was meant to send a message to bishops, priests, and all Catholics that the gifts and ministries of LGBTQ Catholics and our families should be embraced and celebrated,"" Duddy-Burke addd. ""It would be a great thing if the Pope’s visit marked the end of LGBTQ people being told we are unworthy to be full members of our Church.""Also on HuffPost:"

In doing so, she has reminded us we must remember to kneel before we dare stand.”Davis got several standing ovations as she stood on stage. She cried each time, and received a bouquet of flowers as Perkins read the text of the award.“I feel so very undeserving,” Davis said, choking up. “I want to start by thanking my lord and my savior Jesus Christ. Because without him, this would never have been possible. For he is my strength that carries me.”Davis said she’s realized through the challenges in her life that Jesus will “show up at just the right time. His time is always perfect.”She didn’t speak long. Her voice, once quivering, turned to shouting by the end of her remarks. She concluded with, “I am only one, but we are many!”Davis left the stage to another standing ovation and, bizarrely, circus music. "
43,THE WORLDPOST,Inside The Islamic State's Apocalyptic Beliefs,Nick Robins-Early,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/islamic-state-apocalyptic-beliefs_us_56044f37e4b08820d91c21a3,An interview with expert Will McCants.,2015-09-26,Abu Ayyub al-Masri was a leader of the Islamic State prior to current leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Al-Masri was killed in 2010.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56045f541b0000300005d45a.jpeg?ops=crop_0_308_2329_1352%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Every week, The WorldPost asks an expert to shed light on a topic driving headlines around the world. Today, we speak with Will McCants on the apocalyptic views of the Islamic State. The Islamic State has shifted in just a few short years from a militant group nominally under the control of al Qaeda and based solely in Iraq to an international insurgency. Now arguably the most powerful terror organization in the world, it brutally occupies major cities and is fighting to establish a caliphate in the Middle East.Part of the Islamic State's precipitous rise is related to its belief that it is prophesied to bring about the end times. These are not just fringe beliefs held by some in the organization. Rather, as author Will McCants explains in his new book, The ISIS Apocalypse, they are views that directly affect the way that the group operates and appeals to its followers.The WorldPost spoke with McCants, who is director of the Project on U.S. Relations with the Islamic World at the Brookings Institution think tank, on how these views have shaped the growth of the Islamic State.How central are ""end of times"" apocalyptic beliefs to the Islamic State's ideology?There are a number of Islamic prophecies of the end times, both Sunni and Shia versions. In modern history, Sunnis tended to downplay them and viewed thinking about the end times as beneath them -- something that the Shia engage in. But that started to change with the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003.The political upheaval and the ensuing violence lent itself to an apocalyptic framework, particularly because these prophecies have to do with huge upheavals and violence in Iraq and Syria.The Islamic State and its predecessor, al Qaeda in Iraq, really played up the apocalyptic angle. This was both as a way to understand the upheaval and also as a way to recruit foreign fighters to come fight for their cause. This is in contrast to al Qaeda’s leadership that really downplayed the apocalypse.When the Islamic State was established in 2006, the group's chief judge at the time said the group was created because they believed the Muslim savior, or Mahdi, was going to come any day, and the Islamic State had to be established to help him fight the infidels.You mentioned recruitment as one thing affected by this ""end of times"" millenarian view. Are there other ways that this belief impacts the way the group behaves?Just after the organization was established in 2006, its founder, Abu Ayyad al-Masri, ordered his lieutenants to fan out across Iraq and prepare to conquer it within weeks. He said that the Mahdi was going to come and they would surely have amazing victories. Of course, they got their butts kicked and had to quickly retreat. But he was taking early strategic decisions based on his apocalyptic timetable, and I think a number of people in the organization grew uncomfortable with this urgent, apocalyptic mission.Over time, there was a shift away from this urgent messianic vision. The early Islamic State talked a lot about the appearance of this savior figure, while the later Islamic State talked about the appearance of the caliphate and reestablishing it as a fulfillment of prophecy.This allowed them to maintain a sense of apocalyptic anticipation, so you could still draw in foreign fighters, but it got them focused on the more stable, long-term goal of state-building, as opposed to the end of the world happening tomorrow. You also describe in the book how instability in Syria played a role in the growth of the Islamic State. Would the group exist as it does today if it wasn’t for the civil war in Syria?The Islamic State would have continued to be a serious terrorism problem in Iraq had the Syrian war not happened. It was already gaining strength, even though it was not yet an insurgency and it certainly didn’t hold any territory.But it’s pretty clear that had the civil war in Syria not happened, the Islamic State would have never been able to take over the territory it did, and certainly not establish a proto-state and government.It benefitted a lot from the fact that it focused on state-building in the Sunni hinterland, while other rebel groups were focused on overthrowing the Assad regime, and so Assad prioritized defeating the rebel groups who were trying to oust him.You write that Syrian President Bashar Assad committed 90 percent of his airstrikes against groups that weren’t the Islamic State. Is it still in Assad’s strategic interest that the Islamic State stays alive and operational?It’s not in his long-term strategic interest. If he ever hopes to reconstitute Syria, he’ll have to defeat them someday, but if he’s going to rank the threats against him, then the Islamic State poses less of a threat to his strongholds than other rebel groups.His calculation might change, though, and as the Islamic State draws closer to Damascus he might decide they pose more of a threat. In that case you’d see increased airstrikes against them.The Islamic State at this point has been through, depending on how you measure it, three changes in leadership. But now that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is firmly in charge as the so-called caliph, what would the effect be on the group if he were killed?Well, we know from press reports that the Islamic State’s leadership has been devolving military authority to its generals in the provinces in anticipation of his eventual demise, since he’s one of the most hunted men on earth. But Baghdadi has unique skills as a bureaucrat and religious leader that will be sorely missed by the organization.He not only descends from the prophet’s tribe, he descends from Muhammad’s own family. According to some prophecies, that's a prerequisite for reestablishing this caliphate. So his lineage will be hard to replace for the organization.He’s also an honest-to-God religious scholar -- he has a Ph.D. from a real university in Qur'anic studies, which is very rare for a leader of a jihadist organization. They’ll miss his skill as a coalition-builder as well, and he is a savvy bureaucrat who has survived and thrived in the cutthroat politics of the Islamic State.Is there any singular figure that you feel is the most important person to the rise of the Islamic State, in terms of the behind-the-scenes planning of it?There’s just so many different people that have performed different functions. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi conceived it and really laid the intellectual groundwork for it, his successor Abu Ayyub al-Masri put flesh on the bone and really gave it a reality, but I would say that the current leader is probably the most important.He had a lot of people to help him, including a number of ex-members of Saddam Hussein’s Baath party who are very high-ranking in the Islamic State. They’ve been instrumental in running a repressive state because they have experience in it.Was there something that caught you particularly by surprise when you were doing the research for this book? I guess it was a personal revelation, if I can say that without sounding incredibly self-centered. I came to the end of the book and I had to ask myself hard questions: Can brutality work as a political strategy? Can you win an insurgency being brutal, and can you govern being incredibly brutal?This went against a lot of my own biases. I believe that if you are waging an insurgency and you want to govern the people you are fighting for, you need to treat those people well and that will lead to a long-lasting state. But I had to be honest and look at the success of the Islamic State, and other insurgencies that have been waged very brutally, and some of those ended up being successful. It turns out you can be an utter bastard and maintain control of a state. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.More from The WorldPost's Weekly Interview Series:Also on HuffPost:"
44,ENTERTAINMENT,Nic Cage Finally Reveals If He Actually Stole The Declaration Of Independence,Bill Bradley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nic-cage-declaration-of-independence_us_56046967e4b0fde8b0d1f05b,Nic Cage is coming clean.,2015-09-26,Reese Witherspoon aka Laura Jeanne Reese Witherspoon,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55f71f3a2c0000a200aafb39.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"National treasure, and star of “National Treasure,” Nic Cage is finally opening up his book of secrets.Cage’s new movie, “Pay the Ghost,” is now in theaters. He was drawn to the film, he told The Huffington Post, because it mixes real life and supernatural horror. That’s pretty cool, but when we heard Cage was available for interviews on the film, we just had one question: Did he ever actually steal the Declaration of Independence?OK, actually we had a lot of questions. Pages of questions. But with only 10 minutes for the call, we had to whittle them down to the essentials, and getting an answer about a potential heist of our country’s most important document was No. 1.It seems facetious. Of course, he didn’t steal the Declaration of Independence, right? “National Treasure” was just a movie ... or was it?There was that alleged photo of Cage from the 1800s that appeared to reveal he was a vampire. And he’s played a character who thought he was a vampire before. Are Cage’s movies actually a reflection of his real life? The world needs to know.The interview started off smoothly. I said, “Hi, I’m Bill.” Cage said, “Good to talk to you, Bill.” (Wow! He knows my name!) Things were going great.We talked about the film, which Cage called “very liberating” because it allowed him to play the character naturalistically, à la “Cinéma vérité.”“Sounds awesome,” I said.(Note to self: look up the definition of cinéma vérité.)I asked, “If you have to pay a ghost, do they only accept children, or is there some sort of payment plan you can work out?” Cage said, “In the movie, it’s children.” (OK, good to know.)Then things got a little awkward.I said, “Since we’re talking about the supernatural, did you know there’s a whole online community who calls you their ‘one true god.’ What are your thoughts on that?”(This was a mistake.) Cage was awesome. He said, “I don’t know what to think about that. The Internet is its own sort of life force that has seemed to developed this fascination, whether it’s ironic or not, that I can’t really explain. So I sort of let people do what they want.”(Great answer! Then one of the publicists jumped in ...) “STICK TO MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FILM!” he said. OK, maybe it wasn’t that aggressive, and it was cool they set everything up, but the damage was done.My heart fell faster than the stairs do in the first “National Treasure.”(You can’t blame publicists. That’s their job. But I literally have pages of questions to ask, including, “If you could take someone’s face off for the day, who would it be?” “Is there anything worse than a face full of bees?” And, of course, “Did you steal the Declaration of Independence?”)“Sure, no problem,” I said. “So ... are you like ... scared of ghosts?”I’m not sure if that’s exactly what came out of my mouth, but it wasn’t much better. Cage was gracious. He did apparently have normal fears like any other parent. “That’s what I found compelling about ‘Pay the Ghost.’ I think every parent can relate to that fear of losing one’s child in public whether it be an abduction or accident or something and then to have that escalate into a supernatural horror ... I thought that was pretty unusual and not like anything I’ve done before.”(Very cool. But the chance to ask the question I really wanted to know was winding down. Ah, what would Cage’s “National Treasure” character do at a time like this?) (Eh, that doesn't help.)""Last question,"" said one of the publicists. It was now or never. I had to go for it. ""Did you ever steal the Declaration of Independence? Or do you think you could if you had to?"" I asked.It is done.Saying it was a relief, but every millisecond of silence had me more tense than when I waited to see if Cage and his friends would survive the end of ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets.""Then ... he speaks. Oh, speak again, bright angel!""No and No,"" said Cage.Success! All the research and planning finally paid off. The question has been answered. ""No,"" Nic Cage has not actually stolen the Declaration of Independence, and ""no"" he doesn't think he could. He didn't have to answer. He could've just declined.But the one true god did answer, and it was good.""Pay the Ghost"" is now in theaters.Also on HuffPost:"
