I believe for many of us, it's an innate desire within us, whether we'd like to admit to it or not. After all, we are made in His image. As contradictory as it may sound, God's power is certainly made perfect within our weaknesses. I am proud to say that I am the perfect mother. I have a perfect husband who is likewise, a perfect father. We have a perfect marriage. So naturally, we have perfect children and a perfect family. Before you pass a quick judgement on me, let me explain further. Perfect can be defined as having all the required or desirable elements, qualities or characteristics; as good as it is possible to be. Absolute; complete.Why am I a perfect mother? I'm perfect because in the six years that I have been blessed to hold this title, I have failed again, and again, and again. I have made more mistakes that I can possibly total to this day. I have been irritable and impatient due to exhaustion and weariness. I have seen sides of myself that need so much correction, that leave me feeling humbled at the numerous situations I have found myself in. But with that said, as many times as I have failed, I have gotten right back up. I have dusted myself off, looked myself in the mirror and prayed to God that each of those falls made me a better mother. I have turned my life, my heart, my complete existence over to the constant thought of each and every decision I make and its effect on my children, our family. I never knew I was capable of the immense love I could hold until the day they placed my daughter on my chest. It was possibly the most overwhelming moment of my lifetime. Right then and there, I was forever changed. I know that despite the number of mistakes I've made and the mistakes I'm bound to make in the future, my love as a mother is perfect. My love for my children isn't capable of ever faltering or, for that matter, ever diminishing. My love for my children is never-ending and has no flaws to be found within it. A mother's love for her children, without argument, is perfect. Why is my husband a perfect father? He changes diapers. He does the dishes. He gives the babies their baths. He brushes teeth and combs hair. He dresses kids in the morning and gets their jammies on them in the evening. He ties and reties shoelaces. He cooks meals. He rubs heads to sleep. He sleeps on hardwood floors beside toddler beds just in case the scary monster comes back. He watches Dora, The Bubble Guppies and Team Umizoomi more times than any adult should. Basically, when he is not at work, he is in Daddy mode. 24 hours a day, 365 days a year (ok, maybe for the exception of NFL Draft Day and Sundays during football season).Should he do a lot of those things? Sure. Does he want to do a lot of those things, day in and day out, even when he's sick or sleep deprived? No. But... he does them anyway. And the majority of the time, he does them without complaint. He gives his family everything he can, but mainly he gives us himself. My husband would walk across fire to the ends of the earth for our children, without hesitation. Yes, he is the perfect father. Why is my marriage perfect? Our marriage has been put to the test more times than I can say I would have liked. And I am no fool to believe that it's not done being tested. Throughout these tests, there have been numerous times it would have been easier to give up, to give in and well, call it a day. There has been hundreds of times in the past decade that my husband and I have pulled ourselves out of ruts so deep, it was hard to even imagine a light at the end of the tunnel. We've fought hard but thankfully, we've loved even harder. Most days I drive him absolutely nuts and he can agitate me like no other, but I can't picture a day without him beginning it or a night without him ending it. It may possibly be one of the most comforting feelings in this world to know he loves me completely, flaws and all. He loves me as much as he knows how to love. And for that, I very well may be one of the luckiest women on this planet. Yes, our marriage is perfect because our love has outlasted and overcome what the world says it shouldn't and very well couldn't. Our love for one another is indeed perfect. Why are our children perfect? My children fight (OK, they battle one another), they throw temper-tantrums, they complain about some things that they shouldn't and every day they need more than one (or two) gentle reminders on things they should have handled correctly the first time. However, their resiliency and innocent love is captivating. Their sincere empathy, in my opinion, is why this world is still here, still continuing on. I'm not sure at what point in our childhood, teens or adulthood that we lose that kind of love, forgiveness, endurance and ultimately, childlike faith. My children... they're human. They make mistakes. But... yes, they are their own perfection. When I look into each of their eyes, I could get lost in their ultimate love and endless wonder that I pray to God every day they never lose. I encourage my son and daughters to be big dreamers. To think the impossible. To go after the impossible. I know that if I teach them to believe enough in themselves and never lose that, they will be able to accomplish anything in this world. And lastly, why is our family perfect? I have thanked and praised God everyday that He had our plan, our perfect plan, laid out so carefully, so divinely, that no matter what this world has thrown at us or will continue to battle our family with, we will stand strong. We will stand together, and not if, but when we are brought to our knees again, we will turn and wait patiently for once again, the One who has turned each and every hardship and battle into a magnificent blessing.So, as you can see, your definition of perfect and my definition of perfect may slightly differ. I have such a gratified feeling that I have found my perfection that I have prayed for since I was a little girl. I'm grateful that each day as I slip and make my mistakes, I'm reminded in some fashion of who I want to be, what I want to create and what my purpose is while on this earth. Find your perfect. Strive for your perfection. Will I ever reach the world's standards of perfection as a mother and wife? No. Will my husband ever reach the world's standards for perfection as a father or husband? Nope. Will our marriage and family and children meet those worldly standards for perfection? It's safe to say ""no.""But I can say one thing: I wouldn't trade our perfect for any other perfect in this life.To follow Long more closely, visit:Her Author PageBeachbody CoachInstagramTwitterIn the Moment Photography"

Blind to race, gender and religion, it's infected thousands and infiltrated public consciousness like nothing in recent memory.",2014-11-19,2014-11-05-10685441_10152815843308330_2217161618589596796_n.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-05-10685441_10152815843308330_2217161618589596796_n-thumb.jpg,"It knows no socio-economic boundaries. Blind to race, gender and religion, it's infected thousands and infiltrated public consciousness like nothing in recent memory.An ever-present topic in the news, trending on Twitter, conversation among friends revealing deep-seated, highly illogical fears.I'm talking, of course, about Ebola. As I began preparing for a trip to the continent of Africa, I explained to friends, family and acquaintances that I would be traveling to South Africa - the bottom tip of the continent, that the Ebola virus is in the north western horn, thousands of miles away, and that - while Ebola is indeed a very real and very serious threat and, if not closely watched, could become a global catastrophe - I had a better chance of being attacked by a wild water buffalo than contracting the deadly virus.I was going to deal with another evil, just as insidious, as indiscriminating as the dreaded and deadly Ebola virus, but still cloaked in darkness: the sexual abuse and exploitation of children. Every three minutes a child in South Africa is raped. (A figure I learned while conducting victim sensitivity training with the Cape Town police force.) As is the case worldwide, most of the time, this rape occurs at the hands of someone the child knows, loves and trusts. Let's contrast these figures with the number of new Ebola infections occurring every day in South Africa: Zero. Yet where is the focus? Where is the widespread fear and outrage that mobilizes public attention and galvanizes government action? Child sexual abuse is an issue shrouded in secrecy, an intimate and sinister crime that silences victims -- an estimated 1 in 3 girls and 1 in 5 boys -- with feelings of shame, guilt and isolation, and emboldens predators -- who will offend against an average of 117 children in their lives -- with each new offense.While the stats are staggering, the solution is clear: 95 percent of child sexual abuse is preventable though education and awareness.So what's preventing us from getting there? Perhaps it's embarrassment. The sexual abuse and exploitation of children is, admittedly, uncomfortable and difficult to talk about. But during the 11-hour flight from London to South Africa, I saw enough protective facemasks to be reminded that people will risk embarrassment and discomfort when they feel their safety -- or the safety of those they love -- may be threatened.I will admit, the paranoia experienced by my fellow passengers gripped me for a moment, and I as I squirted hand sanitizer onto my palms, I wondered... If not embarrassment, perhaps, then, it's denial and the idea that ""it won't happen to me"" keeping otherwise responsible and intelligent adults away from this particular threat to public safety, health and wellness. Because it is just that: survivors of child sexual abuse are at a greater risk for maladaptive behavior throughout their lives.From Florida to New York to Barbados to the Netherlands to Canada and beyond, we see that the single greatest risk factor for being a victim of child sexual abuse is simply being a child. In South Africa, I heard stories from children like Joyce -- the daughter of an ambassador who was molested at the hands of her family's houseboy, often in the room right next to her parents' -- and also Disha -- who lives in a township outside of Cape Town and is forced to sleep in a bed with five of her siblings or with her grandparents; either arrangement means a night of sleeplessness, shame and violation for the innocent little girl. Or even more disturbing: I met a mother whose six-year-old daughter slipped out from beside her in bed one night to use the bathroom outside, tiptoeing barefoot out of their encampment, not wanting to wake her sleeping family. The little girl never made it more than a few steps: she was snatched, brutally raped and then doused with gasoline and lit on fire. The girl's family discovered her ragged, well-loved teddy bear a stone's throw from their front door, leading them to her body, which had been dumped unceremoniously in a nearby field. Though she was almost naked and very badly burned, tattered pieces of the girl's charred pajamas still remained and helped her mother identify the body.When I shared this story with teachers and police during training sessions, the faces staring back at me did not register shock or horror; I was met with responses like ""Yes, just awful what happens here, isn't it?"" YES. It is truly, profoundly awful. It should not matter whether you are born in a township in Cape Flats or a flat in Manhattan. Each and every child has a right to safety.So I ask again: Where is the outrage? The disbelief? Where is the call to protect those most innocent among us? Child predators know no boundaries, and we shouldn't either in the quest to protect our children. As a survivor and someone who has dedicated my life to making things different for other children, I can talk circles around this issue. Do you prefer facts and figures, or do emotional appeals change your mind and open your heart? I have pages and pages of numbers, and sleepless nights filled with stories from little girls, and boys, like Joyce, Disha and the little girl who never saw her seventh birthday. Some of the stories that haunt me, that drive me, are my own memories. And I will not rest until we do better for our children. And the fact remains...Number of children being raped in South Africa: one every three minutes. That's 20 every hour, 480 each day. That's 5,280 children's lives forever changed, shattered by sexual violence, during the 11 days I spent in South Africa. And how many new cases of Ebola? Zero.So let's look at the facts, listen to the stories and start to have the difficult conversations. Let's begin to support children who come forward and prevent the monsters who hurt them from victimizing others, because they will if allowed to thrive in darkness, continuing their vicious cycle. Let's create an international registry to track sexual predators and inform international officials. Let's teach children that their bodies are their own and they have a right to decide what is safe and what is unsafe.Let's protect childhood.

2,GREEN,Before Cousteau,"Savannah Reich, ContributorPlaywright and screenwriter",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/before-cousteau_b_6165342.html,"The ocean was still a great unknown in the years between the world wars, and some scientists speculated that the bottom was a ""dead zone"" where the pressure and darkness made life impossible.

Beebe had a telephone connection with an assistant and relayed what he saw through the heavy quartz window during the deep sea observation. Barton took photographs and moving pictures. They broke their own record again on Aug. 15 when they descended 3,028 feet. (AP Photo)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1612a260000cf00818986.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As a teenager, I became briefly obsessed with the deep sea. The eternally dark ocean floor, populated by mean-looking fish with glowing fins, giant worms and whale carcasses, seemed like a suitably mystical subject for my adolescent poetry. I know I wasn't alone; for many of us, the deep sea seems as fascinating and alien as the surface of Mars. I was surprised to learn as an adult that the history of deep-sea exploration is nearly as young as that of space travel. Before 1930, no one had been able to make a dive deeper than 500 feet. The ocean was still a great unknown in the years between the world wars, and some scientists speculated that the bottom was a ""dead zone"" where the pressure and darkness made life impossible. It was in this atmosphere of total uncertainty that William Beebe and Otis Barton built a hollow steel ball called the Bathysphere. Like Jacques Cousteau, who has cited him as an influence, William Beebe was a scientist, explorer, inventor, author and wildly popular public figure. His first book, Two Bird Lovers in Mexico (1905), included both his scientific observations of pheasants and riveting prose about the expedition, which involved Beebe and his explorer/naturalist wife Mary Blair riding around on horseback and carrying revolvers for protection. With backing from the Zoological Society, Beebe traveled all over the world cataloging birds and studying tropical ecosystems. It wasn't until he was in his 40s that he took his first underwater dive with the cutting-edge equipment of the time, a copper diving helmet. He immediately fell in love. Describing his first dive, he wrote, ""I knew that I had added thousands upon thousands of wonderful miles to my possible joy of earthly life.""In 1929, Beebe announced to the papers that he was going to build a deep-sea submersible and released a rough sketch. The day after the article ran, a man named Otis Barton contacted him to say that the design would never work. Barton was a young man, recently graduated from an engineering program at Columbia, and the two decided to team up. Barton offered to build the Bathysphere himself. He only had one demand: He was building the Bathysphere to fit two, and he wanted to accompany Beebe on every dive.Barton was no naturalist. He had idolized Beebe for years, and his dream was to be a famous explorer as well. When he finally got into contact with his hero, he made sure to insert himself into the middle of the expedition. Beebe decided to welcome the young man into his circle; after all, he did have the skills needed to design the craft. It probably also helped that Barton offered to pay for the construction.The Bathysphere, when it was finished, was a steel ball four feet and nine inches in diameter. It rested on two skis when it sat on deck and had three portholes filled with thick quartz. It had a friendly demeanor, like a curious alien looking to make new friends -- although perhaps it looked different to the two men who repeatedly sealed themselves inside it and were lowered into the total darkness of the deep sea.Beebe and Barton, who discovered over the course of the expedition that they couldn't stand one another, made six dives off the coast of Bermuda in the summer of 1930. The last one was nearly 1,500 feet. The Bathysphere was lowered off a barge on a thick cable attached to a crane arm. It came stocked with oxygen tanks and a few palm-leaf fans to wave for air circulation. A telephone line was embedded into the cable, and Beebe kept up a constant stream of chatter to his assistant on the surface. If he ever stopped talking, she would ask him to say something, and if he didn't reply, she knew to give the order to pull them up immediately. Of course, if anything had gone wrong, even the quickest rescue would have been much too late. The Bathysphere had to function perfectly, because most small failures would result in instant death.Beebe described everything he saw into the headset, and much of it was totally unknown to science: glowing fish, giant pale forms in the darkness, unidentifiable flashing lights. Most of these would become more familiar to future marine biologists, but at the time, no one had ever seen a deep sea creature alive. Beebe had to do his best to describe what he saw, even when he had no idea what he was looking at.In our current world of complex technology, modern science sometimes seems inaccessible or difficult to understand. I'm fascinated by the Bathysphere expedition partially because the mechanics of it were so straightforward. Two men sealed themselves into a metal ball and were lowered on a cable into the water. It sounds like a child's design, but every detail had to be perfect or the passengers would not survive. The combination of the mystery of the ocean and the seeming simplicity of the craft reminds me that science isn't some secret ritual that I can never understand. We all share the same basic human desire to see what is behind locked doors. The story of the Bathysphere makes it easy for me to imagine what it would be like to be so fascinated by a beautiful unknown that you would risk your life to see it with your own eyes.Savannah Reich is an Alfred P.

In other films about schools, hospitals, the welfare system, an insane asylum (Titicut Follies), La Comedie-Francaise, and even the Crazy Horse in Paris, Wiseman's almost diaphanous docu-novel style with its omniscient seemingly absent author, lets the content breathe. The feeling of seeing a Wiseman film is that of being parachuted into a war zone; the absence of plot, of a beginning, middle or end is mitigated by leitmotifs that create a music. But here the subject is looking itself and at times you end up gazing admiringly at the film, more than the collocation of art works comprising its subject, London's National Gallery. Frank Lloyd Wright's architecture in the Guggenheim has often been criticized as competing with and also being unfriendly to art. National Gallery is hardly an unfriendly witness, but in a museum which exhibits many da Vincis, the film is a ""Mona Lisa,"" continually calling attention to its own enigmatic gaze. All that being said National Gallery is amongst many things a Thomas Struth party. Struth as you may recall is the a photographer who records people looking at art and National Gallery's portraits of people watching Rembrandt portraits and other masterpieces are a singularly affecting part of the movie (in one an attendee with earphones is caught gazing at a docent giving a lecture he can't hear). The recent The New Rijksmuseum film portrayed another art institution with a similarly broad canvas, but it had an axe to grind, in terms of the museum's relationship to its surrounding environment. The New Rijksmuseum is to the National Gallery what Ibsen's An Enemy of the People is to say O'Neill Long Day's Journey Into Night. National Gallery, which includes a moving scene where a class of blind and visually impaired people are lectured on a Pissarro, ultimately deals with museums and museum going in such as way as to demonstrate what one of Wiseman's subjects calls ""a wonderful opportunity to study the human condition.""{This was originally submitted to The Screaming Pope, Francis Levy's blog of rants and reactions to contemporary politics, art and culture}"
4,BLACK VOICES,Is Cosby Still the Darling of the Right?,"Earl Ofari Hutchinson, ContributorAuthor and political analyst",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bill-cosby-conservatives_b_6161780.html,"In May 2004, comedian, social critic and philanthropist Bill Cosby took the stage at Constitution Hall in his hometown of Philadelphia.

Jack Kemp, former congressman and co-founder of Empower America, philanthropist and comedian Bill Cosby, Howard University Board of Trustees Chairman Frank Savage and his daughter Grace Savage arrive at a Constitution Hall gala in honor of the 50th anniversary of the Supreme Court ruling on Brown vs. Board of Education. (Photo by Dudley M. Brooks/The Washington Post/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae01271f0000390122d34b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In May 2004, comedian, social critic and philanthropist Bill Cosby took the stage at Constitution Hall in his hometown of Philadelphia. It was a gala commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court's Brown decision on school segregation. Cosby was being honored for his by then near legendary philanthropy to African-American colleges. The mostly black audience, chock full of veterans of the civil rights and social justice movements past and present, fully expected to hear Cosby reminisce about the gains and importance of the civil rights fight and reflect on the massive racial disparities, poverty and economic inequality that still ensnare millions of African-Americans today. They got a shock. Cosby did nothing of the kind. He instead launched into a long-winded, bitter verbal rampage against alleged ignorant, gun-toting, baby-making and jail-deserving young blacks. Cosby then put the capper on it when he angrily shouted that even more blacks deserve to be dumped in the slammer and even evoked God to bolster his scream, ""God is tired of you,"" and so am I. The stunned audience didn't know what to make of Cosby's tirade. But an endless column of conservative columnists, right-wing talk show gabbers, bloggers and unreconstructed bigots did. They had found just the man to put the proper face on their long-standing manufactured growth industry in black, and especially black male, victim bashing. He was perfect. He had none of the odor of the handful of black conservatives such as Clarence Thomas and Alan Keyes who were routinely trotted out to rip and disparage blacks, and who engendered near universal ridicule and condemnation from African-Americans. Cosby by contrast was seen as a real civil rights man, a liberal, and to boot just as universally admired by blacks.In the days after that, as Cosby ramped up his new found crusade against alleged black dysfunctionality, his stock soared to new heights among conservatives. He was feted, toasted, and quoted as the fount of all wisdom for daring to speak the supposed truth about blacks. He was a man who would air black America's dirty laundry, brave the wrath of civil rights leaders, black activists, and black columnists and let the chips fall where they may. This all culminated in his getting an unprecedented one hour to tout his blacks must clean up their own ghettos spin job on Meet the Press. He topped that with a book, Come on People, which quickly roared up the charts. In the book, he harangued and lectured, cobbled together a mish-mash of his trademark anecdotes, homilies, and personal tales of woe and success, juggled and massaged facts to bolster his self-designated black morals crusade. Stripped away it was the same stock message that blacks can't read, write or speak coherent English, and are social and educational cripples and failures. To no surprise, the cheers for Cosby from the racism-deniers were wilder and louder than ever.The problem with all this was that even then the rumors and allegations of Cosby's unsavory personal hijinks and antics were swirling around the gossip mill. It was a near textbook case of picking the Cosby that people wanted to believe was the real Cosby. For Cosby's conservative cheerleaders, that Cosby was the one who was quick to harangue poor blacks for their alleged faults and utter not a peep about the institutional causes of their plight. There was not even a peep from him encouraging government officials and business leaders to provide greater resources and opportunities to aid those blacks that need help. But why would he if blacks allegedly killed, mugged, peddled dope, were jobless untouchables and educational wastrels, and made endless babies with reckless impunity? The blame fell on their head alone. Now that Cosby totters dangerously on the verge of disgrace he's again important for two reasons. The first is obvious. You have not one, two, three, or even five women but at last count 13 women, some of whom were underage at the time of the alleged offenses, claiming variously that he raped, drugged , assaulted, abused, and then discarded them like dirty dish rags. These allegations alone would almost certainly bring a loud clamor for the alleged offender who didn't have the name, money and icon status as Cosby to be shoved into a court docket and, if convicted, a jail cell. The ad nausea takeaway from this is that wealth and fame can always trump public outrage over real and alleged bad behavior.The other thing that makes the ugly Cosby saga important is it casts yet another glare on the colossal hypocrisy of conservatives who routinely and blithely turn a blind eye to some of the worst behaving characters as long as they loudly pulverize blacks for their alleged bad behavior. Cosby is hardly the first or last to be cheered and lauded for his biting criticism as long as the bite is on blacks. Now that the bite is again on him, the question: Is Cosby still the darling of the right?Earl Ofari Hutchinson is an author and political analyst.

Four months of sleeping in a sleeping bag on the living room floor. My wife right next to me, on the cushions off the sofa. Our son has our bedroom. All of it. He's 13 months old.There's a beautiful bed in there -- for us, I mean -- with a special mattress that aligns with our bodies. And he has a crib, a crib that takes up, oh, you know, 12 cubic feet. But we're sleep training him. At least we were. That was almost 12 weeks ago, and it worked beautifully. Really. Like apples in an orchard. After two days, the 11 p.m. feedings stopped. He was a tad more adamant about the 2 a.m. top up. But another four more days or so and he was sleeping like, well, a baby... until just after 5.The first night was horrific. An hour and fifteen minutes of tonsil-sapping howling. Every 10 minutes, I'd go down to the bedroom, following the method to the letter: a hand gently placed on his chest, followed by, ""It's OK. Mama and Papa love you. Go back to sleep. You're OK."" Tip-toe out the door. Head back upstairs. Lie down. Go through the news website on the iPhone and actually have the time to read a couple of news pieces rather than vaguely scanning headlines. Wait 10 minutes. Go back down. Repeat. Seven times. You're supposed to wait five more minutes each time. But that's hard when your kid sounds like a demented otter is chewing through his nose. So, it's every 10 minutes. But it works. Like magic. Like I said, within a week, he's out pretty much from 7 a.m. through until 5:15 p.m. or so. Which I'll take every time. He takes a four -ounce bottle just after 5 p.m. and goes back down until 7 p.m.. Wonderful.So, where's the problem? Why are the two of us, still, three-and-a-half months later, in sleeping bags on the living room floor? Why is there an impending sense of sharks off the starboard motor? Our bedtime, that's why. And trying to take back the ground given. At 10:30 p.m. we try sneaking in, like cartoon mice on their hind legs going after the Christmas presents. This, after we've brushed our teeth upstairs, checked the door, unplugged all the appliances. He doesn't even let us make it to the bed. He's up immediately. Eager. Trying to stand up in his crib, his little head banging against the rails because he can't get his legs to coordinate inside his sleep-sack. We didn't make a sound, I swear. Like field mice not shaking in the grass and all that. Not even to the bed. Like, he smells us. And, then, as we reverse maneuver, the screaming. The otter is back. And we're back upstairs. We tried again two nights later. Tried going in at different times, during different sleep cycles. Waited a week. No change. He's utterly steadfast.So, the living room becomes the bedroom. Clothes and underwear on the back of chairs, jewelry and makeup on the kitchen counter. We can't put him in our daughter's room. She's not ready for him. Not until we can get him sleeping well past 6 p.m.. Have you seen an 8-year-old on interrupted sleep? Picture whippets on cocaine chasing a balloon around a bowling alley. Now make the bowling alley one lane and add neighbors. Unsustainable. So, he gets the bedroom. My dad used to tell me about a '70s TV show called The Prisoner where there would be things like disembodied beach balls bouncing down an empty, wind-scattered beach. So every night, we roll out the sleeping bags, set the alarm clocks, unplug the appliances and watch the beach balls methodically bouncing by.And we'll keep watching them until we can get our baby sleeping until 7 a.m., when our 8-year-old needs to be up anyway for school. Which can't be too long in the distance, right? Maybe at 14 months. So, 10, maybe 11 more weeks. Cake walk."

He is creator of the universe(s), which is within and beyond our imagination. Quran is a book of guidance to preserve the cohesiveness within and what surrounds us; people and the environment.",2014-11-19,2014-11-18-QuranisnotforMuslimsaloneHuffingtonPost.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-18-QuranisnotforMuslimsaloneHuffingtonPost-thumb.jpg,"The very first verse in Quran reads, ""1:2 (Asad) All praise is due to God alone, the Sustainer of all the worlds (that exist),"" and the very last chapter opens with this line, ""114:1 (Ali) Say: I seek refuge with the Lord and Cherisher of Mankind,"" and there is a whole lot in between. God chose to address the entire mankind, and rightfully so. Quran is for the whole humanity and not just Muslims exclusively.Hold your breath, I cannot pack the next 1200 words in one single sentence, or utter it in one single breath, but I promise you a better understanding by the end of this essay. First of all, God is not the God of Muslims and no where he claims that in Quran. He is creator of the universe(s), which is within and beyond our imagination. Quran is a book of guidance to preserve the cohesiveness within and what surrounds us; people and the environment.Darwin is right about survival of the fittest. Nothing in the universe will survive if it goes off balance and is not intact. Thank God everything is created in balance and harmony (55: 7-13) with billions of other elements interconnected and interdependent on each other to function cohesively. In fact, the entire creation can be broadly classified into Matter and Life. Planets, stars, seasons and plants are programmed to function obediently (55:5-6) with precision, whereas humans were not put on an auto-pilot, they were instead given a free will to manage and maintain their own balance, and of course there was the guidance for everyone.God's says (49:13) that he has created us into many tribes, communities, nations and by extension faiths, ideas, shapes, and colors -- and all of us can trace back our origins to a singular couple referred to as Adam & Eve. Given that diversity, we are bound to have conflicts and compete for the resources. So, he adds, the best ones among you are those who will take the time to know each other, he knows that knowledge leads to understanding and understanding to acceptance and appreciation of different points of view. God does not miss a beat in communicating with his creation, and tells us not to compel others to be like you (2:256) let it come from their hearts for common goodness, and let others be others and you be you (109:6). Indeed, when you respect the otherness of others, and accept the God given uniqueness of each one of us, then conflicts fade and solutions emerge to live in harmony. By the way, this is my definition of Pluralism. Had he willed, he could have made us all into a single community or created all of us precisely alike (5:48), but he chose to create each one of us to be unique with our own thumb print, eye print, DNA, taste buds, belief buds, races, nations and ethnicities. God loves us all, and n0 one is deprived of his love; he has reached out to every human through a peace maker, messenger, prophet, reformer, a wise man or simply a good friend that brings sense to living. The creator offers a variety of guidance to the mankind, no matter where you live, the guidance is there, the guidance that leads to live in peace, and without fear of the other. He says I have sent a peacemaker to every nation and every tribe. What does God want? Like a mother who wants her children to live well; a teacher who wants his students to do well; and the chef who wants his patrons to enjoy his food.... God wants every one of his creation to live in harmony. He emphasizes the idea repeatedly (over 18 times) -- if you take care of his creation (neighbor), you need not worry; your rewards are with him. Just to make sure we understand this precisely, he says, whether you are a Jew or a Christian and by corollary other, if you take care of your neighbor, I will take care of you (2:62). Mind you, he is very clear, he has never said, ""Muslim Neighbor,"" but just neighbor to be inclusive of all humanity.The concepts of universalism are loaded in the phrases like God of the Universe, ""Rabbul Aalameen"" and Mercy to Mankind ""Rahmatul Aalameen ""as Prophet Muhammad is called. Indeed, the word Aalameen is the mother of the word inclusion, aka Pluralism. We have reduced Islam from a system to create harmony and peace in the world to an exclusive political entity, copyrighted and owned by the group.Please beware of the mistranslation and misinterpretations. Deeper study will lead any one to realize the Quran had been purposely mistranslated down through history. In the middle Ages, European leaders commissioned a hostile Quran translation to foster warfare against Muslim invaders (Monastery of Abbot 1143 CE). Later, Muslim leaders (Hilali Khan 1924 CE) produced another translation to inflame Muslims against Christians and Jews. It was all for politics. Thank God for the efforts of countless people, most of the mis-translations have been fixed since 2012, and I have contributed my personal share of work towards that effort and I will be happy to do a full presentation on it if needed anywhere in the world, one of them was done in Melbourne, Australia in 2009 at the Parliament of World Religions. Dr. Tariq Ramadan and I also presented the same topic again in tandem.Don't panic, everything has checks and balances, as a seeker of the truth, you will look at least three different translations to grasp the inclusiveness of Quran.HERE IS THE FORMULA   It may be worth your while to see the list of the mistranslated verses and how the fear mongers in the market have capitalized on those. The best way to understand Quran is to remember, ""If it is not about justice, mercy and creating harmony"", then the translation is wrong. Go back and read it several times, three verse before the 'wrongfully maligned' verse and three afterwards, and read at least three to four translations. Quran in Arabic is precisely same and well preserved, but its translation and interpretations are not. The treatment of verses is at www.Quraantoday.com and the full story of Quran conference is at www.Quraanconference.com I recommend the translations by Muhammad Asad, Abdullah Yusuf Ali and Marmaduke Pickthall, they are not perfect but by far the best. Dr. Laleh Bakhtiar has fixed a few misogynistic translations in her work that were not handled earlier. More work needs to be done and God willing it will continue. I want to acknowledge the contributions made by Mr. Farooq Khan and Dr. Rehana Kausar of Texas, who convinced the Muslim establishments to accept and promote Muhammad Asad's translation and have distributed many on their own. Once they bought the entire stock of books and freely distributed to right people. Farooq Khan adds, ""Only through these translations Muslim and Non-Muslims, both, can have a true glimpse of what the Holy Quran says.""Here is a 17 minutes video about Abdullah Yusuf Ali shared by them, it is inspirational and worth watching. You may find a similar spark in you and I did. Here is the video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05CDGLqrWHM Thanks to CAIR for providing me some of the copies of Asad translations which I have personally given to pastors, Rabbis, Sikh and Hindu educators and even some Imams. A copy was also presented to my friend Sean Hannity - a great American (unless you know about him, you may not believe until you hear from me), Pamela Geller and others with a similar but one paragraph note as above. Yes, I have copies of Bible, Torah, Bhagvad Gita, Book of Mormon, and Book of Jaina, Guru Granth sahib, Kitab Aqdas, Rev. Moon's World Scriptures and 12 Quran translations.Thanks to friends and Muslims from around the world for the encouragement they have given me in moving forward with presenting Quran as a document of pluralism. It is a manual to create cohesive societies and it is for all, don't let Muslims monopolize it. To be a Muslim is to be a peace maker, one who seeks to mitigate conflicts and nurtures goodwill for peaceful co-existence of humanity.

Two Palestinian cousins armed with meat cleavers and a gun stormed a Jerusalem synagogue during morning prayers Tuesday, killing four people in the cityâs bloodiest attack in years. Police killed the attackers in a shootout. (AP Photo/Ariel Schalit)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc1413c240000680038285c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"To be a Palestinian resident of Jerusalem is to suffer from a special form of statelessness. They are citizens neither of Israel nor of Palestine. They cannot vote. They have no official passports and cannot freely cross borders.They have the right to residency in Jerusalem, but it is a daily battle to keep it. Under the Israeli Ministry of Interior's ""center of life"" policy, they have to continuously disprove a negative, that their real family life is not elsewhere. This means endlessly collecting receipts as proof of their life in Jerusalem like medical prescriptions and school registrations. Inspectors go as far as counting the clothes in a wardrobe or the food in the fridge, as evidence of the claimed number of children living in the family home.Obtaining citizenship of any country or spending too long abroad are both reasons for the revocation of the residency status, which cannot be handed down to children. They cannot build onto their houses, and if they do, they have to pay to have the extension knocked down, or knock it down themselves. This is the community from which the two men who shot and hacked worshippers in early morning prayers in a synagogue in West Jerusalem on Tuesday came from.There is another element peculiar to this attack on a Jewish religious target. Ghassan Abu Jamal, 23, and Odai Abu Jamal, 30, were not members of a religious Palestinian group. They came from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) -- a secular, revolutionary, leftist organisation founded by George Habash, a Palestinian Christian, responsible in the 1960s for a series of aircraft hijackings.This brings us to the third new element in this attack: The PFLP did not, on the available evidence, order or plan this attack. A statement posted on the group's Facebook page supported the attack and identified the attackers as members of the PFLP, but a press release emailed on behalf of the group omitted any affiliation the men had to the group. The PFLP in Gaza wanted to claim responsibility for the attack, the West Bank did not. This is similar to the abduction and murder of three settler youths by members of Hamas, which Hamas itself did not know anything about.Ofer Zalzberg, senior Middle East analyst at the International Crisis Group (ICG) put his finger on what is happening here. ""There is no leader to go to that can represent the needs and demands of East Jerusalemites or Palestinians in general. For Palestinians, Abbas does not seem to act, Jordan's actions are limited, while most of the Arab or Islamic world doesn't seem to be mobilising...No one is acting in the face of perceived threats among Palestinians in East Jerusalem and therefore in the absence of leaders, individuals react.""While Benjamin Netanyahu claimed that Mahmoud Abbas' ""incitement"" was responsible for the synagogue attack, a young woman in Ramallah put a video up lambasting the Palestinian president for condemning it. Kristina Yousef said:""Mr. President! Where were you a month ago? Where were you when child Turin was killed? Where were you yesterday when Yousef al-Ramouni was strangled to death while on the job? Did you watch the video of his wife when she was weeping and crying? Where are you? Do you watch the news? Where are you?We are not in a state of war. We are in the middle of a massacre. We have lost all hope. These are the ones who lift our heads high while you come out to condemn (them)? Where are the violations of Al-Aqsa? Here is Al-Aqsa. It has only a few years to go. They have been demolishing it. They are digging underneath it. Every day, the women at Al-Aqsa get beaten. Why are you not coming out to denounce this? If you do not want to stand by us, then sit on the side. Believe me, we can do the job instead of you. We can defend our country; we do not need you.""Like it or not, this is an authentic Palestinian voice. Her video went viral. The issue, then, is not the degree to which Abbas condemns or dissociates himself with the Palestinians who carry out these attacks. On this point, the Shin Bet service chief Yoram Cohen bluntly contradicted his prime minister. The issue is the extent to which Abbas, the Palestinian Authority, and indeed all Palestinian factions have lost control of events taking place on the ground. The Palestinians of East Jerusalem are not only stateless, but leaderless too.Yousef's voice should not come as a surprise. Hers is the product of the generation that has grown up under a policy that has been consistently applied and internationally supported. It is to suppress all political opposition in the West Bank, isolating Jerusalem, to allow Abbas to speak. Abbas' voice comes at the expense of silencing all others. The policy has been undermined in two ways. Israel collectively has stopped listening to Abbas. And the Palestinian president has stopped being listened to by Palestinians themselves.The red line in this battle is al-Aqsa in particular and Jerusalem in general. There is no question in the minds of the Palestinians of East Jerusalem but that Israel has already crossed this line. Attacking places of worship has alas become commonplace. Since June 2011, 10 mosques in Israel and the West Bank have been set on fire by presumed right-wing Jewish extremists. No charges have been filed. Over 63 mosques were destroyed and 153 partially damaged in Israel's attack on Gaza.Ever since the occupation of East Jerusalem in 1967, there were Jews who aspired to remove the mosque of al-Aqsa and the Dome of the Rock and replace it with the Third Temple. There was always a brisk trade in pictures of the Holy City with al-Aqsa and the Dome of the Rock photoshopped out. But this sort of wish fulfilment remained on the fringe of Israeli political discourse. Now it has entered the mainstream.Movements for the rebuilding of the Third Temple have gained ground and the religious veto against praying on the Temple Mount has waned. Thirty years ago, Yehuda Etzion, one the movement's leaders, was convicted of planning to blow up the Dome of the Rock. Today, he enjoys right-wing backing. ""The Temple will rise on the expense of the mosques, there is no doubt about it,"" said Etzion.Just a few hundred meters away from al-Aqsa, the crowded and poor Palestinian neighbourhood of Silwan is in the first stages of Judaisation. It is now referred to as the City of David. Just after settlers took over 23 more apartments in Silwan at the end of September, and violent clashes ensued, an advert appeared congratulating the settlers on their Zionist endeavour. ""The strengthening of Jewish presence in Jerusalem is our common challenge,"" went the ad. ""With your settlement act, you make us proud."" Who put their names on the front page ad? Nobel Laureate Eli Wiesel; Shlomo Aharonishky, ex-chief of staff of the Israeli Police; and retired general Amos Yadlin, former head of intelligence in the Israeli Defense Forces and a possible contender for the leadership of the Labor Party. As MEE contributor Meron Rapoport noted: ""In short, not a bunch of right-wing lunatics, but the flesh and bone of the Israeli establishment.""The settlers of the ""City of David"" are just the visible part of a broader act of dispossession. Declaring the area a Jewish National Heritage site, despite the fact that no reliable archeological evidence has been found linking King David to the stones uncovered during the excavations, has legitimised the acts of the settlers.The takeover of Silwan is not a fringe activity. Israel's housing minister Uri Ariel, a senior minister from the Jewish Home party, has looked into renting an apartment there.Sami Abu Atrash, a colleague of Yusef al-Ramouni, found hanging from a steel bar in the Egged bus he drove summed up the atmosphere in East Jerusalem on Tuesday. He told the Middle East Eye: ""They're against us. They don't want any Palestinians to live on this earth. They want to transfer all the people ...We work for the Jewish people, and help them, all the time, day and night. But the Israelis - and it's not just the settlers - it's the government - they are pushing them to kill us, and destroy our houses. It's the system of the government against the Palestinian people.""What's going in East Jerusalem has forced even the most West-leaning and compliant of Arab leaders, King Abdullah of Jordan to withdraw his ambassador. The king is acting out of pragmatism. He is mindful of the presence of Islamic State supporters in Jordan, to say nothing of the Palestinian majority in the Hashemite kingdom. Abdullah knows that nothing can unify Arabs as quickly as Jerusalem.Which brings us to the last and perhaps most significant difference between this Palestinian uprising, if such it proves to be, and the last two. If it does materialize, it will be fought by Palestinians inside the walls that Israel has constructed around itself, by the East Jerusalemites and the Palestinians of 1948, who are Israeli citizens. Unlike the previous two intifadas, this conflict will not be contained inside secure borders, such as were guaranteed by strong states, friendly and hostile alike. Egypt's Mubarak has disappeared, and a very large jihadi insurgency is battling for control of the Sinai Peninsula. Bashar Assad's forces no longer control Israel's northern border on the Golan Heights. To make Jerusalem a battle zone, in the circumstances of chaos in the wider Arab world, where four states have failed, is to invite every Arab fighter in.And Jerusalem will surely become a battle zone, if the public security minister eases controls on gun licenses to Israel's Jewish citizens, East Jerusalem becomes locked down by roadblocks and police patrols, or the response of the government is to demolish Palestinian houses while announcing 78 new settlements.So Netanyahu, for once, is right. This is a battle for Jerusalem. It will either be the last battle Palestinians will fight before Israeli Jews take East Jerusalem over. Or it is the first battle of a larger struggle -- in which Jerusalem serves as a magnet for militants from wherever they hail -- Sunni or Shia, secular and Islamist, takfiris, jihadis, or nationalists. Netanyahu has picked the one battleground capable of drawing them all in."

To calm down and think rationally, President Obama and Congress can help by: 1. Stop thinking and talking about the middle class. Think and talk about the country.   2. The president can only act as authorized by Congress. President Obama should cite the authorization, and fulfill his commitment on immigration. 3. The Supreme Court is gearing up to make a mess of Obamacare, and Tea Party Republicans are gearing up to impeach President Obama for his changes in the Obamacare law. Have the Senate take up the House repeal of Obamacare, pass it, and sign the repeal. Then have the Senate introduce a bill: a) extending Medicare incrementally, or in steps. Have actuaries determine what increments the economy can stand; b) Appoint a panel of doctors to limit the cost of Medicare. Doctors know items for change and excessive costs. 4. Harold Meyerson states in The Washington Post (11/12/14), ""...Democrats have detected a deficiency in their 2014 midterm campaigns: They didn't really have an economic message."" Democrats didn't have an economic message because they had done nothing for the economy. Globalization is nothing more than a trade war with production looking for a country cheaper to produce. David Ricardo's Comparative Advantage in globalization is China's closed market and predatory practices. China sets the competition in globalization, and this requires countries to protect their economies and act against predatory practices. The Founding Fathers pointed the way. The United States was born in a trade war (Boston Tea Party), and the U.S.'s strong economy was built on protectionism by Congress passing the Tariff Act of 1787 -- two years before the Constitution and four years before Madison's First Amendment rights. But, the President and Congress call for free trade and do nothing. President Obama fails to enforce the Defense Production Act of 1950 and fails to protect items vital to the economy such as steel, motor vehicles, computers, and machine tools -- items protected by President Reagan in 1984. Economists estimate a loss of 9,000 jobs for every $1 billion deficit in the balance of trade. Last year's deficit was $471 billion, costing the loss of 4,239,000 jobs. President Nixon acted to repair the deficit in trade balance in 1971, but President Obama and Congress fail to act. Congress can do something -- institute an infrastructure bank to repair our roads, bridges, and build a ""fast-track railroad"" from north to south and east to west. 5. Replace the 35% Corporate Income Tax with a 7% Value Added Tax (VAT). One hundred sixty countries compete in globalization with a VAT that's rebatable on export. The Corporate Tax is not rebatable on export. An entrepreneur in the U.S. has to pay 35% Corporate Tax on his production, and when his exports reach China, a 17% VAT. A competitor can produce the same product in China, import it tax-free, and put the entrepreneur out of business. Not having a VAT stultifies manufacture in the U.S. The VAT has no loopholes, giving instant tax reform. The VAT is self-enforcing -- pay it or pass it on. You can downsize government (IRS). The Corporate Tax is full of loopholes for the multinationals, so they (GE) pay no tax and oppose a VAT. The Main Street merchant pays the full 35%, so this VAT tax cut helps small business. The VAT tax cut releases $2 trillion in offshore profits for Corporate America to repatriate tax-free, invest and produce in the United States, creating millions of jobs and jumpstarting the economy. The 2013 Corporate Tax produced $288 billion in revenues. A 7% VAT for 2013 would have produced $945 billion -- billions more to balance the budget in two years rather than ten. The people are for tax cuts, jobs, closing loopholes, tax reform, downsizing government, helping small business, and jumpstarting the economy. When either Republicans or Democrats do something for the economy that the people are for, you can break a filibuster. Have Senate Democrats introduce a Corporate Tax replacement, debate it, and break the filibuster. I know, I know. Under the Constitution, all revenue measures should derive in the House of Representatives, but at least Democrats will have done something for the country by pointing the way."

She searched for months for a lawyer who would fight for a restraining order, and then, a divorce. Evcil also said she ignored threats from Serdar's family and searched for Muhterem when she would go missing for months on end, taken hostage by her abusive husband.Now, with the help of We Will Stop Women Murders, Evcil is speaking out for the women who can still be saved.The women’s group tries to track every incident of domestic abuse and female homicide in Turkey -- a huge feat in a country of over 74 million. The tight-knit team of volunteers provides victims' families with legal aid and comfort, compiles statistics, and pursues legal action against perpetrators and those deemed complicit in violence against women. Many of the victims it tracks were or are in the process of leaving their husbands or seeking a divorce, according to the rights group. Late last month, grim headlines splashed across the front pages of Turkish media outlets, detailing the death of Hülya Çadırcı. According to the Turkish Hurriyet Daily News, her husband allegedly walked up to her on a street in Istanbul and stabbed her five times in front of one of her children. She was in the process of seeking a divorce, Doğan News Agency reported.“We have passed the phase of traditional honor killings,” said Gulsum Kav, a medical ethics doctor in Istanbul who founded We Will Stop Women Murders. “Now we are facing modern murder. Women want a divorce, and the families aren’t adjusted to it.”While Turkey’s rural areas in the south and southeast have become infamous for honor killings -- the belief that a family member, usually a woman, must be killed for the shame they have supposedly brought to their family -- women are being killed in cities and villages all across the country. Kav said she receives a phone call nearly every day from someone seeking justice for a murdered woman.Part of the problem, Kav said, is that a 2012 law meant to protect women from domestic violence isn't being enforced.Before 2012, Turkey's domestic violence law only pertained to married women, and ""significant gaps"" in the system made protection of abused women unreliable, according to Human Rights Watch. But in a move applauded by the EU in 2012, legislation expanded law enforcement's rights around domestic violence in the country: Police officers now have the ability to authorize and enforce restraining orders, imprison those who violate protection orders and even track offenders with technological devices.In a speech at a women's conference in 2012, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan promoted the new legislation as a step in the right direction. ""We will provide legal and financial assistance and shelters to the victims,"" he told a crowd in the country's southeast. But leading voices in the fight for gender equality in Turkey have decried the state of women’s rights here and what they say is failing legislation. In April, following a big win for Erdogan’s ruling party in a round of local elections, several of Turkey’s top women’s rights activists told The WorldPost that their country was sliding backward on rights and freedoms for women.""Instead of concentrating on protecting women who suffer from domestic violence, the government concentrates on how they can make the laws more in line with their conservative ideology,"" said Pinar Ilkkaracan, who co-founded the leading NGO Women for Women's Rights. ""There is a difference between what is happening in the legal sphere and everyday life. The laws aren’t being implemented.""Kav also said the 2012 law sounds great in theory -- but is not being properly enforced.“The problem is in application,” she said simply. Umit Ulas, a divorce lawyer in Istanbul, agreed. “The laws are sufficient right now,” he said. “But the thing is that no one is taking these mechanisms seriously, from prosecutors to police. It’s not working well.”At one police station in Istanbul, a senior officer knowledgable about how police deal with cases of domestic abuse and violence against women in the city defended enforcement of the 2012 law. The officer asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak to the press.“This law is very strict,” said the officer, detailing how the station follows precise protocol in protecting women and dealing with perpetrators. “In the old days, women wouldn’t come forward about domestic violence. But thanks to this law, women can come forward and get help.”The officer said his police station has 600 restraining orders on file, all issued in 2014. They are all for abused women who sought legal protection, he said, and the station has not come across a case yet where a woman was murdered while under their protection.“But sometimes, women abuse this law,” he added. ""They say, ‘He tries to beat me’ and they get a restraining order. Sometimes his pride is damaged.”Women’s rights activists cite a slew of concerns on top of what they describe as lackluster enforcement of the protection laws -- including Erdogan advocating for women to have at least three children, restricted access to legal and safe abortions, and more recently, a top government official saying that women shouldn't laugh in public. In 2013, the World Economic Forum rated Turkey 120 out of 136 countries in terms of gender gaps in political empowerment, health, education and economic participation. The United States scored 23 out of 136 countries. Turkey's struggle with women's rights mirrors a regional struggle in gender rights and equality. To Turkey’s east lies Armenia, a country void of domestic violence laws. To its southeast is Iran, where despite high rates of divorce, it can take years for women to divorce abusive husbands and the law often favors men. To the south are Iraq and Syria, countries marred by conflict where women face rape and even sexual slavery. And to the west lies Europe and the union that Turkey has long strived to join. Despite its March 2012 law, Turkey has some of the highest levels of violence against women in Europe, and some of the lowest levels of female participation in politics and education. In April, an Istanbul court convicted Serdar of murder and sentenced him to life in prison, but with the possibility of parole. Evcil worries he will be let free in the years to come. Men in Turkey who commit similar crimes often do end up in jail, but advocates like Kav say it’s not enough to punish the perpetrator. They want to stop the killings before they happen.  Cigdem Evcil, a survivor of domestic abuse, stands in front of the hair salon where her sister was brutally killed last year.  Sefa Akyuz, the manager of the salon where Muhterem worked, remembers her murder all too well. He was working there the day Serdar came in and stabbed Muhterem to death in front of horrified staff and customers. “It took five seconds,” he said, pointing to a corner of the salon near the door. “Her husband came in and they made eye contact. There was no talking. No resistance. No time to intervene. We were in shock.”Akyuz said the hair salon staff knew Muhterem had been abused, and they were trying to help her in whatever way they could. He remembers her as a hard worker who loved her job.“She was a good person,” he said to Evcil, who was shaking near the doorway and trying to hold back tears. “Muhterem means honorable [in Turkish],” he said reassuringly. “Her name fits her.”It was here, in this small salon, that Muhterem had tried to start over, Evcil said. It was a refuge away from the endless abuse and humiliation. Evcil said she remembers a young Muhterem who dreamed of being a hairdresser someday, cutting her doll's hair for hours and pasting it back on in different styles. But she never got her second chance. Evcil blames the legal system, and said she thinks her sister would be alive if Serdar hadn’t been let go and if the police had enforced Turkish law and protected her. Evcil noted how easy it was for Serdar to simply walk into the salon and stab Muhterem.“Our society asks what the women did wrong,” Evcil said, sipping hot tea in a cafe close to where Muhterem was killed. “Like there should be a reason for a man to beat. Every day, women are murdered.” Evcil has some experience herself with this issue. She battled in an abusive relationship for years as well, only to watch her sister go through the same hell. Cigdem Evcil holds up photo taken on her cellphone showing her sister, Muhterem Gocmen, before Muhterem's brutal murder.Evcil said that in 2006, her then-husband beat her up in a public square in Istanbul. Passersby merely stared, she said, and when he was finished, she was “unrecognizable.” She recalled that the police told her to go back home, saying that her husband might even bring her flowers to patch things up. It was then that she lost her trust in the law, she said. She realized that she was alone in her fight.Fast forward several years, and Evcil sought out a divorce -- which fueled more attacks by her husband, she said. But in the end, she got her divorce and legal custody of her son and daughter, now school-age.The single mom is also now raising Muhterem’s 13-year-old daughter and 4-year-old son.Evcil said she was lucky to win custody over Serdar's family and the state -- both of whom were pushing to take Muhterem's children. We Will Stop Women Murders provided legal assistance for the case. Kav said that in several other cases handled and documented by the group, the relatives of the alleged perpetrator gain custody of the children.Evcil said Muhterem’s young son often asks for his mother. Evcil visits her sister’s grave several times a week, but doesn’t know what to tell the young boy. She wants to protect him from the truth.Despite the tragedy that Evcil said haunts her, she has been having a recurring dream -- one with a happy ending -- about her sister. In the dream, Kav, the founder of We Will Stop Women Murders, saves Muhterem.“I see her as a shield,” Evcil said, speaking of Kav and her group. “I stayed strong because of them. They supported me with all their hearts.”Her dream ends the same way every time: Kav patches Muhterem’s wounds and helps her change into a clean white dress. Then the two walk off, whispering and laughing. And at last, Muhterem is safe. Burak Sayin and Özlem Özarpaci contributed reporting from Istanbul. "

Israel describes those two urban settlements as Jerusalem neighborhoods.Jerusalem has seen unrest in the past few weeks over access to the city's most sacred and politically sensitive site, holy to both Jews and Muslims. On Tuesday, two Palestinians killed four rabbis and a policeman at a Jerusalem synagogue, the worst attack in the city since 2008.The Palestinians have also been angered by a recent slew of plans Israel has advanced for about 4,000 housing units on West Bank land annexed to the city.The Palestinians want to establish a state in East Jerusalem, the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip, territories captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War. They fear the Israeli enclaves will deny them contiguous territory.Nabil Abu Rdainah, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said of the latest announcement: ""These decisions are a continuation of the Israeli government's policy to cause more tension, push towards further escalation and waste any chance to create an atmosphere for calm.""Israel's settlement activities have drawn criticism from the European Union and from the United States, which like most countries views settlements as illegal.U.S. State Department spokesman Jeff Rathke stressed Washington's ""clear and consistent opposition to construction activity in East Jerusalem"" and said: ""During this sensitive time in Jerusalem, we would see such activity as inconsistent with the goal of lower tensions and seeking a path toward peace.""Israel, citing Biblical links to Jerusalem, says Jews have a right to live anywhere in the city.

15,POLITICS,Did The National Archives Give The CIA Permission To Destroy Evidence?,Ali Watkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cia-destroy-emails_n_6184810.html,,2014-11-19,"CIA Director John Brennan arrives on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, March 12, 2013, to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on worldwide threats. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8dd94210000d601c96795.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- In mid-January of this year, a small request was slipped quietly to the National Archives and Records Administration, the lord of the U.S. government’s record-keeping operations. One government agency’s method for storing documents was clogging up its system, and it just wanted permission to clear out some of its emails.The National Archives gave the proposal a temporary nod in August, and the Central Intelligence Agency was granted the ability to erase certain email records.The tentative approval of the new record-keeping strategy has set off a firestorm between the CIA and its critics, including the agency's congressional overseers. The CIA insists that it'll actually be keeping more extensive records under the new system. But the agency's watchdogs say the emails are vital to the oversight process, and that, due to its history of secrecy, the CIA shouldn’t be trusted to judge what’s worth saving and what isn’t.Under the CIA's proposal, the agency will delete emails from its records “when no longer needed,” or, at most, three years after the employee who authored the emails leaves the agency. (An exception is made for the correspondence of 22 senior agency officials, which will remain on file.) Currently, the agency's record-keeping process consists of printing out and filing emails that are deemed important, which are then retained for an amount of time that could not be clearly determined. It's unclear how much additional discretion the new system will give the CIA, since the criteria currently used to determine which emails to retain are not known. But transparency advocates are incensed that the National Archives would grant the agency explicit permission to delete emails, given what they see as the CIA's history of secrecy.In a letter sent to the National Archives on Wednesday, Senate Intelligence Committee members Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Mark Udall (D-Colo.) blasted the initial approval of the CIA’s proposal, and suggested the office had relied too heavily on the agency’s good faith in granting the request.“[National Archives] appears to have relied on CIA assertions about the CIA’s treatment of information contained in email records, not on an independent review of these issues,” the letter reads. “We also believe that [the National Archives'] justification for the pending approval severely undervalues the importance of email records to be used as documentary evidence for Congress, the courts, Executive Branch entities and the public.”The CIA, however, argues that under the new system, more records, not fewer, will be kept on file.“CIA’s proposal exceeds [National Archives] requirements, would preserve more records than many other government agencies and would preserve more records than under existing policy,” agency spokesperson Ryan Trapani told The Huffington Post last week.The agency noted in its request to the National Archives that any important information contained in emails to be deleted would be swept up and stored through other protocols already in place. The specifics of those protocols could not be ascertained, as many of the agency’s data storage systems are classified.But the senators, who are familiar with the protocols, challenged those claims.“These statements, in our judgment and experience, are simply not true,” the senators’ letter reads. “Important information about the CIA’s actions, assessments, and decision-making processes is often contained in email records and nowhere else.”The Senators also warned that the CIA would be the first of the nation's intelligence agencies to implement the new email storage policy, which could set a dangerous precedent.The CIA's proposal was first reported in September by Steven Aftergood, the director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists.The agency also suggested that it is being unfairly criticized for its request.“Because we are the CIA, some tend to see conspiracies where there are none,” Trapani said.Transparency advocates and agency critics, though, are up in arms, and say that based on the agency’s track record, the conspiracies are seldom imagined.Seventeen government transparency advocates wrote to the National Archives earlier this month, asking the office to reconsider its initial approval of the CIA’s proposal.“It leaves too many key terms undefined, and relies too heavily on the CIA’s good faith instead of NARA’s own careful appraisal of CIA recordkeeping,” the letter said.Katherine Hawkins of OpenTheGovernment.org, one of the groups that signed the letter, said it's not clear from the CIA's request that the new policy would lead to more extensive record keeping than current practices.“If that's the case, their proposal is very poorly written. It is not at all clear from the text that it requires any additional email preservation,” she said. “Even leaving aside the lack of clarity ... the list of officials whose records are to be preserved permanently is much, much too short. There is more than one person in the 5000-person clandestine service whose emails are historically significant.”There’s ample evidence to support the advocates' claims that email records are critical to the oversight process, the most recent example being the CIA emails that were frequently cited in the intelligence panel's study on the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi. The senators’ letter also noted that the committee’s yet-to-be-released study on the CIA’s enhanced interrogation program relies in part on CIA email correspondence.Underscoring concerns over the proposal is the CIA’s track record of discarding incriminating evidence. Most notably, in 2005, the agency destroyed certain videotapes of interrogations conducted under its post-9/11 torture program. The advocacy groups say that this history should prompt concern over allowing the CIA to independently determine which emails are worthy of saving.  “In many cases, the CIA has justified the destruction of evidence by using an extremely narrow definition of what constitutes a 'permanent record,'” the groups’ letter reads. ""This has contributed to incidents where crucial documents were destroyed, and the CIA has refused to acknowledge that their destruction violated any law.”The Senate Intelligence Committee was briefed on the agency’s records request in the past weeks, HuffPost has learned, but requests for comment from the committee have gone unanswered.The public comment period for the proposal closed this week. The National Archives declined to comment.Read the senators' letter to the National Archives here."

They may not be the celebrated rainmakers bringing additional revenue in to the firm, but there seems to be an intangible value assigned to them by their bosses.What's going on here?We've always known that the workplace isn't a meritocracy. Now Dr. Wu has demonstrated that small talk really can turn into big business.More and more managers are recognizing that, especially in a world of hyper-connection and social media, workers who have connections across the workplace can really benefit the company. They may know the right person to contact to solve a particular problem, help collect and spread information, come up with new products or even get their co-workers on board with organizational changes.No wonder leaders want to capitalize on the connectworking (kicking networking up into high gear to make personal connections) ability of their employees.Yet according to a Harvard Business Review research report, an astounding 77 percent of the women surveyed believe that hard work and long hours, not connections (which they view with disdain as too sales-y), self-promotion or politicking will secure their advancement.Everyone in every company is -- or should be -- in the business of selling: not just products and services but their organization's brand and culture and themselves and their abilities as well.""Networking"" might be considered a dirty word around the office -- a little too aggressive, making people uncomfortable. But whether it's labeled teamwork, relationship building, or collaboration, it's still connectworking. And to that end, many organizations offer mentoring programs, women's (or other special interest) connectworking groups and other opportunities for people to work together out of their usual work group.Assess what skills you have that can be used in other areas of the organization and how you can showcase them to make others aware of your abilities. Demonstrate that you are able to astutely identify problems and can solve them.Think about how well you are connected inside your organization. Consider how many people you know at different levels of the company, how many of them know your name, and how plugged in you are to the company grapevine.Also think about your reputation. Do people like you? Are you able to motivate and inspire diverse teams?Do you have (or make) any opportunities to participate in cross-functional or interdepartmental projects? Are you known as a problem solver? If you see issues or evolving priorities do you suggest solutions to influential people and/or take responsibility for implementing those suggestions? Do you make time to see people just to say hello and find out what they're working on?Your skills and experience are important in progressing at work, but landing a big promotion is really more about how you are moving the company forward. Consider how what you are doing is helping meet organizational goals, rather than individual objectives.Look for and ask for additional opportunities and responsibilities. You want to make yourself indispensable, the go-to person (Trusted Advisor) for your area of expertise.Some companies are much better at internal connectworking than others. Ask if your company offers workshops on connectworking, if employees are encouraged to belong to and participate in leadership roles in professional and community organizations and conferences and if you can, or are expected to, collaborate with people across department lines.Are connectworking activities part of your annual performance plan? Are your connectworking efforts recognized and rewarded? If not, they should be.While you're building your internal connectwork, it's critical not to overlook developing a connectwork outside the company. The higher you progress in a company, the greater the stresses and the fewer places to release pressure. Many top executives feel that they must always look strong and confident for the people both below and above them. It can, indeed, be lonely at the top.Having an external connectwork of peers gives each of them someone with whom to commiserate and use as a sounding board because they have a unique and shared understanding of the issues. But you have to have that connectwork built out before you need it.Womenhave natural skills as communicators, collaborators and connectors. We should be using those abilities to meet whatever goals we set for ourselves.Susan Dench is the founder and president of The Connectworks Academy, a training, development and advisory firm which uses her trademarked system to help organizations who want to accelerate the advancement of a diversified workforce engage employees through communication and personal connections.

TentEd's co-founder, Zack Bazzi, recently produced a short video about the project and is now preparing a return trip to the region in December. Since the first TentEd visit to Kurdistan, a lot has changed in the region so I sat down with Zack recently to find out what he sees has been accomplished and what he thinks he can get done with another visit to the region.  Tell us about how much you were able to fundraise for your first trip this last summer and what you were able to accomplish? (Include metrics, numbers of backpacks delivered, schools helped, children served)  I landed in Erbil, Iraq on 7 June. Two days later, Mosul, Iraq's second city, fell to ISIS. Needless to say, it complicated the project. I assessed the situation with my teammates back in the U.S. and we decided that I would stick around and see the project through. The Kurdistan Region of Iraq where I was is pretty stable and secure, and it is defended by a wall of hardened Peshmerga warriors. I was pretty comfortable with that decision. I ended up staying in the Kurdistan region for a little over a month. It turned out to be a pretty productive stint. In just a few weeks we:1) Stocked the Afreen Elementary School (in Domiz Refugee Camp) Library with 300 Arabic books 2) Purchased teaching supplies, stationary and furniture for the Derek Secondary School (also in Camp Domiz). 3) Funded three months of bus transportation for children who could not afford it at Garanawa Elementary School in Erbil. 4) Provided school uniforms for 200 girls and boys and badly needed shoes for nearly 100 first and second graders. 5) Distributed 200 stationary kits.I think that's pretty good impact for $17,000. A lot of people would look at your work this last summer and I think be congratulatory for your efforts but with the headlines now discussing ISIS, why go back, are you afraid?  I'm going back because there continues to be a clear need for the sort of support that TentEd can provide. I also have many dear friends from all faiths and backgrounds in Kurdistan and so I'm going back to visit them. TentEd is not just a humanitarian project. It's also a personal initiative. Frankly, it's tough to figure out where the project part starts and the personal one begins. The concern about danger is understandable, although, it is important for people to understand that the Kurdistan region in Iraq feels like a separate country all together. It has its own government, parliament and security forces. It's fairly secure and stable and I feel very safe traveling throughout that region. I ALWAYS present myself as a proud American veteran--never an issue. The people of Kurdistan love America. I think we should show them some love back. Regarding risk, that's something I think about on a routine basis. One mantra that stuck with me from my Army days (also my favorite) is this: we don't avoid risk. We manage it. I think that's also a good way to live life. That's all the philosophy you'll get out of me!You going back to Kurdistan, and you being in graduate school at Georgetown, brings up natural comparisons to Austin Tice, the Marine Combat Veteran who, while on summer break from law school went to cover events in Syria and has now been missing since 2012 (http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/05/03/war-nostalgia-is-leading-veterans-to-places-like-syria-one-marine-never-came-back.html). Some have labeled his return as 'war nostalgia'. Does war nostalgia factor into your decision to go back to Iraq?  No. I've been out of the Army many many years now. I loved my time in uniform and if you ask me if I miss it sometimes, the answer is a definite yes. Most former soldiers will answer in the same way. I miss patrolling the mountains in Kosovo with 100 pounds of gear when I was deployed there with the 101st. And I miss the electric thrill of a firefight in Iraq and the extraordinary beauty of the Hindu Kush Mountains in Afghanistan. All that is normal and healthy. But I'm also very comfortable and content being a reintegrated citizen. When the uniform comes off, it's time to move forward. I certainly don't live in the past. You don't take a salary for your work, so why not just send the funds raised here to do the same work and be administered by someone already in the region?  It's very important for me to maintain the trust with TentEd supporters and donors. It frames every action and every decision. And crucial to maintaining that trust are two things: accountability and responsibly. As the person who oversees TentEd, I believe that it is my responsibility to personally implement the projects and ensure full accountability for each dollar invested. Our generous funders deserve nothing less. Do you see any near term solution to the refugee crisis in Kurdistan? How long does TentEd need to continue?  Given the historic nature of what's happening throughout the broader Middle East, the demographic fracturing of Syria and Iraq and the intensity of the regional Shiite -Sunni rivalry, the refugee situation in Kurdistan is not likely to improve any time soon. Iraqi Kurdistan will continue grappling with wave after wave of refugees trying to escape the violence that's plaguing their communities. It's not a rosy predication, but that's the reality right now. This is why it's so vital now more than ever to support organizations that are trying to ease the situation. To the second part of your question, I'm currently enrolled in an Emergency Management master's program at Georgetown University. The challenge is to balance school demands with the responsibilities of TentEd. So far, it's been a good balance. I plan to continue doing the occasional TentEd trip to (Iraqi) Kurdistan as long as I can maintain that balance. What are your long-term goals professionally and with TentEd?  TentEd is a program within the Education for Peace in Iraq Center (EPIC). This provides the initiative a stable and very supportive home. For now it's one project at a time while I focus on grad school. After that, who knows! What do you think the United States should be doing in the region to support a more stable Iraq and Syria?  That's a very complicated question. And if I had a good answer, chances are I would not be a student at the moment! What's really important is for those of us in a position to do something, whether through volunteer work or careful donations, to try and do what we can when we can. As we close in on the American holiday season, why should people give to TentEd?  Because we're making direct impact on the ground in a place that urgently needs all the support possible. There is very little separating donated money from a school child who, to be frank, is not having the best winter. I will be flying to Kurdistan in mid-December and I will spend my time there making sure that the $15,000 we raise is invested wisely and carefully. I can't think of a more appropriate and thrilling way to spend my holiday season."

Katey Sagal's Gemma scheming till the endWe will all find out soon enough but a final season visit to the Los Angeles-based SOA set, whose basic interiors have been filmed in a relatively quiet NoHo residential/commercial community that doubles for fictional Charming, reveals the very real brotherhood ties that the series has built up among its actors. Where will Jax's road lead?Englishman Hunnam rode his own Harley Dyna daily to the soundstage that features SOA's clubhouse as well as their own auto shop, replete with gorgeous motorcycles with an array of SOA customized paint jobs and Grim Reaper illustrations. Of what he'll miss most about the series, Hunnam relates:The relationship Jax has with club, and how that has bled into us actors becoming, through the experience of the show, a little club of our own. That real camaraderie has become a central dynamic for us guys who play these characters. As we had staggered calls, we would hang out on the set afterwards, and do a post mortem, decompress a little. And then ride home together. We've shot exteriors all over the place, sometimes f••king miles away, and we often had a long ride home, so it was fun to have someone to ride back with. Tommy Flanagan (as Chibs) and Mark Boone (as Munson) are the two guys I've become really close with, becoming like brothers. The three of us have ridden home a lot. Charlie Hunnam looking to slow the pace down a little after SOAA very down to earth person, who wouldn't mind ""slowing the pace down a little after a few really great years,"" Hunnam admits he likes to hang at home, cooking and hanging with his ladyfriend when not working. He's also become a huge fan of riding motorcycles since working on SOA, explaining:I mainly ride my Harley-Davidson Dyna, the same one we ride in the show. Which is a little unfortunate when I get photographed, looking a little like a dickhead riding a similar bike as in the show, but it's just the best bike that Harley makes. There's a reason that so many ride it, particularly 'outlaws' because they're the fastest. A lot of Harleys are more for cruising and they look and feel great for that. But the Dyna is one bike they make that you can ride pretty aggressively and have some fun on.Even though the SOA series is coming to an end, Hunnam doesn't believe the counter culture ethos of motorcycle clubs will fade, explaining, ""The direction we're going with the controlling of society by ever nefarious means, is just fueling the rebellion that is at the heart of all counter cultures. And, just based on stuff I've read and talked to other bikers about from the 1960s and 1970s, when biker culture became really popular in America, it's always been about a separatist identity and rebellion, and so it has its place even more today."" Sons of Anarchy - Hamlet on HarleysAs for his initial inspiration for Jax, Hunnam recalls:I went up to Oakland and hung out with a very well known motorcycle club. One kid was amazing, a dream come true, because he was Jax. He was 22 and had 22 birthday parties right in their clubhouse. He was the heir apparent, like my character, being the history and the future of that Club. He was young, fearless and modern day, but also an old school, badass gunslinger. And sure enough he ends up getting killed the week after I left Oakland, just before we started shooting the series. People would say he'd put his gun in his belt before he put his shoes on. Like he was a straight, f••king outlaw. So based on the whole aesthetic of his character -- his jeans, running shoes, everything he wore -- I knew I'd never find anyone more prototypically perfect, so I based everything on him.With the finale looming, will Jax go the way of the real young outlaw, like in a great Shakespearean tragedy? Or, will Jax ride off on his Harley into the sunset and overcome his seemingly pre-destined fate? Do not adjust your screen!Check out Sons of Anarchy."

(Photo by Al Pereira/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb48b78250000940038fdec.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Wouldn't ya know it? Just when the boys at Netflix think they have HBO right where they want 'em (the online content giant is just days away from challenging HBO's dominance in the comedy arena with a stand-up special featuring the legendary Bill Cosby), yet another woman comes forward and accuses Cosby of raping her.At this point in time if you're Reed Hastings, Netflix CEO, shouldn't you seriously be considering pulling the plug on the Cosby train before it leaves the station? Aside from the fact that a comedy special by an accused rapist might make the watching of it an entirely unfunny experience, not to mention turn the event into a study in duality, wouldn't it be worse if they air the thing and members show their disdain by boycotting it entirely, or worse, cancelling their subscriptions? Lord knows, Netflix could do without another 50% drop in their stock price.Keep in mind, it's not as if there's only one accuser. This is not a situation where a disgruntled ex or a vindictive lover is trying to exact revenge. A recent article posted on The Huff by Maureen Shaw puts the total number of women accusing Bill Cosby of raping them at an astounding 13. And now, with the scathing interviews being given to CNN and The Washington Post, by former actress and Cosby protege, Barbara Bowman, it would be pretty arrogant and foolish of Netflix to just ignore the issue in the hope it will go away -- especially since publicist Joan Tarshis has just come forward as alleged victim number 14. Though, that seems to be NBC's plan at the moment regarding their upcoming project with The 'Cos.Meanwhile, Cosby has decided to answer these accusations by not answering them. He's cancelled several talk-show appearances, been the subject of the Internet's version of ""Pie in the Face"" and has refused to comment on the issue at all. I do not envy his publicist.In this day and age, when a simple 'Tweet' can get your upcoming appearance canceled, or even an entire series pulled (just ask Artie Lange or Cee-Lo Greene), shouldn't having over a dozen women coming forward with virtually identical stories of sexual abuse, drugging, threats, and accusations of cover-ups by dozens of hangers-on in Cosby's inner circle warrant the same?Granted, the aforementioned tweets came directly from the individuals, themselves, so denying them was never an option, and there's no physical proof that Cosby ever did anything to these women. But, as the bishop, whose hospital is accused of negligence during a routine procedure which leaves a woman in a coma, asks his attorney in the Paul Newman classic, The Verdict, ""Do you believe her?"" In this case, it would be, ""Do you believe them?,"" as there are enough accusers in this situation to form a glee club. Add to that the fact that Reed Hastings is a male, and it makes it an even more slippery slope. If Netflix had a female CEO, would she be more inclined to pull the plug than a male CEO? It may sound sexist but the question as to why it took a male talking about the issue to bring it to light, has some merit. Netflix has no doubt spent millions in production/marketing, thus, might a female executive require less external pressure to abandon the pursuit of profit and err on the side of the accusers? Let's also take a moment to focus on the timing of these allegations; the Ray Rice incident is still fresh on everyone's minds, as is the disgraceful way violence against women has been handled for the past several decades, not only in the sports world, but by the entertainment industry, as well. Don't let it slip by that not only is Cosby being accused here, Ms. Bowman is also calling to task his agents, managers, lawyers, staff, etc., for aiding/enabling the situation while riding the gravy train of Cosby's fame and fortune. Obviously, not everyone who worked with the man back then would have known if these alleged abuses were occurring, but, if they're true, you know some of them had to.And, while we definitely don't want to become a society of ""witch hunters"" looking to form a lynch mob as soon as a finger is pointed, it's tough to know where to draw the line. In this situation, there appears to be enough consistency and corroboration of testimony that, even if it's not possible to prosecute Cosby for his alleged crimes, his reputation can be given the death penalty.Regardless of whether or not you believe Ms. Bowman and the others who've come forward, if Netflix does decide to go ahead and air Cosby's special, and they're lambasted for it, they'll have no one to blame but themselves for its ""'Cos and effect.'"""
