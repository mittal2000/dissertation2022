(Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb486ee3c000066000ca350.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Katherine Heigl answered a personal question during a Facebook Q&A about her new show, ""State Of Affairs"" on Saturday. When a fan asked Heigl for her thoughts concerning rumors that she is ""very rude,"" the actress responded:Yeah I've heard those too...honestly I don't think I am...nothing makes me more uncomfortable than confrontation or hurting someone's feelings and I would never, ever actively do so on purpose. Of course just like any human being I've made mistakes and unwittingly or carelessly spoken or acted but I always try to make any wrong right. That doesn't mean I won't stand up for myself by drawing boundaries and asking to be treated kindly and respectfully but I don't do that with any rude or unkind intentions just with the same strength and honesty I think every one of us is entitled to.This isn't the first time Heigl has addressed these rumors. When asked a similar question in a press event for ""State Of Affairs,"" the 35-year-old said:""I can only say that I certainly don't see myself as being difficult. I would never intend to be difficult. I don't think my mother sees herself as being difficult. I think it's important to everybody to conduct themselves professionally and respectfully and kindly. If I have ever disappointed somebody, it was not intentional.""Over the years, Heigl has come under fire for allegedly being difficult to work with. Most recently, ""Grey's Anatomy"" creator, producer and writer Shonda Rhimes took a shot at Heigl in a profile by the Hollywood Reporter. While discussing production on ""Scandal,"" the showrunner said, ""There are no Heigls in this situation."" Rhimes later added, ""I don't put up with bullshit or nasty people. I don't have time for it."""
1,CRIME,Documentary Star Fights Molestation Conviction,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jesse-friedman-capturing-the-friedmans_n_6090856.html,,2014-11-02,"**FILE** Jesse Friedman poses for a portrait in his lawyer's New York office in this Wednesday, Jan. 7, 2004 file photo. A federal judge has rejected Friedman's bid for exoneration in a child-molestation case explored in a noted documentary film, saying he filed his appeal too late. She ruled Jan. 4, 2008, that the June 2006 appeal was ""untimely."" Friedman's appeal stemmed from the Oscar-nominated 2003 film, ""Capturing the Friedmans."" (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II, FILE)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ba2c86d2200003000da74b0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Ellen WulfhorstNEW YORK (Reuters) - Jesse Friedman, whose conviction as a teenage child molester was portrayed in the Oscar-nominated film ""Capturing the Friedmans,"" is not giving up his decades-long campaign to clear his name.Friedman has asked a court to review evidence in his case, one of the most notorious in the history of New York's Long Island, contending that prosecutors coached and intimidated child witnesses into making false allegations. A judge could issue a ruling on his request any day now.Friedman also alleges that prosecutors defamed him after a more recent reinvestigation of the case, and a lawsuit he filed is winding its way through the courts.Friedman was 18 when he pleaded guilty to molesting more than a dozen boys in the 1980s at computer classes taught by his father in the basement of their home in suburban Great Neck.The documentary on the Friedmans pieced together intimate home videos and revealing interviews, and raised questions about the police work and prosecution tactics.Now 45, Friedman wants exoneration even though his prison sentence is behind him. Having completed parole, he is a married man who has found work as an online bookseller.""I haven't gotten to the end yet,"" he said in a recent interview at his Bridgeport, Connecticut home. ""I could just say, 'It's time to move on,' but I don't and I'm not going to because justice for justice's sake, truth for truth's sake. It's still important.""Controversy always surrounded the Friedman case, from the sensational details at its start to the doubts about its veracity that linger today.The saga began in 1987 when Jesse's father Arnold was caught ordering child pornography. The investigation led to hundreds of charges of child molestation against father and son.Arnold Friedman, an admitted pedophile, pleaded guilty and went to prison, where he killed himself in 1995.Jesse Friedman served 13 years in prison and was released in 2001. NATIONAL ATTENTIONThe case gained national attention in 2003 when ""Capturing the Friedmans"" was nominated for an Academy Award.Today Friedman, thin and balding, lives quietly with his wife Lisabeth, two dogs and two cats and tries to stay out of the public eye that peered so intimately into his life.""I'm a 45-year-old guy who sells books and goes to the grocery store like everyone else, and that's important to me,"" he said. ""I strenuously protect what privacy that I have.""Despite Friedman's efforts at normalcy, his exoneration fight means a stream of legal filings and meetings with lawyers. His designation for life as a Level 3 violent sex offender restricts where he can work, live, worship and travel. Raising a family would be nearly impossible, making everyday events like taking a child to school problematic.Friedman has an encyclopedic knowledge of wrongful convictions and false confession cases, many of which made headlines in the late 1980s such as the McMartin preschool case in California and the Kelly Michaels case in New Jersey.Many unraveled or were discredited over prosecutors' questionable use of suggestive interviewing techniques, hypnosis and what is known in psychotherapy as repressed and recovered memories of abuse.Friedman, facing 243 charges in 1988, has said he pleaded guilty to 25 counts, convinced after dire warnings from the presiding judge about the penalties he faced, that he could not get a fair trial in the intensely publicized case.A federal appeals court in 2010 said there was a ""reasonable likelihood"" he had been wrongfully convicted but said it could not overturn his conviction due to legal technicalities.The ruling strongly criticized the judge, prosecutors and police and suggested the case be reviewed.It also raised Friedman's hopes of clearing his name. REPORT DISPUTEDBut Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice declared three years later that a reinvestigation of the case ""has only increased confidence in the integrity of Jesse Friedman's guilty plea.""Her report cited victims who affirmed their accounts, disputed recantations and blasted ""Capturing the Friedmans"" as ""selectively edited and misleading.""""Instances of wrongful conviction are real and exist in far greater numbers than any of us would like to admit,"" Rice wrote. ""But the case against Jesse Friedman is not one of them.""We were fully prepared to exonerate Mr. Friedman if that's where the facts led us. But the facts, under any objective analysis, led to a substantially different conclusion,"" she wrote.Stung by the Rice report, which called him a psychopath, Friedman filed his defamation suit against the prosecutor.Rice spokesman Paul Leonard said she was prepared to defend against it.""We view this lawsuit as meritless and will defend zealously against its allegations,"" Leonard said.Friedman's team of advocates, which includes ""Capturing the Friedmans"" director Andrew Jarecki, has collected recantations, eyewitnesses who say they saw nothing amiss and accusers who now say their incriminating statements were pressured and coached. They say the Rice report was biased and woefully incomplete.In a reel of new evidence compiled by Jarecki, one accuser, now an adult, said he was never raped or sodomized. ""If I said it, it was not because it happened. It was because someone else put those words in my mouth,"" he said.Another advocate for reopening the case is Arline Epstein, whose young son made accusations against the Friedmans. Two years ago, as an adult, he admitted he had lied to end what he found to be relentless pressure.He told his mother that police questioning him as a child warned if he didn't say he was abused he could become a homosexual.""The degree of the wrong is so appalling and so shocking that this just has to be addressed,"" Epstein said. ""If we don't, then the whole credibility of our system crumbles.""Friedman's defenders want all the evidence reviewed in a hearing seeking to overturn his conviction. The hearing has been assigned to a Nassau County judge but not scheduled."
2,RELIGION,Bishops Object As Catholic Universities Offer Same-Sex Benefits,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/catholic-university-same-sex-benefits_n_6082778.html,,2014-11-02,"SOUTH BEND, IN - AUGUST 30: The mural at the Hesburgh Library, commonly known as 'Touchdown Jesus' is seen on the campus of Notre Dame University before a game between the Norte Dame Fighting Irish and the Rice Owls at Notre Dame Stadium on August 30, 2014 in South Bend, Indiana. (Photo by Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7f23525000032003a0bb9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(RNS) The decision by a Jesuit university in Nebraska to provide benefits to spouses of gay employees has prompted a strong protest from the local archbishop, the latest skirmish in a battle that seems likely to widen as gay marriage becomes more common.The Rev. Timothy Lannon, president of Creighton University in Omaha, said the Catholic school would recognize the spouses of gay employees married in states where same-sex marriage is legal. Those spouses would be eligible to join the university’s health plan.Nebraska has a constitutional amendment barring gay marriage.Apart from Creighton, 21 other Jesuit universities now provide benefits to same-sex partners.Indiana’s University of Notre Dame also announced in October that it will offer benefits to all legally married spouses of employees. Unlike Nebraska, Indiana is one of 32 states where gay marriage is now legal.Lannon said the university began discussing the change a year ago after comments by Pope Francis — who is also a Jesuit — about welcoming gays into the church without judging them, and the university’s benefits committee approved it unanimously.Lannon said the decision did not imply an endorsement of same-sex marriage but was a matter of treating employees fairly.“As you might expect, some people will be very happy and some will be quite disappointed in me and the decision I made,” Lannon told the Omaha World-Herald.Archbishop George Lucas of Omaha was one of those who reacted with disappointment.“Despite Father Lannon’s claim that this is not a statement of approval of same sex marriages, this is precisely the message that the University is giving,” Lucas said in a statement released Monday (Oct. 27). “I am dismayed that the recommendation of the University Benefits Committee is thought to supersede divine law regarding marriage.”In announcing that it would provide same-sex spousal benefits, Notre Dame officials said the university had to follow state employment laws and said it still supported the traditional Catholic teaching that marriage is between one man and one woman.But Notre Dame’s president, the Rev. John Jenkins, added that beyond the legal obligations “we recognize an urgent call to welcome, support and cherish gay and lesbian brothers and sisters, who have been too often marginalized and even ostracized, and many of whom bear the scars of such treatment.”Bishop Kevin Rhoades of the Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend, which includes the Notre Dame campus, voiced concern at the decision.Rhoades called on Notre Dame to work with Indiana’s bishops to secure religious exemptions that would prevent the government from “forcing our Catholic institutions to extend any special benefits we afford to actual marriage to same-sex ‘marriage’ as well.”"

A few thousand people opposed to Italy's 1978 law allowing abortion have marched from the Colosseum to Castel Sant'Angelo, a landmark near the Vatican, in a protest drawing people from around the world, including Americans and Poles. (AP Photo/Riccardo De Luca)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7f2372100000002c91bf5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"VATICAN CITY (RNS) American Cardinal Raymond Burke, the feisty former archbishop of St. Louis who has emerged as the face of the opposition to Pope Francis’ reformist agenda, likened the Roman Catholic Church to “a ship without a rudder” in a fresh attack on the pope’s leadership.In an interview with the Spanish Catholic weekly Vida Nueva, published Thursday (Oct. 30), Burke insisted he was not speaking out against the pope personally but raising concern about his leadership.“Many have expressed their concerns to me. At this very critical moment, there is a strong sense that the church is like a ship without a rudder,” Burke said.“Now, it is more important than ever to examine our faith, have a healthy spiritual leader and give powerful witness to the faith.”Burke is the current head of the Vatican’s highest court known as the Apostolic Signatura, but he said recently he is about to be demoted. There is speculation he will be made patron of the Order of Malta, a largely ceremonial post.“I have all the respect for the Petrine ministry and I do not want to seem like I am speaking out against the pope,” he said in the interview. “I would like to be a master of the faith, with all my weaknesses, telling a truth that many currently perceive.”“They are feeling a bit seasick because they feel the church’s ship has lost its way,” he added.Burke has expressed an uncompromising stance on keeping the ban on Communion for Catholics who divorce and remarry without an annulment, and is one of five conservative cardinals who aired their views in a new book, “Remaining in the Truth of Christ,” released on the eve of the bishops’ blockbuster synod in early October.When the synod signaled a more welcoming tone to gay and lesbian Catholics, Burke publicly accused the global gathering of bias and was among those who pushed for a less conciliatory approach in the final report.Burke had previously said that Catholic families should not expose children to the “evil” of homosexuality by inviting a gay son home for Christmas with his partner.In his latest interview, Burke said the church was “the pillar of marriage” and challenged the pope’s revolutionary “Who am I to judge?” remark on gay people.“The acts must be judged; I do not think that the pope thinks differently. They are sinful and unnatural. The pope never said we can find positive elements in them. It is impossible to find positive elements in an evil act.”ALSO ON THE HUFFINGTON POST  LISTEN: WHAT DOES POPE FRANCIS REALLY WANT FOR THE CHURCH? "

(Photo by D Dipasupil/FilmMagic)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafd086260000cf00816079.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I recently came across this piece by a black gay man who seems to need a bit of help when it comes to realizing how awesome he is, so I've come up with 10 reasons it's utterly amazing and pretty awesome to be a black gay guy.1. We have twice as many heroes to look up to.Sure, the less enlightened among us would like to call being black and gay ""being a double minority"" or give pitiful lectures on how tough it is to fight racism and homophobia, but flip that argument on its head and you'll find that the experience of belonging to two cultures that have brought so much change and good to the world is pretty damn great. I have heroes who range from Bayard Rustin to Sylvia Rivera to Harvey Milk to Audre Lorde, all great people who cross boundaries of race, sexual orientation, and gender identity. To be able to look to those who have caused so much amazing change in the world and realize that they share one or more of my personal identities is pretty damn amazing.2. The most pro-LGBT-equality president in U.S. history is black.You know, the one who came out in support of gay marriage? The one whose presidency saw the most rapid expansion of recognition of LGBT rights in history? Yep, that's President Barack Obama, and he's black. We know he's black because that's how he identifies. President Obama's embrace of LGBT rights has helped start a much-needed conversation about said rights in the black community and has helped dispel the persistent and insidious myth that blacks are somehow more homophobic than other races. 3. Many of the pioneers leading the charge for gay equality in sports are black.Michael Sam. Jason Collins. Derrick Gordon. These (newly) out gay black men are changing the game in sports at the professional and collegiate levels and are heralding an unprecedented change in visibility for gay black men. When Jason Collins came out on the cover of Sports Illustrated, it was a moment. Michael Sam and Derrick Gordon have had their moments as well, and each of these three men is redefining what it is to be a black gay man by taking the steps to lead the charge in their respective arena in sports. I'd say that's ballin'.4. We have more dating options... really!OK, hear me out. Since most of the images we see of loving couples or hot guys in gay media are of upper-middle-class gay white men, most people are going to see that as the standard of beauty, right? Well, if you're a black gay man, that means that you need to look in the mirror and create your own standard of beauty that isn't quite so rigid, thus opening you up a little bit more to the fantastic men of all colors whom the gay community has to offer. So you're more likely to talk to that hot Korean guy at the deli. Or that beautiful black man you met at church. Or that scruffy white hipster who keeps giving you the eye whenever you go bar hopping in Williamsburg. Or that hunky Latino who keeps asking you for a spot at the gym. So be glad that the blinders are off and be open to dipping into some different flavors!5. We pretty much invented shade.With all this talk about ""reading"" and ""shade,"" it's probably a good idea to know the origins of the terms, and I promise you that they were in heavy usage long before the Real Housewives started using them in confessionals or drag queens from Chicago started using them on cable TV. If you haven't been introduced to the classic documentary Paris Is Burning, you probably don't know that black gay and trans people were using these terms over 20 years ago. So head over to Netflix immediately to stream it, and don't forget who sent you, hunty. 6. We have an abundance of amazing black gay authors.Any discussion of black gay literature starts with the granddaddy of them all, James Baldwin, and his romantic opus Giovanni's Room, but if that's a bit too retro for you, there are plenty of other authors to choose from. For a romantic gay classic, look no further than James Earl Hardy's B-Boy Blues. If politics is your thing, check out Keith Boykin's seminal Beyond the Down Low: Sex, Lies, and Denial in Black America. For a sexy, funny lark, check the Armani Williams novel Harlem Boyz. And, if you're in the mood for a coming-of-age memoir with a military twist, check out the memoir from yours truly, Closets, Combat and Coming Out. Yes, that was a shameless plug. Deal with it. 7. We know that Harlem is where it's at.Chelsea is over, and Hell's Kitchen is crowded. Luckily, South Harlem is a progressive home to many black gays who mix with -- gasp! -- actual heterosexuals in the many bars, restaurants, and lounges that the neighborhood has to offer. The other hues of gays are finding their way up to Harlem quickly enough, but if you want to see sexy, classy, well-dressed gay black men, South Harlem is the place to be. If you don't believe me, just check out Melba's on Wednesday nights, or lesbian-owned Billie's Black any night.8. Even after all these years, Noah's Arc is still everything.For two seasons on LOGO TV, Noah's Arc reigned supreme and gave gay black men everywhere much-needed representation on prime-time television. Was it a little campy and a bit silly? Absolutely, but that was all a part of its appeal. The fact that, all these years later, there still hasn't been another show like it ensures that it'll be passed on from generation to generation of gay black men who want to see themselves represented as the attractive, successful, fabulous, fantastic people we are. 9. We can call out other black folks for being homophobic... minus the racism.Every once in a while, you come across an article like this that drowns out whatever point it has in the weird and awkward racial biases that the author obviously has. Thankfully, that whole dual-consciousness thing allows us black gays to call out black folks when they're being homophobic, minus any thinly veiled racism that sometimes comes into play when other groups do so. We can look in the mirror and be reminded that homophobia has no color, religion, race, or ethnicity, so we can smack down homophobes with facts, not racist jabs. 10. Black don't crack.No offense to anyone, but black just doesn't crack. It fades, mind you, so one has to be constantly on guard against too many UV rays (yes, we can burn) and the effects of an unhealthy lifestyle, but overall this melanin is a godsend when it comes to slowing down the effects of aging. My 56-year-old father can still pass for a man in his early 40s. If that is what I have to look forward to, well, I'm sticking with loving the skin I'm in. And, no, Shemar Moore isn't gay, but he is 44. Damn, damn, damn. So there are my 10 reasons it's utterly awesome to be a black gay guy. Got more? Feel free to share them in the comments section below!Rob Smith is an author, journalist, and openly gay Iraq war veteran.

Saved by the Bell, the first-ever Saturday-morning sitcom for kids, was not progressive or challenging in any way; there's no mention of ""gay"" or ""lesbian,"" not even in Saved by the Bell: The College Years. I should know: As the co-writer of Bayside! The Musical!, a musical parody of Saved by the Bell, I've seen every episode more times than I'd like to admit. The closest Saved by the Bell came to ""handling social issues"" was Jessie Spano's crippling addiction to caffeine pills so she could study more. Could you imagine a ""very special episode"" where the new kid was a transgender youth? Their heads would probably explode. Saved by the Bell taught me absolutely nothing about gender transition, but co-creating and producing Bayside! has taught me to take big leaps of faith, learn from my mistakes, and believe in myself -- all the tools I needed to come out as transgender several months ago.I'm embarrassed to admit this, but there was a time in my life, about seven years ago, when the subject of transgender people would come up I would get on my righteous (mostly drunken) soapbox and say, ""You're born with a body and gender, and it's up to you to accept and learn to live in that body and gender,"" which sounds like a ""lesson"" one would learn at the end of an episode of Saved by the Bell. It's obvious that the only person I was trying to convince of this ridiculous theory was me. It's not surprising that I was unhappy, abusive with my alcohol and drugs, and ended up trying to kill myself. Luckily, I sucked at suicide. It took me several years to come to terms with my gender dysphoria and start talking about it. I was scared that I was too late in the game. I was 34 years old; how could I make this big of a change now? What would my family think of me? My corporate job? My cats? Creating art (yes, I'm calling a parody musical about Saved by the Bell ""art"" right now) and transitioning have a lot in common. They are both processes that require trust and patience. I had to take huge leaps of faith, like investing my life savings into the musical and letting the HR department at my workplace send out a letter to the entire company detailing my gender transition. I had to let go of the results and let people have their own process around it. I have no control over the reaction of the critics and audiences who come to Bayside! every night, just as I had no control over my mom's reaction when I called to tell her I was transitioning. She handled it with love and acceptance -- A-plus parenting. She actually said, ""You go, girl!"" and then, ""I guess I can't say that anymore?""The most surprising thing about transitioning? Liking my body -- for the first time ever. At night I take off my clothes and look at myself in the mirror. I used to hate my body. I would push and press at it, wanting for something else. I would run millions of miles and starve it down. But I like what I see now. Zack and Kelly and the students of Bayside will never change. I think we like them that way. There's a certain comfort in that. But I will continue to change -- inside and out. It's messy. It's beautiful. It's imperfect in the most perfect way. As far as the future is concerned, in the words of Jessie Spano in the grips of her caffeine-pill addiction, ""I'm so excited! I'm so excited!"" I'm so not scared of what's next.Need help?

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafd096260000e900816085.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The best thing about Tim Cook's coming out was what it was not. It did not come as the result of some sex scandal perhaps involving an employee. It was not an embarrassing disclosure after being caught in some public restroom or a park. It was not a grudging coming out after years of very public denials and the usual ""my personal life is private"" protestations. It did not even come with any grand pretensions to being a catalyst for changing hearts and minds in an acrimonious debate about same-sex marriage or discrimination laws. He was not getting some kind of tech equivalent of a Golden Globe lifetime award and feeling expansive.One cannot even really say Tim Cook ""came out"" for it implies he was in a closet all this time. But actually most people thought he was already out. But now that he has officially confirmed it, the reaction has been fairly ho-hum. There will be no grand boycott of Apple launched by conservatives. Republican senator Ted Cruz told CNBC ""Those are his personal choices. I'll tell you. I love my iPhone. Listen Tim Cook makes personal choices and that's his life."" Tim Cook's coming out was far less dramatic than an Apple product launch. He wrote a moving op-ed and quietly became as the New Yorker puts it ""the most prominent openly gay C.E.O. in history."" It's only fitting that the most prominent openly gay C.E.O. comes from Silicon Valley, from an industry that is famously more live-and-let-live when it came to personal lives, where companies often have LGBT groups. Another Tim, Tim Gill, the founder and chairman of Quark set up the Gill Foundation to fund the gay and lesbian movement. This is where much of workplace protections and rights of gay employees to be treated the same as heterosexual employees were forged. And the Apple CEO's coming out is the fruit of all those endeavours. As he himself wrote ""I've had the good fortune to work at a company that loves creativity and innovation and knows it can only flourish when you embrace people's differences. Not everyone is so lucky."" This apple did not fall very far from the tree.In that sense, Cook's coming out was no great surprise, nor any great risk either to his professional career or to Apple's stock price. But the same would not hold true if the head of some Wall Street investment firm or a big bank decided to come out. In businesses that are far more of an old boys club, coming out would still be a loaded issue. It's unlikely that Cook's coming out will precipitate a great rush out of corporate closets of America's big firms.But there is something to note in this coming out story. We tend to look for gay ""icons"" in the world of culture. We obsess about which film star might or might not be gay or bisexual because we are interested voyeuristically in the sex lives of stars. We speculate about the sexuality of writers because we want to mine their works for nuggets of their personal lives. And to a lesser extent we think about the sexuality of sportsfigures either because it's so unexpected (a footballer) or stereotypical (a diver) or so not-news (Martina Navratilova).And all of these people resist those labels because they do not want to become the gay writer, the gay actor, the gay musician or the gay sportsperson. They do want their lives to be seen through that prism and only that prism. And they come out when they are either past their prime like a Ricky Martin or completely secure like an Elton John. Or like Freddie Mercury or Rock Hudson, are outed by disease. Or it's only an exceptional event that tends to push them out in front. Vikram Seth, a man famously guarded about his privacy decided to appear on the cover of India Today because he thought his stature could help the fight against Section 377 which criminalizes gay sex in India. But while Tim Cook will no doubt be embraced as a gay role model by LGBT groups, he will not be a gay CEO in quite the same way as a writer might worry about being branded a gay writer. As an actor or a writer, the worry is whether the public will be able to see beyond the sexuality in the work they produce.In that sense his coming out, while quieter and less flashy than a showbiz coming out, matters far more. It is the coming out most gay persons want. It adds another layer to what we know about them without defining his persona and colouring his work. Cook makes no apology for being gay. In fact he calls it ""God's greatest gift"" because it made him more empathetic. But he is neither militant about it, nor defensive. It's not his cross to bear. That actually has a resonance that we are unused to in coming out narratives.We tend to look for our out celebrities in the arts and culture because we think culture is the true game-changer. But Cook's coming out reminds us that gays and lesbians are in all kinds of professions. When leaders of companies that make iron and steel, detergents and tea, cell phones and clothing, decide to be open about their sexuality and then just go back to work as usual it makes for a powerful statement about the need to judge people by the work they do, not their sexuality.And ultimately that's all any of us really want. To be recognized for the work we do every day and not discriminated against because of the person we fall in love with. And Tim Cook is no exception. As the CEO of Apple, Cook knows that he will be judged by iPhone and iPad not iGay. And that's exactly how it should be.A version of this blog originally appeared on Firstpost.com."

The deposed president of Burkina Faso, Blaise Compaore, is 'in a safe place' and his 'safety and well-being are assured', Colonel Isaac Zida, second in command of the presidential guard, said on November 1st. Zida, who had just declared himself head of state, told journalists that Compaore, who resigned on October 31, and his chief of staff 'are in a safe place and their safety and well-being are assured.' AFP PHOTO / ISSOUF SANOGO (Photo credit should read ISSOUF SANOGO/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14086240000d30b51b46b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Mathieu Bonkougou and Nadoun CoulibalyOUAGADOUGOU, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Burkina Faso's opposition parties and the African Union rejected the army's seizure of power in the West African country on Saturday after the resignation of President Blaise Compaore, setting the stage for fresh protests.The military top brass named Lieutenant Colonel Isaac Zida, deputy commander of the elite presidential guard, as head of state on Saturday. A power struggle within the armed forces was resolved by sidelining the chief of staff.Zida, who has operational control over the army's best trained and equipped unit, had declared himself interim president in an early morning radio address, overruling military chief General Honore Traore's claim to lead a transitional government following Compaore's departure.One of Africa's long-serving rulers, Compaore stepped down on Friday after two days of mass demonstrations against his attempts to change the constitution to extend his 27 years in power. At least three people were killed after protesters stormed the parliament building and set it on fire.On the dusty streets of Ouagadougou, the capital, protesters voiced anger that they had driven out Compaore - who seized power in a 1987 military coup - only to have another soldier imposed on them.""The victory of the popular uprising - and consequently the management of the transition - belongs to the people and should not in any way be confiscated by the army,"" a coalition of opposition parties and civil society groups said in a statement after talks on Saturday.""Our consultation reaffirmed that this transition should be democratic and civilian in character,"" it said, announcing a demonstration in the vast Place de la Nation for Sunday morning.The unfolding crisis in the poor, landlocked nation is being closely watched by the United States and former colonial power France, which were close military allies of Compaore. Under his rule, Burkina Faso became a key ally in operations against al Qaeda-linked groups in West Africa.The United States could freeze military cooperation if it judges a coup has taken place. Washington on Friday urged a peaceful transition to elections, respecting constitutional rules.Under Burkina Faso's 1991 constitution, the head of parliament should take office if the president resigns, with a mandate to organize elections within 90 days. However, the army has dissolved the legislature and suspended the constitution.In a statement issued by military leaders after meeting to appoint Zida to power, they said the form and duration of the transition would be decided in consultation with all sections of society. Troops loyal to Zida patrolled the quiet streets of Ouagadougou on Saturday following his early morning radio announcement that he was taking over as head of state to avoid a descent into anarchy and to ensure a democratic transition.""This is not a coup d'etat but a popular uprising,"" Zida said, dressed in military fatigues, in the studio of BF1 television. ""I salute the memory of the martyrs of this uprising and bow to the sacrifices made by our people.""He appealed for the African Union and West African regional bloc ECOWAS to show their support for the transition.But, in a strongly worded statement, the African Union called for the military to hand power over to civilian authorities. It said the Peace and Security Council -- the arm of the 54-nation bloc that imposes sanctions for violations of democratic process -- would discuss the situation on Monday.""The Chairperson of the (African Union) Commission ... stresses the duty and obligation of the defense and security forces to place themselves at the disposal of the civilian authorities who should lead the transition,"" read the statement. COMPAORE IN IVORY COASTIn the Place de la Nation, the epicenter of this week's massive demonstrations, many people voiced anger at what they saw as an attempt by the military to subvert their uprising.""It's ridiculous. It's just replacing Blaise with a little Blaise,"" said Frederic Ouedraogo. ""The presidential guard opened fire on the crowd. If were able to get rid of Blaise, then he (Zida) will not be able to stop us. He is going to go, too!""The events in Burkina Faso will also be carefully followed by other governments in West and Central Africa. Several long-serving leaders are reaching the end of their constitutional terms in several countries in the region, including Benin, Congo Republic and Democratic Republic of Congo.The government of neighboring Ivory Coast said on Saturday that Compaore had arrived there with his family and entourage but did not specify his location. Military sources said he was staying at a presidential retreat in the coastal resort of Assinie, to the east of the economic capital, Abidjan.It was the seventh time that a military officer had taken over as head of state in Burkina Faso since it won independence from France in 1960. It was previously known as Upper Volta.Troops loyal to Zida deployed at strategic points across the capital on Saturday night, though an evening curfew was pushed back by three hours to 2200 GMT. The airport was also reopened. Land borders remained closed.Despite being one of the world's poorest nations, Burkina Faso positioned itself as a key mediator in regional crises under the stewardship of the imposing Compaore, popularly known as 'Handsome Blaise', who was renowned as a skilled negotiator and a wily, ruthless politician.A taciturn former soldier who had survived several bids to oust him after he seized power in a 1987 military coup, Compaore initially sought to defy the calls for him to step down once the protests turned violent on Thursday.Diplomats said Compaore - widely blamed for the death of his friend, the leftwing revolutionary Thomas Sankara, in the 1987 coup - was alarmed at the possibility of prosecution on rights charges if he left office.But his bid to cling to the presidency - and its lavish trappings - angered many young people in a country stagnating in 183rd place out of 186 countries on the U.N. human development index. With an average age of less than 18, most of the country's 17 million population have never known another leader.Crowds danced, cheered and blew whistles in Place de la Nation on Friday after Compaore's resignation, before the army announced it was taking charge.""This is a 'sub-Saharan Spring' and it must continue against all the presidents who are trying to hang on to power in Africa,"" said law student Lucien Trinnou on Friday, referring to the Arab Spring that toppled several long-term leaders.

It's pitch-black, except for the faint light at the end of the corridor, which leads upstairs to Nana's house. This illumination is my sunrise every morning. As my foot touches the cold tiled floor, I arrive at my early morning sanctuary. I turn left into the kitchen and see the little old lady cooking breakfast: delicious grits, cheesy yellow eggs, crispy, tangy veggie patties. This daily routine brings new conversations, new stories, and more lessons.At 13, I bring her my latest complaint: mom babies me too much by driving me to school. Nana just nods. When I finished my ranting, my grandmother asks if I want to hear a story. ""When I was a little girl, even younger than you, I used to have these flatties. My two sisters and I all had the same size shoes.""What do shoes have to do with this?""In those flat shoes, the three of us walked the entire three and a half miles to and from school daily. In those days, Scotland County had no busing for black students. We lived across town from the black schools. On those long, 90-degree summer-like days, we walked. Feet burning from our flatties, school clothes near ruined from sweating up a storm, but nonetheless, happy to make it to school and learn some more and happy to be alive. An opportunity not many blacks had in the South."" I was speechless. From that day on, my grandmother's story has always remained with me. As a point guard, I must see the game from everyone's angle and encourage everyone to appreciate their opportunity. Nana's story provides the model for me to do this. In my first high school JV game, I felt like I couldn't miss a shot, but my teammates played as if they were in the bleachers. I looked up at the scoreboard; we were losing. One man can't make a team. So I became a general on the court, spreading the ball around. Everyone found opportunity. We won. Nana's stories help me to value opportunities. When I was 16, I was nominated for People to People. I needed to raise money for this opportunity to travel across Europe with 20 other students for 20 days. By spring, after a long winter of work, I had raised the $4,000 for the trip. I did odd jobs like shoveling snow, taking out my neighbor's trash, and created a website to sell eccentric rubber bracelets. Everything was set to go; I was to represent America as a teenage liaison and also tour Cannes, Italy, visit the remarkable Monte Carlo, and explore Barcelona. Then a bubbling apprehension began to boil over me the closer we neared the summer. Every day I wondered if I was actually ready for this trip. I had never traveled without my parents and this would be my first trip outside the United States. I feared the language barrier and I knew nothing about the Spanish homestay family. The fact that my money and effort would be lost did not drive me to overcome my fears as much as Nana's story.I had to go, considering the story of that little girl in the South who only knew Florence as a city in South Carolina. I would be a kid from Brooklyn seeing parts of the world some members of my family didn't even know existed. Without Nana's story, my perspective would have been completely different. Sometimes, I think back on that little girl in the small town, 65 years ago. She seized her opportunity and never looked back. Well, my opportunity is coming, and I've learned from my mistakes. The only time I'm looking back is over my shoulder to see that little girl's face--smiling at me.

For once, the debate gripping Washington is not about party politics. It's about the White House fence. Is it high enough? Should it be electrified? Are tourists allowed to get too close to the building? After a series of security lapses that raised questions about the safety of the US president, do authorities need to change or reconsider the fence surrounding the First Family's residence in the heart of the city? But the spectacular breach that saw an Iraq war veteran sprint across the White House lawn in mid-September and enter the building with a knife in his pocket has rattled the US Secret Service, which is tasked with protecting the president.

Secret Service agents questioned the man after he drew attention by recording images of the president with a camera in the elevator. Officials then ran a background check that revealed prior arrests in his history.The change is significant because one day after the Post and the Washington Examiner published reports on the incident on September 30, Secret Service director Julia Pierson resigned.

Marine Le Pen, the French shock winner in the European elections, has come to the home of the European Union, the organization she blames for undermining France's economy, hamstringing its sovereignty and flooding it with immigrants. The National Front leader was searching Wednesday for enough like-minded fellow members of the European Parliament to form a parliamentary group, a step that would guarantee it more speaking time and allow it to benefit from administrative and financial support. Le Penâs party came out on top in Sundayâs elections, and will be sending Franceâs largest contingent to the European Parliament.

According to our information, Marine Le Pen's National Front (FN) now counts 83,000 fully paid-up members who are eligible to vote at the party's convention on November 29 and 30. That is twice the number claimed by the far-right party at the start of 2012.An internal source in the far-right party says the figure represents, ""give or take a few hundred"", the electorate that is eligible to elect the president of the FN at its triennial convention. The figure was finalized on Oct. 31 before a bailiff, but another list will be added between now and Nov. 24.While the UMP and the Socialist Party (PS) have seen a rapid erosion of members since 2012, the National Front has made new gains, although it officially remains the third party in France in terms of the number of members in good standing. In comparison, 268,341 UMP members are eligible to vote for the conservative party's next president. A little less than 29,000 can vote for Jean-Louis Borloo's successor at the helm of the UDI. As for the PS, undermined by the left's unpopularity in power, it reports a list of 160,000 members in good standing.100 percent more members than at the start of 2012While Nicolas Sarkozy hopes to rekindle membership growth once he is elected president of the UMP, the membership trend currently favors the far-right party. On its website, the FN has long boasted 75,000 ""members and supporters"", a well-overestimated figure that has been disproven several times by statements from its executives and the official vote tallies at its conventions.At its January 2011 convention in Tours, Le Pen was elected president of the FN with 11,546 votes versus only 5,522 for Bruno Gollnish. The electorate totaled 22,000 members. Since then, this figure has grown continuously. In 2012, the party's general secretary Steeve Briois reported 40,000 members in good standing.Near the end of 2012, at the height of the UMP's internal crisis, Marion Maréchal-Le Pen said that the FN had seen an ""explosion of memberships"" with nearly ""600 new members a day"". Between the first round of the presidential election, which had rallied members, and the UMP's meltdown, the National Front claimed to have gone from 50,000 to 61,000 members.With 83,000 members in November 2014, the extreme-right party is reaping the rewards of its long work to establish a local presence, which saw it garner very good results in both the municipal and European elections. With less than a month to go before the convention, Marine Le Pen can be assured of her reelection (she is the only candidate): since her arrival at the head of the party, the number of members has increased by more than 300 percent.

The ""snowbirds"" that come down for the winter season leave their homes closed up, not even a vehicle is left in the driveway. Very eerie feeling to see so many developments like this in a city. Surrea to be sure. This location is right next door to the hotel I am staying at in Yuma off the 4th Avenue area south of 24th Street.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb315b1240000310055bfd9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The U.S. federal poverty line has been determined using the same general framework since the mid-1960s. In that time, the official measure has come under criticism as an inadequate way to measure the number of people truly in need.In 1995, a National Academy of Sciences panel made recommendations for how an alternative poverty measure could be developed. Since then, the Census Bureau has worked in partnership with the Bureau of Labor Statistics to further these recommendations. The result was the supplemental poverty measure, which produces state level poverty rates that differ considerably from the official poverty measures.Compared to Mississippi’s official poverty rate of 20.7% between 2011 and 2013, the supplemental poverty rate was more than five percentage points lower during that time. In California, the supplemental poverty rate was 7.4 percentage points higher and, at 23.4%, the highest in the nation. Based on recently released data from the Census Bureau, these are the states where poverty is worse than you think.Click here to see all 10 states.In an interview with 24/7 Wall St., Sheldon Danziger, president of the Russell Sage Foundation, said “It’s been common wisdom among researchers since at least the 1970s that we should rethink the official poverty measure.” Danziger added that the supplementary measure improves understanding of poverty by including items such as the earned income tax credit and food stamp benefits.Kathleen Short, economist at the Census Bureau and author of its report on the supplemental poverty measure, explained, “The important feature of that measure is that it includes a lot of the non-cash benefits that we have in the United States to help families with low incomes.” Short added that this is useful for policymakers because it allows them “to get a better idea of how effective our safety net is for helping people.”One of the primary differences between the supplemental poverty measure and the official one is housing costs. The supplemental measure is adjusted to reflect local housing costs, whereas the official poverty measure is not. According to Short, this is one of the major factors that can push up poverty rates in many states under the supplemental measure.In fact, of the 10 states with the highest increases in poverty under the supplemental poverty measure, eight also had among the 10 highest costs of living. Further, in seven of these states, the relative cost of renting an apartment was also among the 10 highest nationally. The two states with the largest increases in poverty under the supplemental measure — California and Hawaii — were also the top two states in terms of the cost of renting a home.Still, the role of non-cash benefits programs is very important in shaping the supplemental poverty levels in many states. For example, in many of these states residents are far less likely to receive an earned income tax credit. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) estimates that 79% of eligible Americans filing tax returns received a credit in the 2010 tax year, the most recent year for which data is available. However, in many of the states where poverty is most undercounted, the percentage of eligible filers receiving a credit is far lower. In Nevada, just 71.5% claimed their credit, while in California just 71% did, among the lowest rates in the U.S.High levels of out-of-pocket medical expenses are also a factor contributing to higher supplemental poverty levels in many states. In fact, according to the Census Bureau, 11 million Americans fall into poverty under the supplemental measure because of these expenses, more than for any other reason. While some states where the poor are undercounted have high rates of health insurance coverage, others do not. Notably, in Nevada and Florida, 20.7% and 20% of the states’ populations were uninsured, respectively, as of 2013. These were the second- and third-highest rates in the nation.In addition to the huge role played by out-of-pocket medical costs, Beth Mattingly, director of research on vulnerable families at the Carsey School of Public Policy, identified work-related costs as another expenditure that leads many families to struggle. Mattingly said that much of these costs are related to transportation, which can be high for people who live in cities, as well as in rural areas. In cities, “to take the train, then take the bus, it really adds up,” Mattingly said. Yet, in more rural areas, long drives, and the wear-and-tear on vehicles can also increase costs.In order to determine the 10 states where poverty is worse than you think, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed data from the Census Bureau’s recent release, “The Supplemental Poverty Measure: 2013.” We then ranked states on the difference between the supplemental poverty and the official poverty measure. The supplemental measure uses an updated definition of households, as well as poverty thresholds that incorporate area housing costs. Further, while the official poverty rate is calculated using gross before-tax cash income, the supplemental measure is adjusted for noncash benefits, taxes and tax credits, work expenses, out-of-pocket medical costs and child support payments.Data on Social Security, cash public assistance, Supplemental Security Income, SNAP benefits — or food stamps — and other factors included in measuring the social safety net are from the Census Bureau’s 2013 American Community Survey. Data on Unemployment Insurance claims are from the Department of Labor. Data on Earned Income Tax Credits are from the IRS. EITC participation rates are as of the 2010 tax year, while average EITC amounts are for the 2013 tax year. Figures on regional price parities — representing the differences in cost of living and cost of rent — are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis for 2012.These are the states where poverty is worse than you think."

For Día de Muertos, friends and family will visit his home, and he'll stop by theirs, to pray for the dead and the living.Hundreds of miles away in New York City, Courtney Weber, a Wiccan priestess, will at the same time be preparing a celebration for Samhain, an ancient Celtic holiday of death and renewal, when modern witches and neopagans pay tribute to their ancestors and the dead.Meanwhile, in Canton, Georgia, pastor Cyndi Parr of Faith Presbyterian Church is organizing the first All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day service at her congregation, where she'll read aloud the dozens of names of deceased congregation members and their family members as part of a prayer service.Death is in the spiritual air these days, across faiths and cultures.Catholics -- and some Protestants -- are observing All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day, by visiting graves and praying for the departed. All Saints takes place on Saturday, and as one might expect, is meant to celebrate the saints. All Souls, on Sunday, is for Catholics a day to pray for every soul, particularly those in purgatory who are waiting to get into heaven. Both have historically influenced Halloween, and both rose in part out of Samhain, which pre-dates Christianity. In Mexico, and among Latin American communities elsewhere, Día de Muertos (also Día de los Muertos), or ""the Day of the Dead,"" and related celebrations take a colorful, festive and sometimes humorous angle on All Souls and All Saints. One tradition is for families to share funny stories and poems about the dead, such as those that focus on relatives' quirky habits.These intricately connected traditions are not the only ones permeating homes and places of worship with thoughts of mortality as November begins.Muslims have been coming together since last week in majlises, late-night prayer and study gatherings during Muharram, one of the holiest Islamic months and one that's particularly meaningful for Shias. The month peaks with the day of Ashura on Tuesday. An intense time of spiritual mourning for the seventh-century martyrdom of Hussain ibn Ali, the grandson of the Islamic prophet Mohammad, the holiday observes his death with prayer, inner reflection and, among some, self-flagellation.In late November, Sikhs will remember the martyrdom of one of their own revered: the ninth Guru Tegh Bahadur, who was executed in the 17th-century for standing up to the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb for religious freedom.""Death seems to be integral to the theology and celebrations of every culture and religion, and it comes out over and over again in the fall,"" said John Troyer, the deputy director of the Center for Death and Society at the University of Bath, west of London. ""Part of it has to do with this time of year, since earlier agrarian civilizations were structured around the changing of seasons. But in other traditions, there's a particular event that has taken a huge historical importance that's being observed.""The purposes of the holidays and observations also vary.For Beltran, a student at Milwaukee Area Technical College, Día de Muertos is mainly about ""remembering and not forgetting,"" he said. After 11 years in the United States, it's also a ritual that keeps him connected to his Mexican culture.Weber, 33, thinks people can be too scared of death, and looks at Samhain as a way challenge that. ""It's nothing to fear, but is a sacred mystery,"" said the priestess, who works at Auburn Theological Seminary as an events and trainings manager. ""We honor people to honor that sacred mystery, but not be fearful of it.""While the holiday runs through Saturday, Weber's event will take place later in the week at Catland, an occult bookstore in Brooklyn, where Weber has organized a ""celebration of life being brief and beautiful."" At a time of year considered to be one when there's a thinning of the veil between life and death, Weber and her companions will be drumming, singing and lighting candles around a community altar throughout the night. In Georgia, Parr said she also wants to honor those who came before her in faith and in the church community. After asking the 50-member church to submit names of loved ones two weeks ago, she's amassed nearly the same number to read from the pulpit on Sunday. Her sermon will touch upon the ""great cloud of witness"" -- members of the church and faith who have died -- and will reflect on the notion that ""everything we learn through the year, we build upon,"" she said. ""Everything we have today is because of the inventions and spirit of our ancestors.""She hopes to use the occasion to put into context the current issues being discussed among Christians, such as same-sex marriage. ""I want to remind people that we are in a continuum. We are part of a chain reaction, and we have to honor how we, as well as our theology, has changed over the years,"" she said.""So just like we are not burning people at the stake anymore, and maybe we are not sending black people to separate schools anymore,"" she said, ""we have to think about how our practices and views of faith can change for the better today."""
