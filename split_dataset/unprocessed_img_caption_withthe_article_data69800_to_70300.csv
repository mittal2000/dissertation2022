0,POLITICS,Ted Cruz May Be Right In His Fight Against Marco Rubio. But That Just Makes Him A Petty Politician.,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ted-cruz-marco-rubio-immigration_us_56733cf2e4b0b958f6560230,The only person who knows Ted Cruz's true beliefs on immigration is probably Ted Cruz.,2015-12-18,Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) is defending his past immigration statements as he campaigns for the presidential nomination.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56734401160000d400eb92c3.jpeg?cache=6L2xVzAc4e&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The easiest way to summarize the ongoing skirmish over Republican presidential candidate and Sen. Ted Cruz's immigration position is this: A politician very likely misled people. The question is when. The Texas senator has been under fire for weeks from fellow candidate and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who pointed out that Cruz, seemingly in earnest, indicated he was open to legal status for undocumented immigrants in 2013 and even introduced an amendment he claimed would help create it. The question now, as reporters and strategists pore over transcripts and interviews two and a half years old, is whether Cruz meant it at the time. One school of thought, pushed by Cruz's campaign, is that he was offering a poison pill amendment all along. Another is that Cruz meant what he said then -- for political reasons or genuine ones -- but has since changed his mind, now holding what is a more palatable stance for the Republican base. ""I have never supported legalization, and I do not intend to support legalization,"" Cruz said during Tuesday's GOP debate on CNN, after being challenged on the point by Rubio.He doubled down on this in a Wednesday evening interview with Fox News' Bret Baier.""What that amendment did is it revealed the hypocrisy of [New York Democratic Sen.] Chuck Schumer and the Senate Democrats and the establishment Republicans who are supporting them because they all voted against it,"" Cruz said. How capable Cruz is in selling this as his true intent could very well determine his fate in the Republican presidential primary. But it won't be easy for the Texas Republican. Either he is misrepresenting his previous stance, or he is admitting that in the past, he repeatedly claimed to be trying to improve a bill he was actually trying to sink by proposing something he now says he never supported. It's not an easy sell. ""He's reinventing the past, and we're supposed to believe his lying words today rather than his lying words from back then?"" said longtime immigration advocate Frank Sharry of America's Voice. ""I believe what he said then, I believe what he's saying now, because it's all manufactured bullshit.""As an aide familiar with the 2013 negotiations put it, the idea of a senator offering an amendment that he himself opposes is ""absolutely nuts."" ""We would never send our boss in to go kill a bill with policy that he doesn't like,"" said the aide, who requested anonymity to speak about the private negotiations. ""That's basically what he's saying he's doing: 'I hate this so much that I made an amendment out of it and offered it to kill the bill.' That makes no sense."" None of that is to say definitively that Cruz supported legal status then, or that he supported the Gang of Eight bill -- he was outspoken in his opposition to a path to citizenship. In fact, one top Senate Democratic aide said it is ""110 percent"" true that Cruz offered his amendment knowing that Democrats wouldn’t go for it and as a means of framing them as resolutely committed to a pathway to citizenship. ""Which we were,"" the aide added. Rubio's campaign can try to muddy the water by noting similarities in their statements. But when it comes to votes, the fact remains that Cruz opposed immigration reform, and Rubio helped to pass it. Still, other than current-day recollections and some old press clippings, the Cruz campaign hasn't offered much proof that the senator never actually believed in his amendment, other than to say it was meant as a poison pill (something Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the Senate's foremost immigration hawk, agreed with).Asked for comment, the campaign pointed to Cruz's comments at a Judiciary hearing -- likely the May 21, 2013, one where he offered the amendment, although the spokeswoman did not specify. At that time, Cruz was offering one of his amendments to the so-called ""Gang of Eight"" comprehensive immigration reform bill, which Rubio helped to draft. The bill would have allowed certain undocumented immigrants to gain eventual citizenship, but Cruz wanted to amend it so they would be blocked from naturalization. Still, he spoke sympathetically about the need for undocumented immigrants to come out of the shadows. Cruz acknowledged that the committee would probably vote down his amendment, but he insisted that approving it would be beneficial for the legislation's chances of making it to the president's desk. ""I don't want immigration reform to fail,"" he said at a markup. ""I want immigration reform to pass.""  He made statements to that effect outside of the committee room as well. On May 28, 2013, the Washington Examiner's Byron York asked Cruz whether he bought ""into this whole legalization idea."" ""Legalization is the predicate of the Gang of Eight bill,"" Cruz said, according to a recording York posted of the conversation. ""And in introducing amendments, what I endeavored to do was improve that bill so that it actually fixes the problem."" Supporters of immigration reform didn't buy the argument that his amendment would make the bill better. Immediately after Cruz finished his speech in support of the measure, then-Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said he was concerned that it would ""gut the bill"" and destroy ""a very careful balance by Republicans and Democrats who sponsored it.""Schumer, one of the bill's authors, then said that if Cruz's amendment was adopted, it wouldn't pass the Senate. ""If we don't have a path to citizenship, there is no reform, many of us feel. ... This is the heart of the bill,"" he said. All this suggests that Democrats and other supporters of the bill at the time saw Cruz's amendment as nothing more than a gambit designed to produce a spectacle, not actual policy. In that vein, the amendment can be considered a poison pill because it went directly against the actual legislation. Ultimately, it didn't end up being a threat to its passage. The Judiciary Committee voted it down 13 to 5, with three Republicans voting against it: Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, and Gang of Eight members Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jeff Flake of Arizona. That all three of those Republicans were supportive (at the time, at least) of comprehensive immigration reform suggests that they, too, viewed Cruz's amendment as subterfuge.The full bill later passed the Senate 68 to 32, with Cruz opposing and Rubio supporting it. Rubio has since backed away from the bill, saying that reform must be done piece by piece.At this point, Rubio and Cruz have definitively different views on how to deal with undocumented immigrants. Rubio reaffirmed at Tuesday's debate that he is open to allowing them to eventually become citizens, albeit at the tail end of a lengthy process of buffing up enforcement and border security. Cruz has veered even further right into the mass-expulsion wing, and said more firmly that he does not support legal status for undocumented immigrants. In summary: Did Cruz seem to be engaged in a genuine effort to improve the bill? Not really. Did he paint himself as a supporter of legal status for undocumented immigrants? Absolutely. Did he mean it? Probably not. But to admit that, he'd have to say that he was acting like one of the conniving, insidery politicians he often laments on the campaign trail.

The commonwealth will default on its debt in January or May, said Puerto Rican Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla on Wednesday.Attempting to address the crisis before the new year, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) tried to secure unanimous consent for a vote on legislation that would have temporarily protected Puerto Rico from being sued by creditors until Congress acts. “The Puerto Rico Emergency Financial Stability Act would protect the 3.5 million Americans who call Puerto Rico home from economic catastrophe while Congress advances a more comprehensive solution to the Commonwealth’s financial emergency,"" Pelosi said. ""The bill would give Puerto Rico temporary but essential breathing room from creditor lawsuits until Congress can act.""As expected, Pelosi's symbolic tactic failed, and consent was not granted for a vote. Minutes later, the House voted on final passage of the omnibus bill, which passed with the help of 166 Democrats. In a small meeting with reporters ahead of the omnibus vote, Pelosi said Democrats made one more ""last-ditch effort"" to include something in the bill that would address the debt crisis in Puerto Rico.But Republican leaders weren't having any of it. Instead, to woo more House Democrats to vote for the omnibus, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) instructed relevant committees to work with the Puerto Rican government to find a solution. ""While we could not agree to including precedent-setting changes to bankruptcy law in this omnibus spending bill, I understand that many members on both sides of the aisle remain committed to addressing the challenges facing the territory,"" Ryan said in a statement earlier this week.Pelosi said the first hearing will be held the day Congress returns in January. Ryan also promised to ""take action on restructuring legislation by March 31,"" she said. ""I feel confident that he will follow up on it,"" Pelosi added.But after the House passed the omnibus bill with no aid for Puerto Rico attached, reality sunk in. Garcia Padilla blamed Congress for allowing the situation on the island to ""unfold into chaos."" ""After weeks of crippling lobbying by Wall Street, Congress denied fairness and due process -- which costs nothing to the U.S. taxpayers,"" Padilla said on Friday. ""I will hold Speaker Ryan to his public declaration that Congress will reach a solution by the end of March, which must include broad, comprehensive restructuring authority and an economic growth plan,"" he added.Also on HuffPost:"
5,POLITICS,How The Fed May Have Just Made It Harder For Democrats To Take The White House,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-fed-democrats-white-house_us_56734258e4b014efe0d4db23,And there's nothing any of the candidates can do about it.,2015-12-18,"Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen held a news conference after the Fed announced that it was raising its key interest rate on Dec. 16, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5673456b160000d400eb92c7.jpeg?cache=BkCl99uE15&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Federal Reserve’s decision to raise its key interest rate on Wednesday could hurt the Democratic Party’s chances of winning the presidency in 2016 by beginning a process that will slow down the economy.It is hard to believe that the Fed influences voters, given that the vast majority of Americans have no idea who Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen is.But inasmuch as Fed policy weakens or boosts the economy, it can have a big impact on voters’ calculus -- even if they don’t know it.“The significant variable is not the rate hikes, but their effect on the strength of the economy,” said Larry Sabato, director of the center for politics at the University of Virginia.History has shown that Americans are more likely to vote for the incumbent party in a presidential election if they think that the sitting president is doing a good job. A number of factors can contribute to public opinions of a president, including terror attacks and scandals, but the performance of the economy is near the top of the list.If the economy is doing well, it can lift a president’s approval rating and help the candidate from his party vying to replace him. Conversely, if the public turns on the commander-in-chief over a souring economy, it can hurt the candidate from his party.Just ask John McCain, who ran and lost while fellow Republican George W. Bush was president. His candidacy foundered after Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008, marking the onset of the most devastating financial crisis since the Great Depression.The Pew Research Center notes that “what had essentially been a deadlocked contest between McCain and Obama before the Lehman meltdown turned into a solid lead for Obama in the weeks that followed.” Even media coverage of McCain started becoming more negative.A similar phenomenon was at play in the respective defeats of Gerald Ford in 1976, Jimmy Carter in 1980 and George H.W. Bush in 1992, according to Sabato.He even argues that it contributed to Richard Nixon's loss in 1960 and Al Gore's defeat in 2000, though Sabato noted that in those cases, ""a hundred separate factors made the tiny difference.""Brad Miller, a Democrat who represented North Carolina in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2003 to 2013 and is now a financial regulatory policy analyst at the Roosevelt Institute, describes witnessing that dynamic over the course of his career. “People vote on the economy along the lines that you should always change a losing game and not a winning game -- just do something different if it is not working,” Miller said.Since President Barack Obama is in the White House through 2016, a proverbial losing game would hurt Democrats the most.But whether the Fed will raise the influential federal funds rate enough to tip the scales against Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, the two leading Democratic presidential hopefuls, depends a lot on what the Fed does next -- or how accurate Fed officials' predictions prove to be.The federal funds rate is how much banks charge one another for overnight lending. It serves as a benchmark for almost all credit, giving it major power to affect the economy.The Fed raises the federal funds rate, as it did Wednesday, to increase borrowing costs and slow the economic growth rate when it believes the pace of job creation risks prompting excessive price inflation.Even critics of Wednesday’s decision conceded that the initial quarter-percentage-point increase will not in itself put major downward pressure on job creation.But the move lays the groundwork for more significant increases in the coming year. Fed officials project that inflation will rise enough for them to raise the rate to 1.4 percent by the end of 2016.Moody’s Analytics estimates that an increase in the federal funds rate of 1 percentage point over the coming year would reduce economic growth in 2017 by 0.15 percent, resulting in the creation of some 30,000 fewer jobs per month.Josh Bivens, a Fed watcher at the progressive Economic Policy Institute, and a critic of Wednesday's rate increase, is even more pessimistic. He estimates that if the Fed raises the federal funds rate at the pace that Fed officials believe will be necessary, it will slow economic growth in a meaningful way by the time of the November election.“An increase of 0 to 1.4 percent would have a noticeable effect on the economy,” Bivens said.The Fed's top officials, including most of the members of the committee charged with adjusting interest rates, believe that the economy will grow enough to begin accelerating inflation in the meantime to a degree that will justify the gradual rate increases and offset their potential contractionary effects. Yellen said herself on Wednesday that if inflation does not rise as rapidly as they expect, they can hold off on additional increases.Jared Bernstein, an expert in labor market trends at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, and the former chief economist for Vice President Joe Biden, has similar concerns to Bivens, but believes Yellen in particular will base her decisions on data to avoid making a “mistake” that affects the economy that adversely.Bernstein hopes Wednesday’s rate hike, which he believes was not data-driven in light of below-target inflation, was an exception.“It erodes my confidence a bit,” Bernstein said. “I hope chair Yellen was managing” the concerns of more inflation-wary colleagues at the Fed, “not following the data.”Another thing Bernstein said he finds reassuring is the Fed’s tendency to avoid raising rates too close to an election so as not to cast aspersions on its political independence.“You certainly don’t want Janet Yellen helping Donald Trump -- or otherwise playing a role in the election -- and they don’t want that either,” he noted.Regardless, the mere pivot away from rock-bottom interest rates should worry Democrats, according to Ari Rabin-Havt, a former Democratic presidential campaign strategist who now hosts The Agenda, a progressive talk radio show on Sirius XM.“If you are Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, the last thing you want is the Fed intentionally slowing down the economy, especially in light of the fact that despite some solid numbers, the labor market is already weak,” Rabin-Havt said.Also on HuffPost:"
6,BLACK VOICES,Why The Fed's Rate Hike Will Hit Black People Harder Than Whites,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fed-rate-hike-african-americans_us_567447fee4b06fa6887d2552,Unemployment is twice as bad for black people as it is for white people. This isn't going to help.,2015-12-18,"A Chrysler employee works on the assembly line making the new Jeep Grand Cherokee at the Chrysler Jefferson Avenue Plant, May 21, 2010, in Detroit.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/567454aa1f0000c000e9c2c8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Federal Reserve’s decision to raise its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday is bad news for black workers.The move is expected to put downward pressure on job creation by raising borrowing costs throughout the economy. While the rate hike is a modest measure on its own, it sets the stage for a series of additional developments that stand to have a much bigger contractionary effect on the economy.That will squeeze all American workers, since there will be less demand for their work and they won't have as much leverage when it comes to setting wages. But it will be especially bad for African-Americans.The unemployment rate among black people in the U.S. is generally about twice as high as the unemployment rate for white people. As of the end of November, the unemployment rate for African-Americans was 9.4 percent, compared with a rate of just 4.3 percent for whites.This means that any time the overall unemployment rate declines, it disproportionately benefits black workers -- and any time national unemployment goes up, it disproportionately hurts them. The progressive Center for Economic and Policy Research created a visualization tool in October to illustrate this phenomenon. CEPR focused on how black unemployment would fall relative to white unemployment if the Federal Reserve allowed the economy to grow unfettered by not raising the interest rate.Since black unemployment is twice as high as white unemployment, it means that every time white unemployment declines by 1 percentage point, black unemployment declines by 2 percentage points.CEPR also looked at the relationship between white unemployment and black teen unemployment, which is typically six times the overall white rate. Thus, every decline of 1 percentage point in white joblessness is accompanied by a drop of 6 percentage points in black teen unemployment.It's important to note that the disparity between black and white unemployment does not correspond to educational attainment.William Spriggs, the chief economist of the AFL-CIO, who has done some of the pioneering research on the African-American labor market, notes that in previous growth periods, the unemployment rate for black college graduates was roughly equal to the rate for white Americans with associate degrees.Right now, though, the disparity is even greater: Black college graduates are unemployed at roughly the same rate as white high school graduates. ""Under their own abilities and own efforts, the best that blacks can do, the unemployment rate is the lowest that black people can get it,"" Spriggs told The Huffington Post.Spriggs and other scholars have concluded that the higher rate of black unemployment is due to discrimination. ""The only solution that African-Americans have is a very tight labor market that raises the cost of discrimination,"" he said.The kind of ""tight"" labor market Spriggs describes would only be possible if the Fed allowed unemployment to drop before raising its key rate. In such a scenario, the theory goes, employers' demand for workers would become so great that they could no longer afford to discriminate against black job applicants.Spriggs emphasized that caring about the plight of black and Latino workers is in all of Americans' interest. He called workers of color the ""canary in the coal mine.""""This recovery has been fueled by auto sales, disproportionately to black and Latino consumers in subprime loans with unfavorable terms,"" he said. ""The moment they lose their jobs, they will lose their car.""Spriggs compared it to the way the economy was flooded with new homes during the subprime mortgage bubble that prompted the 2008 financial crisis.""The point is that when they start to lose their cars, we will flood the auto market with new model, used cars,"" he said. ""The same thing will happen to the auto market as what happened with housing. It will collapse.""Activists who oppose a Fed rate hike have cited the heavy impact it would have on people of color as one reason why the interest rate should not go up.Black and Latino workers affiliated with the Fed Up campaign, a coalition of groups advocating more progressive monetary policy, held a candlelight vigil Tuesday to “mourn” the impending Fed rate hike outside the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

This isn't going to help.,2015-12-18,What Happens to Black Unemployment if White Unemployment Declines More? ,http://public.tableau.com/static/images/Wh/WhatHappenstoBlackUnemploymentifWhiteUnemploymentDeclinesMore/BlackUnemployment/1_rss.png,"The Federal Reserve’s decision to raise its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday is bad news for black workers.The move is expected to put downward pressure on job creation by raising borrowing costs throughout the economy. While the rate hike is a modest measure on its own, it sets the stage for a series of additional developments that stand to have a much bigger contractionary effect on the economy.That will squeeze all American workers, since there will be less demand for their work and they won't have as much leverage when it comes to setting wages. But it will be especially bad for African-Americans.The unemployment rate among black people in the U.S. is generally about twice as high as the unemployment rate for white people. As of the end of November, the unemployment rate for African-Americans was 9.4 percent, compared with a rate of just 4.3 percent for whites.This means that any time the overall unemployment rate declines, it disproportionately benefits black workers -- and any time national unemployment goes up, it disproportionately hurts them. The progressive Center for Economic and Policy Research created a visualization tool in October to illustrate this phenomenon. CEPR focused on how black unemployment would fall relative to white unemployment if the Federal Reserve allowed the economy to grow unfettered by not raising the interest rate.Since black unemployment is twice as high as white unemployment, it means that every time white unemployment declines by 1 percentage point, black unemployment declines by 2 percentage points.CEPR also looked at the relationship between white unemployment and black teen unemployment, which is typically six times the overall white rate. Thus, every decline of 1 percentage point in white joblessness is accompanied by a drop of 6 percentage points in black teen unemployment.It's important to note that the disparity between black and white unemployment does not correspond to educational attainment.William Spriggs, the chief economist of the AFL-CIO, who has done some of the pioneering research on the African-American labor market, notes that in previous growth periods, the unemployment rate for black college graduates was roughly equal to the rate for white Americans with associate degrees.Right now, though, the disparity is even greater: Black college graduates are unemployed at roughly the same rate as white high school graduates. ""Under their own abilities and own efforts, the best that blacks can do, the unemployment rate is the lowest that black people can get it,"" Spriggs told The Huffington Post.Spriggs and other scholars have concluded that the higher rate of black unemployment is due to discrimination. ""The only solution that African-Americans have is a very tight labor market that raises the cost of discrimination,"" he said.The kind of ""tight"" labor market Spriggs describes would only be possible if the Fed allowed unemployment to drop before raising its key rate. In such a scenario, the theory goes, employers' demand for workers would become so great that they could no longer afford to discriminate against black job applicants.Spriggs emphasized that caring about the plight of black and Latino workers is in all of Americans' interest. He called workers of color the ""canary in the coal mine.""""This recovery has been fueled by auto sales, disproportionately to black and Latino consumers in subprime loans with unfavorable terms,"" he said. ""The moment they lose their jobs, they will lose their car.""Spriggs compared it to the way the economy was flooded with new homes during the subprime mortgage bubble that prompted the 2008 financial crisis.""The point is that when they start to lose their cars, we will flood the auto market with new model, used cars,"" he said. ""The same thing will happen to the auto market as what happened with housing. It will collapse.""Activists who oppose a Fed rate hike have cited the heavy impact it would have on people of color as one reason why the interest rate should not go up.Black and Latino workers affiliated with the Fed Up campaign, a coalition of groups advocating more progressive monetary policy, held a candlelight vigil Tuesday to “mourn” the impending Fed rate hike outside the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

8,BUSINESS,This Is The Most Important Thing To Remember When Choosing A Job,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/happiness-money-work_us_56741a06e4b0b958f65640c4,"It's not about the money, folks.",2015-12-18,Printer rage: What happens when your work is too dull....,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56741d001f0000c000e9c211.gif?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Does a fat paycheck help ease the pain of a boring job?Most of us kind of believe the answer is yes. Indeed, it’s the thinking behind many a young corporate lawyer or investment banker’s failed career.But the reality is: People underestimate just how important it is to enjoy the experience of work, according to a new study from researchers at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business.In fact, the researchers found that enjoying your work is a critical part of actually getting your work done -- and doing it well. This may seem obvious: You’re more likely to do a thing if you genuinely like doing that thing. Yet apparently, humans are terrible at understanding why they do things. This will play out in real time quite soon as so many of us fail to follow through on our New Year’s resolutions.“People don’t realize how important the experience is after or before they are doing it,” Ayelet Fishbach, a professor at Booth and the study’s co-author, told The Huffington Post. “We found that those doing something fun persist longer than those doing something for money. People worked harder when we made the task more interesting.”The results have implications not just for work, but also for exercise and eating. You’re more likely to work out if you enjoy doing the activity you picked. You’re more likely to stick to a diet if you actually want to eat the healthy food you’ve committed yourself to.Personally speaking, the research goes a long way in explaining why I have no problem writing three stories in a day, but struggle to file a simple expense report or schedule a dentist appointment.For their paper, published in the December issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Fishbach and coauthor Kaitlin Woolley conducted six experiments on university students, faculty and Chicago residents. The study participants exercised, visited a museum or were asked to do various tasks. The aim was to learn whether people were motivated by “extrinsic” rewards like money or “intrinsic” rewards like having fun.In one experiment, test subjects were asked to read either a computer manual or a joke book and do some evaluations. Most said they’d do more of either task if they were paid more, but those who chose to read the dull manual for more money had a hard time following through.In another study, subjects were asked to choose between listening to The Beatles song “Hey, Jude” or an alarm clock. If they picked the clock, they would receive more money. Most chose the clock -- and after going through with the exercise, most of them regretted their choice.The researchers found that when a task is boring or unpleasant, people have a hard time completing it, no matter the compensation. Yet in considering a task, people tend to devalue what the actual experience will be like -- the “intrinsic” rewards -- and focus more on the money they'll get for doing it.So, you (well, this reporter anyway) wind up committing to, say, a five-day green juice fast because it will be “healthy” without considering how truly unpleasant it will be to drink only slightly acidic, gritty beverages for nearly a week. Or you think you can spend a few years researching legal documents because of a six-figure salary, even though you hate researching legal documents.Enjoying your work, by the way, isn't simply about the task at hand. The experience includes the social environment, too. Do you like bantering with your colleagues over at the coffee machines? That really matters.""It’s not just doing something you love. It’s doing it with people that you like. Having a nice office environment. Having a nice experience,"" Fisbach said.To be sure, choosing work that you enjoy is a luxury only for some (typically well-off, better educated people). Many people have not-so-great options when it comes to work or pay. But if you do have the privilege of getting to choose around both those incentives, choose wisely."

Trump ultimately lost out to a higher bidder last year, and was quite bitter about it.After losing out on the team, The Donald offered a preview of the social media presence he'd later bring to the presidential race. On this week's ""The Second Half"" podcast, Daily Beast and New York Times Magazine columnist Ana Marie Cox posits that Trump's bravado and outsized self-assurance might have made him the ""perfect NFL owner."" She also discusses the effect of Trump's anti-Muslim pronouncements have had on the world of sports, where incidents of Islamophobic discrimination have occurred multiple times in recent weeks. Also on this week's episode: U.S. Women's National Team star Carli Lloyd sits down to discuss women's soccer stars' ongoing fight for equal treatment, and how the sport can continue to grow after a year as big as 2015 (that interview starts at 16:25).This podcast was produced, edited and engineered by Peter James Callahan and Adriana Usero, with assistance from Christine Conetta.Also on HuffPost:"
