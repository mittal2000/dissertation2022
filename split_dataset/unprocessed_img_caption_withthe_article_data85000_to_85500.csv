7,IMPACT,How I Finally Developed Some National Pride,"Sezin Koehler, ContributorAuthor, Crime Rave and American Monsters, contri...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-i-finally-developed-s_b_7679184.html,Being a Third Culture Kid -- someone who spent her developmental years outside her parents' home countries -- I never got the cultural coding that provides for a sense of nationalism or patriotism.,2015-06-30,2015-06-27-1435437851-4609074-5283103775_76f8496cf7_z.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-27-1435437851-4609074-5283103775_76f8496cf7_z-thumb.jpg," Creative commons image courtesy of Colin Dunn on Flickr.Being a Third Culture Kid -- someone who spent her developmental years outside her parents' home countries -- I never got the cultural coding that provides for a sense of nationalism or patriotism. Seeing the phenomenon in other people has invoked in me a sense of general bafflement, sometimes horror at the things done ""for God and Country,"" and occasional jealousy at not feeling so connected to a place I would tattoo its flag on my body or cry when my team lost a sports game. Add to the mix being biracial: I have functioned under an assumption of otherness for as long as my memory serves. No matter where I go, even in my passport country of the US or the other half of my ethnic identity Sri Lanka, I am asked ""Where are you from?"" To bring my fundamental otherness home: On our yearly visits to Milwaukee to see my (white) maternal grandparents my grandmother would tell me how unfortunate it was my mother married the man she did because I would never really be American. On the flip side, my Sri Lankan father would constantly remind me that I was ""too American"" to ever be considered Sri Lankan. I internalized racism from a young age and was forced to cultivate a racial isolation that followed me to today: I became a cultural chameleon without a fixed identity. And in spite of carrying a coveted American passport I never felt any connection to this country, especially with its appalling history of genocide of indigenous populations, slavery, Japanese internment, the modern-day war on women, along with illegal military incursions, rendition, torture, ad nauseum. Because of that constant otherness I never felt the need to claim a country. It doesn't really matter when you're an eternal foreigner, right?I met my husband in 2006, he proposed after 10 days and we were married 3 months later. That was 9.5 years ago, and for me marriage was one of the first in the line of game-changing moments that changed me for the better as a woman, a writer, an artist, a human being. I was no longer alone. I was bound to a man who did not judge me, belittle my confused identity or tell me I'd never belong anywhere because I belonged with him. It took several years of his (and my) patience, but I finally got comfortable in the fact that he wasn't going anywhere without me. I let myself become more than just the lonely, rootless, outsider girl who was othered so often she eventually believed that was the only way to live. My husband became -- and continues to be -- my sense of home.Marrying the man I love was the most profound, beautiful, transcendent thing I ever did in my life. And getting married was one of the best decisions I ever made, and one that has shaped me for the better, and taught me the value of unconditional love. I would not be even remotely the person I am today without my marriage.On June 26, 2015 I learned that the Supreme Court of the United States had declared marriage equality in all fifty states. Marriage equality. All. Fifty. States. Is this real life?! Was I still dreaming?! I wasn't. I took to Facebook and Twitter and saw the incredible outpouring of love as people were finally able to share ""I do's"" with the loves of their lives. Tears streamed down my face at the wedding pictures of total strangers who can finally and openly share an official marriage with their partner. Marriage is now a universal right in the USA.My heart began to swell with a new feeling. A strange feeling. One I had never felt before in my empath's life of feeling all the kinds of feelings: I felt proud to be an American.""What's this?! What's this?!"" I was Jack Skellington discovering Christmastown. What The Grinch felt when his heart grew to full size.That upsurge of emotion added a new layer of tears streaming down my face. So this is why people get so upset when their home team loses! This is why people fly a flag in front of their home! This is why people join the army! Eureka, I get it!I'm not gay, but I've always had gay pride. And suddenly I had a new kind: National pride. Pride that my country did something right. Pride that my country took human and civil rights a step forward. Pride that a whole segment of the population can express their love for another human being in a new way, the same way I've been blessed for almost a decade. I've been on this planet for 36 years and never realized what I was missing in not having a sense of attachment with my ancestry. I had an emptiness I chalked up to my nomadic sense of self. Now that the hole is gone I realize it wasn't a hole at all, but rather anger, and disassociation and jealousy's ugly older sister envy that everyone else got to have something I thought I couldn't or wouldn't have. I imagine that's how many of the same-sex couples who are finally getting married felt about being denied their right to wed for all these years. Later on 6/26, I watched the USA kick China's butt in world cup football -- a sports event that literally the day before I was scoffing at for being a public display of nationalistic nonsense -- and I felt proud to be American. I cheered for my badass team when they won. I now feel like I'm part of something more than just a stamp on my birth certificate saying ""Citizen of the United States of America."" It's because on June 26, 2015 love won. And hope won. And dreams came true. This institution of marriage that saved me from so much sadness is now a right all can afford in this country. I am so proud of you, America. I am so proud to be one of yours. I'm sorry it took me so long, but here you have me. A proud citizen. A patriot. National pride, baby. And congratulations to all the new happy couples out there! I wish I could have thrown glitter at every single one of your weddings. But let's not stop with marriage equality and maintaining an affordable healthcare system. We need still need to deal with pervasive racism in this country. And we need sweeping gun control reforms. And a living wage. And more. We're just getting started, really. We can do this, America.As the voice says in Field of Dreams: Go the distance."

Joseph S. Blatter resigned as president of FIFA. The 79-year-old Swiss official, FIFA president for 17 years said a special congress would be called to elect a successor. (Photo by Philipp Schmidli/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ba2c7e21f0000500022713c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This is one of a series of posts discussing what the FIFA case might tell us about the American criminal justice system. Click here for the introduction, here for ""Part 1: Pretrial Publicity,"" here for ""Part 2: How the Government's Story Develops,"" here for ""Part 3: The Special Problem of the 'Cooperating' Witness,"" and here for ""Part 4: The Challenge of Preparing a Defense.""In previous posts, I've discussed some of the difficulties that await the FIFA defendants and others charged with federal white-collar and corruption-related offenses. This may not have generated much sympathy for these defendants, on the theory that at some level they deserve what they're getting. Even staunch advocates of the presumption of innocence will tend to assume, deep down, that people get targeted by federal prosecutors for a reason. So a typical response might be -- if you don't want to go through this kind of process, keep yourself out of it. Don't break the law, and just to be safe, stay away from the gray areas. In short, conduct yourself in such a way as to stay out of the reach of even an aggressive, ""creative"" prosecutor.Sounds logical. Unfortunately, it's impossible. The problem is that within the legal framework applicable to white-collar and public corruption offenses, there's no clear set of rules as to what can and can't be done. The federal criminal statutes are drawn extremely broadly -- criminalizing, for example, any ""scheme or artifice to defraud."" No one has ever been able to figure out quite what that means, with the result that crippling, life-changing prosecutions can be brought whenever some transaction or practice seems fishy to at least one federal prosecutor. (The best book on this topic is Three Felonies a Day, by Harvey Silverglate. Anyone who can read that book and come away thinking that our federal criminal system is working properly has a stronger stomach than mine.)One aspect of this issue is already being showcased in the FIFA case. Part of that case is based on the notorious theory of ""honest services"" fraud -- the idea that it can be a federal crime, punishable by up to 20 years' imprisonment, to fail to provide fully ""honest services"" to one's employer. This theory has been ricocheting throughout the system for more than half a century. It's been enormously controversial, largely because it's so broad and far-reaching -- potentially covering, for example, every employee who tacks a few unrecorded minutes onto an authorized coffee break. And there has been virtually no consensus as to whether the federal criminal statutes actually cover this kind of thing. For several decades most courts concluded that they did. In 1987, the Supreme Court effectively stated that they didn't. Congress tried to clarify the statutory language in 1988, but it wasn't until 2011 that the Court finally (sort of) settled the question of what types of ""honest services"" offenses were criminally punishable -- in doing so, drawing lines seemingly different than those proposed by Congress. Notably, the alleged conduct in the FIFA case goes back decades, so the ""honest services"" part of the prosecution will apparently be based in part on alleged conduct that took place back when it was anyone's guess as to what was really criminal.The problems with such a system should be obvious. It's impossible for individuals to order their affairs to stay within the law when the relevant statutes are drawn so vaguely. Just as importantly, the breadth and vagueness of these laws give prosecutors immense discretionary power to prosecute pretty much anyone they feel like targeting. Back in 1940, then-Attorney General (and future Supreme Court Justice) Robert Jackson already saw the danger:With the law books filled with a great assortment of crimes, a prosecutor stands a fair chance of finding at least a technical violation of some act on the part of almost anyone. In such a case, it is not a question of discovering the commission of a crime and then looking for the man who has committed it, it is a question of picking the man and then searching the law books, or putting investigators to work, to pin some offense on him. It is in this realm -- in which the prosecutor picks some person whom he dislikes or desires to embarrass, or selects some group of unpopular persons and then looks for an offense, that the greatest danger of abuse of prosecuting power lies. It is here that law enforcement becomes personal, and the real crime becomes that of being unpopular with the predominant or governing group, being attached to the wrong political views, or being personally obnoxious to or in the way of the prosecutor himself.And prosecutors are well aware of the immense power they wield. A 2007 article in Slate  describes a game played by federal prosecutors in the highly influential Southern District of New York, in which one would ""name a random celebrity -- say, Mother Theresa or John Lennon,"" and the others would ""figure out a plausible crime for which to indict him or her."" Funny stuff -- as long as you don't end up in these prosecutors' crosshairs.This troubling combination of vagueness and discretion shows up in a number of contexts. Silverglate's book, for example, describes criminal cases based on individual prosecutors' beliefs that certain business practices in various fields were improper -- despite the lack of any pre-existing rules or standards governing the practices, and in some cases despite confusion within government agencies themselves regarding their legality. (I've seen the same thing in my own practice. Several years ago, I represented a man who was criminally charged based on conduct that the head of the relevant government agency had stated, in writing, was legal.)The FIFA case may end up focusing on alleged conduct that's clearly illegal, or it may center on more controversial, ""creative"" theories. Regardless, it's increasingly clear that prosecutors have essentially unbounded discretion in deciding whom to charge in a case like this, and extraordinarily broad legal weapons to use against their chosen targets -- a troubling combination for anyone concerned with the rule of law."

This interview was originally published on June 26, 2015 and can be read here. BCN Editor's note: I asked SreyRam and her sister SreyReath a few questions regarding their amazing journey. I hope you find their answers as enlightening and inspirational as did I.Last month, Breaking Christian News published Part 1 of an article by Dr. SreyRam Kuy, detailing her family's journey as refugees from Cambodia--out of the Killing Fields of Khmer Rouge. SreyRam's mother's courage and strength were what they clung to after escaping the genocide headed by Pol Pot, trekking through a jungle littered with land mines, and surviving the desperation of refugee camps. SreyRam's mother was even miraculously healed after surviving a RPG explosion in one of those camps, before her family was finally sponsored to come to America by a church group. Read Part 1 of SreyRam's riveting account of survival here. BCN: You mention a Christian group that sponsored you and your family to come to America. Did you ever find out what group that was, and what prompted that sponsorship?SreyRam and SreyReath Kuy: My family was sponsored to the United States by a Seventh Day Adventist missionary group. Judy Aiken, a Seventh Day Adventist missionary volunteering in the Khao-i-Dang refugee camp which we were living in, helped us secure visas to come to the United States. We lost contact, and then several years later, we were reunited when Judy came to visit us in Corvallis, Oregon. We are so grateful to people like Judy, who sacrificed so much to travel across the globe, leaving her comfortable home and family, to help destitute refugees living in squalid refugee camps. We're grateful for that surgeon who operated on us and saved our lives. These people truly exemplify what it means to be the hands and feet of Christ. At the same time that my family experienced the evil atrocities during the Cambodian Killing Fields, we also experienced the extraordinary human capacity for God's amazing grace to shine through people.  (SreyReath and SreyRam with their family in a Cambodian refugee camp.)These acts of kindness were what helped sustain us during these brutal years of the Cambodian Genocide and our time as displaced refugees. We don't know what prompted people to help us. There were millions of other people who died during the Killing Fields, and thousands of other refugees that waited for years in refugee camps, only to be turned away and forced to return to the devastation that they had run away from. I don't believe there is anything special about us. I'm just humbled and amazed at the miracles we experienced, unearned and undeservedly. All I know is that these acts of human kindness were how we saw the evidence of God in our lives. I'm just humbled and amazed at the miracles we experienced... All I know is that these acts of human kindness were how we saw the evidence of God in our lives. BCN: You describe a time when your mother was recovering from her operation to repair injuries after the RPG hit. She was lying in the Red Cross refugee medical tent, and a Christian group came in to pray over her and lay hands on her. At the time she didn't know what they were doing or what they were saying. Did you or she ever find out what group that was, and did she ever make contact with them again once she was in America?SreyRam and SreyReath Kuy: While my mom was lying in the Red Cross tent, recovering from the trauma laparotomy following the explosion, a group came to pray and sing over my mom as she was recovering. At first she was startled and a little afraid of these strange people. They came back the next day, to pray for another woman who was also ill. After that, my mom never saw them again. She didn't know at the time who they were or what they were about. But she felt a surge of strength in her body that she had never felt before. It had been nearly two months since the explosion, and she had been too weak to walk up to that day. After the group prayed over her, she had the strength for the first time to get up and try to walk with help. She later learned that it was a Christian missionary group, but she never found out the name of that group.  (The authors' mother, photographed in a Cambodian refugee camp.)BCN: Can you describe how exactly your mother, sister and you came to know Christ, and what difference that has made in your lives?SreyRam Kuy: Coming to know Christ has been a journey, not an overnight event. Some people planted the first kernels of faith, other people watered the seeds, and later, completely different people were able to see the fruits of those early seeds of faith. God worked in increments in our life, and over generations.As a young girl living in 1950's rural Cambodia, my mom was a stubborn child. She dreamed of obtaining an education and becoming a teacher. However, her spirited and rebellious nature was a contradiction to cultural norms and her old-fashioned father's ways of thinking. Her father believed that women should not be educated, as this made them ""uppity"" and insubordinate to their husbands. However, my mother stubbornly kept going to school despite daunting obstacles. Going to school wearing raggedly clothes, and lacking the money to pay for books and fees, she still excelled in school and became a teacher.  (The authors' mom, first row far right, as a young school girl in Cambodia)However, just as she began to enjoy the fulfillment of her dream, the entire country of Cambodia hit a political crisis. This started in the early seventies during the Cambodian Civil War and took a ruthless turn for the worst after the bloody war was lost to the communists and the Khmer Rouge took over the country. Pol Pot had a savage quest; he ordered the execution of all educated citizens, beginning the systemic murder of teachers, doctors, musicians, artists, government officials. Anyone identified as educated was executed, tortured or enslaved. Being educated was now a crime. The elite become the third class citizens of society and subsequently; the first to be killed. Under the leadership of Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge were responsible for the slaughter of two million human lives during the Cambodian Genocide.  (This memorial serves as a reminder that children, as well as adults, were targets of the Khmer Rouge. This is one of the Killing Trees against which executioners brutally murdered children during the Cambodian Genocide.)After working so hard to achieve an education, my mother now had to hide her identity as a teacher. She fought fiercely to save her life, and the lives of her children, during the four brutal years of the Killing Fields. When the Khmer Rouge took over Cambodia, a lot of people gave up in despair. Among those who weren't executed, some even committed suicide to escape the horrors of the regime. My mother, however, stubbornly refused to ever give up. She faced the Khmer Rouge killers with the same steely resolve that helped her succeed in school. While everyone was starving during the communist regime, my mother faced tigers in the wild jungle to find food for her family. When taken to be executed by the Khmer Rouge, she defied them, multiple times, and lived to tell the stories to her children. My mom has an incredible courage and stubborn will. I don't think my mother was fearless. Who wouldn't have fear living in the middle of a Genocide? However, she refused to let that fear win. She fought to live, and to save the lives of her family. My mom really does have ""The Heart of a Tiger"". After surviving the four years of the Khmer Rouge Regime, we escaped out of Cambodia. We spent 1 and a half years living in four different Cambodian refugee camps before we got visas to come to the US, through the incredible help of the Seventh Day Adventists missionaries.  (SreyReath and SreyRam with their family in a Cambodian refugee camp, seeking asylum in the US.)Arriving in the US, my mom held multiple jobs, working as housekeeper at Good Samaritan hospital, then on her evenings and days off cleaned houses for local doctors and professors. We worked in the fields with the migrant farm workers on the weekends and during the summers picking blueberries, strawberries, cherry tomatoes, green beans, and raspberries. But, on the rare Sundays that she wasn't working, mom would try to take us to church. When we first arrived in the US, we didn't speak any English. As a result, my mom often didn't understand the seemingly strange rituals we witnessed during our occasional visits to churches. She didn't really understand a lot about the Christian faith, and the customs of the church were even more confusing, but she felt compelled to keep trying to go when she could. In 1987, I was given my first Bible by Pastor Paulson at Grace Lutheran Church. It lay unread for years. We'd still intermittently try to go to church when we could, but we usually worked every Sunday. One hot summer day in sixth grade, while I was picking blueberries, a girl working on the row next to me, starting talking about the Bible, and how she read it every day. I don't really know why, but I went home and picked up that Bible I had been given years ago, and started reading it myself. Later, I began reading the stories from the Bible to my family in the evenings. A few years later, my mom was working at the hospital, kneeling over a toilet, scrubbing it, when my mom felt God speak to her heart. Startled, she heard, ""It's time to get baptized."" She had no idea what it meant to be baptized, and she didn't know how to get baptized. However, shortly afterwards we met Pastor James Rehley, from Zion Lutheran church. I have no idea how he came into our lives. He started visiting our home in the evenings, teaching us about the Good News of Christ. Months later, my mom, my sister and I were baptized. Our life has never been the same since then. I look back at my life, and I see that while 2 million people died during the Cambodian Killing Fields, we survived. Among those who survived the Genocide, thousands of Cambodians tried to escape, and died crossing the landmines that pockmarked the border. My family and I made it across the border safely. Then, after the RPG hit the refugee camp, we were severely wounded, and would have died if not for that volunteer surgeon. Because of him, today I'm a surgeon myself, taking care of our nation's veterans. I look back, and I am astonished and humbled. There is absolutely nothing I did to deserve to be alive, when so many other people were killed. I don't know why I survived, but I do think that I was picked out of that blueberry field for a purpose. My family lived through a Genocide where millions of people died, either through execution, brutal torture, starvation, disease, or despair and suicide. However, God saved us time after time; from execution by the Khmer Rouge soldiers, from starvation during the inhumane conditions of the Killing Fields, and from the four to six million land mines that riddled the borders of Cambodia during our escape. If I can inspire someone to have hope through this story, then my time was well spent. Jesus tells a parable about a wealthy man who gives each of his servants' talents. To one, he gave one talent, to the other two talents, to the last he gave five talents. The person who got five talents, put it to work, and multiplied it into five more. The one who got two talents, put that to work and earned two more. But the person who received one talent, was scared and buried it in the ground. I don't want to live in fear. I want to have the courage to boldly go out and use every gift that I've been blessed with. That means making the most of every day I'm blessed to live in this incredible land of freedom. America is a blessed country. As an American, I have the freedom to dream, to get an education and to succeed. However, being successful is not determined by how much wealth you amass, but in how many people you help along the way.America is a blessed country. As an American, I have the freedom to dream, to get an education and to succeed. However, being successful is not determined by how much wealth you amass, but in how many people you help along the way.I wrote the book, ""The Heart of a Tiger,"" to encourage others. This book is a testimony to God's incredible love and amazing grace. He has brought my family through so much. We have seen miracles after miracles in our lives. My message in ""The Heart of a Tiger"" is that despite what obstacles you face, God is greater than any obstacle. Despite how bleak your circumstances, God's grace is sufficient to enable you to emerge victorious.""The Heart of a Tiger"", is a story about finding hope when there is no hope. It is a story of a woman who refuses to give up no matter how bleak her circumstances are. It is the story of a woman whose love for her family gives her the courage to overcome brutal atrocities. And it is the story of how God's grace can shine through the incredible human capacity for kindness even in the midst of extraordinary evil. My hope in sharing this story is to honor the legacy of the millions of lives lost during the Cambodian Genocide. Their lives need to matter. By remembering this legacy hopefully we can learn from humanity's tragic history to prevent it from repeating itself. ""The Heart of a Tiger"" is a searing story of courage, faith, and forgiveness through one of the worst atrocities in human history. This is a story that you will never forget.  BCN: Was it difficult for your mother to go back to visit Cambodia and the places where she experienced so much pain, and how did she deal with that?SreyRam and SreyReath Kuy: My mom is incredible; I am amazed by what a heart she has to serve. She doesn't dwell on the atrocities she experienced. Instead, she always talks about the kindness she experienced. The first several times she went back to Cambodia, she went in search of people who had helped her during the Killing Fields to try to repay her debt of gratitude. These were people who had risked their lives to help save her life during the Khmer Rouge Communist regime, or shared food with her during the endemic starvation of the Killing Fields. There were many people that she never found, because they had died already. However, it gives her great joy whenever she can find someone to pay back their kindness. During her last three trips to Cambodia, my mom returned to share her faith. Her last trip was this past January/February during which she visited five Cambodian churches where she testified about how God's incredible grace enabled her to forgive and heal after her experiences in the Killing Fields. She helped baptize 33 people, brought 900 Cambodian language Bibles that she distributed, and brought new school uniforms and clothes that she shared with the local villagers.  (SreyRam and SreyReath's mother on a mission trip to her home village in Siem Reap, Cambodia.)A couple weeks into her trip, she visited one church, where the building was dilapidated with a broken roof. Despite the unsafe conditions, people still gathered, desperate to find hope. My mom immediately called my sister and me to help out. My mom provided the funds to rebuild a new church, and the villagers provided the manpower, with everyone from children to the elderly all pitching in. My mom was determined to share the blessings she's experienced. At age seventy, my mom rebuilt a crumbling church, leads worship services, and shares her testimony about forgiveness, faith, and God's incredible miracles in her life. BCN: SreyRam, as you hear of events such as the genocide against minorities by ISIS and Boko Haram in the Middle East, what message would you have to this nation's leaders, and also to fellow Christians, in light of the fact that you have lived through and have experienced similar atrocities?SreyRam Kuy: In surgery, we talk about ""never events"". These are things that should never happen, such as a retained sponge, a death in the operating room, or a wrong site surgery. But, ""never events"" do happen. And when they happen in medicine, rather than forgetting about it, we take pains to remember, discuss and analyze it in detail, learn from it, and create interventions to try to prevent it from happening to another patient. Genocide is a ""never event"". It should never, ever happen. And yet, we have seen it occur during the Holocaust, the Rwandan Genocide and during the Cambodian Killing Fields. It keeps recurring, like a metastatic malignancy. The healing of humanity is analogous to the art of medicine. It is imperative that we talk about these events and never forget them, so that we can learn from the mistakes of our human history and develop interventions to prevent future genocides. I absolutely believe genocide should, and can, become a ""never event.""""The Heart of a Tiger"" is a story about finding hope when there is no hope. It is a story of a woman who refuses to give up no matter how bleak her circumstances. It is the story of a woman whose love for her family gives her the courage to overcome brutal atrocities.

As an American, I have the freedom to dream, to get an education and to succeed. However, being successful is not determined by how much wealth you amass, but in how many people you help along the way.I wrote the book, ""The Heart of a Tiger,"" to encourage others. This book is a testimony to God's incredible love and amazing grace. He has brought my family through so much. We have seen miracles after miracles in our lives. My message in ""The Heart of a Tiger"" is that despite what obstacles you face, God is greater than any obstacle. Despite how bleak your circumstances, God's grace is sufficient to enable you to emerge victorious.""The Heart of a Tiger"", is a story about finding hope when there is no hope. It is a story of a woman who refuses to give up no matter how bleak her circumstances are. It is the story of a woman whose love for her family gives her the courage to overcome brutal atrocities. And it is the story of how God's grace can shine through the incredible human capacity for kindness even in the midst of extraordinary evil. My hope in sharing this story is to honor the legacy of the millions of lives lost during the Cambodian Genocide. Their lives need to matter. By remembering this legacy hopefully we can learn from humanity's tragic history to prevent it from repeating itself. ""The Heart of a Tiger"" is a searing story of courage, faith, and forgiveness through one of the worst atrocities in human history. This is a story that you will never forget.  BCN: Was it difficult for your mother to go back to visit Cambodia and the places where she experienced so much pain, and how did she deal with that?SreyRam and SreyReath Kuy: My mom is incredible; I am amazed by what a heart she has to serve. She doesn't dwell on the atrocities she experienced. Instead, she always talks about the kindness she experienced. The first several times she went back to Cambodia, she went in search of people who had helped her during the Killing Fields to try to repay her debt of gratitude. These were people who had risked their lives to help save her life during the Khmer Rouge Communist regime, or shared food with her during the endemic starvation of the Killing Fields. There were many people that she never found, because they had died already. However, it gives her great joy whenever she can find someone to pay back their kindness. During her last three trips to Cambodia, my mom returned to share her faith. Her last trip was this past January/February during which she visited five Cambodian churches where she testified about how God's incredible grace enabled her to forgive and heal after her experiences in the Killing Fields. She helped baptize 33 people, brought 900 Cambodian language Bibles that she distributed, and brought new school uniforms and clothes that she shared with the local villagers.  (SreyRam and SreyReath's mother on a mission trip to her home village in Siem Reap, Cambodia.)A couple weeks into her trip, she visited one church, where the building was dilapidated with a broken roof. Despite the unsafe conditions, people still gathered, desperate to find hope. My mom immediately called my sister and me to help out. My mom provided the funds to rebuild a new church, and the villagers provided the manpower, with everyone from children to the elderly all pitching in. My mom was determined to share the blessings she's experienced. At age seventy, my mom rebuilt a crumbling church, leads worship services, and shares her testimony about forgiveness, faith, and God's incredible miracles in her life. BCN: SreyRam, as you hear of events such as the genocide against minorities by ISIS and Boko Haram in the Middle East, what message would you have to this nation's leaders, and also to fellow Christians, in light of the fact that you have lived through and have experienced similar atrocities?SreyRam Kuy: In surgery, we talk about ""never events"". These are things that should never happen, such as a retained sponge, a death in the operating room, or a wrong site surgery. But, ""never events"" do happen. And when they happen in medicine, rather than forgetting about it, we take pains to remember, discuss and analyze it in detail, learn from it, and create interventions to try to prevent it from happening to another patient. Genocide is a ""never event"". It should never, ever happen. And yet, we have seen it occur during the Holocaust, the Rwandan Genocide and during the Cambodian Killing Fields. It keeps recurring, like a metastatic malignancy. The healing of humanity is analogous to the art of medicine. It is imperative that we talk about these events and never forget them, so that we can learn from the mistakes of our human history and develop interventions to prevent future genocides. I absolutely believe genocide should, and can, become a ""never event.""""The Heart of a Tiger"" is a story about finding hope when there is no hope. It is a story of a woman who refuses to give up no matter how bleak her circumstances. It is the story of a woman whose love for her family gives her the courage to overcome brutal atrocities.

Church or the African Methodist Episcopalian Church. The name alone implies togetherness even though the church was formed in strife as Africans were upset that Caucasians in the Methodist and Episcopalian churches refused to pray equally with African descendents. So, in Philadelphia the Africans formed their own church which had a simple mission of Christian liberation theology. For the oldest African-American church in the U.S., part of that liberation meant following Union troops to the south to open churches for newly freed slaves, as Confederate territory was taken over. One tenet we learned in the church was the power of forgiveness. To forgive is not considered a weakness, but rather a powerful tool. Forgiving another person is taught as a self-liberating action that leaves the individual with spiritual and emotional space to continue to improve one's self. There is no room for hate in self improvement only love. Forgiveness does not let the perpetrators of hate off of the hook. It just means they alone are now wedded to their actions - not the forgiver. And one other thing, the forgiver forgives, but forgetting is another matter all together.After the Civil War ended some wealthy and rather pissed southerners formed a movement known as the Redeemers and their motto was ""The South Shall Rise Again."" They meant it would rise for Caucasians. Well the south will never rise again as the Redeemers envisioned Photo Credit: Wikiwand.comBut I believe the South will rise again in a way that frees most Caucasians from intimidation by other Caucasians who are racist, ignorant and love to flash the rebel flag on any and everything, including taxpayer supported buildings. Everyone knows there are Caucasian Americans who want to speak up against the rebel flag, but do not out of fear of being ostracized by other Caucasians. They can't get a break. African-Americans look at them and wonder why don't you speak up and join us, but their peers say, ""Stay with us."" ""Understand us."" ""We are having a cookout and you're invited, just bring your rebel flag."" or ""I know of a bar we can go to that has the flag on the wall.""That is a hell of a tight spot to be in. I can just see most Caucasians just waiting to exhale, but their true emotions are being held hostage by a small, strident group which is clutching onto a flag that represents rebellion against the higher ideals of this nation. That same intimidation existed during the Civil Rights Movement. But many over-came and stood up for what was obviously a right and just cause. The south will rise again to lead America along the path to improved race relations. If only Nixon could go to China, then solutions for our race problems will start - in the South, where basically they got started. And there will be plenty of Caucasians who will again join a good cause and take part in equal leadership.Reasonable people know that we are all in this race quagmire together and togetherness is how we will get ourselves out. There will be no fantasies of a ""white"" Northwest bordering west at Idaho, Utah and Arizona. Ain't gonna happen. There will not be a ""New Africa"" for ""blacks with Atlanta as the capital. Just ain't gonna happen. Give it up. What we will have is what we already are. We are a people of many different cultures who decide to try to get along and live together for the sake of a greater cause, namely united states. There are many more of us than the knuckle-heads, both African-American and Caucasian, who prefer to embrace divisive symbols and practices. Just remember that we out number them.  For the sake of unity I prefer to practice forgiving as I was taught in the A.M.E. church. It is the same forgiveness displayed by the relatives of the victims killed in Mother Emanuel A.M.E. church. In order to forgive you have to release the hate and move on to higher ground. In no way will honest history be forgotten though. That, just ain't gonna happen."

""Put it down and let's look for a better one.""""What about this one, Mommy?"" she asked, again picking up a broken shell.""Let's keep looking,"" I replied.Along the way, we did find some unbroken shells. We marveled at them and dropped them in our bucket as we walked. However, my sweet daughter continued to pick up some shell fragments as well.Eventually, she excitedly held one up for me to see. ""Mommy! Look! I know it's broken, but it has purple on it and purple is your favorite color! See? It's still pretty since it has purple, right?""Through the eyes of my child, I finally saw the beauty in the broken shells. I thought about all those shells had been through before they ended up there on the beach under our feet. They had been, perhaps, a home to some sea creature, eventually abandoned and discarded. They had traveled untold miles, tossed around among the waves. They had grown and changed and become mere pieces of what they once were. The tossing had shattered them, but it also had polished them. Eventually, they had come to rest right there in that spot, decorating the sand like confetti scattered about on the floor of a party and the beach would not have been the same without them. Their journey had ended beneath my toes and in the fingers of my sweet little girl. While she was fascinated, I had discounted them as broken and useless. She made me realize that, even in their brokenness, those delicate shells still had something to offer.It seems to me that people are often like those seashells. We travel great distances, both figurative and literal. Along the way, we get beaten and bruised; injured and scarred. Some of us end up more broken than others. Just like those shells, though, we still have something beautiful to give. We have talents and gifts that are unique to each of us. Sometimes, they are difficult to see, but they shine through the jagged cracks when we let them and when we make an effort to see them.As I looked at those shells with the fresh perspective my daughter had given me, I was reminded that there is beauty to be found in the broken. There are stories, fears, hopes, and dreams. They are there, in pieces and fragments, among the divots and crevices. Often, we just need to adjust our lens a bit so we can see them more clearly and appreciate them more fully. Lisa Witherspoon is a wife, mother, and blogger.

In short, I found a sanctuary. I'm pretty sure the debut of the 2015 Cadillac Escalade was about a year ago so I'm interested to see what's new when the 2016 model comes out sometime later this year. Suffice to say this bad boy has a 6.2-liter V-8 with 420 horsepower and 460 pound-feet of torque. There are details like the direct injection engine and GM's active fuel management, which can switch off four cylinders when more power isn't needed. Plus a fully boxed frame to stiffen the chassis, Magnetic Ride Control and more.   The Escalade has always been an iconic SUV with a luxurious ride. Yes, the paperwork I got said it has a 9.5-inch rear axle and standard automatic locking rear differential, and I was told the electric power steering has been adjusted to improve handling and fuel economy. For someone who needs a bit of quiet time to write my next video idea and be creative, the fact that Cadillac quieted the Escalade's ride and added additional luxury features inside and out wasn't lost on me. After speaking to CMO, Uwe Ellinghaus at the NYC auto show back in April, I know first-hand that his main objective is to claim the leadership position again in the luxury SUV market and restore the brand to greatness.The Escalade's exterior is clean and has sweet LED lighting details and Total Internal Reflection LED beams, which use four vertically stacked crystal lenses. One night after coming out of the movies late it was easy to find the Escalade because crest and wreath logo glow in the dark. My Escalade had a rich Root beer colored leather interior with comfy seats and an all-digital instrument panel. It was easy to load all of my lights, cameras and other production gear in the back because the second and third row seats fold flat with the push of a button.

After crying in a counselling office when Bush was re-elected and all of my Southern Californian classmates rejoiced, I would have lauded this day. Though Bush's continual threat to create a constitutional amendment defining marriage between a man and a woman was little but political pandering, to me the threat of being taken from my mother's partner was real. The lack of healthcare options was real. The double federal tax because they both had to file as single despite being recognised as ""domestic partners"" in California was real. Still I celebrated by wearing a hand written t-shirt to school when they drove 8 hours during the short period marriage was legal in San Francisco and married in front of the court house. I'm sure my mother still has the check refunding her $30 for her state annulled marriage framed.I didn't grow up with an anthem telling me that I, or my mother, were born this way. I didn't see lesbian or gay people on television, let alone bisexual people or transgender people. I lived with bullying about my gender presentation so thick it felt suffocating. I was called a ""lesbian"" and not anything worse because ""lesbian"" was the worst already. My first Pride was a small nearly secret meeting in a park in Virginia where no one raised their voices.By 14, I was active in the Marriage Equality movement in California. I gave a talk in my history classes about the importance of the 2,500 plus federal rights that legal marriage would give same sex couples. I stood in the faces of people screaming ""Get your hands off marriage!"" and sang that what the world needed now was love. Sweet love.As I look back on my teenage self, and the struggle that my mother and her partner went through, I realise that if this day had happened ten years ago, yes I would have been happy. But the immediate threats we faced would have stayed put. There was no recourse for poor queers when my mom would go to a job, have a great first day, be spotted getting into a car with a rainbow sticker and be mysteriously asked not to return. There was no real recourse for my mother when she was targeted by homophobic bosses, no specialist car insurance for bricks that busted her window, and no help when I nearly faced homelessness instead of university. My mum would have been married and jobless, then married and homeless. But hey, some freedom is better than none, right?It's been a weird few days for me because I never thought I'd see myself here. As an agender person, as a bisexual/queer person, I slowly came to realise how limiting the frame of ""equal marriage"" always was. I guess I should have realised it when my mother's partner transitioned and they were essentially booted from the marriage equality movement. But for a long time, marriage was such a symbol for me. It was something simple. Legalising marriage for all had a lot less political strings attached than labour rights.Pride today is so different. During my teen years it represented the idea that I wasn't alone. I wrote fierce angry responses to straight columnists who described gay prides as orgies unfit for children. I wrote angry letters to lesbian magazines about George Bush's inability to see my mother as a person. I greeted the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence with glee and the Dykes on Bikes with excitement that should have hinted my own bisexuality to me.I never thought I would see the day the SCOTUS in the US legalise same sex marriage pass me by without much personal fanfare. And as happy I am about what this symbolically means, I can't help thinking how this wouldn't have helped CeCe McDonald in prison. How this doesn't help the trans women trying to stay alive day in and day out. I can't help seeing myself as an agender person in the UK, rejected and dismissed by Gender Identity Clinics and struggling to raise funds for my surgery - but I can get married.Recently, when I demanded more than marriage, when I said that it was hard to happy about this, I was told by a queer person half my age that I needed to learn ""queer history"". Little did that person know, I've been part of this history. Both in the US and now in the UK. I've seen marriage be legal in the UK but the LGBT youth groups I volunteer for run out of funding. I've seen organisations like Stonewall Housing and Gendered Intelligence struggle to provide for the UK's LGBT youth while banks and corporations marched ahead of us in London Pride. I've been fine to be out as bisexual or queer at work, but hesitated to bring up being agender because of how little people understand.If this piece seems a bit confusing because my feelings are confusing. I've established what part I've played in fighting for equal marriage and how things have changed so much since I was in the first grade, adamantly assuring my classmates I didn't ""judge girls that way"". Maybe I'm just another greedy bisexual or maybe I'm just older and wiser now - but Marriage is not enough.So do celebrate now. I know what a big symbol this is for so many people. And when you're done, please turn that Pride float around and come back for trans people, specifically the trans women of colour dying every year - and stop the death. Actualise the vision that Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera had when Marsha threw the shot glass the started the Stonewall riot - and stop LGBTQ youth homelessness.There is still so much more to do. This isn't over."

18,ENTERTAINMENT,What Is the Spooky Real Life Origin of Scream's Ghostface Mask?,"Brian Cronin, ContributorWriter and founder of legendsrevealed.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-is-the-spooky-real-l_b_7686112.html,Reader Guillermo M. asked me if it was true that the mask was discovered by Craven by accident in an abandoned house during the location scouting for the first Scream film. Did this iconic piece of horror film history really have such a spooky origin?,2015-06-30,2015-06-29-1435561240-9161444-ScreamGhostfacemask.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-29-1435561240-9161444-ScreamGhostfacemask-thumb.jpg,"It appears that with the creation of any sort of iconic film, there is always a little bit of serendipity mixed into the process. In an old Movie Legends Revealed, I discussed the various factors (including, improbably enough, the 1970s soft rock hit song, ""Dream Weaver"") that went into Wes Craven coming up with the idea for Nightmare on Elm Street. Over a decade later, Craven was once again inspired from an unlikely place for the iconic ""Ghostface"" mask that terrorized victims in the hit 1996 film Scream. Reader Guillermo M. asked me if it was true that the mask was discovered by Craven by accident in an abandoned house during the location scouting for the first Scream film. Did this iconic piece of horror film history really have such a spooky origin?  The answer is yes!When Wes Craven took on the project that became Scream (it was originally dubbed Scary Movie), screenwriter Kevin Williamson gave no direction for the look of the villain of the film besides ""ghost mask killer."" So it was up to Craven and his production team to come up with a visual look for the film's killer. In an twist of fate, one of the producers on the film, Marianne Maddalena, was doing location scouting for the film when she came across an abandoned house in Santa Rosa, California that had been used previously in the 1943 Alfred Hitchcock film, Shadow of a Doubt. Maddalena ended up not using that house but instead chose a neighboring house for the home of Tatum and Dewey Riley (Rose McGowan and David Arquette) in Scream. However, while at the first house, she discovered a striking mask hanging from a post. She brought the mask to Craven (Craven accidentally once stated that it was he who discovered the mask, but he has since concurred with Maddalena that it was she who found the mask) and he loved it. There was only one teensy little problem. The mask was the intellectual property of the Halloween mask company Fun World. It was designed by Brigitte Sleiertin as part of a ""Fantastic Faces"" series of masks. It came out somewhere around 1992. Originally the mask was called ""The Peanut-Eyed Ghost."" So now Craven was in a bind - he had a mask he absolutely loved, but in order for the film to be able to use the mask, his studio, Dimension Films, would have to license the mask from Fun World. Fun World, naturally, had quite a bit of leverage in the negotiations and they drove a hard bargain. The bargain was initially too hard for Dimension Films and they told Craven he would have to make due with a different mask.

19,ENTERTAINMENT,What Is the Spooky Real Life Origin of Scream's Ghostface Mask?,"Brian Cronin, ContributorWriter and founder of legendsrevealed.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-is-the-spooky-real-l_b_7686112.html,Reader Guillermo M. asked me if it was true that the mask was discovered by Craven by accident in an abandoned house during the location scouting for the first Scream film. Did this iconic piece of horror film history really have such a spooky origin?,2015-06-30,2015-06-29-1435562156-6000094-knbeffectsghostfacemask1.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-29-1435562156-6000094-knbeffectsghostfacemask1-thumb.jpg,"It appears that with the creation of any sort of iconic film, there is always a little bit of serendipity mixed into the process. In an old Movie Legends Revealed, I discussed the various factors (including, improbably enough, the 1970s soft rock hit song, ""Dream Weaver"") that went into Wes Craven coming up with the idea for Nightmare on Elm Street. Over a decade later, Craven was once again inspired from an unlikely place for the iconic ""Ghostface"" mask that terrorized victims in the hit 1996 film Scream. Reader Guillermo M. asked me if it was true that the mask was discovered by Craven by accident in an abandoned house during the location scouting for the first Scream film. Did this iconic piece of horror film history really have such a spooky origin?  The answer is yes!When Wes Craven took on the project that became Scream (it was originally dubbed Scary Movie), screenwriter Kevin Williamson gave no direction for the look of the villain of the film besides ""ghost mask killer."" So it was up to Craven and his production team to come up with a visual look for the film's killer. In an twist of fate, one of the producers on the film, Marianne Maddalena, was doing location scouting for the film when she came across an abandoned house in Santa Rosa, California that had been used previously in the 1943 Alfred Hitchcock film, Shadow of a Doubt. Maddalena ended up not using that house but instead chose a neighboring house for the home of Tatum and Dewey Riley (Rose McGowan and David Arquette) in Scream. However, while at the first house, she discovered a striking mask hanging from a post. She brought the mask to Craven (Craven accidentally once stated that it was he who discovered the mask, but he has since concurred with Maddalena that it was she who found the mask) and he loved it. There was only one teensy little problem. The mask was the intellectual property of the Halloween mask company Fun World. It was designed by Brigitte Sleiertin as part of a ""Fantastic Faces"" series of masks. It came out somewhere around 1992. Originally the mask was called ""The Peanut-Eyed Ghost."" So now Craven was in a bind - he had a mask he absolutely loved, but in order for the film to be able to use the mask, his studio, Dimension Films, would have to license the mask from Fun World. Fun World, naturally, had quite a bit of leverage in the negotiations and they drove a hard bargain. The bargain was initially too hard for Dimension Films and they told Craven he would have to make due with a different mask. Instead, Craven had Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger of design company KNB Effects came up with their own version of the famous mask, altered enough to make it unique and not a violation of Fun World's intellectual property. This mask was actually used in the first few scenes in the film, including the famous opening sequence with Drew Barrymore. It is quite possible, though, that Dimension Films was just trying to prove to Fun World that they would be willing to do the film without the mask to get them to come down on their asking price in the negotiations.

However, the next big decisions facing the Supreme Court are very likely to revolve around the limits of free speech. The famous Oliver Wendell Holmes decision in Schenck v. United States brilliantly prescribed limits to First Amendment Rights. But free expression is one of the most complex matters in jurisprudence and it regularly receives challenges from all sides of the ideological spectrum. This problem is particularly acute in the case of religious expression. Is wearing the Hijab, the veil worn by some Muslim women a right, when hiding one's face makes identification documents like driver's licenses and passports almost meaningless? Members of Canada's conservative government recently courted controversy when they began to question this form of expression (""Harper says majority of 'moderate Muslims' support view on hijab ban,"" The Globe and Mail, 3/15/15) Do militantly anti-Muslim groups have the right to promote offensive attacks on Muhammad like the cartoon contest recently held in Texas, under the guise of defending the right of free speech against those who would stifle it (""Pamela Geller, Organizer of Muhammad Cartoon Contest, Trumpets Results,"" NYT, 5/4/15).The latter might have given Oliver Wendell Holmes pause, as would have the case of the Nazis marching through the Jewish section of Skokie, Illinois (a case that never made it to the Supreme Court). At the recent PEN conference in New York, otherwise liberally inclined writers signed petitions against honoring surviving Charlie Hebdo staff members, an astonishing turn of events considering PEN's storied history of defending writers and free expression around the world (""PEN Group Blacklists Charlie Hebdo,"" The Screaming Pope, 4/29/15) Those who believe that questioning the First Amendment opens up a Pandora's Box might ask how exactly ""fire!"" was cried, how crowded the theater and where the exits were. Salman Rushdie, who had a fatwah issued against him for The Satanic Verses, was incredulous and irate at the waffling some of his PEN colleagues, but the fire has now become the threat of violence and destruction. Liberal western values themselves are like crying ""fire?"" for fundamentalists of many stripes. In Israel the ultra Orthodox have attempted to inflict their values on a population that doesn't always cotton to their values. In an age of increasing terrorism, there will be a tendency to constrict both the exercise of beliefs as well as the right to express opposition and outrage at those self-same beliefs.

Some businesses prefer traditional media, direct mail and face-to-face personal selling. Others understand going exclusively digital is perfect for the people they want to reach and the message they want to get across. Neither of these are wrong, they're just different.   Have you ever wondered if your marketing was old school? If you're like me, that thought probably crosses your mind about every 5 minutes, and trying to change seems nearly impossible. Regardless of your marketing, it could be considered old school. However, that is only based on your personal impression of what is old and what is new? Also, let's say your business is using what some may say are old-school tactics. Is that a bad thing if your brand is performing well? Hmm.   Your customers are really the best measure of how to gauge whether or not your marketing is old school or not.  Time To Make A Change? How do you know if it's time to change your marketing? That's a great question, one that deserves some thought. Here are a few tidbits of information that may help your marketing team decide how to assess the action steps needed to take your business to the next level and start using some of the latest forms of marketing.  1. The first question to ask is: Who is my primary audience? If your target audience is a Millennial, old-school marketing is not what you should be using. Start thinking about how this generation communicates and prefers to engage with the world. You will soon discover traditional forms of old-school marketing are not among their favorite forms of media. Do a little research to see what forms of digital media capture a high percentage of your customers attention.2. Content Marketing: Is your brand telling a story in ways that attract your target audience (or persona)? This is critical, because if the brand is not doing this, that means your products and services are not appearing online, except for on your website --Yikes... not good. Start spreading the word in all places digital and begin to answer prospective customer questions. Start with the general principle of (Who, What, When Where, Why and How?). If you create content around all of these words and don't make your content sound like a sales pitch, your brand will organically get more exposure online and be shared among your target audience more frequently. This also adds credibility to your brand.3. Expand Your Digital Footprint: This can mean, place your relevant content on social media channels that connect with your audience. If you want Millennials, that's easy, they are everywhere and getting in front of them means using social media, mobile marketing techniques, blog, video and current responsive website tactics. The goal here is to create as many brand-specific landing pages and experiences online in as many places as possible - and all of this needs to be relevant and point to your brand. Don't forget, this also helps strengthen your SEO ranking.4. Mobile: This could be the most effective marketing medium ever created. If you're not using it or not considering it, shame on you. Find a way and carve out your own space to generate leads using smartphones. As you know, a high percentage of people in the US carry smartphones and this creates a platform and action that promotes share-ability for your marketing content. Additionally, text messages that users receive typically get read within 3 minutes - wow! Need I say more?If your brand wants to reach Millennials, take a look at a few research facts below that support that their lifestyle is purely digital.  Millennial generation and digital: • 93% are members of a customer rewards or loyalty programs • 90% have purchased something using a smart phone or tablet • 87% use social media to find info and share feedback about brands and products • 88% spend more than $50/month shopping online • 80% spend more than $50/month on E-tailers (Amazon, eBay) • 76% would consider shopping on their mobile devices easy • 74% discover products and services through friends  • 69% look for stores with sales and promotions Source: BuzzReport  Why Do CMOs Who Want Millennials As Customers Need Mobile Marketing?In many ways millennials share who they are through their mobile engagements-in both fast paced connections and contexts and in thoughtful comments and conversations. In order for a brand to illuminate its value to this powerful demographic group, brands must move mobile onto the center stage of their approach strategy--if they are to have a shot at earning this very smart audience's attention. But mobile only gets the brand into the right position with millennials--it is through timely genuine, and entertaining, content that a brand can hope to capture and retain the loyalty of this very smart audience. - Greg Thorson, 3CinteractiveWhat Next? If you made it this far, you have some ammunition to take back to your marketing team that will help them figure out what to do if your brand needs a change, especially if you are targeting millennials. Start asking questions internally about what data you want to collect and why? Also, think about what social channels you are using. Don't just publish content for the sake of publishing. Post on social channels with a purpose and clear direction. Use social channels that also have the types of users that you want and need. Lastly, think about mobile specific campaigns that will end up in your prospect's smartphone in their pocket or purse. Half the battle is getting your prospective customer to be exposed to your brand. With mobile, you definitely have a fighting chance, one that is clearly going to be around for a long time. Out with the old and in with the new. Thanks to the influential millennial generation, the transition is happening faster than we expected.  Follow Scott MacFarland on Twitter: @scmacfarland"

We're all well aware of the domestic issues at hand because every uproar comes with a hashtag in today's day and age.As a nation we've had to endure the terrorist acts of the Charleston shooting but we've also been able to relevate in the Supreme Court's decision to declare same sex marriage as a constitutional right. The Supreme Court also worked to keep Obama Care alive. As the Supreme Court continues to work for nationwide changes amongst all age groups and communities, our efforts from a millennial's perspective consists of social media enthusiasm.Times haven't changed, publicity has. As a result my greatest fear is that we continue to confuse activism with socialization. The media has made it seemingly instant to turn a handful of witnesses into hundreds of thousands of innocent digital bystanders. But above all, the most troubling thought I've come across is - why is tragedy the real trigger behind love? It seems as if we only see true unity after Dylann Roof's moves towards separation. Before Bree Newsome's spidey senses, retail stores only teetered on the idea of removing the Confederate Flag off of their online stores (where Nazi related items are still sold).Prior to these events, our sense of urgency only extended as far as our keyboards would allow us for the most part. That Instagram post is the new protest poster and that tweet made is usually the degree of our personal contributions towards the bigger difference. What change does social network activism really evoke? There's no doubt that awareness is brought to these situations that need to be brought to light, but often that awareness substitutes action. We're quick to assume someone else is making the needed change or that we aren't enough to spur the change ourselves. As you can see I didn't dive into the depth of the troubling racial/social instances that have engulfed our country this year. I'm more focused on how we as the people can work together to preach pro-activism rather than action in hindsight. Maybe these words will push the next person to make the change that we need to build systems in our nation that promote a more positive lifestyle for all. Or maybe these words will simply be appreciated for what they are and then brushed off. Either way, we can all agree that millennials have influence in numbers, but can we use it to make CHANGE rather than CHATTER."

Still, the 37-year-old “Magic Mike XXL” star says he wouldn’t necessarily encourage others in Hollywood to follow suit. “I think one thing that people don’t always take into consideration is a holistic aspect of what may or may not be going on in that individual’s life ― you know, what kind of relationship they have with their family, how the people around them feel about it,” he recently told PrideSource’s Chris Azzopardi. “But for me, having kids and being married, it was important to maintain the integrity of those relationships and not teach my kids that this is a shameful secret and that my husband has to be waiting in the wings all the time ... By the same token, I don’t hold anyone else accountable. It’s their choice.”The actor is also refreshingly candid about the gushing compliments paid to him by “Magic Mike XXL” co-star Channing Tatum during his recent Reddit AMA. Tatum said, “No matter if you’re a man, woman, cat [or] hamster, you will get lost in Matt Bomer’s eyes.” “I mean, obviously, I blushed,” Bomer said of the apparent man crush. “Knowing Channing, and what a kind soul he is, I guess when you’re the most handsome man on the planet ― and probably the most desired man on the planet ― you have the security to give those kinds of compliments. It made my day, of course!”He also reveals that his recent appearance alongside Tatum at the Los Angeles Pride parade was actually his co-star’s idea. “It wasn’t some PR move on his part ― he wanted to be inclusive, and that’s a big part of who he is as a human being,” Bomer said. “So, given the opportunity to work with him, and really everybody in this cast ― they’re just a great example of what we all can be, which are people who are secure in themselves, and loving and accepting of people no matter who they are and where they come from.”To read the full interview with Matt Bomer, head to PrideSource.
