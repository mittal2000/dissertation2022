Macias and Janet Hernandez, NCLRCarla Mena, a young aspiring American living in Raleigh, North Carolina, who received Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) in 2012, continues to be a committed and engaged member of her community. She is a sitting member of the Wake Health Services Board of Trustees and spends most of her spare time empowering youth through her work on the Youth Council at El Pueblo, Inc. This NCLR Affiliate taught Carla about the importance of helping Latinos achieve positive social change by building consciousness, capacity, and community action, a belief that has been part of their mission for over 20 years. Most recently, thanks to her hard work and determination, Carla was promoted to Bilingual Project Coordinator, a full-time position at Duke University's Global Health Institute. Now that she is a permanent employee, Carla enjoys an array of benefits including, among others, health insurance and a well-deserved salary increase. With these benefits, she can not only increase monetary contributions to her family but also contribute more to the local economy. These opportunities, however, wouldn't have been possible had it not been for her new status resulting from DACA.Carla recalls that she first learned about DACA on June 15, 2012. This date had a special significance to her and her family, as it marked the 10th anniversary of their arrival to the United States. ""I had recently graduated from college, and learning about this opportunity was a relief,"" she said. ""The first question I had was, when can I apply? My family and I hugged and cried from the emotion and the opportunity that this represented.""Today those memories are bittersweet, particularly because Carla fears that her parents -- as well as thousands of other parents in the same situation -- cannot join her in living the American Dream.Although Carla's story represents the reality that hundreds of thousands of young DACA recipients currently face, it also corroborates an undeniable fact: DACA works. This program's effectiveness suggests that the implementation of Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) could have an even greater impact on our country's economy and workforce.DAPA would provide opportunities for millions of skilled immigrants to work in fields where they can earn and contribute more. If DACA recipients have demonstrated in just three years what this program can do for communities like Raleigh, perhaps it's time to consider something more stable. As Carla puts it, ""Temporary programs are helpful, but a more permanent and more inclusive solution could be better."" Carla's story attests to the social and economic benefits of administrative relief, however, the overhaul of our immigration policies remain a critical task that congress must undertake.This was first posted to the NCLR Blog."

Steve King (R-Iowa) for his tremendously effective effort to assure your election in 2016. While some of the 2016 Republican contenders seek the holy grail of attracting the Hispanic vote, some other Republicans in Congress are openly contemptuous of the Hispanic community.King's series of anti-immigrant, ad hominem attacks are legendary -- but recently, he crossed a line from which there is no return.In what seemed like one of the most insulting debates so far in the House immigration committee that King vice-chairs, he maintains that the ""birthright citizenship"" provision of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution is no longer operative.Deeply disturbed by the idea that babies with undocumented mothers born in the U.S. automatically become citizens, like the children of all immigrants until now, he is calling not for a new amendment to the Constitution -- unlikely ever to be ratified -- but a legislative ""fix"" that would no longer honor the immigrant roots of this nation, and would further stigmatize undocumented people.Or more precisely, their American-born children.One more time, the man that has identified undocumented immigration as the biggest threat to America fails to offer a real immigration solution. Instead, he seeks the most radical position possible. Based on his statements, having a permanent underclass of workers in this country, workers without rights, is King's optimal state.We are faced with the reality that in today's Republican Party, a proposal to mangle the U.S. Constitution for partisan -- not to mention darker -- purposes is not only acceptable, but welcomed.I did a Google search for reactions from other Republicans to this idea. I could not find another member of Congress who stood up for the Constitution and America's traditions by criticizing King's outlandish proposal. Instead, there are the shrill voices of support for King and the mind-numbing silence of the rest of the GOP caucus.So a man who is the de facto leader of the House of the Representatives GOP's immigration policy is now taking his unhealthy obsession with immigrants to a whole new level: apartheid.Politically, King's birthright position is a sure loser. Barrels of ink have already been used in writing about how American Hispanics see the immigration crisis in our country. While some rather shallow readings of polls would suggest that Latinos are more interested in education and the economy (like all other Americans) than immigration, those same analysts fail to understand that immigration is a transcendent issue.People, unlike answers in a poll, live multidimensional lives. Yes, they worry about their jobs, economic opportunity, the quality of schools; but Latinos in particular filter the world through a prism that has immigration front and center. Why? It is a threshold matter -- it's about respect.So every time King and his allies sally forth with yet another attempt to deport the Dreamers, or in this case, to withdraw the constitutionally guaranteed citizenship right of a select group of Americans, they crash into a bigger reality.There is no path for a Republican candidate in 2016 without significant Latino voter support. This is a mathematical, demographic reality. Making believe that the shrunken electorate of 2014 is somehow a proxy for 2016 is delusional at best.I don't think that Latinos will vote for Clinton just because Republicans have repeatedly shown pure contempt for Latino immigrants and their children. Clinton will have to fight for every Latino vote, as she will to win support from all her voters.But when it comes to rapidly ascendant American Latino and Asian-American voters, Steve King and his radical ideas are the equivalent of several, well-funded SuperPacs dumping money in Hillary Clinton's favor."

Bush tax cuts of 1981, 2001, and 2003, respectively, were sold to America as ways to boost the economy and create jobs.They ended up boosting the take-home pay of those at the top. Most Americans saw no gains.In fact, the long stagnation of American wages began with Reaganomics. Wages rose a bit under Bill Clinton, and then started plummeting again under George W. Bush.Trickle-down economics proved a cruel hoax. The new jobs created under Reagan and George W. Bush paid lousy wages, the old jobs paid even less, and we ended up with whopping federal budget deficits.Then came the bailout of Wall Street in 2008. It was sold as the means of preserving the economy.It ended up preserving the jobs and exorbitant pay of bankers, but millions of Americans lost their shirts. Small savers were wiped out, and homeowners never got the refinancing they were promised. No conditions were put on the Wall Street banks for what they were supposed to do for the rest of us in return for our bailing them out. None of their top executives even went to jail for causing the crash in the first place. Here again, nothing trickled down.Now comes the Trans-Pacific Partnership.It's being sold as a way to boost the U.S. economy, expand exports, and contain China's widening economic influence.In fact, it's just more trickle-down economics.The biggest beneficiaries would be giant American-based global corporations, along with their executives and major shareholders.Those giant corporations initiated the deal in the first place, their lobbyists helped craft it behind closed doors, and they're the ones who have been pushing hard for it in Congress -- dangling campaign contributions in front of congressional supporters and threatening to cut off funding to opponents.These corporations made sure the deal contains provisions expanding and protecting their intellectual property around the world, but not protecting American jobs.Supporters of the deal say it contains worker protections. I heard the same thing when, as secretary of labor, I was supposed to implement the worker protections in the North American Free Trade Act.I discovered such provisions are unenforceable because of how difficult it is to discover if other nations are abiding by them. On the rare occasion when we found evidence of a breach we had no way to force the other nation to remedy it anyway. The Trans-Pacific Partnership is far larger than NAFTA -- covering 40 percent of America's global trade.If it's enacted, American workers and consumers will be made even worse off because of another provision that allows global corporations to sue countries whose health, safety, labor, or environmental regulations crimp their corporate profits.It establishes a tribunal outside any nation's legal system that can force a nation to reimburse global corporations for any such ""losses.""Big tobacco is already using an identical provision to sue developing nations that are trying to get their populations off nicotine. The tobacco companies are demanding these nations compensate them for lost cigarette sales. This provision would mean less protection from corporate harms here in America. It would require that when the potential cost of a new health, safety, environment, or labor protection is weighed against its potential benefits, the cost of reimbursing corporations for lost profits is added in.I've been through enough regulatory wars to know this added cost could easily tip the balance against protection.The arguments in favor of the deal aren't credible. The notion that the Trans Pacific Partnership will spark American exports doesn't hold because the deal does nothing to prevent other nations from manipulating their currencies in order to boost their own exports.The argument that the deal will help contain China makes even less sense.Does anyone seriously believe American-based corporations will put the interest of the United States above the interests of their own shareholders when it comes to doing whatever China demands to gain access to that lucrative market?Big American-based corporations have been cozying up to China for years -- giving China whatever American technology China wants, letting China ""partner"" with them in designing new generations of technology, and allowing China to censor their software and digital platforms -- all in exchange for a crack at Chinese consumers.What we should have learned by now about trickle-down economics is that nothing trickles down.If the Trans-Pacific Partnership is enacted, big corporations, Wall Street, and their top executives and shareholders will make out like bandits. Who will the bandits be stealing from? The rest of us.ROBERT B. REICH's film ""Inequality for All"" is now available on DVD and blu-ray, and on Netflix. Watch the trailer below:"

That myth, however, has had enormous staying power, and partly because it resonates within rock history.",2015-05-03,"An undated file photo shows ""Nirvana"" lead singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain performing on stage. Living fast and dying young has long been part of rock 'n' roll lore. And in this case, statistics affirm the image, according to a study released Tuesday, Sept. 4, 2007. Researchers at Liverpool John Moores University, whose report appeared in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, studied a sample of North American and British rock and pop stars and concluded they are more than twice as likely as the rest of the population to die an early death. The team analyzed the stars of rock, punk, rap, R&B, electronic and new age genres in the ""All Time Top 1,000"" albums, published in 2000. They then analyzed the artists - ranging from the late Elvis Presley to the still lively rapper Eminem tabulating how many had died and at what age. Cobain committed suicide at his home in Seattle on April 8, 1994. (AP Photo)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4b63e1f00002e0124281f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The myth surrounding Kurt Cobain casts him as a songwriting genius, rising to international fame while simultaneously -- but also problematically -- unwaveringly devoted to punk-rock authenticity. He unwillingly and reluctantly became the voice of a generation, and he hated the rockstar fame and adulation that came with it. During the last couple years of his life, he was addicted to drugs, in part using them as a way to escape the pressures and perhaps even disappointments of stardom. Success, the myth has it, drove Kurt to depression and ultimately to suicide -- the ultimate rejection of fame. The new HBO documentary, Montage of Heck, attempts to probe beyond the often-romantic hero worship of Cobain to get to the real Kurt. Director Brett Morgen was granted first-time access to a rich collection of Cobain's personal materials, including hundreds of tapes. Maybe this film, then, will also tell us something new about Nirvana's music.Rock documentaries tend not to focus on music-historical continuities and stylistic connections, and when they do, the observations are often simplistic, superficial or even incorrect. The worst in this regard tend to be the VH-1 Legends and Behind the Music episodes, but even the otherwise fantastic Beatles Anthology devotes proportionally little time to the band's music. Artist documentaries often concentrate, instead, on the personal lives of their subjects, and in a certain sense, the more troubled those lives are, the better. Such films are most powerful when they highlight dramatic and titillating personal struggles and events. They are the least appealing, by contrast, when they spend a lot of time talking about the music in any detail. Music can certainly create celebrity, but then it turns out that celebrity is the more interesting thing to talk about. I strongly suspect that Kurt Cobain would have preferred us to concentrate on the music, along with the culture and historical contexts around it. That is what historians will ultimately do anyway. Fifty years from now, the sensational details of Kurt's personal life will be a biographical footnote, while the band's music will live on.In the official video for ""In Bloom,"" the band has some fun with rock history.For music historians, Cobain and Nirvana are mostly important for the group's major-label debut, Nevermind, which rose to the top of the charts in early 1992, displacing Michael Jackson's Dangerous for the number-one slot, and signaling a fundamental shift in pop music: The mainstream arrival of alternative rock. As interesting as the album is in itself, it is perhaps more significant for the commercial doors it opened for other alt-rock bands, acting much as the Beatles' ""I Want To Hold Your Hand"" did to launch the British invasion almost 30 years earlier. The emphasis is often on how Nevermind disrupted and re-directed rock history. Viewed from a larger music-historical distance, Cobain's music also seems more continuous with the music that preceded it than it did back in the mid 1990s. Cobain reportedly listened to Meet the Beatles for three hours the day he wrote ""About a Girl""While Cobain himself was eager to point to influences from the punk scene from the late 1980s, his music also resonates with a wide range of even earlier artists. Kurt's lyrics are filled with a kind of playfulness and fascination with wordplay that can be found in the lyrics of John Lennon (""I Dig A Pony,"" ""Mean Mr. Mustard""), Bob Dylan, and even Chuck Berry. Nevermind producer Butch Vig remembers that all it took to get Kurt to double his vocals or add a harmony in the studio was to say, ""John Lennon did it."" Kurt quickly obliged. His rebelliousness is reminiscent not only of the Ramones and the Sex Pistols, but also of Pete Townshend and the Who in the mid 60s. Kurt once wrote, ""I hope I die before I turn into Pete Townshend,"" a reference to the famous line in ""My Generation."" And Kurt loved pop, at one point enthusing over the album, Get the Knack, while also having fun twisting the title of the hit single, ""My Sharona."" A crucial and central element in the Nirvana story is how the band re-fashioned elements drawn form rock's long history into a style that changed that history.The opening power chords of Boston's ""More Than a Feeling"" served as the basis for ""Smells Like Teen Spirit,"" though the respective harmonic progressions are different.Montage of Heck may help viewers see beyond the Cobain myth. That myth, however, has had enormous staying power, and partly because it resonates within rock history. Cobain's early death is much like those of Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison and Janis Joplin (all died at 27), feeding the popular fascination with untimely demise. The element of depression reminds us of Marilyn Monroe or Brian Jones (and there are many more). Some have openly speculated that Cobain was clinically depressed, a condition that went back years before his drug addiction, and was almost completely undiagnosed and untreated during his lifetime. If so, it suggests that Cobain's tragic death was not heroic in its rejection of a life of fame: What was heroic was that he held out so long against the darkness.Further readingMichael Azerrad, Come As You Are: The Story of Nirvana (Broadway Books, 2001).Kurt Cobain, Journals (Riverhead, 2002).Charles R.

Part 1 of this post challenged public and private investors to build infrastructure for a 21st century clean energy economy rather than repairing and expanding infrastructure designed for fossil fuels. Part 2 describes how the evolution of a clean energy economy is putting increased pressure conventional electric utilities and their regulators.When Elon Musk introduced the latest in battery technology last week, it was a Steve Jobs moment. Musk wants to do for energy technology what Jobs did for information technology: Revolutionize it.In an auditorium whose lights and media equipment were powered by sunlight stored in his latest invention, Musk unveiled wall-mounted and surprisingly affordable battery packs as elegant-looking as Apple's iPhone (see the unit in the photo with one of Musk's electric vehicles). They even come in a choice of colors. The electric battery was invented more than 200 years ago. In modern times, it has been the weak link in applications such as electric vehicles and energy storage; by most accounts the technology still has a distance to go before it is optimized for applications like these. Musk's vision is to allow households and communities to become as independent from the aging electric grid as smart-phone users are from landlines. In customary big-think, he says that two billion of the devices could eliminate the world's use of carbon fuels, slow down climate change and give reliable electric power to people in less-developed countries. Last week's rollout was a happy event for renewable energy enthusiasts, but it was another rude reminder for America's electric utilities and regulators that their business and regulatory models lag years behind our rapidly emerging clean energy technologies. It's as though Musk unveiled a new automobile that can travel safely at 250 miles an hour while the nation's speed limits are stuck at 55. Innovation is not going to slow down so regulators can catch up.Some of the challenges that utility regulators face can be described with several terms that are familier in policy circles. The first term is load defection. It is what occurs when customers put solar panels on their roofs to produce more of their own electricity and buy less of it from their utility. These distributed solar systems grew more than 400 percent between 2010 and 2014 according to the Energy Information Administration. Solar homes usually use the conventional grid as backup when the sun doesn't shine; in many states, homeowners can sell or ""net meter"" excess power back to their utilities when they produce more than they use. An even more disruptive development is grid defection. Batteries that do a good job storing power are one of the advances that will enable households and communities to divorce themselves entirely from the conventional electric system. Navigant Research reports there is growing interest in micro-grids -- small electric generation and distribution systems that can allow a community or large institution to separate from the utility system during a power outage, or to become completely independent of the grid. Navigant predicts the micro-grid market will grow to $20 billion by 2020. A third issue has to do with stranded assets in the fossil energy sector. These are assets that end up unused and investments whose returns are not fully realized. An example of stranded assets are coal plants that shut down before the end of their useful lives because they cannot compete with cleaner fuels like natural gas, or because of the cost to comply with regulatory constraints on pollution. Investments in oil and gas wells, pipelines and related infrastructure could become stranded if it becomes necessary to limit fossil energy production to prevent climate change from growing worse. Investments in new electric transmission and distribution lines could become stranded by a proliferation of micro-grids and distributed power generation. The flip side of stranded assets is committed carbon. If we were to build new pipelines and fossil-fired power plants and insist on using them until the end of their design lives, they lock us in to future carbon pollution unless acceptable technical solutions such as carbon capture and sequestration can be devised. Dealing with these trends and issues requires forward thinking by investors, power companies, legislatures and regulators. That is difficult because we do not have a consensus national energy plan to provide reasonable certainty about which investments will pay off. Investment also would be safer if Congress established a price on carbon pollution to give accurate market signals about which resources and technologies are most competitive in a carbon-constrained world. It seems unlikely we will get these tools in today's political environment, but without them we will see more false starts, more wasted money and more committed carbon in the years ahead. In a more rational world, the hundreds of billions of dollars we must spend to modernize America's energy systems would not only accommodate the clean energy revolution; they would empower it. Our old electric power system has been called the greatest engineering achievement of the 20th century. The innovations by the many ingenious pioneers of the past contributed to a remarkable system that delivers modern electricity to virtually every part of America. The reinvention of that system, led by a new generation of pioneers, has the potential to become one of the greatest engineering achievements of the 21st century. But only if we are smart enough to let it happen."

Dachau was the first Nazi concentration camp and began operation in 1933 to hold political prisoners, though it later expanded to include Jews, common criminals and foreign nationals.

""They all admonish us to never forget. No, we will never forget. We'll not forget for the sake of the victims, for our own sake, and for the sake of future generations.""The Nazis set up Dachau in March 1933, weeks after Adolf Hitler took power, to detain political rivals. It became the prototype for a network of camps where 6 million Jews were murdered, as well as Roma, Russians, Poles and homosexuals.More than 200,000 people were being held in the camp when U.S. troops liberated it on April 29, 1945. Television footage from Dachau, showing starved inmates and piles of bodies, was among the first images the world saw of the Holocaust.""It was a terrible shock, but we will never forget your excitement as you hugged us and brought out a hand-sewn American flag you hid for the occasion,"" said a former U.S. soldier, Alan Lukens. ""The Nazis could not crush your spirit.""Jean Samuel, a French resistance fighter, said he felt like a human again on the day the Americans arrived. ""It was the best day of my life,"" he said. ""The nightmare was finally over.""The main gate with its cynical slogan ""Arbeit macht frei"" (Work sets you free) was rebuilt by a local blacksmith after the original was stolen last year. Merkel said it was alarming that the gate was never found. She also lamented that Jewish institutions need round-the clock police protection in Germany.""These camps keep our memories alive, despite all the adversity out there,"" Merkel said. ""There are unfortunately incidents again and again such as the theft of the Dachau gate last year that are disturbing.""In a recent opinion poll, some 42 percent of Germans said they want to draw a line under an intense focus on the Nazi past in German media.

Marilyn Mosby, Baltimore City state's attorney, ruled the death of Freddie Gray a homicide and that criminal charges would be filed against six Baltimore City Police officers. Gray, 25, was arrested for possessing a switch blade knife on April 12 outside the Gilmor Homes housing project on Baltimore's west side. According to his attorney, Gray died a week later in the hospital from a severe spinal cord injury he received while in police custody.

But in a sharp departure from many prior incidents, Baltimore prosecutors found the officers had broken the law both in arresting Gray and in roughly handling him.""What happened in Baltimore sets the bar for prosecutors across the country,"" said State Senator Catherine Pugh. ""It raises the standard of what you can do.""After a day of violence on Monday, when rioters torched buildings and cars and threw rocks at police, the mostly black city of 620,000 people has seen a week of largely peaceful demonstrations and marchers that swelled into the thousands of people on Friday and Saturday after charges were brought.Maryland's Governor, Larry Hogan, called for a day of prayer and reconciliation on Sunday.""As we begin to rebuild and restore, let us renew our faith in the true spirit of our city and its people,"" Hogan said. ""I pray that tomorrow will be a day of reflection.""On Friday, prosecutor Marilyn Mosby said the Maryland state medical examiner had ruled Gray's death a homicide. She said he was unlawfully arrested and the officers repeatedly ignored his pleas for medical help while he was handcuffed, shackled and lying face down in the back of a police van.Investigations of police killings of unarmed black men last year in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York had concluded the officers involved had acted within the law, triggering waves of sometimes violent protests.Gene Ryan, president of the Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police, said he was disappointed with ""the apparent rush to judgment"" in charging the officers.Police on Saturday arrested at least a dozen people for violating the 10 p.m. curfew that has been in place since Tuesday night. They were a tiny fraction of the thousands who marched through the city's streets for hours.Officers in patrol uniforms, rather than riot gear, mingled with the crowd for much of the evening at an intersection where buildings had been burned in Monday's rioting. Police and citizens chatted amiably, in a possible sign of improving relations.Travis Robertson, a 33-year-old law student, spoke to one officer.""At first, I didn't want to listen to her because I have had bad experiences with police...,"" Robertson said. ""But as we talked, I could see that she was one of the good ones. There are definitely bad officers out there, but there are good ones too.""

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae0b2f3c000018010b5e46.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A Maryland prosecutor has charged a Baltimore police officer with a major felony charge in the killing of an unarmed young black male who was not charged with any crime. The case has drawn intense media attention and stirred public rage. Prosecutors in bringing charges are confident that they can get a conviction. And why not? There are many witnesses that say the victim was not committing a crime, there was no provocation, and he was unarmed. The coroner classified the killing as a homicide. The Maryland prosecutor in the case is not Maryland State Attorney Marilyn Mosby. The victim is not Freddie Gray. The officer charged with the killing was not the officers Mosby is charging with the slaying of Gray. The slaying did not happen in April 2015. It happened in 2008. The victim was Edward Lamont Hunt. He was shot dead by Baltimore police officer Tommy Sanders. The charge against Sanders was voluntary manslaughter. Hunt's alleged offense was that he supposedly stared too hard at Sanders in a shopping center, and when he tried to search him, he ran off. He opened fire when he thought he was reaching for something. The story was potentially bogus, and it seems Sanders could have told the tall tale to cover his wanton slaying of Hunt.During the four-day trial, the prosecution called eight witnesses who testified that they never saw Hunt reach into his jacket as he fled or saw Hunt assault the officer. The defense called only three witnesses. Two of them were police experts who said that Sanders simply followed standard Baltimore police guidelines in the detaining of a possible suspect. The other witness was Sanders who claimed that he feared for his safety in the encounter. That was enough for the jury. Sanders was acquitted. Seven years later, Baltimore police officers are back in a court docket on multiple charges. The Sanders case, and the handful of other similar cases, where cops are tried in the killings and assaults on unarmed civilians once again raise the eternal and deeply troubling question: Will a jury convict them?In 2010, a Bureau of Justice Statistics report found racial discrimination in jury selection is still rampant, even blatant. A Supreme Court ruling and other court rulings that ban all white or non-black juries have been in far too many cases no more than paper decisions that have had little effect in insuring a diverse jury in cases involving black defendants. The same holds true where blacks have been the victims, and whites or non-blacks the defendants. That's even more the case when the defendants are police officers. Mosby cleared the first colossal hurdle with the indictment of the cops. To get that far is in itself the rarest of rarities. Here's how rare: Police have killed thousands of unarmed civilians in the decade since 2005 but according to a survey by the Washington Post and researchers at Bowling Green State University, only 54 officers have been charged in the shootings and virtually all have been acquitted if they ever get to trial. The Bureau of Justice Statistic report gave a big clue why it's virtually impossible for juries to face the brutal reality that some cops do wantonly kill. It comes down to the racial make-up and the ingrained biases of the jurors, no matter what their color. On that point, it did find that a racially diverse jury weighed evidence and testimony longer and more carefully, brought different perspectives and life experiences to the deliberations, and made fewer factual errors. These are crucial factors in the rare cases where cops are charged with killing young black or Hispanics. On the other hand, a jury with no blacks, composed of mostly older middle class whites, and non-black ethnics, is much more likely to believe the testimony of police and prosecution witnesses than black witnesses, defendants or even the victims. In the Sanders trial, Hunt family members were outraged that the jurors chose to believe the testimony of the shooter, Sanders, rather than eight witnesses who flatly contradicted his version of the killing.Prosecutors know it's a tough hill to climb with jurors in police abuse cases and in surveys and interviews have said as much. This is one of two big reasons that they almost never bring charges against cops who kill even in the most blatant, outrageous and over-the-top killings. Prosecutor's business is first and foremost fighting crime. They must rely on and work in lockstep with policed departments to have any success. But it's still the problem of convincing a jury that cops deserve jail time for deadly assaults and killings.In three major racially charged cases in past years where blacks were the victims either beaten or killed by white cops -- Rodney King, Oscar Grant and Sean Bell -- defense attorneys depicted all three men as the aggressors who posed a threat to the officers. They played up and exaggerated their run-ins with the law to depict young blacks as crime prone, menacing figures. Almost certainly, they'll trot out the same script with Gray. The idea is to subtly and openly play on the prejudices, stereotypes and negative beliefs of many white jurors toward young blacks. Mosby acted swiftly and courageously in indicting the cops who killed Gray. But as time has shown, it's one thing to indict and another to convict cops. Let's hope this go-round it will be different.Earl Ofari Hutchinson is an author and political analyst. He is a weekly co-host of the Al Sharpton Show on American Urban Radio Network.

But I cannot remember a time when journalists and journalism were under greater threat. Once, journalists were sacrosanct and protected; now they are targeted and hounded and imprisoned with impunity. So far this year, 27 journalists have been killed, including the grisly beheadings of James Foley and Steven Sotloff, who once worked for me at TIME. Last year, more than 220 journalists were jailed around the world. Freedom House's annual report found that global press freedom in 2014 had descended to its lowest point in a decade. Being a reporter has become one of the world's most dangerous professions. At a time when the supply of information seems unlimited and overwhelming, journalists and journalism are being challenged like never before. It seems contradictory, but it makes a perverse kind of sense. Despots and autocrats and terrorists are threatened by the free flow of information, and they are targeting not only the messengers but the message. Restrictive press-laws are on the rise. Government-controlled and manipulated media is becoming the norm rather than the exception. The free flow of information is the enemy of tyranny. But governments and non-state actors are not only restricting the free flow of information, they are manufacturing their own versions of reality and dispensing it as though it were news. There is a global epidemic of misinformation and propaganda. This is not an information war, but a war on truth -- on the very idea that there is a reality that can be verified. Their goal is not so much to make people accept their distorted version of the truth, but to make people question whether there is any truth at all. The first priority for us at the State Department is free, unfettered, uncensored access to information. The remedy for misinformation is often just more information. The American Founders believed that freedom and free access to information were inextricably linked. They understood that a free press was the foundation of other freedoms. Thomas Jefferson said a nation could never be ignorant and free. Despots and terrorists thrive on ignorance and perish from freedom of expression. On World Press Freedom Day, we pay special honor to the value of a free press and those journalists who are both the symbols and brave practitioners of it. The State Department's Edward R. Murrow Program for Journalists has welcomed more than 1,000 international journalists to the U.S. over the last ten years to examine the link between independent media and democracy. Our annual ""Free the Press"" campaign profiles journalists and media outlets who are censored, attacked, and threatened. The State's Department's bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor details the state of media freedom around the world in its human rights reports and supports more than 40 international programs focused on investigative reporting, tools, and training for journalists, and increasing diversity in media. For example, DRL's SAFE initiative provides state-of-the art security training for journalists around the world. From urging the release of the Washington Posts' Jason Rezaian in Iran to combating the legal restrictions imposed on journalists, we will work to protect and extend press freedom around the world. Information is the lifeblood of freedom and the ability to make informed choices for yourself, your community and your nation. As Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence almost 250 years ago, governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. You can't agree to anything without the free access to information upon which that consent is based. That's the message of World Press Freedom Day."

(Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4b61a3c000018010cb07d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"""Saturday Night Live"" alumni tend to form predictable career paths: They star in broad comedies that double as extensions of their work on the series, then attempt to wow us with an off-kilter dramatic performance that confirms they're worth more than sketch-show idiosyncrasies. Some forge their own paths in television (see: Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jimmy Fallon), but most linger in the admittedly fruitful shadow of the famous words ""live from New York."" Kristen Wiig, on the other hand, has been quietly breaking with her ""SNL"" heritage since exiting the show in 2012, and this year offers a trifecta of films in which the actress not only masters dramatic roles -- she is a marvel in them.First up is ""Welcome to Me,"" which opened in select theaters this weekend and expands nationwide on May 8. Wiig's best role since ""Bridesmaids,"" the film casts her as Alice Klieg, an Oprah-obsessed hermit with borderline personality disorder who uses her $86 million lottery winnings to fund her own daytime talk show. Its topics, all of which revolve around Alice, are very un-Oprah-like. Instead of finding ""aha moments,"" Alice devours an entire piece of homemade meatloaf cake (after discussing its ""carbohydrant"" quantity), reenacts melodramatic moments from her adolescence and neuters dogs on live television. That description sounds like one long ""SNL"" sketch, and parts of ""Welcome to Me"" very well could have been. But that's what makes the movie a perfect interlude in Wiig's career: The accessories of her broad-comedy background are intact, but what resounds is a heartfelt character study that never reduces Alice's mental condition to a punch line.  Wiig, whose participation in movies like Paul Feig's female-centered ""Ghostbusters"" reboot indicate she hasn't abandoned big-budget comedies, does not think of her indie-film trajectory as strategic. In fact, while discussing ""Welcome to Me"" earlier this week, Wiig told The Huffington Post that she receives fewer ""SNL""-esque scripts than one might imagine. There's a misperception, then, that her dramatic parts -- which have recently included ""Hateship, Loveship"" and ""The Skeleton Twins"" -- mean she is drifting away from the comedic realm. ""It's just the timing of it,"" she promised.Still, by the end of 2015, audiences will have a fuller interpretation of Wiig's range. In August, the '70s-set ""Diary of a Teenage Girl,"" based on Phoebe Gloeckner's graphic novel of the same name, will arrive with almost no ""SNL"" trappings whatsoever. One of this year's Sundance Film Festival standouts, the dramedy finds Wiig playing Charlotte Worthington, a self-absorbed Patty Heast obsessive glued to the halcyon hippie days that have just passed her by. Meanwhile, Charlotte's boyfriend (Alexander Skarsgård) is having an affair with her dumpy teenage daughter (Bel Powley). Powley is at the film's center, but Wiig's performance is her most dynamic work yet. In Charlotte, she captures both the anger and idealism that boiled beneath 1974 San Francisco as it reeled from Watergate and the Vietnam War. Also due out in the near future is ""Nasty Baby,"" an even smaller-scale indie about a gay couple in Brooklyn (Sebastián Silva and Tunde Adebimpe) attempting to have a baby with their close friend. A down-to-earth Wiig portrays said friend in the movie, which begins mostly as a comedy before its third act takes a swift dive into thriller territory. After premiering at Sundance, ""Nasty Baby"" was acquired without a set release date. If it opens in 2015, the movie could be sandwiched between Wiig's part in this summer's bombastic heist comedy ""Masterminds"" -- the latest offering from ""Napoleon Dynamite"" director Jared Hess -- and a supporting role in Ridley Scott's much-anticipated ""The Martian,"" which could factor into next year's Oscar race. For ""Welcome to Me"" director Shira Piven, there was never any doubt that the same actress who gave us Target Lady and Gilly would fit firmly into Eliot Laurence's script, which Piven helped to develop. She told HuffPost she was targeting a performer who existed in a ""comic space"" and could stretch into dramatic characterizations, rather than the other way around -- Bill Murray in ""Lost in Translation,"" for example. (Were she to recruit a dramatic actress who can pull off comedy, Piven said Kate Winslet would have been her first choice, citing ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" as evidence.)""We batted around a lot of lists of actresses, but in my mind she was really the one,"" Piven said of Wiig. ""I love those performances from comic actors who are asked to do something really heartbreaking.""Wiig was the first to sign on, and a slew of others followed: Linda Cardellini as Alice's patient best friend; Tim Robbins as her patient therapist; James Marsden, Wes Bentley, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Joan Cusack as the patient network executives who supervise Alice's show. Wiig acknowledges that Alice is hard to like, but because the character occupies some of the same fictional space that her ""SNL"" roles did, Alice's idiosyncrasies -- often tied to the demonstrative facial expressions that highlight Wiig's humor -- accentuate the character's oddities without dehumanizing her. ""Eliot wrote such a detailed description of this character that I kind of just pictured it in my head as I was reading it,"" she said. ""It was so great just having him on set, even for little things like saying, 'I feel like when I walk maybe I should be a little stiff up top.' He was like, 'Oh yeah, show me. Yeah, that feels like her.' Because she has a mental illness, I wanted to be respectful of it and not comment on it and not make fun of her in any way, and if comedy came out of it, it was because of her just doing something funny, not because she’s sick.""There's something similar happening in ""The Diary of a Teenage Girl,"" where Wiig is in full bad-mother mode. Unlikeable for entirely different reasons, the character still manages to ignite sympathy because Wiig's performance is full-bodied in both appearance and actions. In keeping, this transition to deeper storytelling seems natural for someone whose more memorable ""Saturday Night Live"" moments seemed to inhabit her entire body, à la Dooneese and impressions of Suze Orman and Liza Minnelli. In the same way that Wiig's Oscar-nominated screenplay for ""Bridesmaids"" (written with Annie Mumolo) was heralded as a watershed for women in comedy, the future of Wiig's career seems destined to become one of the ""SNL"" roster's big-screen triumphs.That's the mark of a prosperous ""Saturday Night Live"" departure: a career that draws from and dismisses its sketch-comedy roots in the same breath. Meet Kristen Wiig, burgeoning indie queen."

18,FIFTY,10 Things You Can Do To Help You Live To Be 100,Ann Brenoff,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/things-you-can-do-to-live-to-100_n_7127796.html,,2015-05-03,"Paraguayan Anacleto Escobar (R), veteran of the Chaco War (1932-1935) fought between Paraguay and Bolivia, and his wife Cayetana Roman, smile during a ceremony coinciding with his 100th birthday in which they received a house -- the first in their lives they own -- as a gift for his merits, in Neembucu, Paraguay, on January 7, 2015. The event was organized by the governor of the state of Neembucu, Carlos Silva, to honour Escobar. AFP PHOTO / STR (Photo credit should read --/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb67360250000320039a552.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It seems that almost every day we read about another centenarian swimming across the English Channel blind-folded with one hand tied behind his back or jumping out of an airplane while she knits a scarf without dropping a single stitch. OK, slight exaggerations perhaps, but without a doubt, more people are living to the ripe old age of 100 -- or longer. Certainly, medical advances are a principal reason behind the longevity boost and to a large extent you will play the genes you are dealt. But here are a few more ways to improve your odds of reaching a triple-digit birthday:1. Run like your life depends on it. Why? Because it may. Stanford University researchers tracked runners and non-runners for 21 years. They found that runners didn't just get less heart disease, they also had fewer cancers, infections and neurologic diseases -- and yes, they live longer. Study author Eliza Chakravarty was quoted in Time saying, ""Aerobic exercise keeps the immune system young."" How much exercise is enough to make a difference? Opinions vary but If you don't like to run, even 20 minutes a day of any activity that leaves you breathless can boost your health, she says. Even a moderate jog can add between five and six years to your life, according to a 2012 analysis of data from a Copenhagen City Heart study. But gains from running do hit a place of diminished returns when it comes to longevity. Researchers from the University of South Carolina found that people who run more than 20 miles a week, faster than seven miles an hour, or more than five times a week, lose the longevity boost.Bottom line: Exercise and you may live longer.2. Eat the right colors. Diets rich in green and purple vegetables are good not only for your heart, but also as a way to protect against Alzheimer's disease. One study found those who ate plants from the mustard family -- broccoli, cauliflower and cabbage -- tended to have a reduced risk of total and cardiovascular disease mortality. The vegetables contain vitamin C, which brings health perks.Eat red -- as in red meat -- only in small amounts if you must, please. Vegetarians have a 12 percent lower risk of premature death than their meat-eating cohorts, according to a JAMA Internal Medicine study that included 73,308 Seventh-Day Adventist men and women who do not eat meat for religious reasons.Elderly people who eat a Mediterranean diet -- which is high in fish and vegetables and low in animal products like milk and red meat -- have about a 20 percent increased chance of living longer compared with their non-Mediterranean-eating counterparts, according to a Swedish study reported in the journal AGE. They live an estimated two to three years longer than those who don't, Gianluca Tognon, scientist at the Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, said in a statement reported in HuffPost.3. Act like a squirrel.Scamper freely through life and eat nuts. In other words, have fun! When you think about it, aren't squirrels really just little self-contained parties -- darting around the park chasing one another, dodging cars in a game of ""Chicken,"" mocking your dog who is leashed and can't reach them? They are happy little guys.Happier people live longer. A 2011 study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that among older people, the group that scored as “happiest” (having the highest “positive affect”) had a death rate of 3.6 percent -- less than half the death rate of the unhappiest group, which was 7.3 percent.And while we're talking squirrels, let's not ignore the value of nuts. Eating nuts could help you live longer, according to a study in BioMed Central of 7,000 people ages 55 to 90. The study found that nut eaters had a 39 percent lower risk of early death from cancer or cardiovascular disease, and walnut eaters in particular had a 45 percent lower risk of early death from cancer or cardiovascular disease than non-nut eaters. 4. Make sure you return your stomach to its original upright position. Extra weight in your mid-section isn't good for your longevity. Post-menopausal woman who have lost their waistline are at a higher risk for heart disease and diabetes, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center. It's harder to keep a stomach flat after menopause because shifting hormones cause the extra weight to settle in your mid-section. Scientists working for the International Menopause Society looked at published studies on the impact of menopause on body weight. They concluded that the loss of the estrogen leads to a change in the pattern of body fat, which shifts from the hips to the abdomen.5. Be alert to what you no longer can smell. An NIH-supported study involving approximately 3,000 older individuals showed that those who could no longer detect or distinguish odors were four times more likely to die within five years than those with normal olfaction. The findings were the first to indicate the importance of olfaction in mortality risk for older adults.Still think your sense of smell doesn't matter? It's actually responsible for your sense of taste. Try holding your nose when you eat chocolate. You will be able to distinguish between its sweetness and bitterness, but you won't be able to identify the chocolate flavor. That's because the distinguishing characteristic of chocolate is largely identified by our sense of smell as aromas are released during chewing, the NIH website states. 6. Laugh a lot.  In a 2012 study published in the journal Aging, Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Yeshiva University researchers identified what personality characteristics that a group of 243 centenarians had in common. Among them? They all found a reason to laugh a lot. “They considered laughter an important part of life,” the lead researcher said.7. Learn to drink tea the healthy way. Both green and black teas contain a concentrated dose of catechins, substances that relax blood vessels and protect your heart. In a Japanese study of more than 40,500 men and women, those who consumed green tea had a lower risk of dying from heart disease. Other studies involving black tea showed similar results.Ready-to-drink teas don't count because the catechins degrade once water is added. And some studies suggest that adding milk diminishes tea's protective effects on the cardiovascular system; stick to lemon or honey.8. Be a giver, not a taker. Generous people give of themselves in many ways. They do favors, pay compliments, go out of their way to help others. And what they get in return for it is, among other things, a longer life. Researchers from the University of Buffalo found a link between giving and having a lower risk of early death. “Our conclusion is that helping others reduced mortality specifically by buffering the association between stress and mortality,"" study researcher Michael J. Poulin, Ph.D., an assistant professor of psychology at the University at Buffalo, told PsychCentral.9. Keep busy. While you may joke and say that you plan on spending the first year of your retirement napping on the front porch, the best way to extend your life may be to keep working. Of the men who were subjects of Harvard’s famed Longevity Project, those who made it into old, old age had successful, satisfying careers and continued to work -- at least on a part-time basis -- into their 70s. ""The stress that comes from an ambitious career can be beneficial to health,"" The Atlantic noted in a quote from the Longevity Project book. 10. Don't binge-watch TV. Every hour of TV you watch after age 25 cuts your lifespan by about 22 minutes, according to research from The University of Queensland, Australia. They also found that people who sat in front of a television screen for an average six hours a day died nearly five years sooner than people who didn't watch any TV. We can only assume they don't get Netflix in Australia.It's not the TV per se that does the damage, but the inactivity that occurs while you watch it.Have any of your own tips to add?

One woman who had just been focused on her laptop approaches, saying, ""I'm going through this same thing with my mother. She's 85. Do you mind if I join in?""""No, no, it's fine,"" comes the echo from three others. ""I've been looking at five places,"" the balding man explains. ""The one I like, it has independent living, it has assisted living. But for my mother, the problem is accents.""""Your mother has an accent?""""No, it's the accents of the staff. They're from all over and she can't understand them.""I sit and watch and listen, remembering it all. The resistance (my mother), the frustration (my father, me), the pain (everyone, everywhere). It's been 20 years since the roles reversed on me. Suddenly I was the parent -- cajoling, coaxing, pleading, gently scolding. Dutifully watching over, ready to break a fall, prevent a slip, steady a wobble. Helping get in and out of the car, buckling seat belts, holding hands, interlocking arms going up and down stairs. I want to get up and tell this ever-widening group of not-so-baby boomers to prepare for one of the worst experience of their lives -- to let them know that no matter what they do, who they talk to, where their parent ends up, it will hurt. It will hurt their hearts forever. A sadness will envelope them, an ache will endure. Mortality knocks. First for your parents, then for you.Watching your parents age and being the one on the front lines of denial -- I'm not moving, I'm not selling the house, I'm going to keep driving my car, I don't need help -- slaps you awake into a reality no one wants, or is prepared, to face. Not parents, not children, and sometimes it seemed to me, not American society.I've never felt so alone, so helpless, so conflicted as I did when I packed up 40 years worth of family possessions from the only home I ever knew while my parents sat, usually in the dark, and usually silent.I was 35 years old, the youngest of six kids and the most available to upstage my life (read: single, no kids). Talk of being the ""sandwich"" generation, taking care of both children and parents, was just beginning. I took family leave from my newspaper job to help my parents pack up their house in the suburbs of Buffalo, N.Y. The plan was to move them to the Northwest where my sister and brother had settled more than 30 years ago, and where five grandchildren lived. After much searching, my sister had found an apartment for them in a retirement home that served nice meals, planned many activities, and provided round-the-clock security.I had measured the furniture and my sister had figured out what would fit into the two-bedroom place with a living room, small kitchen and tiny patio. The matching buffet dining set, my father's motorized reclining chair, my mother's piano were Seattle bound. April 1995: My parents watching the piano being loaded onto the moving van.  Photo by Patricia GuthrieArranging the moving van, setting the moving date, finding a realtor, selling the car, selling the sailboat were just some of my jobs. My main task: packing up and clearing out a six-bedroom, two-story house with an attic chock full of memories and a basement cluttered with abandoned tools and toys. Railroad sets, darkroom equipment, beer-making kits. A busted sink from a long ago too-wild my-parents-are-out-of-town high school party. Among the layers of a lifetime, I uncovered were my father's chemistry sets and his father's shaving razor.He tried to help. But congestive heart failure left my dad living in slow motion while Parkinson's disease clouded his emotions and judgment. One time when I was cleaning out the garage (a task I soon gave up on, decreeing all contents to the home buyer), I watched my father slowly walk to the curb carrying a small box. He put it down near the overflowing garbage cans. Waiting until he returned to the house, I opened it up and inspected the contents. Inside were hand-drawn comic strips of a futuristic rocket man, neatly collected in a three-ring notebook. His admiration of Buck Rogers was well known as were these wonderful drawings from his 16-year-old imagination. Grabbing the treasure, I marched inside the house and confronted my dad.""Why did you leave this out with the trash?""""That's old stuff. No one wants it. I'm just trying to help.""My father died months after we moved them. He probably knew that would be the case. He also knew what none of us had figured out -- his wife of 54 years, my dear stoic mother of Norwegian and English stock, needed to be pushed into a new life no matter how much it hurt. It took her a few years (and some new anti-depressants and anti-anxiety pills), but she blossomed. She gladly attended the old lady gatherings of red hats and made a habit of keeping old prescription bottles brimming with nickels and dimes. She even grew so confident as to agree to duet piano recitals.When mom died five years ago at age 91, she was the oldest -- not in years, but in residence of her building. I had moved to Seattle from Atlanta three years earlier to spend time with her. She was not the same mother I had known so many seasons before, sitting in a lawn chair sadly watching her piano roll up the moving van ramp. We took short road trips together, to see fields of blossoming tulips and sip tastes of local wines. She even went out on ""dates"" a few times with another resident to a nearby Jack-in-the-Box. Stan wore a bow tie with a tucked-in flannel shirt and jeans. My father had worn clip-on bow ties before switching to his ever-present ""string"" tie. I never knew this until I found a small bag of bow ties preserved among my mother's slips.I keep them lined up on my dresser next to the bottled bingo winnings of my mother.

In the late 19th century, bison numbers in the American West plummeted from well over 20 million to a mere 23 animals in the wild. Photo by Jeff Burrell ©WCS.The shipment was an extraordinary achievement - the start of what would become the first successful organized conservation effort to save a species from extinction. In the ensuing decades the wild bison population would rebound to close to 25,000, with another quarter million maintained as managed herds in every state in the union. So inspiring is the end result that one could be forgiven in forgetting the work required to make it happen.Two years earlier, in 1905, Bronx Zoo Director William T. Hornaday brought together a group of diverse stakeholders to form the American Bison Society (ABS). With President Theodore Roosevelt as honorary president, ABS set out to prevent the extinction of the American bison by establishing a number of small herds in widely separated parts of the country. Anticipating the challenge, Hornaday had already lobbied the Congress to set aside federal land in Oklahoma for the purpose of creating game preserves (as ABS would later do for land in South Dakota and Nebraska). Hornaday now gathered available bison from around the northeast to establish a small population at the Bronx Zoo, operated by NYZS (today the Wildlife Conservation Society, or WCS).  In 1907 the American Bison Society arranged for 15 bison donated by the New York Zoological Society (now the Wildlife Conservation Society, or WCS) to be shipped by railway from the Bronx Zoo to the Wichita National Forest and Game Preserve in Oklahoma. Photo ©WCS.To defray the cost of transporting the animals west, the ABS worked with both Wells Fargo and American Express. The public was also engaged. Between 1908 and 1909, conservation-minded individuals from 29 states - as well as the District of Columbia, England, Canada, and France - made personal contributions, raising more than $10,500 in support of the Montana National Bison herd. Hornaday juggled these disparate elements of his campaign expertly. Decades before Rachel Carson's passionate call for the protection of our forests, streams, and pastures in her book Silent Spring, Hornaday helped to establish a veritable blueprint for modern environmental movement-building - one that he would apply again and again to achieve the vision and goals of the zoological society.As WCS turns 120 this week, it continues that tradition of effective conservation movement building begun a century ago. The past two years have seen perhaps the most ambitious and successful of these efforts with the creation of the 96 Elephants campaign. The campaign takes its name from the roughly 35,000 elephants being killed across Africa each year for their ivory - a figure that translates into 96 elephants per day, or one every 15 minutes.  With the slaughter of African elephants reaching 35,000 a year (96 a day), WCS established the 96 Elephants campaign in 2013, joining leaders of elephant range states, NGO partners, and the Clinton Global Initiative (above) in a commitment to stop the killing, stop the trafficking, and stop the demand for elephant ivory. Photo by Julie Larsen Maher ©WCS.Responding to the devastating poaching crisis, the 96 Elephants campaign developed a three-prong strategy to curtail the illegal ivory trade: stop the killing, stop the trafficking, and stop the demand. Central to this effort has been an acknowledgement that the United States has itself played a large role in driving demand for ivory. With poached ivory being sold and traded as antique (the latter is protected by law, but the two are very difficult to distinguish), a tightening of restrictions on ivory purchases and sales in the United States needed to take place.To achieve that goal, the 96 Elephants campaign followed Hornaday's tested movement strategy: building coalitions with public and private partners (including more than 120 members of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums), raising public awareness, and working with government leaders.

Photo by Julie Larsen Maher ©WCS.The results would make Hornaday proud. New York and New Jersey successfully established ivory bans in the summer of 2014. Similar efforts are now underway in California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and elsewhere.The success of the 96 Elephants campaign is not merely another example of what's old being new again. It demonstrates that tried and true organizing principles - clearly articulated goals grounded upon public education (including a lot of pavement-pounding), the building of partnerships and alliances, and passionate advocacy at all levels of government - can and should be the basis for other pressing environment and conservation priorities of our time.In the coming years, WCS hopes to continue to apply this movement strategy for the protection threatened species. In so doing we are not merely working to protect great iconic wildlife like the bison and the elephant. We are developing a constituency for conservation that will continue the fight for future generations as we do now 100 years after William Hornaday's inspiring example.---------------------------------------------------------- John Calvelli is Executive Vice President for Public Affairs at WCS (Wildlife Conservation Society) and Director of the 96 Elephants Campaign.

It demonstrates that tried and true organizing principles - clearly articulated goals grounded upon public education (including a lot of pavement-pounding), the building of partnerships and alliances, and passionate advocacy at all levels of government - can and should be the basis for other pressing environment and conservation priorities of our time.In the coming years, WCS hopes to continue to apply this movement strategy for the protection threatened species. In so doing we are not merely working to protect great iconic wildlife like the bison and the elephant. We are developing a constituency for conservation that will continue the fight for future generations as we do now 100 years after William Hornaday's inspiring example.---------------------------------------------------------- John Calvelli is Executive Vice President for Public Affairs at WCS (Wildlife Conservation Society) and Director of the 96 Elephants Campaign.

These delicious dishes are some of my most requested Ole!1. Roasted Tomato SalsaUnlike most salsas, which are raw, the vegetables in this recipe are roasted -- intensifying the flavor of the tomatoes, mellowing the onions and garlic, and adding a light touch of smokiness. Warning: It's utterly addictive. GET THE RECIPE2. Black Bean & Corn Salad with Chipotle-Honey VinaigretteWith black beans, sweet corn, crisp bell peppers and creamy avocado, this make-ahead salad is one that everyone loves. You can serve it as a side dish, salad or dip. The vinaigrette is similar to the popular smoky-sweet salad dressing served at Chipotle. GET THE RECIPE3. Chicken Enchiladas with Tomatillo SauceMy whole family loves these enchiladas. They're filled with smoky shredded chicken and cheddar cheese and topped with a tangy tomatillo sauce. GET THE RECIPE4. Roasted Garlic GuacamoleWhile traditional guacamole is made with raw onions, this updated version is made with roasted garlic, which has just as much flavor and none of the unpleasant aftertaste. Always a crowd-pleaser! GET THE RECIPE5. Chicken TacosThese are my kids' all-time favorite tacos -- they're healthier than traditional beef tacos, and just as good, if not better. GET THE RECIPE6. Mexican Rice Pilaf This dish is not really authentic. True Mexican rice is more complicated and time-consuming to make -- but my kids claim it tastes just like the rice served at their favorite Mexican restaurant. GET THE RECIPE7. The Best Black Bean DipThis recipe was inspired by a black bean dip I had at a restaurant in Costa Rica that was better than any other black bean dip I'd ever tried. Given -- it won't win a beauty contest, but it's so flavorful, healthy and easy to make, you won't care. GET THE RECIPE8. Grilled Tequila Lime ChickenAlso known as Margarita Chicken, this is one of those dishes that just screams fun. The marinade -- a combination of tequila, lime, garlic and spices -- is loaded with bright South-of-the-Border flavor. GET THE RECIPE9. Chicken Tortilla SoupInspired by the delicious chicken tortilla soup served at Tommy Bahama Café, this silky purée of vegetables, corn tortillas, chicken broth and spices is hearty enough to serve as a meal. GET THE RECIPE10. MargaritasA proper celebration needs a libation. Citrusy and slightly sweet, these margaritas are a refined version of the syrupy, fake-tasting margaritas served at many bars and restaurants. GET THE RECIPE"
