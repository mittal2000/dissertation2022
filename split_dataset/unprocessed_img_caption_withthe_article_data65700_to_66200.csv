0,ENTERTAINMENT,Sofia Vergara Doesn't Seem To Get Why Objectification Is Offensive,Cole Delbyck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sofia-vergara-objectification-offensive_us_56b3b956e4b08069c7a68a46,"""I am secure enough not to take it all that seriously.""",2016-02-04,Sofia Vergara covers Net-a-Porter’s The Edit magazine's March issue.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56b3ba361800006f0080b50c.jpeg?cache=BJBZ5LGVE4&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sofia Vergara covers Net-a-Porter’s The Edit magazine this month and in the accompanying interview reveals she’s kind of OK with being treated as a sex object. “I’ve never understood why women get so offended [by being objectified]. I just don’t believe in all that drama, which is why I’ve made a whole joke out of it,” the “Modern Family” actress explained. “I am secure enough not to take it all that seriously, and I like to laugh at myself. My husband played a male stripper in ‘Magic Mike’ ― do you think he was offended by [the objectification]? I thought it was hilarious.”This isn’t the first time Vergara has found herself the center of a conversation about sexism and objectification in the film industry. During a problematic gag at the 2014 Emmy’s, the actress was placed on a spinning pedestal to give viewers “something to look at” during the President of the Academy’s typically yawn-inducing speech. Vergara responded to critics who thought the bit was sexist, saying,”I think its absolutely the opposite ... It means that somebody can be hot and also be funny and make fun of herself. I think it’s ridiculous that somebody started this ― I know who she was ― who has no sense of humor [and should] lighten up a little bit.”Although Vergara refuses to give much weight to the damaging beauty standards in Hollywood, she does admit she hates watching footage from early seasons of “Modern Family.” “Watching myself age on screen is awful!” she told the mag. “There is nothing more disturbing than watching an episode of ‘Modern Family’ from the first season, then one from seven years later. It just makes me want to kill myself, but what can I do? I’ll be sad when the wolf whistles stop. I’m already sad that men have started calling me ‘Señora’. I get really p***** off: ‘What? It’s Señorita!’”Yikes. Also on HuffPost:"

2,POLITICS,There Is A New Plan To Help Lower-Income Parents Afford Quality Child Care,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congress-child-care-plan_us_56b3b769e4b01d80b2459366,But don't expect Congress to pass it any time soon.,2016-02-04,But who will take care of them when mom and dad go to work? A new bill in Congress would expand a program that helps low-income families get child care.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56b3b9661a00009c01ab207f.jpeg?cache=fzWdcJSYBC&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Child care is more expensive than public college tuition in most U.S. states making it unaffordable for the majority of middle-class families, let alone those living in poverty.Now, some lawmakers are trying to change that.Congressional Democrats announced a new bill on Thursday that aims to increase access to child care for lower-income families and improve the notoriously inconsistent quality of the child care those subsidies buy.The Child Care Access to Resources for Early-learning (CARE) Act, which has the backing of the White House, allocates an additional $25 billion in mandatory funding over five years to the Child-Care Development Block Grant, a federal subsidy for state-run child care assistance programs.While the block grant itself serves low-income children under age 13, the new funds would be designated for children under age four only, since the first few years of a child’s life are believed to be the most critical years for cognitive development.States’ eligibility for the new funding would depend on their adoption of new quality improvement metrics. And as under current law, states would be required to match a portion of the federal funds with contributions of their own.Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.), and Reps. Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.) and Lois Frankel (D-Fla.), who are sponsoring the bill in the Senate and the House, respectively, framed the bill as both a lifeline to working parents struggling with the costs of care, and a boon to the American economy. “If we are going to be not only competitive but outcompete the world, we need the best workforce in the world,” Casey said at a rollout event for the legislation in the Senate on Thursday. “One of the best ways to ensure that is to make sure that every child has an opportunity, and especially that children from low-income families, have an opportunity to learn more now and earn more later.""The bill would generate new funds by closing a loophole U.S. companies use to base themselves in a foreign country to avoid shouldering a domestic tax burden -- a practice known as “tax inversion.”The new funding infusion is aimed at bringing the program closer to achieving its stated goal of providing access to subsidized child care for the infants and toddlers of families who live in or near poverty.The Child-Care Development Block Grant program, which dates to 1996, was reauthorized in 2014 with virtually no opposition. But the program’s funding levels lag far below what is needed to provide that care to all eligible children.Over 7.4 million children under age four live at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, or $48,600 for a family of four, but millions don't have access to subsidized child care -- just 583,773 receive the development block grant subsidies, according to the Department of Health and Human Services’ office of child care.The legislation is projected to provide child care to one million more children over the course of ten years, according to a summary and description of the bill distributed by its congressional sponsors.There can be little dispute that the U.S. child care system is substandard. Only 10 percent of day care providers offered high-quality care, according to a 2007 government study.So, to accomplish the tricky task of increasing access to care and simultaneously improving the already-poor quality of care, the legislation would require states to adopt significant new quality controls to qualify for the new funding. States would not only have to affirm that they are committed to expanding their eligibility standards significantly, to include more children by 2021, to receive the funds, but also submit a plan to the federal government that describes how they plan to improve the quality of child care. Specifically, the bill asks states to create a payment formula for child care providers adequate enough to create a child development and learning environment similar to what is offered by Head Start and Early Head Start, federal programs considered by many advocates to be the gold standard for children under age four. It also requires states to pay child care workers enough to obtain “credentials or degrees and the knowledge and competencies to support children’s learning,” according to the bill summary.At least 80 percent of the new funding would be designated for paying for the services directly and a minimum of 12 percent -- up from the 9 percent quality improvement ratio required by the 2014 reauthorization of the broader Child-Care Development Block Grant -- of the new funding would be earmarked for quality improvements such as pay increases and technical training for child care professionals.The new provisions build on the minimal quality controls established by the 2014 reauthorization bill, such as the first ever requirement that child care provider staff who receive subsidies for looking after low-income children undergo criminal background checks.The bill’s congressional sponsors say that the funding increase is in itself a key component of the quality improvement plan -- they argue that the child care industry’s low pay is a major impediment to high-quality care. The median pay for child care workers is $10.31 an hour, which is relatively low compared to other workers who typically earn $17 an hour.As a result, child care workers are more than twice as likely as other American workers to be living in poverty.“We pay people who fix toilets … more than the people who take care of the most precious part of our lives,” Rep. Frankel said at the Thursday rollout event.The Democratic lawmakers acknowledged that the bill is unlikely to pass the Republican-controlled Senate or House.Sen. Casey seemed to doubt that the bill would attract Republican support, but said he holds out hope that GOP colleagues will co-sponsor it when he formally introduces it next week.“I am an optimistic person,” Casey deadpanned.Child welfare advocates, many of them in attendance at Thursday’s announcement, applauded the new bill as a crucial step toward making high-quality, affordable child care universally available.“We’re really feeling very positive about it,” said Patricia Cole, director of government relations at Zero To Three, a nonprofit dedicated to improving the wellbeing of infants and toddlers. “This is a sign that the president and Congress are listening to the science of brain development that babies need to be surrounded by quality child care.”“It's an aspirational bill that hopefully will start a much-needed conversation between the federal government and the states about how to finance a system that ensures young children's development is supported while their parents are working,” Cole added.Chris Herbst, a public policy professor at Arizona State University, whose research has focused on U.S. child care outcomes, is skeptical that the new quality requirements are dramatic or binding enough to make much of an impact.Among the proposals Herbst would prefer is the one put forward by the Center for American Progress, in which the federal government provides generous tax breaks to families if they purchase child care from providers the government recognizes as offering high-quality care.“If they’re serious about increasing not just access, but access to high quality care, why not build explicit incentives into the program to purchase higher quality care at the consumer level?” he asked.Also on HuffPost:"

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.).The news, first reported by CNN and the Washington Post earlier on Wednesday, comes after Santorum finished with just one percent of the vote in the 2016 Iowa GOP caucus. The loss had already prompted his campaign to postpone a planned 46-county tour in South Carolina.Santorum had hoped to earn the backing of evangelical Christian voters and peel away supporters from some of his conservative rivals, like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas).He announced his presidential run on May 27 in a Pennsylvania factory, joining an already-crowded field of GOP contenders. His highly conservative platform, fueled by his own blue-collar roots, rested upon reining in spending and fighting on behalf of the American worker.""It’s time to revitalize manufacturing, processing, construction and energy sectors of our economy again so America can once again thrive,"" his campaign website said.On some issues, he veered away from many in his party, proposing to raise the minimum wage by 50 cents per year over three years during a CNN Republican debate.Santorum is also known for his hawkish foreign policy. He has staunchly opposed the nuclear deal struck between world powers and Iran, calling it ""the greatest betrayal of American national security"" in U.S. history. He also advocated for 10,000 U.S. troops to defeat the Islamic State, a terrorist group also referred to as ISIS or ISIL.His run has been marred by controversial comments on abortion, homosexuality and immigration. In August, he said that undocumented parents are ""like someone who robs a bank because they want to feed their family.""Santorum ran in the 2012 presidential election on a similar platform, but with a greater degree of success. He won 11 primaries and campaigned in all 99 of Iowa's counties on a tight budget, leading him to a very narrow victory in the 2012 Iowa caucus. (He finished 11th out of 12 candidates in this year's Iowa caucus.)Some of his comments, however, landed him in hot water throughout the campaign. He famously told Fox News' Chris Wallace in 2011 that gay soldiers ""cause problems for people living in close quarters.""Santorum didn't drop out of that primary race until April of 2012, after a series of defeats and the hospitalization of his daughter, Bella, who suffers from a rare genetic disorder. At that point, he ostensibly handed the 2012 GOP nomination over to Mitt Romney.Santorum served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1991 to 1995 and in the Senate from 1995 to 2007. In 1996, he co-authored a GOP welfare reform bill, which President Bill Clinton ultimately signed into law.This story was updated with details of the official announcement and Santorum's endorsement of Rubio.Also on HuffPost:"

Here's how that logic works, according to reform advocates: The longer that Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and business mogul Donald Trump, who placed first and second in Iowa, are in the news talking about border walls and driving out undocumented immigrants, the more that Latino, Asian and other minority voters will be galvanized to get out and vote against them. If they do, and if the GOP suffers another disastrous loss, there could be a repeat of 2012, which prompted the Republican National Committee to rethink its immigration messaging in its so-called ""autopsy report"" and the Senate to pass a bill that would have allowed many undocumented immigrants to become citizens. Or, at least, that's the hope. ""Our theory of winning is that Republicans have to get hurt in yet another general election before we have a chance to pass comprehensive immigration reform,"" said Frank Sharry, founder of the pro-reform group America's Voice. ""It creates a huge opportunity for the 2016 election ... for Latino and Asian voters to be decisive in a way that makes the RNC autopsy in 2017 like the 2013 report but on steroids,"" he said. There's still a long way to go until the election. But Democrats and immigration reform supporters already have plenty of ammunition to hit any Republican candidate over the issue. The most talked about bête noire is Trump, who began his campaign last summer by saying many Mexican immigrants were rapists and criminals, and since then has talked frequently about building a border wall and deporting even U.S. citizen children of undocumented immigrants. ""It definitely is an incredible motivator, especially because you see you or your family or your neighbors or your co-workers are under attack,"" said Rocio Saenz, executive vice president of the Service Employees International Union, one of several groups holding naturalization drives to ensure immigrants eligible to become citizens are doing so. Even if he were to drop out, though, Trump has already had an impact on the race. Immigration reform supporters said Cruz isn't any better on the issue -- especially since he now says his past statements on legal status for undocumented immigrants were just political maneuvering and he wants to restrict legal immigration.Pro-reform Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who dropped his bid for president and is now supporting former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, said on MSNBC Tuesday he thinks Cruz would have a ""one in 10"" chance of winning against a Democrat, in part based on his move further to the right on immigration. ""The problem we have as Republicans is that we're losing the largest and fastest-growing demographic, Hispanics, and when we ask them after 2012 why they don't like the Republican party, it's the immigration issue and the way we handled it,"" Graham said on MSNBC. The third-place finisher in Iowa, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, has softer rhetoric on immigration but has opened himself to attacks from the left by backing away from the comprehensive immigration reform bill he worked on with Graham and others in 2013. He could move back toward the center in a general election, but if pro-immigration reform voters are engaged now, it might be too late. ""The more these candidates continue attacking and not showing any way to deal with the issues that the Latino community cares [about], the more it's going to get our community to say we need to participate,"" said Ben Monterroso, executive director of the Latino group Mi Familia Vota.Civil rights leader Dolores Huerta, a board member for People For the American Way, said that it wasn't only Trump upping engagement with Latino voters; it's also that Democratic candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ""has such a long history of engagement with the Latino community.""Groups aimed at increasing Latino voter participation don't want to just use anger at Republicans as a motivator, said Latino Victory Project spokeswoman Pili Tobar.""It's not just about getting them excited and energized to vote or participate because they're anti-Trump or anti-Cruz, we also have to give them the opposite, which is, 'Here is why you should vote on a positive lens.'"" In the end, Todd Schulte of the pro-reform group FWD.us said he thinks two scenarios are most plausible: Either ""Democrats win on the strength of Latinos, Asian-Americans and others, and we see a 2012 on steroids dynamic, or a Republican wins by improving on the 2012 margins with these groups."" ""The third scenario -- electing someone who favors rounding up and deporting every single undocumented immigrant -- is not only incredibly unlikely, but their mere nomination would prove a historical disaster for the party,"" he added.Note to our readers: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S. "

""Our theory of winning is that Republicans have to get hurt in yet another general election before we have a chance to pass comprehensive immigration reform,"" said Frank Sharry, founder of the pro-reform group America's Voice. ""It creates a huge opportunity for the 2016 election ... for Latino and Asian voters to be decisive in a way that makes the RNC autopsy in 2017 like the 2013 report but on steroids,"" he said. There's still a long way to go until the election. But Democrats and immigration reform supporters already have plenty of ammunition to hit any Republican candidate over the issue. The most talked about bête noire is Trump, who began his campaign last summer by saying many Mexican immigrants were rapists and criminals, and since then has talked frequently about building a border wall and deporting even U.S. citizen children of undocumented immigrants. ""It definitely is an incredible motivator, especially because you see you or your family or your neighbors or your co-workers are under attack,"" said Rocio Saenz, executive vice president of the Service Employees International Union, one of several groups holding naturalization drives to ensure immigrants eligible to become citizens are doing so. Even if he were to drop out, though, Trump has already had an impact on the race. Immigration reform supporters said Cruz isn't any better on the issue -- especially since he now says his past statements on legal status for undocumented immigrants were just political maneuvering and he wants to restrict legal immigration.Pro-reform Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who dropped his bid for president and is now supporting former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, said on MSNBC Tuesday he thinks Cruz would have a ""one in 10"" chance of winning against a Democrat, in part based on his move further to the right on immigration. ""The problem we have as Republicans is that we're losing the largest and fastest-growing demographic, Hispanics, and when we ask them after 2012 why they don't like the Republican party, it's the immigration issue and the way we handled it,"" Graham said on MSNBC. The third-place finisher in Iowa, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, has softer rhetoric on immigration but has opened himself to attacks from the left by backing away from the comprehensive immigration reform bill he worked on with Graham and others in 2013. He could move back toward the center in a general election, but if pro-immigration reform voters are engaged now, it might be too late. ""The more these candidates continue attacking and not showing any way to deal with the issues that the Latino community cares [about], the more it's going to get our community to say we need to participate,"" said Ben Monterroso, executive director of the Latino group Mi Familia Vota.Civil rights leader Dolores Huerta, a board member for People For the American Way, said that it wasn't only Trump upping engagement with Latino voters; it's also that Democratic candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ""has such a long history of engagement with the Latino community.""Groups aimed at increasing Latino voter participation don't want to just use anger at Republicans as a motivator, said Latino Victory Project spokeswoman Pili Tobar.""It's not just about getting them excited and energized to vote or participate because they're anti-Trump or anti-Cruz, we also have to give them the opposite, which is, 'Here is why you should vote on a positive lens.'"" In the end, Todd Schulte of the pro-reform group FWD.us said he thinks two scenarios are most plausible: Either ""Democrats win on the strength of Latinos, Asian-Americans and others, and we see a 2012 on steroids dynamic, or a Republican wins by improving on the 2012 margins with these groups."" ""The third scenario -- electing someone who favors rounding up and deporting every single undocumented immigrant -- is not only incredibly unlikely, but their mere nomination would prove a historical disaster for the party,"" he added.Note to our readers: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S. "

""This is our opportunity to... invest in the main cabin as well.""Yes, pretzels are delicious, and we're glad American Airlines announced earlier this week that free pretzels will return to domestic flights. But when airplane seats are shrinking, lines are growing and baggage and booking fees continue to rise, passengers would like more than free bags of teensy-tiny pieces of baked bread. If record profits make 2015 the best year for the industry in decades, as the Associated Press reports, then free snacks are not enough.C'mon, guys. A little more legroom would be nice. Please?To be fair, American Airlines said it will introduce TWO kinds of free snacks: Domestic flights leaving in the morning will get cookies, and later ones will get either cookies or pretzels. American Airlines is also expanding in-flight entertainment to including more movies, TV shows and music on domestic flights. But they haven't announced that seats will be more spacious, or that high baggage fees will be reduced. Other airlines are following a similar pattern: JetBlue, for example, recently announced free Wi-Fi and more movies, but smaller seat sizes. JetBlue still has MANY perks, but the addition of entertainment while making our physical experience less comfy is troubling, to say the least. We've also seen the return of free snacks to United, who will bring cookies and snack mix to its domestic flights this month. And airlines like Delta are supposedly ""improving"" their economy classes with more free movies and TV shows, the Associated Press notes.

""We're calling on the U.S. Marshals to hunt him down and give him that subpoena,"" Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) said of the former emergency manager on Wednesday morning, to applause from Flint residents in the audience. Darnell Earley's lawyer, A. Scott Bolden, told The Huffington Post that he and his client weren't given enough time to prepare for Wednesday's hearing. Bolden said he asked the committee to give him some future dates, and the committee issued its subpoena instead. ""I have not heard back from the committee since then -- other than what I saw on TV, that the chairman indicated that he was going to have to hunt my client down like he was an animal,"" Bolden said.""My client's not an animal, and neither am I, and neither one of us are running and hiding from the committee,"" Bolden said. ""We're ready, willing and able to participate, just under reasonable circumstances.""Congressional Democrats, for their part, seemed more annoyed that Chaffetz hadn't called on Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) to testify. Wednesday's hearing delved into the poisoning of Flint's water. A Michigan Department of Environmental Quality official told the committee that the water went bad in 2014, after the city switched to getting water from the Flint River and the department told the city not to treat the new water to make it less corrosive. The river water wound up leaching lead from the city's pipes, resulting in elevated lead in Flint kids' blood.Earley served as emergency manager at the time, though it's not clear exactly what role he had in the decision-making process. Bolden said the choice to switch to the Flint River as city's water supply was made before Earley's tenure, and that local leaders supported it. ""This wasn't some purposeful decision on his part that was met with a lot of opposition; he was simply implementing the plan that was put in place before him,"" Bolden said.City and state officials brushed off residents' complaints that the water looked bad and caused rashes, though officials at the city and state level maintained the water was safe to drink from the time of the switch in 2014 until October of last year, when they admitted the water was unsafe. ""There was nothing that was presented to him, nothing that was reported, no test results that were suggesting that the prior decision should not have been made,"" Bolden said. Snyder appointed Earley to run Flint in 2013. He served until January 2015, when Snyder tapped him as manager of Detroit's public school system. Earley announced his resignation from the Detroit schools this week. "

In a new HuffPost/YouGov poll, 49 percent of respondents say heroin use is a very serious national problem, and 87 percent say it's at least a somewhat serious problem. They perceive the issue to be nearly as troubling as gun violence, even if it's not a top personal concern for most of them.About half of those surveyed also say that heroin use is at least as much of issue in their community as it is elsewhere. More than one-third of respondents know someone who's been addicted to heroin or another opiate.There's relatively little difference across racial lines. Though black Americans are more likely than white Americans to describe heroin use as a serious issue, members of both races are about equally likely to know an addict or to consider their community especially hard-hit.That marks a sea change from previous years. As heroin use has climbed disproportionately among white Americans -- who now comprise the vast majority of new heroin users -- it appears that more policymakers, politicians and members of the public have started to pay attention.A 2005 poll on heroin -- conducted for a pharmaceutical company that made Suboxone, a medication for treating opiate addiction -- found that 37 percent of respondents considered heroin abuse to be a greater problem for minorities and 26 percent thought heroin use was more of a problem for whites. (That survey didn't give respondents the option to say heroin use was equally a problem for both groups, but many said so anyway.)Yet in the recent HuffPost/YouGov poll, just 8 percent of Americans say they think heroin abuse is more common among blacks than whites. Twenty-seven percent say it's more common among whites, while 46 percent say it's equally common for both groups and the rest aren't sure.Twenty-five percent of white respondents say heroin abuse is more common among whites, while 7 percent say it's more common among blacks. Black Americans said the same thing, by a much greater margin: 48 percent say it's more common among whites, and only 6 percent say it's more common among blacks.Asked whether any specific group of people deserves particular blame for the heroin crisis, a near majority say drug users, drug dealers, and government and law enforcement are equally at fault. Twenty-eight percent blame users themselves, while 11 percent blame drug dealers, and 5 percent blame government and law enforcement officials who determine how heroin users are treated. The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Jan. 20-22 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov's nationally representative opinion polling.

New Hampshire seems stable, but that could change. And Gallup finds states shifting toward the GOP, but that doesn’t necessarily give Republicans an election advantage. This is HuffPollster for Wednesday, February 3, 2016.IOWA POLLS NOT NECESSARILY WRONG, JUST TOO EARLY - Mark Blumenthal and Jon Cohen: ""Although the polls failed to predict Ted Cruz's Iowa win on Tuesday night, it isn't because they were dead wrong. They just ended too early. Consider this: SurveyMonkey data from Iowa showed a seismic shift among GOP caucus goers in the final week -- with Donald J. Trump losing six percentage points and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz gaining six in the last six days. Beyond the very real challenges that polling faces -- from single-digit response rates and the fast growing number of ""cell phone only"" households -- the Iowa misfire traces to issues that have challenged polls there for decades: large late shifts in voter preferences and the difficulty in predicting exactly who will trek out to caucus meetings on a cold winter night."" [HuffPost]Signs of momentum shifts and evangelical turnout were there all along -More from Blumenthal and Cohen: ""Data collected by our firm, SurveyMonkey, helps confirm that both issues were in play for polling on the Republican caucuses this year. In our data, there was a dramatic difference between the first (Jan. 21-26) and second (Jan. 27-Feb.1) six-day stretches. From the first six days to the second Trump lost six percentage points, while Cruz gained six and Rubio five -- looking at GOP voters expressing at least some intention of showing up Monday evening. Momentum was running against Trump….Something else happened as well when dividing the time period: the evangelical share of GOP caucus-goers in the first six days was 39 percent; it jumped to 55 percent in the second six days (closer to the 64 percent evangelical share of Republican caucus reported by the networks' entrance poll). There was a lot shifting on the ground in Iowa."" [HuffPost]Pollsters agree - Carl Bialik: “One of the biggest lessons was a simple one: Keep on contacting voters as late as possible.….That sounds like a wise approach because of the success by two pollsters whose final Iowa polls started at a later date than anyone else: last Friday, January 29. The two pollsters, Emerson College and Opinion Savvy, both showed Donald Trump leading Ted Cruz by just one percentage point, with Marco Rubio either close behind or tied. Most other polls started before the last debate and many finished before it, too. They generally showed Trump with a bigger lead and Rubio trailing him by more than 10 percentage points.” [538]But polls did predict the Democratic caucus - HuffPollster: ""While the Iowa caucuses provided a polling upset on the Republican side, most pollsters -- often in the same surveys -- fared much better with the Democratic results…. Polls projected a very close race. HuffPost Pollster's final average put former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 3 points over Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Clinton seems to have won the caucuses with 49.8 percent of the delegate count to Sanders' 49.6 percent. The Democratic Party reports results as delegate counts, making a comparison to the polls more difficult, but entrance poll estimates show the raw vote just about in line with Clinton's 3-point polling lead."" [HuffPost] Media shares blame in Iowa poll overhype - HuffPollster: ""Pollsters are taking a lot of heat from the public and the media for not anticipating Sen. Ted Cruz’s (R-Texas) victory in Monday night’s Iowa caucus. But some of those critics in the media share the blame. Pollsters tried to tell us that the outcome was highly uncertain -- and in some cases, we listened. Still, enough headlines in the last week broadcast Donald Trump’s lead that it gave the appearance of certainty in the polls. There’s a conundrum for the media, though: 'Donald Trump Leads' simply generates more attention and traffic than 'We Don’t Know What Will Happen.' In reality, the latter probably should have been the headline. HuffPost Pollster isn’t immune…. Why does the message of the horse race prevail so much? In short, because polls are the only thing that give us an idea of where voters stand.""[HuffPost] HIGHER THAN EXPECTED TURNOUT IN IOWA DOESN'T INCREASE EXPECTATIONS IN OTHER STATES - Michael P. McDonald: ""At long last the 2016 presidential nomination contests have finally started with the conclusion of the first contest, and we now have the first solid glimpse at voter participation. The Iowa Republican caucus blasted through its 2012 record of 121,354, but Democrats could not keep pace with 2008, when 236,000 Iowans participated in the Democratic caucus. Iowa's turnout rate was therefore down slightly from the 16.1% in the 2008 election, the last election when both parties last held competitive contests. It may be tempting to directly overlay Iowa's turnout onto the 2008 turnout to project overall turnout in the coming presidential nomination contests…. This approach is flawed in ways that expose deficiencies in the timing of presidential nomination contests. The most obvious issue is candidate competition, which is related to contest timing…. The horserace analogy is particularly apt, because once the candidates clear the initial poles, the front running candidates separate themselves from the pack and it becomes increasingly clear to the voters and campaigns which candidates have a realistic chance of winning the nomination. When this happens, voter participation usually begins to fade."" [HuffPost]NEW HAMPSHIRE SHOWS STRONG TRUMP LEAD, BUT COULD IT BE MISLEADING? - Donald Trump has enjoyed a 20-point lead in New Hampshire polls for much of the fall and winter, with Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Ohio Gov. John Kasich in a three-way race for second. But, as we learned in Iowa, his lead could be tenuous and fall apart in the actual voting. Pollsters have offered fewer caveats to Trump’s lead in New Hampshire than they did in Iowa, but those may emerge if he drops in standing during the coming days. There are still 11 candidates in this Republican race, and that means lots of uncertainty in the voting.SANDERS HAS ADVANTAGE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE - Since January, Sen. Bernie Sanders has opened up a 15-point lead over Hillary Clinton, which could be even boosted by his strong second-place showing in Iowa It’s important to remember, though, that independents can vote in New Hampshire’s primaries, and their choices could shift the vote tallies considerably. RED STATES OUTNUMBER BLUE STATES FOR THE FIRST TIME - Jeffrey M. Jones: “Gallup's analysis of political party affiliation at the state level in 2015 finds that 20 states are solidly Republican or leaning Republican, compared with 14 solidly Democratic or leaning Democratic states. The remaining 16 are competitive. This is the first time in Gallup's eight years of tracking partisanship by state that there have been more Republican than Democratic states.….Importantly, even though Republicans claim a greater number of states, Democrats continue to hold an edge nationally in partisanship….That is largely because many of the most populous states, including California, New York and Illinois, are Democratically aligned.” What that means for this year’s presidential election - More from Jones: “The partisanship of the state population is a starting point in determining a state's likely vote, and there are more states in the Republican column heading into 2016 -- a positive sign for the GOP. But because electoral votes are based on state population, the size of the state matters as much as the number of states each party holds. The 20 states that Gallup classifies as solidly Republican or leaning Republican account for 152 electoral votes, less than the 187 accounted for by the 14 solidly or leaning Democratic states plus the heavily Democratic District of Columbia.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) apologized on Tuesday after his campaign sent out an email during Monday's Iowa caucuses suggesting that GOP hopeful Ben Carson was dropping out of the presidential race.Spence Rogers, Cruz's deputy Iowa state director, sent the email, which stated that Carson would be ""making a big announcement next week,"" and that his supporters should be urged to caucus for Cruz instead. Carson's campaign announced Monday that the candidate was briefly returning to Florida to get some fresh clothes after the caucuses, but clarified that he would be back on the campaign trail shortly.In response to the letter, Carson accused the Cruz campaign of ""dirty tricks."" However, Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler initially defended the campaign's actions.""We simply as a campaign repeated what Ben Carson had said in his own words,"" Tyler said on MSNBC Tuesday morning. ""He said after Iowa he was going to go back to Florida for a couple of days and then he was going to go to D.C. for the prayer breakfast ... And what that told us was he was not going to New Hampshire.""But later in the day, Cruz said in a statement that his campaign should have clarified that Carson was not dropping out of the race.""Last night, when our political team saw the CNN post saying that Dr. Carson was not carrying on to New Hampshire and South Carolina, our campaign updated grassroots leaders just as we would with any breaking news story,"" Cruz's statement read. ""That's fair game. What the team then should have done was send around the follow-up statement from the Carson campaign clarifying that he was indeed staying in the race when that came out,"" he added.On Wednesday, Republican candidate Donald Trump, who finished second to Cruz in the caucuses, accused the Texas senator of ""stealing"" a victory and said many people had voted for Cruz over Carson because of the note.Carson continued to criticize Cruz for the message during a press conference in Washington on Wednesday afternoon, saying he believed the email had hurt his chances in the caucuses.""It's clear that there were people who tried to take advantage of a situation,"" Carson said.This story has been updated with a statement from Ben Carson.Also on HuffPost:"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, under fire from Democrats for deportations and Republicans for border crossings, announced some positive news on Tuesday: The numbers of families and unaccompanied minors apprehended at the Southwest border fell last month. Border agents picked up 3,145 family members in January, compared with 8,974 in December, according to figures released by DHS. They also apprehended 3,113 children traveling without parents, down from 6,786 the previous month. Johnson said in a statement that the overall number of Southwest border apprehensions, which the government says indicate how many people are attempting to cross without authorization, were at the lowest levels since January 2015. The number of children and families coming to the U.S. without authorization climbed in the final months of last year, prompting concern about another border surge like the one in 2014 that overwhelmed border patrol and social service agencies. Many of the mothers and children picked up at the border have said they were fleeing violence in Central America. Even with a dip last month, the apprehension figures remain considerably higher this fiscal year than during the same period in the 2015 fiscal year. From Oct. 1 to the end of January, DHS apprehended twice the number of unaccompanied children as agents did during the same period the prior fiscal year, and more than twice the number of families. DHS began to conduct raids last month on families previously apprehended at the border that had received final orders of removal. Democrats and immigration advocates have warned that the mothers and children would be in grave danger if returned to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. The administration has remained firm on what officials call ""enforcement actions,"" despite the public pressure. Johnson indicated that is not changing, although he said he had spoken to critics and has ""great respect for the views expressed and those who expressed them."" ""While the one-month decline in January is encouraging, this does not mean we can dial back our border security efforts,"" Johnson said in the statement. ""Recent enforcement actions, which focus on those apprehended at the border on or after January 1, 2014, will continue."" Johnson emphasized that people apprehended at the border are priorities for deportation -- a rebuttal to arguments that the administration was failing to keep promises to remove ""felons, not families"" in its latest enforcement efforts. Johnson added that Immigration and Customs Enforcement ""will not, except in emergency circumstances, apprehend an individual at a place of worship, a school, a hospital or doctor’s office or other sensitive location.""Johnson's statement was similar to a letter he and Secretary of State John Kerry sent last week to Democratic House members and senators defending their response to Central Americans coming to the U.S. In both the letter and the statement, Johnson talked up new efforts to expand refugee admissions in Central America so those eligible can apply within their country rather than making a risky trip to the U.S. without authorization. (Opponents of the raids have questioned why mothers and children are being deported to countries considered so dangerous they need a renewed refugee effort.) ""Our policy is clear: we will continue to enforce the immigration laws and secure our borders consistent with our priorities and values,"" Johnson said in his statement. ""At the same time, we will offer vulnerable populations in Central America an alternative, safe and legal path to a better life."""

In his recent profile in DuJour magazine, writers Jessica Morgan and Heather Cocks (aka The Fug Girls) seem to have unearthed proof of the rapper's oft-rumored infidelities. And they weren't afraid to share their scoop. Morgan and Cocks begin their story by describing the scene in front of Tyga's house upon their arrival, where they instantly sensed a scandal brewing. The article reads: ""As a photo crew and styling team lug gear up the 26-year-old rapper’s steep stone driveway, a young, bleary-eyed Kylie Jenner lookalike is huddled outside the gate, shivering in the light drizzle."" But that's not all: ""The girl’s hair is matted and slept-on, the extension tape visible from the back, and she taps her toe nervously while awaiting her ride. She is clearly wearing last night’s shorts."" It's probably safe to say that this profile doesn't paint the picture Tyga was hoping for. But how could Morgan and Cocks not include that juicy tidbit of information? As the two note, they weren't permitted to ask about the ""Rack City"" rapper's personal life -- aka his relationship with Jenner -- but thanks to Tyga's own disorganization and lack of scheduling skills, they didn't even need to. ""Leaving a random, scantily clad ladyfriend on your doorstep in the rain, right when the media is scheduled to arrive, seems like gutsy optics,"" they write. ""Or at least an argument for buying a day planner."" (Shortly after the interview took place, the mystery girl was identified as Val Mercado; she and the rapper were spotted hanging out in January while rumors of his split with Jenner were swirling.)Later in the profile, which is confusingly accompanied by photos of the rapper and some Jenner-like mannequins, Tyga fittingly admits that he really doesn't give a f**k about what people think about him or what they say about him. ""I don’t engage with people that much. You can’t base your life off waking up every morning like, 'What are people saying about me now?' Then I’d never stay in my creative headspace,” he said. ""I just want to put all my answers in the music."" ¯\_(ツ)_/¯Also on HuffPost: "

The rope broke off after a mile and half, finally freeing a bloodied Goliath who limped away.Witnesses immediately called a local nonprofit rescue organization for help.""When we first found him, he was in shock,"" Dennis Burns of Valley Isle Animal Rescue told The Huffington Post. The dog had lost more than half of the skin on his right side and belly and three of his paws were ground down to the bone -- but he was still breathing.WARNING: The photos below are graphic.""He took a pretty big hit,"" Burns said. ""If it had not been a strong breed dog like that, he might have not survived.""Burns took the dog to the Central Maui Animal Clinic where he underwent surgery. There, Burns and the veterinarians came up with a more fitting name for the 6-year-old dog: Tuff Guy.The dog's owners didn't realize their mistake until the next morning. They called the animal rescue thinking their dog had simply gone missing at the beach -- but when Burns gave them the news, they were devastated.""When I told them what happened, they started crying. They were worried about their dog,"" Burns told HuffPost.

31,POLITICS,Paul Ryan to Heritage Action: Can You Not?,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-heritage-action_us_56b220a9e4b04f9b57d7faf7,The speaker is trying to bring the gadfly conservative group back into the fold.,2016-02-03,Speaker Paul Ryan came before a Heritage Action conference and said Republicans shouldn't argue over tactics.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56b223501800002d0080b317.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In a speech meant to unite a sometimes-meddlesome wing of the Republican Party, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) came to the Heritage Foundation on Wednesday morning to tell the conservative group it was time to put down their scorecards and coalesce behind a common vision.“To quote William Wallace in 'Braveheart,' we have to unite the clans,” Ryan said.While Ryan’s campy reference got polite laughs and plenty of ink even before he gave the speech, his task is not that far off.Conservative groups were a constant headache for former Speaker John Boehner, whose appearance at a Heritage Action conference would have been almost shocking. For Ryan, however, it was just another extension of his overarching strategy to bring his foes in and try to soften them from the inside. (Ryan was meeting with House Freedom Caucus members until nearly 11 p.m. Tuesday, trying to get them to back the Republican budget.)But Ryan wasn’t completely deferential to Heritage Action, the hectoring political arm of the Heritage Foundation, which keeps track of how often a member of Congress votes with the conservative group through a scorecard. He used the speech as an opportunity to try to temper the group’s sometimes-unruly strategies and lofty expectations.“What I want to say to you today is this: Don’t take the bait. Let’s not fight over tactics. And don’t impugn people’s motives,” Ryan said. “It’s fine if you disagree. And there’s a lot that’s rotten in Washington -- there’s no doubt about that -- but we can’t let how someone votes on an amendment to an appropriations bill define what it means to be a conservative.”The Heritage Action scorecards have become a proxy test of conservatism in recent years, and many Republican members worry which way -- or whether -- Heritage will score a particular vote.Ryan, who called himself a “Jack Kemp, Ronald Reagan conservative,” said the GOP movement could no longer demand things that are unrealistic, specifically name-checking a repeal of Obamacare while President Barack Obama was still in office. “All it does is depress our base and in turn help Democrats stay in the White House,” he said. “We can’t do that anymore. It won’t work.”The Wisconsin Republican suggested that establishing those sorts of expectations were setting the GOP up for failure, whereas he wants to exceed expectations and help Republicans be successful.Ryan’s plan to achieve that success is to unite the GOP behind a common vision. He went on to once again lay out his five-point agenda: national security; jobs and economic growth; health care and entitlement reform; poverty and opportunity; and restoring the Constitution.(Ryan said that last piece was “so critical to all the others,” as the conservative Heritage crowd nodded their heads and greeted the platitude with plenty of mmm’s.)During a brief question-and-answer period, Ryan called Obamacare “nothing more than basically a proxy and a plan to get to government-run health care,” and he said Republicans have to show voters -- “We owe you!” -- an Obamacare replacement. It’s been an open question whether Republicans would actually produce a health care replacement bill -- one that could be scored by the Congressional Budget Office and voted on by vulnerable Republicans in Congress -- and Ryan has been cagey on those details.An audience member also asked Ryan what his deadline was for passing appropriations bills, and whether he would replace any chairman who didn’t meet that deadline, a question that was met with laughter and applause. Once everyone calmed down, Ryan said the actual deadline is Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year, but he wanted to get them done before July.Again, though, if Republicans can’t adopt a budget, they might find themselves doing zero appropriations bills. And then Republicans might be asking themselves who set the unrealistic expectations."

Cruz later apologized for his staffer's actions.The GOP businessman also slammed Cruz for sending out shady mailers claiming Iowans faced a ""VOTING VIOLATION.” Trump is a master at sucking the oxygen out of the race by drawing attention to himself with new controversies. The Twitter rant is just one more example of this media strategy, particularly at a time when Cruz and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) are basking in the glow of their performances in Iowa.Cruz responded Wednesday afternoon, mocking the businessman for throwing a ""Trumpertantrum.""""His insults get more and more hysterical the more upset he gets,"" Cruz said in a press conference in New Hampshire. ""I wake up every day and laugh at the latest thing he's tweeted because he's losing it.""""We need a commander in chief, not a tweeter in chief,"" the senator added. “I mean we’re liable to wake up one day and Donald, if he were president, would have nuked Denmark.""Cruz continued by noting that his two young daughters are ""better behaved"" than Trump.This story has been updated with Cruz's response.Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.Also on HuffPost:"

On Tuesday, Uber traded in its signature ""U"" logo for ones that CEO Travis Kalanick said were inspired by the tech building blocks of bits and atoms. The ride-hailing company, which has recently expanded into services like food delivery and is eyeing a future in self-driving cars, says the new look better represents its ambition.""With the potential for many apps with many app icons, we needed one approach that connected them all,"" Kalanick wrote on the company's website. ""So we came back to our story of bits and atoms."" Kalanick went into further detail in an interview with Wired:""There’s an evolution here, for the founder as well as for the company,” he says, “because really, they’re very connected.” During Uber’s early years, Kalanick came across as a bellicose bro, a rebel-hero always angling for a confrontation—with regulators, the taxi industry, and competitors. Reflecting on this, Kalanick says it was all a misrepresentation by the media. When you don’t really know who you are, he says, it’s easy to be miscast—as a company, or as a person.The San Francisco-based company is striving to be perceived as a kinder, gentler version of its old self. Yet it still struggles with many issues that bolstered its reputation for being an aggressively profit-driven company, even when it hurts consumers and workers.Last week, the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco rejected the company's attempt to freeze a class-action lawsuit representing more than 100,000 drivers in California who want to be recognized as employees, not contractors. The case, which could upend Uber's business model and affect its bottom line, is set to go to trial in June. (Uber's chief competitor, Lyft, settled a similar lawsuit by giving its drivers some workplace protections.) As the trial looms, drivers are expressing their discontent in other ways -- particularly since Uber cut fares across the country, therefore cutting drivers' profits as well.Hundreds of drivers in New York and San Francisco went on strike on Monday over the fare cuts, and many in the San Francisco Bay Area are reportedly planning to strike during Sunday's Super Bowl. The sporting event will be held at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, and Uber is an official partner for the game and related festivities. Drivers are planning to block freeways and other areas around the stadium, according to the Observer.Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment. "

""There’s no age limit to tickets. It’s $1800 for our week-old daughter we just had. It’s kind of crazy,"" Colquitt said to the Denver Post last week. ""You won't remember, but I’m paying for it. It’s not about the money because with the tickets you end up kind of forfeiting your Super Bowl check. It’s about the medal I guess and the memories and putting your name in history forever."" NFL players -- they're just like us when it comes to budgeting!Though we don't know the exact state of Colquitt's finances, the Associated Press reported that the football player took a $1.4 million pay cut in 2015. And yet, he's still reportedly making $1.6 million this year and will earn $3.25 million for the 2016 season. Never mind that the Super Bowl is a once-in-a-lifetime experience for football players, one most would literally pay to play in.Considering Broncos QB Peyton Manning has twins and Panthers QB Cam Newton recently welcomed a baby boy, we wonder if the Super Bowl will extend a ""families get in free"" coupon for players with kids.

35,POLITICS,Conservative Group Rejects Paul Ryan's Call For Unity,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-freedom-caucus-budget-heritage_us_56b264d9e4b01d80b244e513,They don't seem to be backing down from a fight.,2016-02-03,"House Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) -- flanked here by two other Freedom Caucus members, Scott Perry (R-Pa.) and Raul Labrador (R-Idaho) -- is getting ready to push GOP leadership to go back on the current budget agreement.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56b2660d1a00009c01ab1f29.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Just a few hours after Speaker Paul Ryan came before a Heritage crowd to ask for unity, four prominent members of the House Freedom Caucus went on the very same stage and delivered almost a direct rebuttal to Ryan’s call of coalescing behind a common Republican vision.“When you come up here, they want you to join the team, and be part of the team, and you got to be a team player,” HFC board member Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) said at the outset of the panel. “The problem is, for me, my team is in western North Carolina.”House Freedom Caucus members will tell you they started the conservative group because many Republican members felt they were getting pushed around by GOP leadership, and they felt they were forced into supporting deals that were against much of the red-meat rhetoric they were hearing -- and tossing around -- in their districts back home.While HFC Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said the group’s job was not to offend, he made it clear they weren’t in Congress to get along with everyone either. Jordan began his remarks by recounting a scene from the movie “1776.”In the scene, one Declaration of Independence signer stands up and says the those gathered should change a sentence in the Declaration because it’s too strong. And John Adams rolls his eyes, but moves on. Then another says the wording in one spot is just too offensive and they should change it. And then another stands up and says they should delete a certain paragraph entirely because it could jeopardize deep-sea fishing rights off the coast of New England.“And,” in Jordan’s telling, “Adams can’t take it any longer, and he says, ‘It’s a revolution, dammit. We’re going to have to offend somebody!’”That worldview may be coming into sharper focus as Republicans work out how exactly they’ll deal with a topline budget number that conservatives insist is $30 billion overweight.In October 2015, all but two Democrats voted with 91 Republicans to support that higher budget number, meaning 152 Republicans voted no.Now, as Republicans prepare their budget, many House Freedom Caucus members are pushing GOP leadership to go back on the new number and support the slimmer spending level set under sequestration in 2011.Speaker Ryan privately insists Republicans have to go along with the new higher number if they want to do appropriations bills, which Republicans seek as a way to work out spending legislation on the House floor rather than in a backroom. But the Freedom Caucus doesn’t seem to buy Ryan’s argument that they can’t do appropriations at the lower number, or adopt a budget at that lower 2017 spending level.Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.) said he thinks there’s a way out, because the current path of just doing an omnibus spending bill at the end of the year isn’t good for anybody. “Most specifically, Mr. Ryan,” Mulvaney said.Mulvaney added that his plan was simply to disregard the current budget deal and adopt a spending blueprint at the lower topline level, “a number we can all rally behind.”“And if that causes difficulties for the Senate down the road, so be it,” Mulvaney said.Ryan has resisted this idea till now because Senate Democrats refused to pass appropriations bills last year in large part over the disagreement on a topline spending number. For conservatives like Mulvaney, that’s the Senate’s problem. He just doesn’t believe the Senate is going to do appropriations bills anyway.As he told The Huffington Post Monday night, “If there was any credibility on the other side of the building, that argument might carry a lot more weight.""Yet another founder of the Freedom Caucus, Rep. Raul Labrador of Idaho, said Republicans couldn’t just be about saying the right things -- “and we heard Paul Ryan today talk about his vision,” he said -- but Republicans had to actually do them.“That’s why the Freedom Caucus exists,” he said.Labrador mentioned that Republicans had to look at their own spending priorities -- namely defense -- and figure out what they could cut. “What are we doing in the Pentagon that is bloated?” Labrador asked, advocating that Republicans “practice what we preach” on fiscal conservatism.And if that’s the HFC line on the budget -- if they are willing to go that far over $30 billion -- it could make the budget debate quite interesting.“Like Jim said, ‘It’s not easy to have a revolution,’” Mulvaney said, referring back to Jordan’s “1776” riff. “You will, invariably, upset people, which is probably what’s going to happen with all of us over the next couple of days.”"

So, what's next for Wambach?In conversation with AOL CEO Tim Armstrong at the MAKERS conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, Ca., Wambach spoke about her lofty goals for her post-soccer career. ""It's astonishing to me that at the executive level at many, many Forbes 500 companies, there are very few women, very few people of different orientations, different colors, different ethnicities,"" Wambach said. ""So I want to tackle the biggie. And it's the thing that drives me the most crazy -- it costs zero dollars to treat someone equally.""As someone whose life has always revolved around athletics, Wambach said that the mental, emotional and physical transition from the game has been tough. (Though she called the ""getting unfit"" part ""amazing."") But she's found a passion for political engagement. The 35-year-old has been on the campaign trail with Hillary Clinton and vocal about the gender pay gap -- an issue that has become particularly visible in the soccer world. ""Policy really does help impact change,"" she said.The soccer legend will also be getting her own Barbie doll. ""Her hair is even shaved!,"" Wambach exclaimed. So how does one go from being the best at something to a totally new career path? If you're Wambach, you just decide to be the best at something else:I know no matter what I do I'm gonna be good at [it]. But unfortunately, for me, that's not good enough. I want to be the best at whatever I do next. And it's gonna be changing the world, and fighting for equality for everybody in every industry in every city in every country so that everybody has equal opportunity no matter who you are. So that's what I'm gonna do. I have small goals. Small goals, indeed.Also on HuffPost:"

""When any religious group is targeted we all have a responsibility to speak up.""Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States after a California couple who killed 14 people last December were described by authorities as radicalized Muslims inspired by Islamic State militants.Republicans vying to be the party's candidate for the Nov. 8 presidential election also have argued against Obama's plan to accept 10,000 refugees fleeing Syria's war, saying it raised national security risks.Obama urged people watching who had never been to a mosque to think of it as similar to their own houses of worship.""Think of your own church or synagogue or temple, and mosques like this will be very familiar. This is where families come to worship and express their love for God and for each other,"" he said.Obama has called the comments a betrayal of American values, and said discrimination against Muslims ""plays into the hands"" of extremist groups like Islamic State.Muslim civil rights leaders have expressed alarm about anti-Muslim backlash, pointing to recent incidents where vandals have thrown bacon and even a pig's severed heads at mosques.Obama, who has visited mosques outside the United States on trips abroad, first met privately with a small group of Muslim community leaders before delivering remarks at the mosque.He is set to speak to the nation's Christian leaders at the annual National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday, and last week warned against the rise of religious intolerance during a ceremony at the Israeli Embassy.The president, who is a Christian, said it was important to have more Muslim characters portrayed on television who were not related to national security themes, and he said engagement with Muslim American communities must not be a cover for surveillance.Also on HuffPost: "

""It reminds me of this line that Shonda Rhimes wrote on our show that has really resonated with African-Americans. It’s this idea you have to be twice as good to get half of what they have,"" Washington said. ""I think it’s the same for women. You just know, you have to be twice as good. In a way, until girls don’t have that feeling, we will not have done our jobs. That’s almost the point: to not feel the pressure to be extraordinary."" Actress Reese Witherspoon echoed Washington's comments about working hard, sharing an anecdote that illustrates how actresses have to put in extra effort to find roles with substance. ""About four years ago I got sent an awful, terrible script. And this male star was starring in it, and there was a girlfriend part. And I thought, 'You’ve got to be kidding me. No, I’m not interested,'"" Witherspoon told EW.

40,POLITICS,"Congress Seeks Answers On Flint Water Crisis, Doesn't Get Them",Arthur Delaney and Laura Barrón-López,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congress-flint-water-crisis_us_56b225dde4b01d80b244a9c7,"“Can anybody tell me why the governor of Michigan is not here today?""",2016-02-03,"The House Oversight Committee, including ranking member Elijah Cummings and Chairman Jason Chaffetz, demanded answers on the Flint water crisis.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56b229141800006f0080b328.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Members of Congress wanted to get to the bottom of the Flint water crisis, but several key players were missing from an oversight hearing on Wednesday. House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) opted not to call Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) to testify, to the consternation of committee Democrats. And Darnell Earley, one of the emergency managers Snyder had appointed to run Flint, refused to testify even after Chaffetz issued a subpoena Tuesday.""We're calling on the U.S. Marshals to hunt him down and give him that subpoena,"" Chaffetz said.Lead poisoned Flint's water after the city switched its water source in 2014. The state water regulator told Flint not to control for the corrosiveness of the water, and the lack of treatment resulted in the water leaching lead from the city's pipes. And the federal Environmental Protection Agency dragged its feet last year after it knew there was a problem. ""This is the United States of America -- this isn't supposed to happen here,"" Chaffetz said. ""We are not some Third World country where 100,000 people get poisoned.""The committee's hearing was billed as an examination of the federal response to the crisis, and Chaffetz blamed ""failures of government at all levels."" But Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.) disagreed, calling it mainly a state failure. Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-Pa.) took a cue from Kildee, arguing the committee was trying to “create an equivalency of blame,” rather than go after the sole people responsible. “This is the governor of Michigan’s fault, and his emergency managers,” Cartwright said. “Can anybody tell me why the governor of Michigan is not here today? Because he’s hiding.”Snyder’s absence struck a chord with House Democrats, who decided to force the issue with Chaffetz. In a letter released at the start of the hearing, all Democrats on the committee, led by Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), invoked a House rule that allows the minority party to demand a minority day of hearings related to the water crisis in Flint. Democrats requested that Snyder be invited to testify along with emergency managers he appointed since 2011. In a speech last month, Snyder said the crisis began when the Flint City Council voted in 2013 to switch its water source, even though an emergency manager had total control over the city at the time and the vote was to switch to a different water system, not the Flint River. Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) asked witness Keith Creagh, director of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, whether the vote to switch the water resulted in the lead crisis.""I think this incident occurred because of the lack of orthophosphate being added,"" Creagh said, referring to corrosion-inhibiting treatment that could have prevented the lead from Flint's pipes from leaching into people's water. In other words, it was the failure to treat the water, not the decision to switch sources, that caused the problem. Cummings jumped at Creagh's statement. ""Why would Gov. Snyder try to blame the city council for this decision when it was his own appointee who made it and you have a city council that has no authority?"" Cummings said. ""There's something wrong with that.""Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) sided with Democrats in wanting more hearings and testimony from others involved. “What’s nonsensical, what’s disappointing is that one of the people who is probably most culpable for the situation won’t take responsibility for it,” Amash said of emergency manager Earley. “I think he needs to appear here and I’d like to have some more people here.”Another key player missing from the hearing was Miguel Del Toral, an EPA official whose work helped expose the problem last year. Del Toral studied the water in the home of LeeAnn Walters, a Flint resident and activist concerned that her kids were being poisoned by lead. When his report on Walters' water came to light last year, higher-ups in the EPA said it was only a draft that shouldn't have been released -- prompting local officials to dismiss its findings and prolong the water crisis. Del Toral had been listed as a witness on Tuesday, but wasn't there when the hearing started on Wednesday. Chaffetz said he'd been excused because of his close involvement in the ongoing efforts to fix the water in Flint. Rep. Tim Walberg (R-Mich.) asked the EPA's Joel Beauvais why the memo wasn't distributed more widely. Beauvais said he didn't know. So Walberg asked witness Marc Edwards, a corrosion expert with Virginia Tech who helped expose Flint's high lead levels, whether the EPA tried to stifle Del Toral's work. ""The way EPA operates in general is that people who are causing trouble by doing their job aren't allowed to do their job,"" Edwards said. ""They are silenced as Mr. Del Toral was.""Two hours into the hearing, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) said there was plenty of blame to go around.""The problem is there’s not enough answers to be shared,"" he said."

Brooks said the government is on a fiscally unsustainable path, and Congress hasn't helped with Republicans and Democrats agreeing in October to raise the 2017 budget caps by $30 billion.Brooks said Republicans have to get serious about debt-reduction. The deficit is increasing for the first time since 2009 and the Congressional Budget Office projects spending will outpace revenue by $1.4 trillion in 2026. ""What we’re doing is like getting a squirt bottle and thinking that’s going to stop the Titanic from sinking,"" Brooks said.""Paul Ryan has two choices,"" Brooks continued. ""He can either support a financially responsible path that rises to the challenges that America faces, or not.""Freedom Caucus members spent roughly two hours urging Ryan to put forward a budget that reverts to the spending figure set under sequestration, the across-the-board spending cuts imposed in 2013. Two caucus members described the meeting as ""intense.""Ryan, trying to find a way to work with Freedom Caucus members, floated the idea of future entitlement savings to make up for ballooning future deficits. Many caucus members said they want cuts now before they agree to future changes.Ryan told caucus members that much of the blame for the country's growing deficits goes to President Barack Obama, who he met earlier in the day at the White House for a private lunch.Individual caucus members didn't seem to buy Ryan's argument that Republicans are without options -- or blame. (Freedom Caucus members were careful to note they haven't reached an official position on the budget.) Meanwhile, GOP leaders earlier on Tuesday reaffirmed at a press conference that they plan to produce a full budget blueprint.Budget Chairman Tom Price (R-Ga.) told HuffPost he was ""absolutely"" committed to adopting a budget this year. He said he and his committee were working on a document that would produce a balanced budget in 10 years.Asked whether there was a chance Republicans go back on the October budget agreement to use the lower 2017 number, Price said budgets are ""always a challenge"" and that they were ""working through that."" Pressed on whether that meant it was possible Republicans would push for the lower 2017 number, Price reiterated his position. ""These things are always a challenge,"" he said.

The U.S. Supreme Court late on Tuesday denied Jones' request for a stay of execution.His execution was the fifth this year in the United States, and the first of two scheduled this month in Georgia, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, which monitors capital punishment nationwide. Texas, Alabama and Florida executed inmates last month, the center said.The Georgia Supreme Court and the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles rejected his petition to commute his sentence to life without parole.Jones was the second man executed in the shooting death of Roger Tackett, 35, inside a convenience store in June 1979, according to court testimony.Jones was arrested in the store, along with co-defendant Van Roosevelt Solomon, by a police officer who heard four gunshots, according to a Georgia Supreme Court case synopsis.Jones later told another officer, ""There is a man in the back - hurt bad,"" court records said. Police found a badly wounded Tackett in a locked storeroom.Solomon, also convicted of murder, was executed in 1985. Jones had spent decades appealing against his death sentence.A federal district court overturned his death sentence in 1989 because a trial judge had allowed a Bible in the jury deliberation room, finding it could have improperly influenced jurors to base their decision on scripture instead of the law.Another jury again sentenced Jones to death in 1997. Jones had continued to appeal the verdict, saying his trial lawyers failed to introduce evidence of his history of mental illness and childhood sexual abuse.Jones, who declined to request a last meal, was to be offered instead the standard prison menu of chicken and rice, rutabagas, seasoned turnip greens, dry white beans, cornbread, bread pudding and fruit punch, according to the Georgia Department of Corrections.The execution came about two weeks before the planned execution of convicted murderer Travis Clinton Hittson, set for Feb. 17.EARLIER ON HUFFPOST: "

His 186 wins tie with Brett Favre for the most of all time and he's about to become the oldest quarterback to ever start in a Super Bowl. And yet, many quarterbacks surpass Manning's lone Super Bowl victory. So the question becomes: How badly does he need to win another?Brady and Montana each have four, while Manning's brother Eli, inferior in just about every statistical metric, has two. But now, the 39-year-old Manning -- the league's all-time leader in both passing yardage and touchdown passes -- once again has an opportunity to win No. 2. The beauty of the Broncos is that unlike two seasons ago, when Seattle trounced them 43-8 in the big game, this team possesses the premier defense in all of football. It ranks first in total defense and passing defense, leads in sacks and is third in rush defense. Two years ago, it ranked 22nd in points and was 19th in yards allowed.Manning, who was serving as Brock Osweiler's backup less than a month ago -- yes that Brock Osweiler -- has had arguably the worst season of his Hall of Fame career. And the playoffs are indicative of it. He could barely surpass the 200-yard mark against a soft Pittsburgh defense in the divisional round, unable to find the end zone at all. Then, against the defending Super Bowl champion Patriots, he had one of the great all-time halves in playoff history, only to go silent in the second half, a game that was preserved by his stellar defense.Manning, as a result, has for the first time ever been labeled as a game manager. This is not the No. 18 we grew accustomed to seeing during his first three years in Denver -- he's never been worse.His teams have made the playoffs 15 times but lost in the first round nine times. So even amidst his dominant regular season successes, Manning has endured a slew of atrocious playoff games, which has not plagued stars like Brady and Montana.In fact, Manning's teams have failed to score more than 18 points in 11 of his 13 career playoff losses, including both of his Super Bowl defeats, per Bleacher Report. Furthermore, his fourth quarter and overtime performance in the postseason has been noticeably worse than quarters one, two and three. According to Pro Football Focus, Manning's completion percentage dips over 6 percent and, maybe more importantly, his passer rating decreases over 12 percent.One of the main problems when evaluating Manning's postseason troubles is his sheer brilliance in the regular season. An average football fan could feasibly argue that his record five MVPs have only amplified his playoff disappointments. Pro football legends like Dan Marino and Jim Kelly can certainly relate. Neither owns a ring and despite terrific numbers -- especially in the case of Marino -- both are in large part defined by their postseason failures.When it comes down to it, whether or not Peyton Manning and the Broncos beat surefire league MVP Cam Newton's one-loss Carolina squad is anyone's guess -- they are a significant underdog for what it's worth -- but consider that only 11 quarterbacks in NFL history have ever won multiple Super Bowls.As a reference point, Manning's boss and the architect of the Broncos, John Elway, lost his first three only to win his final two. Like Manning, it's not that he wasn't a first ballot Hall of Famer before the rings, but they undeniably altered the way he was looked at. Suddenly, Elway was a winner.If he can find a way to capture his second, Manning, regardless of how he plays Sunday, will drastically enhance the way we view his career, ala Elway. It will even his Super Bowl record to .500 and finally put to rest the useless argument that he isn't an ultra clutch performer.

They beat him, stole his belongings and called him anti-gay slurs. He suffered bruises all over his body. Only a decade earlier, Fox had been the founder of his public Cleveland high school's first Gay Straight Alliance, a club that became one of the largest in the school and allowed Fox to express himself freely as a gay student, he says. He was dismayed to learn that some of his attackers -- two of whom were found responsible for the incident -- likely attended the same school. ""Over the course of that trial, I really discovered a lot of things about myself and the environment I left there in Cleveland,"" said Fox. ""We can't just start a GSA in a school and think that’s it. We can’t just train teachers and say that things are going to be amazing. We really have to educate the community.""In January, Fox became the first LGBT community liaison for the New York City Public School system, the largest school system in the country. The goal is to make sure schools are safe for LGBT students and teachers, to make sure schools are fostering inclusive environments and to create a lasting change through programs that educate students about the importance of tolerance. Prior to taking on this new position, Fox had been working in the technology division in the New York City Department of Education, training teachers to use iPads and smart boards. He spent several years as a teacher in New Orleans before that. He has been an active volunteer with the Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network for years. But his trip back home to Cleveland two years ago solidified his desire to dedicate himself to teaching tolerance.""I'm from this community, and I went back for just one weekend, and the first night I was there that happened,"" Fox said of his attack. ""It changed my life. It confirmed that I'm in this for the long run."" The New York City Council voted to fund the first LGBT community liaison position under the charge of NYC Council Education Committee Chairperson Daniel Dromm. Dromm came out as gay when he was a teacher in the early '90s. ""Back in those days, LGBT teachers and students were mostly closeted,"" Dromm said last week in a statement about the announcement of Jared's position. ""With the appointment of Jared Fox as the new LGBT liaison, the Department has taken a bold step forward to assure students and teachers alike that anti-gay discrimination will not be tolerated and that, in fact, the Department will look for ways to be more inclusive of the LGBT communities.""For Fox, his first weeks on the job have consisted of mostly listening, figuring out what needs to be done and deciding what he should set as tangible goals. By the end of the year, he hopes to launch a program that brings LGBT authors into English classrooms to talk about their books. He wants to figure out what it would take to get gender-neutral bathrooms in schools. He is thinking about how to design a curriculum that is more inclusive of all students.But most of all, he wants to make sure that New York City kids never feel afraid to go to school. ""This is 28 years of dreaming of what I would want to do when I grew up,"" said Fox of the job. ""To wake up in the morning and be able to know the work I'm going to do is going to make school safer for everybody, not just LGBT kids ... I think it's amazing. I feel blessed."""
