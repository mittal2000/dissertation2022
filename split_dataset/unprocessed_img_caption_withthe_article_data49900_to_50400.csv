0,POLITICS,Purple Heart Recipient To Donald Trump: No One Should Ever 'Want' To Get The Medal,Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-purple-heart-barney_us_57a0fabee4b08a8e8b5fdbf6,"""Donald Trump has not sacrificed for this country and he does not understand duty to any cause other than himself.""",2016-08-02,Democratic congressional candidate Sean Barney holds up his Purple Heart.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a0fead1300002a007c28ac.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A Democratic congressional candidate who fought in the Iraq War and was awarded a Purple Heart for injuries sustained there slammed Donald Trump on Tuesday, after the GOP nominee said he’d “always wanted” to get the medal.Speaking at a campaign event in Virginia, Trump thanked an Iraq War veteran who had given him his Purple Heart as a gift prior to taking the stage.“I said to him, ‘Is that like the real one or is that a copy? And he said, ‘That’s my real Purple Heart. I have such confidence in you,’” Trump said in Ashburn, Virginia. “And I said, ‘Man that’s big stuff.’ I always wanted to get the Purple Heart. This was much easier, but I tell you it was such an honor.”The comment drew the ire of Sean Barney, a Democrat running for Congress in Delaware who was shot in the neck by a sniper while on patrol with the Marine Corps in Fallujah.“Today, a Donald Trump supporter handed him a Purple Heart. Trump’s flippant and repugnant reply: ‘I always wanted to get the Purple Heart. This was much easier,’” Barney wrote in a post on Facebook. “As someone who fought for our country in Iraq, was injured, and was awarded a Purple Heart, I can tell you, no one should ever ‘want’ to get a Purple Heart.”“Again and again, Donald Trump has proven that he is unfit to be the Commander in Chief of our armed forces. As Khizr Khan poignantly argued, Donald Trump has not sacrificed for this country and he does not understand duty to any cause other than himself,” Barney added, referring to the father of a Muslim American war hero who last week addressed the Democratic convention.Barney also included a photo of himself holding up his Purple Heart. The medal is awarded to those injured or killed while serving the country.Rep. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) tweeted a response to Trump’s Purple Heart remark as well.Trump’s comment about the Purple Heart comes amid heated debate over his understanding of military sacrifice. The Pakistani-born Khan rebuked the Manhattan real estate mogul last week for his proposal to ban Muslim immigration, adding he had “sacrificed nothing and no one,” a reference to Khan’s son who died in combat.Pressed to respond on Sunday, Trump told ABC News that he had “made a lot of sacrifices. I work very, very hard. I’ve created thousands and thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs, built great structures. I’ve done― I’ve had― I’ve had tremendous success. I think I’ve done a lot.”Trump’s comments on Tuesday also come in the wake of a New York Times report detailing the Manhattan real estate mogul’s draft deferments during the Vietnam War. He received four education deferments and one medical deferment due to a diagnosis of bone spurs in his heels.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."
1,POLITICS,DNC Cleans House After Email Hack Turmoil,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dnc-cleans-house_us_57a0f939e4b0693164c306c6,Three top staffers are out.,2016-08-02,Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) recently resigned as chair of the Democratic National Committee.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a0fb462a0000fa01fb4430.jpeg?ops=crop_0_0_4505_2487%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The Democratic National Committee announced the departure of three high-level officials Tuesday, as the organization works to rebuild after criticism that it was playing favorites in the presidential primary.Interim DNC Chair Donna Brazile said in a statement that CEO Amy Dacey, CFO Brad Marshall and Communications Director Luis Miranda were all leaving, adding that she was “grateful for their commitment to this cause.”“This election is the most important of my lifetime, and the DNC will continue to recruit top talent to help lead the fight to elect Hillary Clinton and Democrats across the country,” said Brazile. “I am committed to adding to our team of skilled professionals who will make sure that Donald Trump is held accountable for his reckless rhetoric and harmful policies.”The departures follow the resignation of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), who stepped down as chair on the eve of the Democratic National Convention. The catalyst was leaks of DNC staffers’ hacked emails that seemed to show the committee working to help get Clinton elected ― even though the party was supposed to be neutral in the primary.But dissatisfaction with Wasserman Schultz had been growing for months. The chairwoman became a lightning rod for criticism from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) supporters, who long believed she was tipping the scales for Clinton.Dacey, Marshall and Miranda all had some of their emails leaked. In one of the most damaging emails, Marshall appeared to speculate that Sanders is an atheist ― despite his Jewish heritage ― and said it could be used against him in the Kentucky and West Virginia primaries. “My Southern Baptist peeps would draw a big difference between a Jew and an atheist,” he wrote. Dacey replied, “AMEN.”Marshall later apologized, although he told The Intercept his email was about a surrogate, not Sanders. The DNC has also been struggling internally, with current and former staffers saying it’s a shell of what it once was. They told The Huffington Post that morale was low as a result of management decisions, constant scrutiny from activists and a feeling that in this cycle, the organization was essentially left in the dust ― not trusted by Clinton’s campaign to handle messaging and not in the mix on key fights. From early June to mid-September last year, for example, the DNC went without a communications director, a misstep that frustrated Democratic officials. Former DNC staffers said at the time that it was hard to guide the Democratic Party without a messaging strategy and, to do that, someone needed to be at the helm.Wasserman Schultz’s eventual choice, Miranda, quickly ruffled feathers when he came on board. Current and former staffers in the department say they moved away from the rapid response they had focused on during the GOP primary and spent more time promoting Wasserman Schultz’s brand and booking her on TV. At least five communications staffers ended up leaving. Part of it was the usual culture clash when a new boss takes over and priorities shift. But part of it was also that Wasserman Schultz seemed to have lost some of the loyalty of her staff, who wanted to turn their focus elsewhere. Sources told Politico that Dacey had run into trouble with Wasserman Schultz and had been cut out of significant decisions, “leading to confusion and turmoil unrelated to the email drama.”Brazile announced Tuesday that she is bringing on several people to serve as a transition team for the general election. The team will be led by Tom McMahon, who served as DNC executive director when Howard Dean was chair. Also on that team will be Brandon Davis, currently the organization’s chief of staff, and strategist Doug Thornell as a senior adviser. Clinton campaign chair John Podesta told HuffPost last week that the campaign would like to see a progressive replace Wasserman Schultz as head of the DNC. “We will want a person at the head of the party that represents the progressive platform that the party adopted and that represents that spirit of reform and integration of the grass-roots into the party,” he said."
2,POLITICS,Donald Trump Is Correct That Hillary Clinton Looks Different From Past Presidents,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-look-presidential_us_57a0d41ee4b08a8e8b5fa64f,Hm. What is different? What could it be?,2016-08-02,"These are the photos that come up in a Google search for U.S. president. Yes, they're all men.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a0f6ab2a00000002fb4414.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump went after Hillary Clinton Tuesday for the way she looks, saying she just doesn’t seem presidential. “Do you think she looks presidential? I don’t think so,” Trump said to his crowd at a rally in Ashburn, Virginia. Trump didn’t elaborate on what it is about Clinton that doesn’t look presidential, and his campaign didn’t return a request for comment. But he is right that she does look different from past presidents, and there’s a pretty obvious reason why. Looking presidential or looking authoritative has long been something women running for office have had to deal with. It’s considered normal and expected for presidents to possess attributes traditionally associated with masculinity: strength, toughness, virility, athleticism and a cool charisma. The country even likes its presidents tall, which men are more likely to be than women. Former Rep. Pat Schroeder (D-Colo.), who explored a presidential run in 1987, has pointed out that there’s a standard way men can dress when they want to look like they’re in charge and working hard. But for women, it’s much harder.“All of us could advise men on what to wear,” Schroeder said during a press call last year. “If you want to look busy, you either take off your tie, loosen your collar, roll up your shirtsleeves, run down some steps, have a phone in your ear.”“There’s no similar kind of uniform for women,” she added. “And we tend to either look like unmade beds or look like a model. Trying to find out how a woman looks like she’s working hard through these very important visuals is just not something that there’s a real formula for.”Since women were also excluded from positions of military leadership for so long, it was also hard for members of the public to wrap their heads around the image of a woman as commander in chief. When Geraldine Ferraro ran for vice president, journalist Marvin Kalb asked her on “Meet the Press” whether she could “push the nuclear button” if she had to ― a question the men in the race didn’t get.And when a woman does finally occupy the Oval Office, longtime Democratic strategist Ann Lewis believes that it will help propel more women into public office.“You cannot want what you can’t even imagine,” Lewis told The Huffington Post recently. “It’s very hard to get up every day and work for something that seems absolutely out-of-sight impossible. A woman in the White House means to everybody, ‘Oh, I can do this.’ Not just, by the way, for women, but anyone who has thought you’re ruled out.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."
3,POLITICS,Chris Christie: It's 'Inappropriate' To Criticize Khizr Khan And His Family,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chris-christie-donald-trump-khan_us_57a0e478e4b0693164c2e9cf,"The New Jersey governor said the Khans have ""the right to say whatever they want.""",2016-08-02,"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) broke with the man he supports as president and said it was ""inappropriate"" to attack the Khan family.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a0e4c21300002a007c27ef.jpeg?cache=E8mENNaMfo&ops=crop_6_303_2994_1446%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) broke with Donald Trump on Tuesday and defended Khizr and Ghazala Khan, saying it was “inappropriate” to criticize the Gold Star parents.Christie told reporters at a press conference Tuesday afternoon that although he didn’t see the Khans’ appearance at the Democratic National Convention last week, as a father, he could not imagine the pain they endured when they lost their son, an Army captain who gave his life saving his fellow soldiers in Iraq in 2004. “For Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the pain of losing their son while defending our country is unfathomable, and I think it gives them the right to say whatever they want, whether they’re right or wrong,” Christie said, according to Politico. Khizr Khan’s moving DNC speech went after Trump for his attacks on Muslims and immigrants, saying, “Have you ever been to Arlington Cemetery? Go look at the graves of brave patriots who died defending the United States of America. You will see all faiths, genders and ethnicities. You have sacrificed nothing and no one.”Since then, Khan has come under intense criticism from Trump and his supporters. He has been called a terrorist, and has been described as unpatriotic and not humble enough. Trump has repeatedly tweeted about him, and in an interview with ABC News, he suggested that Ghazala Khan didn’t speak at the convention because her Muslim faith didn’t allow her to. For the record, Khan responded in a Washington Post op-ed that the reason she didn’t speak was because she was too overcome by grief. Christie has, in the past, been outspoken about anti-Muslim bigotry. In 2011, he stood up for Sohail Mohammed, a Muslim American man he nominated for a seat on the New Jersey Superior Court of Passaic County.“Ignorance is behind the criticism of Sohail Mohammed. ... They are criticizing him because he is a Muslim American,” Christie said at the time. Conservative writers called Mohammed “a longtime mouthpiece for radical Islamists” and charged Christie with being “in bed with the enemy.”Christie is an outspoken supporter of Trump, making his comments Tuesday notable. He declined to offer a specific opinion on whether Trump mishandled the Khan episode, but he encouraged people to stay focused on the sacrifice of the troops. “We need to honor their sacrifice for our country and we need to honor their son’s sacrifice for our country,” Christie said. “And to focus on anything other than that, to me, is missing the point. That’s what we should be doing, and any comments that we’re making publicly or privately should be with that in mind. My view on this is that the Khans have a right to say whatever it is they want regarding the loss of their son and that for all the Gold Star families out there, they have put forward a sacrifice that I cannot fathom as a parent.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

The shopping center is located approximately 25 miles from downtown Atlanta.Investigators did not return a call for comment from The Huffington Post on Tuesday. In an interview with The Associated Press, Roswell Police Detective Zachary Frommer said authorities believe both teens were killed where their bodies were found.“We don’t really have reason to believe they were killed elsewhere,” Frommer said.Atlanta’s WXIA‑TV obtained a redacted copy of the initial police report, which indicates Henderson and Davis sustained injuries consistent with gunshot wounds. However, police have yet to confirm the report.Authorities previously stated the teens died as a result of “severe head trauma,” which could include stabbing, shooting or some other type of trauma, Frommer told the AP.The report also indicates Henderson was the ex-girlfriend of Davis, according to the Roswell Patch.“Given what the officers had on scene at that moment, it appeared to be a relationship-involved situation,” Frommer told the Roswell Patch. “This information can change quickly as evidence and information is gathered, but is only meant to be a starting point.”The results of the teens’ autopsies, scheduled to be performed on Tuesday, have yet to be released.Davis was to start his senior year at River Ridge High School on Monday, where he played football and lacrosse.“We all are devastated by this tragic news,” Principal Darrell Herring said in a statement obtained by Atlanta’s WSB-TV. “Carter was an energetic student who was known as a friend to all. He always came to class in a good mood and with a smile on his face. He excelled in the classroom and was always willing to help out classmates.A GoFundMe page established to raise funds for Davis’ funeral has garnered more than $5,000 in donations as of Tuesday evening.Henderson attended Roswell High School, where she was a member of the band and color guard.“Natalie Henderson was a thriving member of the Color Guard — a fun, talented young woman who was loved by so many,” reads a statement posted to the school’s band Facebook page on behalf of Dr. Michael Moon, the director of bands. “Her absence will be felt by each of us ... for a long time to come.”Anyone with information in the case is asked to contact the Roswell Police Department at (770) 640-4100 or Crime Stoppers Atlanta at 404-577-TIPS.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated Natalie Henderson attended Riverwood High School."

A new hygiene kit invented by a college student in Dublin hopes to make life a little more bearable there.While studying at the National College of Art & Design in Dublin, John Godfrey, 22, volunteered at the Calais camp, in the area that’s been dubbed the “Jungle,” and was horrified by the lack of hygiene and sanitation there.“[It was] one of the most pressing issues within the camp at the time,” Godfrey told The Huffington Post.The situation is so severe that residents have diarrhea, stomach cramps, fever and vomiting because they don’t have access to washing facilities, according to the Guardian.

The camp, which is home to about 3,000 people, failed to meet the standards recommended by the UN Refugee Agency, the World Health Organization or the Sphere project, according to a report released by the University of Birmingham in October. When Godfrey returned from his trip in January, he was inspired to put his design skills to use to give refugees a means to clean themselves with dignity. That’s when he came up with the wash bag, a portable hygiene kit that doubles as an ideal camping accessory and a lifesaving tool for refugees.The 15-euro (about $17) kit contains a number of essentials, including two bars of soap, a toothbrush, toothpaste, hand sanitizer, sanitary napkins in the female packs and a collapsible camping shower.Godfrey’s goal is to market his product with the one-for-one business model.Every time a customer purchases one of his kits, one will be sent to a refugee in need.Godfrey said it costs about 6 euros (about $7) to produce.The recent college graduate aimed to come up with a simple design, so that users ― from children to adults ― could intuitively figure out how to use it.“The pack doesn’t scream for attention,” Godfrey said, “it’s a well-designed piece of equipment that does exactly what it’s intended to do; return a little bit of control to someone who needs it.”By implementing the one-for-one model, Godfrey hopes to push other young people to get involved with helping refugees in need. Godfrey’s next step is to test the product among refugees in Europe to determine how to improve it. However, at this point, he hasn’t been able to afford to do so.He also hopes to demonstrate just how much commonality there is between refugees and non-refugees.“It always seemed as though these are people who are from somewhere I’ve never been, speaking languages I cannot and with problems I’ve never encountered,” Godfrey said. “It very quickly became apparent that these are people who are, for the most part, just like you and I, who’ve found themselves in an extremely unfortunate situation.”"

Twenty others have been diagnosed with anthrax, according to CBS.The region’s governor, Dmitry Kobylkin, linked the outbreak to a massive temperature spike in the region that has melted the permafrost ― a thick layer of soil and organic matter frozen year-round in the coldest areas of the planet. Unusually hot weather has seen temperatures hover close to 95 degrees Fahrenheit for more than a month in parts of the tundra.“I have no words to express my feelings,” Kobylkin told Agency France-Presse. “The infection showed its cunning. Returning after 75 years, it took away a child’s life.”Officials began investigating the outbreak in late June after reindeer began dying en masse. The anthrax outbreak was later linked to a 75-year-old carcass that had thawed with the permafrost, releasing dormant bacteria spores that infected other animals.More than 2,300 reindeer have succumbed to the pathogen since the outbreak began, according to the Siberian Times. Healthy animals in the herd, which numbers more than 200,000, are being vaccinated, and the government said it would spend $1.3 million to help nomads in the region affected by the outbreak.Anthrax isn’t contagious and is spread in humans through spores in the air, food and drink and through open wounds. It can be easily treated with antibiotics, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The Siberian Times reported the young boy, Denis, who died on Saturday was exposed after eating venison from an infected animal.The Washington Post notes scientists have long worried about the viability of anthrax spores after decades of hibernation. In 2011, two researchers from the Russian Academy of Sciences wrote that a consequence of melting permafrost could bring back “the vectors of deadly infections of the 18th and 19th centuries ... especially near the cemeteries where the victims of these infections were buried.”Disease aside, another study released by a researcher at the National Snow and Ice Data Center last year warned climate-change-induced melting of the world’s permafrosts could lead to trillions of dollars in damages."

10,POLITICS,Why America Has A Leg Up On Fighting Extremism -- For Now,Krithika Varagur,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/multiculturalism-extremism-christopher-meserole_us_57a0ed87e4b0693164c2f01b,Multiculturalism is a powerful concept.,2016-08-02,Khizr Khan offers to loan his copy of the Constitution to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump during the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a0ef582a00002d004f7e5c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This week’s standoff between Donald Trump and the parents of slain Muslim American soldier Humayun Khan is the latest example of the Republican presidential nominee’s relentless Islamophobia. But Trump’s divisive rhetoric may backfire and bring about more domestic terrorism, according to one extremism expert. Why? Because multiculturalism can be a powerful safeguard against radicalization. But when Muslims feel excluded from the country they live in, they are far more susceptible to recruiting by groups like the self-described Islamic State, also known as ISIS.France and Belgium provide chilling examples of the consequences, according to Christopher Meserole, a Brookings Institute researcher. He describes a “French connection” between disenfranchisement and radicalization in France, Belgium and former French-administered territories like Tunisia and Lebanon ― where he argues that a unique, rigid concept of national identity alienates Muslim residents. For example, there have been many campaigns against headscarves in French-speaking countries, making it difficult for Muslim citizens to reconcile their religious and national heritage, according to Meserole. What does that mean for Americans? If rigid national identity spurs radicalization, as Meserole argues, our country’s history of religious diversity may have the opposite effect ― that is, if Trump’s divisive, Islamophobic rhetoric doesn’t win out. We asked Meserole to tell us more about his research on radicalization and what it could mean for America in the age of Trump.You have linked Francophone political culture to radicalism in France and Belgium. What exactly is it about the politics of those two countries that may alienate vulnerable youth?In France, there are widely shared norms about how to best limit the role of religion in public life. Those norms are rooted in a concept called “laïcité,” a term which refers to the strict separation of church and state. For some Muslims in France, the implication of laïcité is that it’s not possible to be both French and Muslim. Obviously, there are many French Muslims who would disagree with that conclusion. But for Muslims who believe faith is more important than nationality, or even just those who believe their faith demands that they appear or behave a certain way in public, it can be a fraught balance, and lead to alienation from the mainstream of French society. How does American politics differ from French politics, in a general sense? The concept of laïcité may sound similar to the secular government we have in the U.S., but it’s actually a bit different. Here, we’ll often talk about maintaining a “wall of separation” between church and state. But that term refers to a phrase Thomas Jefferson used in a personal letter, not to anything in the Constitution. And in any case, American secularism isn’t about keeping religion out of public life altogether; it’s about making sure the government doesn’t treat any one religion differently another. That’s why you’ll see American politicians simultaneously talk about the importance of secular governance while also stressing, quite publicly, how important faith is to their lives. Think of Hillary Clinton quoting Methodist dogma at length as she accepted her nomination last week.By contrast, in France, there’s a famous 1905 law separating church and state, which was passed in response to the historical influence of the Catholic Church in French politics. Unlike in the U.S., the law really does strictly ban religious expressions in public life, and over time the “laique” norms underlying the law have come to enjoy enormous popular support. For a French politician to quote religious dogma approvingly in a major speech, as Clinton did, would be unusual.Besides speaking French, what other variables have you found that correlate with rates of radicalization? Do any of them apply to America at this time? Youth unemployment is one, but it seems to be more of a problem in Europe and North Africa than the United States. We certainly have pockets of youth unemployment here, but thankfully not quite to the same extent as in other countries.What do public campaigns against the veil (such as those undertaken in France and Québec, Canada) have to do with ostracizing Muslims?The main strategy of ISIS is what it calls “eliminating the gray zone.” Its main goal in attacking countries in the West is to provoke Western governments into cracking down on their Muslim populations, to the point where Muslims will be forced to choose between being Western and being Muslim. ISIS thinks that if they can force that choice, then many Muslims will choose them.The issue with banning the veil is that, at least for the Muslim communities who believe the veil is an authentic expression of faith, it forces a similar choice. If you think piety requires you to wear certain dress in public, and that dress is banned from public places, then you would have to choose between your faith on the one hand, and participating in society on the other. There wouldn’t be room to be Muslim and also a public citizen.Even if the veil isn’t literally outlawed, does the discourse itself have an alienating effect?Yes, I think so. The discourse around bans is probably more important than the bans themselves. Even if a headscarf bill doesn’t pass, so long as a major politician pushes the bill ― and defends it by saying that the values it represents are not compatible with democratic values ― then that can be enough to plant a seed. And for the jihadist pitching a new recruit, they just need the seed to already be there in the recruit’s head. It’s much easier to convince someone to join the jihadist cause if they already have strong prior beliefs that religious and national identities aren’t compatible. Put differently, it’s much easier for a recruiter if their recruits are hearing the same message from the other side, too ― if it’s not just the jihadists saying Islam and democracy aren’t compatible, but prominent politicians appearing to say it too.What do you think are the effects of Donald Trump’s proposed “Muslim ban” on American Muslims? Is this dangerous?I started this project around the time Trump floated the idea. At that point, I thought the ban was a bad idea, but mostly on moral grounds ― a ban would go against everything that, in my view, makes America great. At this point, though, I also think it’s patently dangerous. A travel ban obviously isn’t quite the same as veil ban, but it would play into jihadist recruiter’s hands in much the same way.How can Americans help blunt the effects of Islamophobia?Give more voice to Muslims. There are a lot more American Muslims now than there were 20 or 30 years ago. But Muslims are still a small percentage of the population, and they tend to be clustered in major urban areas. As a result, a lot of Americans don’t know any Muslims personally, which means their only exposure to Muslims is through the news ― often in the aftermath of terrible tragedies. I would love to see more voice given to Muslims. A large part of the attention Khizr and Ghazala Khan have gotten lately owes to the extraordinary sacrifice their family has made, and the way that sacrifice alone pushes back against Trump’s rhetoric. But I also wonder whether part of the response has to do with it being the first time many Americans have heard two Muslim voices speak with such decency and wisdom and eloquence. That’s not because other Khizr and Ghazala Khans don’t exist. It’s because we haven’t found a way yet to give them a platform.

Assad has denied previous accusations of using chemical weapons.A spokesman for the Syria Civil Defence said 33 people, mostly women and children, were affected by the gas, which they suspect was chlorine, in Saraqeb, in rebel-held Idlib province.The group, which describes itself as a neutral band of search and rescue volunteers, posted a video on YouTube apparently showing a number of men struggling to breathe and being given oxygen masks by people in civil defense uniforms.“Medium-sized barrels fell containing toxic gasses. The Syrian Civil Defence was not able to determine the type of the gas,” said the spokesman.The Syrian government and its Russian allies were not immediately available for comment.The SNC said in a statement: “After shelling, besieging and killing civilians and perpetrating war crimes on them, the Assad regime has resorted once again, and in breach of UN resolutions 2118 and 2235, to using chemical substances and toxic gasses.“The daily reality confirms that all the international agreements and previous security council decisions, be they about chemical weapons or otherwise, are meaningless for the Assad regime.”The Civil Defence spokesman said it was the second time Saraqeb had been hit by toxic gas. The group was aware of around nine suspected chlorine gas incidents across Idlib province since the conflict began, he said.Monitors at the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which tracks violence on all sides in the civil war, said barrel bombs fell on Saraqeb late on Monday, wounding a large number of citizens.Russia’s defense ministry said a Russian helicopter was shot down near Saraqeb during the day on Monday, killing all five people on board, in the biggest officially acknowledged loss of life for Russian forces since they started operations in Syria.DENIALSThe helicopter came down roughly mid-way between Aleppo and Russia’s main air base at Khmeimim in the western province of Latakia, near the Mediterranean coast.Russian air power began supporting Syrian President Bashar al Assad late last year, an intervention which tipped the balance of the war in Assad’s favor, eroding gains the rebels had made that year.The Russian defense ministry said the Mi-8 military transport helicopter was shot down after delivering humanitarian aid to Aleppo as it made its way back to Khmeimim.No group has claimed responsibility for downing the helicopter.Government and opposition forces have both denied using chemical weapons during the five-year-old civil war. Western powers say the government has been responsible for chlorine and other chemical attacks. The government and Russia have accused rebels of using poison gas.U.N. investigators established that sarin gas was used in Eastern Ghouta in 2013. The United States accused Damascus of that attack, which it estimates killed 1,429 people, including at least 426 children. Damascus denied responsibility, and blamed rebels.Later that year the United Nations and the Syrian government agreed to destroy the state’s declared stockpile of chemical weapons, a process completed in January 2016.The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons confirmed in late 2015 that sulfur mustard, commonly known as mustard gas, had been used for the first time in the conflict, without saying which party in the many sided conflict it thought had used it.This article has been updated to include new details, including the opposition statement accusing Syrian regime of being behind the gas attack."

Humayun S.M. Khan, who was Muslim, was killed in Iraq in 2004, saving several other soldiers’ lives in the process. His father, Khizr Khan, highlighted that sacrifice in his DNC speech and rebuked Trump’s proposal to ban Muslims from immigrating to the U.S.“If it was up to Donald Trump, he never would have been in America,” Khan said last Thursday.The GOP nominee has spent the ensuing days attacking Khizr Khan and his wife, Ghazala, drawing criticism from many politicians on both sides of the aisle as well as the families of fallen soldiers. “When you question a mother’s pain, by implying that her religion, not her grief, kept her from addressing an arena of people, you are attacking us,” read a letter that 17 families of service members killed in combat signed.Some of Khan’s former army comrades have echoed that sentiment in interviews this past week and reflected on how the captain always put others before himself.Retired Gen. Dana Pittard, who was Khan’s brigade commander, told the Daily Beast that the captain was an “American patriot.” Trump’s remarks show he doesn’t understand the camaraderie between military families, he said.“The Khan family is our family,” Pittard added. Former Army Pfc. Vanessa Brenes-Ramirez described the captain to the Daily Beast as her “protector,” in the article published Tuesday.“I didn’t even know he was a Muslim,” she said. “He was American. That’s what he was. All the colors we saw were green.”Brenes-Ramirez told the Boston Herald Monday that she was uncomfortable with Khan’s death becoming a focal point in the presidential campaign.“I hate that they are making it about religion or beliefs,” she said. “He believed in the military, that’s what his dad was saying. He was a hero — so many more people could have died that day. He represented the United States. He didn’t think twice about doing what he needed to do to save people.”Several soldiers who served with Khan also spoke to The Washington Post in a tribute article published Tuesday. While those service members would not comment on Trump’s remarks nor the ensuing backlash, they did praise the captain’s leadership. “He never put his rank above his care for his soldiers and his comrades,” said former Sgt. Laci Walker, who served with Khan. “He was the most amazing officer I ever worked for.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S. "

But amid that crisis, Brazil is being heralded as a pioneer for the innovative way it has substantially increased breastfeeding rates and reduced its child mortality rates by 73 percent from 1990 to last year. A recent study from the Lancet, a U.K. medical journal, found that if breastfeeding rates reached near universal levels, 823,000 deaths of children under 5 could be prevented every year due to the fact that the practice protects against a number of serious health conditions. Despite such evidence, only 35 percent of mothers worldwide in 2013 exclusively breastfed their babies for the first six months of life, as the World Health Organization recommends.An inability to produce enough milk, work conflicts, cultural pressure, a lack of education on the topic and other issues, keep moms from breastfeeding their babies in both low- and high-income countries, according to the Lancet report.But Brazil has devised an effective method to educate mothers and make it easier for them to breastfeed their babies. That kind of programming is being linked to its significant drop in child mortality rates, according to the Brazilian Human Milk Banks Network and Ministry of Health of Brazil.Part of what distinguishes Brazil from other countries is that is has the most human milk banks.Of the 292 human milk banks in the world, 220 of them are based in Brazil.Human milk banks enable mothers to donate their breast milk in a safe and convenient way so that babies in need can access it. Milk banks cater to babies who were born premature, underweight, severely malnourished, or have been orphaned, according to PATH, a nonprofit that focuses on improving the health and wellbeing of women and children. Delaying breastfeeding at birth can have severe consequences. According to UNICEF, it increases risks of newborn death by 80 percent. Those who can donate, call the bank when they’re ready to give and a delivery service picks up the milk and preserves it with special cooling systems until it arrives at the bank, according to UNICEF. But scaling up human milk banks in poor countries has been a major challenge because of the painstaking steps involved in the process. To ensure that donated milk doesn’t carry HIV or other pathogens, human milk banks have to pasteurize the donated milk.Brazil launched its milk bank network in 1998 and in the last decade nearly 2 million babies have received human milk through it.Exclusive breastfeeding rates have also soared in Brazil, due to the growing breast milk network and other encouraging initiatives.In 1986, 2 percent of infants under 6 months were exclusively breastfed. By 2006, that figure climbed to 39 percent, according to the Brazilian Human Milk Banks Network and Ministry of Health of Brazil.The South America country has also helped boost the practice through its paid maternity leave and by rigorously monitoring the formula industry. The country regulates the marketing of breast milk substitutes to preclude the industry from influencing breastfeeding moms.Brazil hopes to promote its breast milk bank model at the upcoming Nutrition for Growth event on Aug. 4. UN organizations, government leaders and advocates from the UK and Japan will convene in Rio de Janeirno to learn about effective child nutrition programs and policies and how to implement them. Women who have been able to take advantage of the milk bank say they’re grateful for the opportunity, and hope to be able to return the favor.When Paula Nunes’ daughter, Alice Maria, was born premature in 2013, Nunes wasn’t able to produce enough milk for her daughter. She visited the bank at the Cesar Cals Hospital in Fortaleza, Brazil where she was able to get donated milk to supplement her own and learn how to feed her baby through a tube, according to UNICEF.“I have enough breast milk to feed my baby in the daytime. But sometimes, at night, I don’t seem able to produce enough milk, and that’s when my baby can benefit from the women who have donated to the milk bank,” she told UNICEF. “I feel so blessed that, as soon as I can produce extra milk, I will be sure to donate it to help other mothers like me.”"

In the aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo shooting, for example, hundreds of thousands gathered around the statue to mourn those killed and the attack on free speech. They placed black Xs across the lips of some of the figures and tied oversized pencils around their palms. Make-shift memorial sites also emerged outside the Charlie Hebdo offices on Rue Nicolas Appert and in front of cafes soon after the attacks and again a few months later in November after the city-wide attacks that struck a number of restaurants and bars, a stadium and the Bataclan concert hall, but most of these have been removed. The Place de la Republique was the longest living memorial after the one at the Bataclan.BuzzFeed France reported on Monday that the site was cordoned off by fences and security workers, to make way for the city to take down posters and remove the objects that had piled up in the area.The mayor of Paris’ 10th arrondissement, Remi Feraud, told HuffPost France that cleaning the Place de la Republique is not intended to purge the commemorative character it had gained. “It’s not a question of removing the memorial character of the statue, quite the contrary. People will continue to honor the victims at this place, at the foot of the tree of remembrance planted a year after the attacks of January 2015,” Feraud said. In January 2016, French President François Hollande and the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, organized a commemoration for those who had been killed in terrorist attacks in the city, unveiling a memorial oak tree in the square.“But we want the statue to be clean, that is also the will of the people,” Feraud continued. The city is planning for a 10-day operation, and Feraud says city staff will collect the drawings, photographs and other objects at the square, as they have done at other informal memorials that have popped up on Parisian streets in recent months, and will store them in the Paris city hall’s archives. “Everything will be done in coordination with the archives, which will store all documents and messages left since January 2015,” Feraud said.Scroll down for more photos of the Place de la République.

By accepting migrants we would create fertile ground for barbaric attacks,” Ovcacek said.“The president does not agree with any acceptance of migrants in the Czech territory.”The Czechs and other central Europeans have been the most critical of the European Union’s response to the unprecedented migration crisis in which over a million people entered the bloc last year.The government opposes an EU quota system to re-distribute asylum seekers but has not followed Slovakia and Hungary in challenging it in the courts.

CDC said the first evidence of possible local Zika transmission in Florida goes back to mid-June.CONCERNS ABOUT SPREADING“To assume that it’s just restricted to these few square blocks is presumptuous,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.Hotez believes there are other likely local outbreaks occurring and that more can be expected in the next six weeks in Florida and other Gulf Coast states where the mosquito that carries the virus is common.Reuters was first to report that as of last Friday, Florida had not activated a CERT team to help with its investigation, raising concerns from infectious disease experts that the state was not taking every step it could to contain the spread of Zika in the continental United States.The state said it began investigating its first suspected case of locally transmitted Zika on July 7. According to CDC spokeswoman Kathy Harben, the CDC first became aware of the investigation on July 18, a day before the state announced its investigation into possible local transmission.Florida on Friday said the first four cases of Zika in the state likely were caused by mosquitoes, the first sign that the virus is circulating locally, although it has yet to identify mosquitoes carrying the disease.Scott said in a statement the 10 new cases of Zika also were likely caused by bites from local mosquitoes.The Florida Department of Health said six of the 10 new cases are asymptomatic and were identified through the door-to-door community survey and testing that it is conducting.The state health department has been testing individuals in three locations in Miami-Dade and Broward counties for possible local transmissions through mosquito bites. It said two locations have been ruled out for possible local transmission of Zika.Dr. William Schaffner, infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt Medical School in Nashville, said there is concern that people infected in Florida will travel to other areas of the country where Zika could then be spread through local mosquitoes there.Schaffner and Hotez said the government must come up with proper funding to fight Zika.“Local and state health department budgets are very tight,” Schaffner said.(Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen and Bill Berkrot; Editing by Bill Trott) "

Those were the first cases of local transmission of the virus in the continental United States, and health officials Monday said there were at least 10 more cases.President Barack Obama asked for $1.9 billion to fight Zika in February. Congress did not deliver, and failed to pass a $1.1 billion measure before going on recess last month after Republicans added riders about contraception, the Confederate flag, Obamacare and the Clean Water Act.The reason the administration has any money to target Zika is because it transferred $589 million from the effort to keep Ebola contained in the spring. Republicans took solace from recent news that only $204 million of that had been earmarked for urgent projects so far.But according to the White House Office of Management and Budget, the impression that there is plenty of cash on hand is misleading.In particular, two of the most important efforts by the National Institutes of Health and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, aimed at developing Zika vaccines actually will run out of cash soon.“NIH is on track to exhaust their redirected resources in August and without additional funding will no longer have any resources available to spend on critical vaccine development efforts,” an OMB spokesperson said in a statement. “That is why we wanted Congress to act before it left for vacation until September, so there would be no lost momentum in this critical work.”The statement noted that BARDA, which is key to the effort to develop faster and better diagnostic tools, and to developing new vaccines, runs out of money this month.“These are the tools we need to fight the Zika challenge, and we’ll be stymied when the funding runs out,” the OMB statement said.Some cash will remain available for other efforts by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Those agencies are expected to announce a slew of grants this month “to expand epidemiology and laboratory capacity and new resources to help states with birth registries for babies born with mothers that has Zika,” according to the statement.With Zika now spreading in the U.S. mainland, expenses are likely to escalate. Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) appealed to the CDC Monday to activate its rapid response team to help stem the virus. The CDC also warned that men and women who have visited the South Florida area should refrain from attempting to conceive children for at least eight weeks.With the emerging news, the administration again called for lawmakers to make more money available.“We are working hard on this response, and need Congress to act so we are able to do everything we can,” the OMB spokesperson said."

For his part, Diggs posted a powerful poem about the fear and confusion many young children feel in the wake of police shootings that appear on the evening news with devastating frequency. The poem, which was posted on the actor’s Instagram on Saturday, is told from the perspective of a young boy who finds his two parents reacting to a television clip of a police officer fatally shooting a black man.Addressing social issues from a child’s perspective isn’t new for Diggs. To date, the actor has published two children books, Chocolate Me which highlights the experiences of biracial children, and Mixed Me!, which was inspired by some of Diggs’ “tough” experiences growing up with his biracial cousin, according to a October 2015 with the “TODAY Show.”  “I wrote it from my childhood, because I didn’t have anything like this to refer to when I was a kid,” Diggs said during the interview of the development of Mixed Me. “Luckily, a lot of the kids today are in classes and schools that are a little bit more diverse. But that doesn’t mean that these still issues don’t need to be looked at and acknowledged,” he added."
20,POLITICS,The Criminal Justice System Was A Huge Focus At The DNC. But It Can't Stop There.,Laura Barrón-López,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/criminal-justice-after-democratic-national-convention_us_579c07e4e4b08a8e8b5e408c,"For all the bipartisan support, the nation’s highest level of government has yet to act.",2016-08-01,"Geneva Reed-Veal, the mother of 28-year-old Sandra Bland, speaks as she stands with the Mothers of the Movement at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 26.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579c09072a00002d004f75f1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PHILADELPHIA ― The criminal justice system and its problems received prominent attention this week during the Democratic National Convention.Hillary Clinton vowed to reform it “from end to end.” Mothers whose children have died in racially charged situations gave impassioned pleas for those in power to do something about gun violence and a law enforcement system exhibiting widespread civil rights violations. Their stories have been heard before. The deaths of their children rocked the country into consciousness over the past few years. But they were never given a platform like this: a primetime slot at one of the major political party conventions, broadcast on every major network for millions to see. Moments before those mothers took the stage, former Attorney General Eric Holder explained why he thought an overhaul of the criminal justice system was necessary. “When 1 in 3 black men will be incarcerated in their lifetimes, and when black defendants in the federal system receive sentences 20 percent longer than their white peers, we need a president who will end this policy of over-incarceration,” he said on Tuesday. Clinton, Holder and the mothers of Sandra Bland, Trayvon Martin, and Michael Brown ― to name a few ― weren’t the only ones talking about the issue. Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) mentioned it in their speeches. President Barack Obama advised voters to not look to the commander in chief alone to fix the nation’s legal system.The attention paid to the criminal justice system this week at the DNC undoubtedly sent a signal, but it will mean little if the next president and Congress fails to prioritize reform. That’s where activists and organizations focused on revamping the country’s incarceration institutions will need to fill in the gaps ― not letting up once politicians have moved on from the convention. Heightened racial tensions across the country in the last month may not seem directly connected to criminal justice reform legislation ― which would reduce mandatory minimum sentencing for nonviolent offenders, dedicate resources to reduce recidivism, and give judges greater discretion in sentencing for low-level drug offenses ― but they are. “Part of the economic malaise of the whole country is bolstered by racial tension, which is bolstered by injustice in the criminal justice system,” progressive Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) told The Huffington Post earlier this week. “I mean, part of the way you can convince masses of Americans that they should tolerate the mistreatment of a group is by convincing the masses of Americans that those people somehow deserve it because they are somehow criminally inclined.”Watching the Democratic convention alone, it would be easy to assume passing legislation addressing the overpopulation of America’s prisons would be a no-brainer for a Congress struggling to find bipartisan bills in a turbulent election year. It’s not. When the new session started in January, criminal justice reform was the first thing lawmakers mentioned when asked what, if anything, they could pass during Obama’s last year in office ― not to mention during a contentious election year that shortened their work calendar. Seven months later, legislation has yet to reach the floor in either chamber. Shortly after lawmakers left for their summer break, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said he would start bringing criminal justice reform bills to the floor in September. Ellison isn’t holding his breath, quipping that just because Ryan said that to the press doesn’t mean it will happen. “It’s going to take a movement to make sure he keeps that promise,” Ellison said. “The movement has to keep the heat on.”That’s just the House. A bipartisan coalition of senators revised sentencing reform legislation in April to attract more Republican cosponsors, hoping that would prove to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that now is the time to bring it to the floor. Instead, months went by, and senators like Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) have grown increasingly frustrated, blaming McConnell for listening to vocal Republicans who oppose criminal justice reform altogether. In addition to the DNC speeches, Democrats and Republicans included criminal justice reform in their respective party platforms, adopted days before their conventions. Democrats went further in calling for an end to mass incarceration and the abolishment of the death penalty. The Democrats’ platform changes were monumental, advocates said.Steve Hawkins, president of the Coalition for Public Safety, the nonprofit affiliate of U.S. Justice Action Network, said the platforms are a sign that what happened for decades in the system has been “morally unjustifiable” and “fiscally untenable,” as well as “an overreach of government” that led to the “ruining of people’s lives.” Pressed on why the two parties were beginning to push this now, as opposed to four years ago, Hawkins pointed to the growing movement in the states. In this past year, Hawkins said, 24 states passed some form of justice reform, including efforts to alleviate crimes previously defined as felonies for nonviolent drug offenses and reclassifying them as misdemeanors.Applying Pressure Advocates present in Philadelphia this week know that the only way Congress will move is by keeping the heat on. That’s what Jessica Jackson Sloan intended when working with organizations to make sure the voices of people impacted by mass incarceration were heard during the DNC. Jackson Sloan is the national director of #cut50, a nonprofit dedicated to bipartisan solutions to cutting jail and prison populations across the U.S. by 50 percent in the next 10 years. Across town from the Wells Fargo Center ― where Democrats nominated Clinton to sit atop their ticket ― #cut50 and Rock the Vote created a pop-up art exhibit meant to engage young voters and address political and social issues. A number of the art pieces touched on police brutality, gun violence and criminal justice reform. In the same building housing the exhibit, #cut50 and Rock the Vote hosted three days of discussions centered primarily around the criminal justice system. The entire project kicked off Rock the Vote’s Truth to Power campaign aimed at mobilizing millennials. Panel discussions ranged from “A world beyond prisons” and “The militarization of police” to “Will criminal justice reform ever happen?”Why choose to do this in Philly at the same time as the Democratic convention? It fell under one of Jackson Sloan’s short-term goals when launching #cut50 two years ago ― to get every presidential candidate talking about criminal justice reform. “There’s so much money spent on these conventions, and they’re a pipeline into every living room across the country,” Jackson Sloan told HuffPost. “So you get the folks up there talking about this in the right way and explaining the issue ... and they’re changing hearts and minds across the country.”Michael Skolnik, one of the producers of the Truth to Power exhibit, put it bluntly. “We have to be here,” he said, adding that it’s important for Clinton and Sanders to “hear us loud and clear.” Skolnik also sits on the board of the Trayvon Martin Foundation. He expressed frustration with elected officials, and when pressed on what’s different this time around that will make lawmakers listen, he admitted the movement made a mistake in years past. “We learned our lesson the hard way,” he said. “In 2008, we went back to our respective communities, we weren’t as engaged in the Obama administration as we should have been.” This time around that won’t happen, he said. He and others, whether it’s Black Lives Matter or organizations like Rock the Vote and #cut50, will keep at it. Skolnik has been fighting against mass incarceration and police brutality from a young age. He doesn’t expect the kind of change that’s needed to happen overnight, especially given the 40-odd years that law enforcement raged a war on drugs, locking people up rather than helping them with treatment. “So I hope that when it’s over is when my last breath is taken on this earth,” he said. Giving It A Human FaceIn the end, it isn’t just about keeping criminal justice reform in the spotlight for #cut50 and the larger movement, but humanizing the issue while “everybody’s watching,” Jackson Sloan said. To do that, Jackson Sloan gets personal. Roughly 12 years ago, her husband went to prison on drug charges. One year into his sentence they divorced, stretched too thin by a lack of income, a house entering foreclosure, communication prohibited by the prison (she couldn’t even send him a letter), and the cost of phone calls once allowed ($21 for 15 minutes). Later, her husband was moved to different housing where they made him work every day for a 52 cent-per-hour wage. “As somebody whose husband was incarcerated, I just saw how it ripped apart my family, how it left my child to grow up without a father the first few years of her life, and all because of a drug addiction,” she said. Currently, 2.3 million Americans are incarcerated in the nation’s prisons and jails, according to the latest data. And those who make it out are likely to go back ― 77 percent return ― due to poor re-entry or rehabilitation programs and a lack of educational opportunities for incarcerated students.Russell Craig is no stranger to the criminal justice system. He was imprisoned on drug charges three different times. Now he’s trying to find relief in his art. Craig’s work was on display at the Truth to Power exhibit here. Across four canvases, Craig plastered his sentencing and parole papers, documenting his 12 years in and out of county jails and prison. All of it intersected on an eye-catching portrait of himself. “It’s the alpha and omega of my prison experience,” he said. He used pastels because they don’t completely cover the rap sheets underneath, a nod to the fact that even though he’s moving forward, the system, and society’s view of those who have served time, hold him back.“The stigma of being a felon still lingers and I can’t get jobs,” he said. Craig said the state and federal government need to create a better support system for people who want to change. “I did my time, but even when I do it and I come out I’m still criminalized,” he said. “It kind of destroys you forever.”What’s Next? If Congress does manage to pass criminal justice reform in both chambers this year, the fight won’t stop there. The bills currently up for consideration aren’t comprehensive enough that they address every systemic problem within law enforcement and the nation’s prisons.Hawkins, the Coalition for Public Safety president, who dedicates much of his work to building up grass-roots support across the country and bringing in unlikely partners, wants to look at streamlining the process of moving people out of prison, and re-evaluating parole boards. “There is a backlog because the system we have has incarcerated so many people that we don’t have a full body of mechanisms to release people,” he said, noting that parole boards are not fully staffed and equipped. Jackson Sloan is looking into something similar. She’d like Obama to sign an executive order granting mass clemency for inmates that meet the four criteria the administration has set: 1. In on a first-time drug offense. 2. Served 10 years already. 3. No violent crimes, including actions in prison. 4. Would not have received sentence under today’s rules.“I think if you’d sign an order like that there’s roughly 10,000 people it would affect,” Jackson Sloan estimated. With the convention done, #cut50 will also be pivoting toward the states, focusing on pretrial detention. There are 450,000 people in U.S. jails right now who haven’t been convicted. And #cut50 has a re-entry summit coming up in California to talk to 100 corporations about hiring second-chance workers, or people with felonies.As for how long it will take to reform a system barely turning away from its austere practices, Jackson Sloan isn’t sure, but says it comes down to “the public. You’ve got to move the public.”"

And #cut50 has a re-entry summit coming up in California to talk to 100 corporations about hiring second-chance workers, or people with felonies.As for how long it will take to reform a system barely turning away from its austere practices, Jackson Sloan isn’t sure, but says it comes down to “the public. You’ve got to move the public.”"

24,HEALTHY LIVING,This Mom Is Fighting To Criminalize Drowsy Driving In Her State,Krithika Varagur,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sheila-faulkner-drowsy-driving-activism_us_57991f8fe4b0d3568f85cdb9,She wants to make other parents don't suffer a loss like hers.,2016-08-01,Sheila Faulkner's son died in a car crash off Highway 84 in Alabama in November 2006.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579921232400002600b33811.jpeg?cache=It5aOk0b1U&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ten years ago, Sheila Faulkner got a call that changed her life: Her 28-year-old son was dead. He had been getting a ride home from a local club when the car he was in veered off the highway. The driver emerged with a few scrapes.The shocking part, to Faulkner, was that the driver was clearly in no shape to ferry anyone: He had been awake for at least 22 hours and fell asleep at the wheel.“The driver never paid one dime. He never spent a day in jail,” Faulkner told The Huffington Post. “There was no justice.”Faulkner has become one of Alabama's leading advocates for drowsy driving laws. She has spent the last three years working to get a bill passed that would penalize drowsy driving as an offense. Only New Jersey and Arkansas currently have such laws.“I wish we had something like Maggie’s Law in Alabama,” said Faulkner, referring to the New Jersey statute that criminalized drowsy driving in 2003. She has been working closely with Alabama state Sen. Jimmy Holley to drum up support for the measure. It did not pass in the most recent legislative session, but she is hopeful that it will do so next year. One intermediate victory that she and Holley have achieved is the recognition of Alabama’s first-ever Drowsy Driving Awareness Day on Nov. 19 ― what would have been her son’s 39th birthday.Although her son died about a decade ago, the wound of his passing remains fresh for Faulkner. “He left behind three little girls who were 3, 5 and 7 years old at the time,” she said, tearfully. “And they used to ask ― they still ask ― who’s going to give them away at their wedding?”Faulkner has fibromyalgia, and her activism has been draining. For three years, she regularly drove two hours from her hometown, Andalusia, to the state capital, Montgomery, to protest on the capitol steps. Right after her son died, she and her husband washed cars for $5 apiece to raise money for his headstone.But she plans to keep fighting until drowsy driving is illegal in her state.“If I save one life, it would be worth it,” she said. “No parent should have to go through this.”"

The Republican nominee later suggested that she did not speak because she was forbidden to do so.“Maybe she wasn’t allowed to have anything to say — you tell me,” Trump said on ABC News.Khan quickly denied that she was kept quiet by her husband or her religion, writing in The Washington Post that she did not speak at the convention because she remains emotionally devastated by the loss of her son. “With a huge picture of my son behind me, I could hardly control myself,” she wrote, describing the convention stage. “What mother could?” (She also spoke out on MSNBC.)Female activists within the American Muslim community — supported by organizations like the Muslim Public Affairs Council — soon rallied behind Khan, launching a social media campaign under the hashtag #CanYouHearUsNow. They called on other Muslim American women to help dispel Trump-like misconceptions about their religion.The response was immediate. Muslim women came forward with their own stories ― of being veterans, teachers, students and marathoners. They shared photos of female Muslim athletes. They tweeted pictures of themselves speaking at public events.“Any place in society where people are contributing there would be Muslim women present,” Roula Allouch, chair of the Council on American-Islamic Relations’ national board, told The Huffington Post. “Muslim women’s voices are expressed in their actions — and spoken as well,” she added.

And at the Democratic National Convention last week, marijuana activists celebrated with a colorful display of strength.Cannabis consumers and reform advocates marked the start of the convention on July 25 with a protest march down Philadelphia’s Broad Street toward the Wells Fargo Center where the convention was taking place. Led by the Washington-based organization DCMJ, Philadelphia’s chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, and local groups like the Panic Hour, they carried a 51-foot inflatable joint with the words “De-schedule cannabis now” ― a call to remove the drug from the Controlled Substances Act, the federal law criminalizing it.Perhaps more remarkably, the Philadelphia police tweeted a picture of it approvingly.The gigantic joint also made an appearance at a similar Cannabis Pride Parade to cap off the convention on July 28.As the Philadelphia police’s tweet suggests, the city of brotherly love was a fitting place for marijuana smokers to wave their flag ― or joint, as the case may be. The city decriminalized possession of small amounts of marijuana in October 2014, effectively allowing ordinary consumption to go unabated.At a “DNC Marijuana Welcome Party” organized by the Panic Hour on the night of July 25 at Connie’s Ric Rac, a dive bar in the Italian market, several dozen attendees appeared to be taking full advantage of the city’s newly lax enforcement in the bar’s outdoor ticket booth area and on the sidewalk in front of it. It had the smell and look of a 4/20 celebration in Boulder, Colorado, complete with oversize joints and heavy-duty bongs.These were not the buttoned-up lobbyists of the Marijuana Policy Project or your local ACLU. They were unabashed tribunes of marijuana culture ― and they were not afraid that the eclectic crew would undermine their cause, which many on hand could debate with an articulate command of the most arcane policy details.Inside, there was a slightly tamer vibe, with a handful of convention delegates sipping beers. “Philly NORML” T-shirts were on sale at a table near the bar’s entrance. N.A. Poe, a comedian and local marijuana celebrity who runs the Panic Hour, and Chris Goldstein, the communications director for Philly NORML and a columnist for Philly.com, made some introductory remarks on a stage decked out with pro-marijuana signs, including one that said “Legalize gay marijuana.”Then Emily Yates took the stage, the first in a series of musical and comedy acts that night. The California-based progressive activist was in town to show support for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).She performed a Star Wars-themed antiwar banjo ballad with the refrain, “I wish I knew more about Star Wars than real wars.”While the July 25 party was nominally tied to the DNC, it is one of many celebratory “Philly smoke sessions” organized by Poe and other mainstays of Philadelphia’s marijuana subculture. Those in the know often receive last-minute notifications on social media of the get-togethers’ whereabouts. Still, there were more than a few signs that the July 25 party was different. Poe and Goldstein looked like the proud parents of a child that had finally grown up.The two men were leaders of a small group of marijuana legalization activists who were arrested three years ago in a marijuana smoking protest at Philadelphia’s Independence Mall.Since the mall is federal park land, they faced federal charges. For Goldstein, getting caught with a half of a joint meant several days in jail, a fine of $3,000 and two years of federal probation, which required him to get permission to cross state lines.Goldstein also could not smoke marijuana for two years, depriving him of a key relaxation valve. He picked up drinking after years of abstaining and increased his cigarette consumption.“I was told by many lawyers that I had much more intense scrutiny than offenders that they had on armed robbery offenses on probation,” Goldstein recalled.Goldstein, who is also an editor at the marijuana culture-themed Freedom Leaf magazine, views his advocacy as an extension of his Quaker faith, with its emphasis on social justice. He has helped collect data for the national ACLU on racial disparities in marijuana arrests in Philadelphia.Goldstein and Poe were delighted that the Democratic Party platform calls for marijuana to be removed from the category of “Schedule I” drugs ― a classification reserved for the most harmful illegal substances like heroin, which have no potential medical uses. Such a move would have the stated goal of “providing a reasoned pathway for future legalization,” according to the party platform, with states leading the way with their own decriminalization experiments. “The fact that it is on the platform is such progress,” Poe said.But they will not stop until marijuana is legalized nationwide.“We have been modeling this movement after the LGBT movement for so long,” Poe said. “This is a civil rights movement.”“We want our equal rights and our justice as cannabis consumers,” he added. “And we don’t want people in jail for a plant, because let’s face it, that’s absurd.”Goldstein hopes the platform language will embolden congressional Democrats, who are already hard at work on legislation that would remove marijuana from the federal Controlled Substances Act. Back in November, Sanders introduced a bill that would decriminalize pot at the federal level, allowing states to decide how to treat the drug. Reps. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) and Jared Polis (D-Colo.) introduced similar legislation in the House of Representatives in February 2013.The Democratic Party platform “gives them a good mandate to move forward,” Goldstein said.Goldstein worries, however, that the lack of a bipartisan consensus for decriminalizing marijuana endangers its chances of success.“I’m grateful that the Democrats are doing it,” he said. “I wish the Republicans would too, because there are plenty of marijuana-smoking conservatives in America that want to pay less money for their weed.”In the meantime, Poe hopes that parties and other events will help ease the stigma associated with smoking and consuming the plant. Poe believes advertising cannabis’ success as a remedy for childhood epilepsy and as an aid for veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder is already combatting some of the plant’s negative associations. Another way they fight stereotypes is by collecting charity donations at marijuana-related events and showing themselves to be upstanding members of the community. We’re “trying to get people to come out of the cannabis closet ― come and hang out and say, ‘Hey, I smoke weed and I’m a good person,’” Poe said. “It doesn’t necessarily mean you’re an idiot because you smoke marijuana anymore. A lot of people do.”"

29,BUSINESS,This Is Clearly The Best Perk Of All Time,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paid-vacation-bamboohr_us_579f5d51e4b08a8e8b5e9395,Forget all those other job benefits: this is the one you want.,2016-08-01,Ian Nate and his family have used the perk to fund two trips to Disneyland.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579f85dd2a0000fa01fb3f16.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"At his last job, Ian Nate worked for a company that offered unlimited vacation time. That didn’t mean he actually took a lot of vacation. Now Nate works for a small HR company that offers three weeks vacation time to new employees, but with a twist: BambooHR, an eight-year-old startup, gives full-time employees $2,000 a year to take a real vacation. The Linden, Utah-based company covers their expenses ― airfare, hotel, etc. The idea is to truly compel people to take real time away from work. For the past two years, Nate has taken his wife and four kids, ages 2 - 10, to Disneyland. “My family knows we’re guaranteed at least a week’s vacation every year and it’s going to be awesome,” Nate told The Huffington Post, explaining that it would be tough to compel him to ever leave his job as a business operations specialist. “They’ve got their hooks in me.”Bamboo is one of a few companies offering what I’ve informally decided is the best job perk ever: Paid, paid vacation. Of course, there are other benefits that are more necessary like paid sick time, ordinary paid vacation days, health insurance, paid parental leave etc. And yes, the most important way an employer can compensate you is with a good salary. But really, is there a better way to truly communicate to your employers that you want them to be fully realized human beings? Free snacks and lunch ― standard perks in Silicon Valley at this point ― say, “stay at the office forever.” Paid, paid vacation says, “we want you to have a life.”Go tell your boss about this right now.Airbnb, Evernote, Afar Media, G Adventures and Think Parallax also offer pay for employees’ vacations, according to a Bloomberg Business report written by Rebecca Greenfield last year. At Basecamp, a software company, employees can choose from a curated list of expense-paid vacations ― and the company arranges your travel.The rationale behind the perk is to attract and retain workers and to truly encourage them to take a break. “We want you to get away,” Basecamp CEO Jason Fried told HuffPost earlier this year.BambooHR also wants to emphasize its commitment to work-life balance. There’s also an “anti-workaholic” policy that limits employees to no more than 40 hours a week. The belief is that happier employees who get breaks are actually better workers.“Studies show that longer vacations help you recharge better. We feel the impact when employees get back,” Bamboo cofounder Ryan Sanders told HuffPost.The appeal here is pretty obvious. Americans, even the lucky ones who get paid time off, don’t take enough vacation. Even if you do take time off, you might just wind up at home or perhaps visiting family. Once you’ve got kids, a mortgage and a million bills, forgoing a “real” vacation is unfortunately all too easy. Why shell out hundreds of dollars to take everyone to a far off beach or thousands for a Disney trip, when you’ve got to replace your oil heater or fund another school trip or pay an unexpected hospital bill? Even if you do go away, you might not truly get away. Nate said that before he got to Bamboo, he’d spend a lot of time on his phone with work during vacations.Since implementing the policy two years ago, Sanders said he’s noticed workers take longer vacations. And just about everyone takes advantage of the policy. Bamboo’s not just footing the bill for family vacations. Sanders said one developer who never took a honeymoon with his wife, was able to finally do it and took off for Kauai. One guy has taken his sibling to New York City. Another employee went on a service trip to Africa.Other firms who offer paid, paid vacation might have more specific motives. Afar wants employees to write about their trips for the magazine, according to Bloomberg. The company offers a $2,000 stipend. Bamboo does ask that employees share at least one photo with colleagues via internal social media network Yammer. Sanders said he’s heard no complaints about Bamboo’s program; and that no one has ever asked for cash instead of going away.This is about “spending time with loved ones in places they’d never go.”Sounds good to me."

On a given night, 14,222 single adults ― meaning they are not part of a family ― seek out homeless shelters in NYC, Giselle Routhier, policy director for the Coalition for the Homeless, told The Huffington Post via email. That’s a 95 percent increase from a decade ago. At the end of 2006, there were 7,282 homeless adults in New York City. To effectively tackle homelessness, the Coalition for the Homeless called for a number of measures in its annual report. It pushed for an improvement in prevention efforts, an increase in subsidized and supportive housing and also urged the city and state to more effectively collaborate.“The most important thing is that our elected officials embrace housing-based solutions to homelessness: funding and allocating truly affordable housing and supportive housing for the lowest income and homeless New Yorkers,” Routhier said.Steven Banks, commissioner for the Department of Social Services, agreed that homelessness has “steadily” increased over the past 30 years, but said that the city has taken notable steps to tackle the issue.After conducting a 90-day review of homeless services earlier this year, the city is moving forward with recommendations to increase prevention, better connect individuals with services, and improve policies and support for homeless families.Banks told HuffPost he’s eager to work together with the state.“We can achieve so much more for homeless New Yorkers together,” Banks said.While the Coalition for the Homeless’ report sounded the alarm on the problem, it also pointed to one area where New York City has seen some improvement.The number of family members in homeless shelters dropped by 5 percent over the last year.That was mostly due to the fact that there was an increase in permanent housing placements for homeless families and the city has made significant investments in homelessness prevention for that demographic.There was a slight drop in overall homeless figures, but the Coalition for the Homeless said it will take far more aggressive measures to see those numbers decline significantly.De Blasio’s administration came under fire when the number of people spending the night in shelters hit an unprecedented 60,939 in 2014. That figure has dropped to 60,067 individuals, which includes single adults, adults who are part of families and children. The report singled out New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) for his elusive commitment to providing housing to homeless people.During his State of the State address, Cuomo pledged to fund 20,000 units of supportive housing, but there is no definite timeline for implementing the goal, the Coalition said. There are also no details on the revenue plan to support the first 6,000 of those units in this year’s budget, according to the report.The organization’s analysis of the governor’s budget states that it will take at least three years before a single unit of additional state-funded supportive housing to open.But Cuomo’s office said the program is moving along.Of the $20 billion Cuomo pledged in January to address homelessness and a lack of affordable housing, $150 million has been “released,” Richard Azzopardi, senior deputy communications director for Cuomo, told HuffPost. The administration is eager to strike an agreement on the balance, he added. “We urge the legislature to join us in keeping these projects moving and helping to ensure every New Yorker has a safe, decent and affordable place to call home,” Azzopardi said. While the Coalition would also like to see the city and state acting in concert, de Blasio has struck out on his own in order to take swifter action.In November, the mayor announced an investment of $2.6 billion in housing for homeless people and said he wouldn’t wait for New York state’s help in addressing the crisis, The Associated Press reported.Over the next 15 years, the city will fund 15,000 supportive housing units, which will come with on-site social services, for domestic abuse victims, veterans, drug addicts and people living on the street.“We are acting decisively. We are not waiting on Albany,” de Blasio said, according to the AP. “It was time for New York City to act. It was a simple as that.”"

You are not just attacking us, you are cheapening the sacrifice made by those we lost.”The families called on Trump, who continued speaking out against the Khans through the weekend and into Monday morning, to formally apologize for his remarks.The vets rights group Veterans of Foreign Wars issued an even harsher rebuke Monday.“Trump has a history of lashing out after being attacked, but to ridicule a Gold Star Mother is out-of-bounds,” the group said. “There are certain sacrosanct subjects that no amount of wordsmithing can repair once crossed.”Ghazala Khan also responded to Trump’s comments in a Washington Post op-ed published Sunday.“Donald Trump said I had nothing to say. I do. My son Humayun Khan, an Army captain, died 12 years ago in Iraq,” she wrote. “Every day I feel the pain of his loss. It has been 12 years, but you know hearts of pain can never heal as long as we live. Just talking about it is hard for me all the time ... my husband asked me if I wanted to speak [at the convention] but I told him I could not.”This post has been updated to include the response from Veterans of Foreign Wars.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

He told supporters on Monday that he fears the election could be rigged, an indication that even if Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton wins, Trump might not accept it. He made the comments while talking about Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who lost the Democratic nomination to Clinton and whose supporters Trump has openly courted.“First of all, it was rigged,” Trump said of the Democratic primary during a rally in Columbus, Ohio. “And I’m afraid the election is going to be rigged, I have to be honest.”WikiLeaks recently released internal emails from the Democratic National Committee that suggested its staff favored Clinton. Government officials say Russian hackers were behind the breach. After sowing seeds of mistrust in the election results, Trump quickly turned to praising himself for his “guts” to enter the GOP field and the number of votes he received in the primary, against what some called the greatest field of candidates in history.The rally came as Trump, as usual, faces multiple other controversies. He avoided taking more jabs at a Muslim mother and father whose son died in combat, but did weigh in on criticism of his recent comments on Russia’s annexation of Crimea and his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump insisted that his comments on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday had been misinterpreted and that he was unaware that Russia in 2014 marched into the Crimean peninsula of Ukraine. The Russian claim to Crimea is not recognized by international bodies. Trump insisted he “gave a good answer” on Russia and that he did know about the annexation, but that it happened under President Barack Obama’s watch. He added that it “would be really nice if we got along with Russia and others that we don’t get along with right now,” and teamed up to combat the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. “Putin said some very good things about me,” Trump said. “People say, ‘Oh, Trump’s going to be weak with Putin,’ because Putin is saying nice things about me. OK, all right. And I said he’s a strong guy, they immediately say, ‘Trump likes Putin.’ Look, I don’t like or dislike.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

Chuck Schumer (D-NY) criticized the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Sunday for failing to promptly address food recalls.“Delays in getting bad food off store shelves is just a recipe for disaster,” Schumer said in a statement. “That’s why the FDA must come to the table with a healthy, new plan, detailing how they will revamp and execute a reformed food recall process.”A June report by the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services found the FDA did not have sufficient policies in place to speed up voluntary recalls from food companies. The report noted that in all 30 voluntary recalls it examined, the FDA did not mandate a timeline for the company in question to issue a recall. In two such cases, the companies didn’t recall potentially contaminated products for 165 and 81 days after the FDA knew about the problem.Schumer called for a “top-to-bottom review” of the agency’s process for contaminated food recalls, though he did not detail specific actions he hoped the FDA would take to speed up recall safety.The FDA declined to comment in response to Schumer’s criticism. An agency statement released in June in response to the Inspector General’s report admitted that the process is too slow. “These delays are unacceptable,” the statement read. “’While some food recalls are more complicated than others due to the nature of the product(s), contamination, and investigation, the recall process should be as swift as possible.”According to the statement, the FDA is taking steps to improve recall-related food safety by starting a rapid response team and speeding up the recall process with “new technologies.”Just last week, General Mills expanded a multi-state flour recall linked to E. coli-contaminated products that have sickened 46 people so far. Although the outbreak began in December 2015, it wasn’t addressed with a recall until the following May."

Humayun Khan, the son of Muslim immigrants, died fighting in the U.S. military to keep the country safe.In a recent segment on CNN, Muslim American journalist and lawyer Wajahat Ali debated with Muslims for Trump founder Sajid Tarar over the GOP presidential candidate’s contradictory visions of American patriotism. On the table for discussion were Trump’s recent Islamophobic comments following a powerful speech delivered by Humayun’s father, Khizr Khan, at the Democratic National Convention. Humayun was 27 years old when he was killed by a vehicle packed with explosives that drove into his compound in Iraq. Rather than praising the Khan family for their sacrifice, Trump used the opportunity to question why Khan’s wife, Ghazala, remained silent.“If you look at his wife, she was standing there. She had nothing to say,” Trump said in an interview with ABC. “She probably, maybe she wasn’t allowed to have anything to say.”Tarar tried to justify Trump’s comments, saying that in “most” Islamic countries women aren’t allowed to speak ― a statement that host Poppy Harlow noted is unequivocally false.Unlike Tarar, several top Republican leaders were quick to distance themselves from Trump’s comments, reminding others that they believe service to one’s country is an act of patriotism that shouldn’t be sullied by efforts to incite anti-Islamic sentiment.“This is going to a place where we’ve never gone before, to push back against the families of the fallen,” Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told The New York Times.Graham suggested that the Republican nominee’s comments attack the very patriotism that has thus far carried his campaign. “There’ll come a time when the love of country will trump hatred of Hillary,” he said.Ali noted the irony of the media storm: the fact that a Muslim American couple is now at the center of a national discussion on patriotism and American values. Prompted by Harlow to offer his reaction to Trump’s comments, Ali said: I love the fact, Poppy, let me say this, that there’s a supreme brown karmic justice: that a Muslim Pakistani immigrant American couple with funny accents and multi-syllable names, with mocha caramel skin right now are body slamming Donald J. Trump left and right, and they are the couple reminding all Americans ― Republicans and Democrats ― about our Constitution, about our freedoms, about our values, about our core values that are under threat if a demagogue like Donald J.

It could not be reached for further comment.The names of the passengers killed have not been officially released but social media posts and local media reports indicate the victims included a couple celebrating their 23rd wedding anniversary with a balloon ride at sunrise.Aerial television footage showed flattened remnants of the red, white and blue balloon, adorned with a yellow smiley face wearing sunglasses.The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board two years ago recommended greater oversight of the hot air balloon industry, said Robert Sumwalt, who is heading the federal agency’s investigation of the accident.It was the deadliest crash involving a hot air balloon in the Western Hemisphere, according to the Balloon Federation of North America.(Additional reporting by Joseph Ax in New York; Editing by Will Dunham and Sandra Maler)"

She patrols the same Austin beat as did her father, who died in 2012.Survivors found each other in an informal 2014 remembrance and through the making of a documentary called “Tower” on the shooting that came out this year, with many saying in the movie they still feel emotional scars from that day. They formed a group and pressed the school to mark the event ranked by news services AP and UPI as the number 2 news event in 1966 behind the Vietnam War.Gregory Fenves, who became president last year after joining the university’s administration in 2008, said the school has tried to keep the anniversary ceremony separate from the start of campus carry. He has spoken to shooting survivors about the memorial.“A lot has changed as a society and for institutions since then. We understand the healing process, and closure,” he said in an interview.“One of the lessons is that we do need to deal with the trauma and we need to support the survivors and recognize those who were killed,” he said.[Related: Texas Professors Warn Allowing Guns In Class Will Inhibit Free Speech]Texas follows eight other states that allow people to carry concealed weapons on public post-secondary campuses, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.Diana Mendoza, who graduated from the university in 2015 and now works at the school, visited the stone memorial on Thursday ahead of its dedication and said it was about time to have an official ceremony.She is also staunchly opposed to the new campus carry law, which she said is more likely to bring violence back to the school than prevent it.“Ah Texans and their guns.

Her son Marquees (not pictured) was shot and killed three blocks from the house shortly after the family moved out.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579bdb861200008104a54456.jpeg?cache=acE3yv1cXS&ops=crop_0_0_3600_3580%2Cscalefit_1280_noupscale,"As Oakland, California, undergoes massive changes, an art museum is calling on residents to speak out about being pushed from the city they call home.“Oakland, I want you to know…” opened at the Oakland Museum of California last month and celebrates the history and culture of West Oakland, a neighborhood where rents are rising, tech workers are moving in, and longtime residents, particularly African-Americans, are being displaced. The interactive installation ― a replica of West Oakland’s streets, shrunk to fit in a room ― is as much about community organizing as it is about art. Chris Treggiari, a local social practice artist who curated the show with Evelyn Orantes, OMCA’s curator of public practice, said he wanted to “create a platform that can house what the community is saying, what the community is thinking.”“Gentrification is happening; there’s a shift in demographics; there’s displacement,” he said. “These are words that we’re hearing from the community.”Orantes and Treggiari hope to encourage visitors to tell their own stories about living in West Oakland. The exhibition draws from interviews with residents and contributions from over 700 artists, students, residents and community groups.The miniature city includes structures and spaces inspired by recognizable Oakland sites: a classic Victorian mansion, a historic blues club, the BART subway, a new loft, city streets and a community garden planted with felt vegetables.Each space is centered around an aspect of the neighborhood’s identity, like its deep-rooted arts community. Treggiari hopes the semi-private spaces will allow candid and respectful conversation between friends and strangers.To give visitors a nudge, there’s a question posted at each site. For instance, signage at the loft space, which examines race and housing, asks, “What can we build together to help the future of Oakland?” That’s an optimistic way to tackle the issue when some residents aren’t sure if they’ll have a future in the city at all. Oakland’s rents are now among the most expensive in the country, thanks to the Bay Area’s housing crunch and its growing population of tech workers. With San Francisco rents already astronomically high, Oakland’s comparatively “affordable” housing ― at least on a tech company salary ― has been steadily drawing professionals to the other side of the bay.A number of companies are following suit: Uber will open offices in the city next year.As tech workers stream into the city ― sometimes clashing with longtime residents ― Orantes and Treggiari would like newcomers to come away from their show with an appreciation for West Oakland’s strong community and identity. “I want them to understand and realize that we can’t lose this culture,” Treggiari said. “I hope the show brings that to the surface and makes people aware and starts conversations, starts people thinking, ‘Yeah, we need to preserve this and celebrate it.’”“Oakland is an amazing place to live, and I think all of us look to San Francisco and see what we’ve got to lose if we don’t do something,” Orantes said.OMCA’s exhibition space isn’t large, but it’s loaded with contributions from artists who have ties to West Oakland and are involved in the community.One section includes a series of portraits shot by photographer Julie Placensia of her neighbors on Chester Street in the early 2000s. There’s a collection of prints from housing rights movements dating back to the ‘70s, photos of the African-American community in the city and new music from a local artist. Youth groups created a mural and a billboard. Quotations from residents are plastered on the walls, and their stories are told in video and audio interviews. One of the placards quotes Ericka Huggins, former member of the Black Panther Party:“When I first came to Oakland, West Oakland was the place to be for culture, for the blues, for food, for living, and it was a huge black community, but that’s not what we see now,… You get culture, but if you are afraid of it, you can’t see it as that. You see it as other.”The exhibition also provides a place for visitors to make posters and a station where they can write letters to their council members, which the curators will hand-deliver at the end of the exhibition in October.  Orantes hopes the show will leave residents aware of their own power to advocate for themselves and their community.“Someone said this is as much for the people moving in as the people who are here,” she said. “It’s a reminder that we’re not alone.”View more of Julie Placensia’s portraits of her former neighbors below._____Kate Abbey-Lambertz covers sustainable cities, housing and inequality.
