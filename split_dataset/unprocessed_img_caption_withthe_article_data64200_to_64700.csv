0,POLITICS,A Defiant Iran Defies the UN and International Laws Again,"Dr. Majid Rafizadeh, ContributorPresident of the International American Council",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-defiant-iran-defies-the_b_9283644.html,"Currently, the major questions to address are: What aspect of its military is Iran attempting to strengthen? Why does the UN continue to ignore the Islamic Republic when it is clearly violating its resolutions? And, why does Iran so publicly announce such actions which are  violations of  the UNSC resolutions?",2016-02-21,2015-07-02-1435808454-9985178-ScreenShot20150701at8.40.02PM.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-07-02-1435808454-9985178-ScreenShot20150701at8.40.02PM-thumb.png,"The world powers' view of Iran has significantly shifted. Those days in which Iran was being punished for violating the law seem to have gone. For many, it is baffling that Iran is now capable of getting away with breaking international laws, particularly in the last few months after the nuclear deal was reached between the six world powers (known as P5+1; China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, plus Germany) and the Islamic Republic. Lets take a look at some of the latest violations which are linked to Iran's military institutions. In clear violation of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolution, Iranian leaders test-fired, long-range ballistic missiles and laser-guided surface-to-surface missiles several times. Additionally, in October and November, Iran tested a new ballistic missile capable of carrying multiple warheads. This week, as the Iranian and Russian media outlets boasted, the Iranian Defense Minister Hossein Dehghan, who was reportedly the architect of the 1983 terror bombing that killed 241 Americans in Beirut, Lebanon  held talks with his Russian counterpart Sergei Shoigu as well as President Vladimir Putin regarding delivery of The S-400 air defense system, a more advanced form of the S-300, and the purchase of Russia's most sophisticated and powerful offensive weapons, such as tanks and jet fighters. This development came just after Iran has received billions of dollars worth of sanctions relief. Several UN and Nuclear Laws Are ViolatedIt worth noting that this contract and Iran's similar activities are in violation of several critical U.N. Resolutions. First is U.N. Resolution no. 2231, that clearly bans the Islamic Republic from purchasing ""battle tanks, armored combat vehicles, large-caliber artillery systems, combat aircraft, attack helicopters, warships..."" without prior approval from the U.N. The second is the United Nations Security Council resolution 1929 that states ""Iran shall not undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using ballistic missile technology, and that States shall take all necessary measures to prevent the transfer of technology or technical assistance to Iran related to such activities"". The third one is the JCPOA (UNSCR 2231 Annex II, paragraph three) that points out that Iran should not undertake any ballistic missile activity ""until the date eight years after the JCPOA Adoption Day or until the date on which the IAEA submits a report confirming the Broader Conclusion, whichever is earlier."" Offensive Strength, Iran's Air ForceCurrently, the major questions to address are: What aspect of its military is Iran attempting to strengthen? Why does the UN continue to ignore the Islamic Republic when it is clearly violating its resolutions? And, why does Iran so publicly announce such actions which are violations of the UNSC resolutions? If we closely analyze the 8 billion dollar contract between Iran and Russia, Iranian leaders are mainly concentrating on buying offensive weapons such as Su-30 fighter jets. In fact, this is the first time that Iran is publicly announcing that it is upgrading its offensive weaponries. Even the S-400, despite being characterized as defensive in nature, can be utilized by Iranians to defend their nuclear sites. Most specifically, Iran is advancing its air force. Tehran has an adequate number of ground forces to operate in foreign countries, support or train Shiite proxies(including in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, and Bahrain), but Iran desires to deploy its air force and make it superior to that of Turkey or other Arab nations in the region. With a robust military on the ground and powerful air force supporting the forces, for example in Syria and Iraq, Tehran will be in much better position to direct the conflicts in its own geopolitical and ideological interests, as well as, reduce the number of its casualties. Green Light from the UNSC Members to IranOn the other hand, Iranian leaders would not have announced such a provocative deal without receiving an implicit green light from the White House and other powers in the UNSC, or without being cognizant that world powers will not react to Iran. Not having a clear agenda on how to deal with the crisis in Syria and rise of the Islamic State, the US and other Western powers have given the driver's seat to the Islamic Republic. Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, on the other hand, is exploiting this situation, to make its organization a regional military empire. By having the most powerful military in the region, IRGC and Iranian leaders not only can frighten domestic oppositions, but can also attract the world powers respect, and send a message to other countries in the region, that Iran is back, that Iran has the power to purchase any offensive weaponry it wants, that the West is on the side of Iran, that even the UN will not object Iran's actions; and that no regional countries should dare to challenge Iran. Finally, with regard to the UN, the UN is primarily the five members of Security Council. Russia and China are on the side of Iran and the European states follow the US footsteps and their own economic interests. The US, President Obama to be more specific, currently does not want to scuttle his crowning foreign policy ""accomplishment""- the nuclear deal. As a result, every member of the UNSC is backing Iran. There are no reasons for the UN (the five members) to politically or economically punish Iran for violating international laws and terms of the nuclear deal (JCPOA) . Iran will be best contained if regional powers unite and take actions for Iran's violations of international laws. Iran projects the capabilities of its military power to be more than what it really is. Iran is actually more vulnerable than it projects to regional powers. However, if a strong message not sent to Iran soon, it will be too late to contain the IRGC's military stranglehold and empire, Tehran's regional hegemonic ambitions, as well as Iran's relentless pursuit to be treated as the superior power in the region.  --Dr. Majid Rafizadeh is an American political scientist, business advisor and the president of the International American Council on the Middle East.

Both officers were hospitalized but alert and in stable condition. Their names were not immediately released.The injured officers were the third and fourth New York policemen shot and wounded while on duty during the past month. The latest shooting follows a string of encounters that left four other NYPD officers dead since December 2014.The incident started early on Saturday morning when two housing police officers heard a shot fired near a Brooklyn intersection. As the officers approached, the suspect, who authorities believe to be from New Jersey, pointed a revolver at them and drove off, police said.The officers called for help and began to follow the vehicle, while officers from three commands came to their assistance. Funes, driving down the street in the wrong direction, rammed a responding patrol car, and gunfire was exchanged, police said.One of two responding officers, dressed in plainclothes, suffered blunt-force trauma after a bullet hit the front of his protective vest without penetrating. The second officer, also in plainclothes, was struck in the right hip, below his vest, police said.The first officer is the son of a retired policeman whose life may also have been saved by a protective vest when a bullet struck it several years ago, Police Commissioner William Bratton said during a news conference.(Reporting by Frank McGurty in New York, Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee and Mary Wisniewski in Chicago; editing by Andrew Roche)"

Its main argument, as Senate leaders Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley outlined in a joint op-ed in The Washington Post, is that the president shouldn't ""rob"" voters of a nominee of their choice.Quite likely, Scalia himself wouldn't have any of this. Not only because it doesn't seem to square with his originalist view of the Constitution -- nowhere in the text of the Appointments Clause is there anything about voters being a part of the process.But also because the political gamesmanship twists the appointment process to the detriment of the Supreme Court itself. As The Huffington Post's Jen Bendery wrote this week, the entire federal judiciary is now hamstrung because of the obstructionism of Senate leadership.That's the real damage here. The constitutional posturing by McConnell and Grassley -- and, to an extent, the president himself -- takes a backseat to the prospect of real-life paralysis that the Supreme Court now faces.Scalia appreciated the judicial branch's insulation from the political ones -- which may explain his 20-year absence from the State of the Union address, which he once called ""a childish spectacle.""A few years ago, Scalia said as much when he explained how he viewed his role vis-a-vis that of Washington lawmakers.""I have a deal with the Congress. I leave them alone. They leave me alone,"" he said at a Tufts University appearance in 2013.The issue there was the looming government shutdown. But Scalia's comment underscored how he valued judicial independence and the separation of powers -- constitutional principles that, for the most part, have allowed the Supreme Court to continue hearing cases and churning out decisions for years. It's far more productive and functional than Congress has been in a very long time.But with only eight justices, that productivity is now in jeopardy. An understaffed Supreme Court means the future of constitutional law is at a standstill, and some of the nation's most contested, unresolved legal matters -- including the fate of affirmative action, abortion and immigration -- are in limbo.""The Court proceeds with eight Justices,"" Scalia once wrote, ""raising the possibility that, by reason of a tie vote, it will find itself unable to resolve the significant legal issue presented by the case.""Scalia was addressing the problem of Supreme Court recusals, but the principle underlying his words is the same: The court cannot operate with eight justices. And the state of the law for the entire country -- for judicial precedent, for finality, for guidance that other courts must follow -- suffers as a result.So the flowers were a nice gesture of the Senate. But honoring Scalia's legacy will take far more than that. The stability of the Supreme Court and the rule of law depend on it.Also on HuffPost:"
3,TECH,Your Fears About The Coming Robot Revolution Might Be Overblown,Damon Beres,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rob-high-ibm-watson-mit_us_56c87423e4b0928f5a6c0b89,"People worry they'll steal our jobs, but there's still hope for the future.",2016-02-20,"IBM's Rob High, chief technology officer for Watson, says an intelligent robot who fills an already empty slot can make life better for current employees and customers.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56c890701e0000220070e6f5.jpeg?ops=crop_700_337_2538_1248%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- The robots are coming! The robots are coming! But maybe that's OK.Rob High, IBM's chief technology officer for Watson, on Saturday urged an audience of industry elites, academics and press to consider how artificial intelligence technology should improve -- rather than replace -- the human experience.AI can help people became more efficient, creative and informed, High suggested during a keynote speech at the MIT Tech Conference.""It's not about answering the question, it's about helping you come up with the questions you're not thinking to ask,"" High said.Take Watson, for example. It's a technology platform geared toward using a vast amount of data to produce intelligent responses to some of the biggest human problems, like cancer treatment.No one human could possibly read every medical journal out there, but Watson is being trained to ingest that information and produce smart solutions based on specific data -- a patient's background and symptoms, for example.That's a true partnership between humans and AI. Watson takes information that people produce, considers a variety of factors and provides knowledge that is then used to help a human doctor do their job better. But Watson is not a replacement for an actual doctor.There are concerns that robots are coming for our jobs, though. Meet Pepper, a Japanese robot that's able to function as an intelligent sales representative.In a video High included in his presentation, Pepper interacts with a man who wants to buy a cheap television. She up-sells him and suggests a cutting edge 4K TV instead. (Yes, this is real life.)The man asks the robot if channels are even broadcasting in 4K yet. The robot considers the question and responds with several stations that, indeed, broadcast in 4K.That's cool, but there's an obvious dark side. A store like Best Buy could theoretically populate its TV section with a couple of Peppers someday, rather than pay a regular wage to human employees.The Huffington Post asked High about concerns that a robot like AI could steal human jobs. He said, of course, that he doesn't have the answer. But he said it's absolutely a question society will have to grapple with in the near future. ""We, not just as a set of engineers a set of scientists building these things,"" High said. ""We as a society have a role and responsibility for deciding how we want these things to affect us in the world.""He compared AI to a hammer. There's a social contract that you use a hammer to build stuff, not to bludgeon people to death. Sweet, robotic Pepper isn't a murder machine, but the same principle applies.""We have created conditions and regulatory requirements and social conditions that place expectations on how people use these things,"" High said.And anyway, he added, so many of these jobs have already disappeared. Hotel concierge desks are so often understaffed, he offered. Supermarkets and pharmacies have already embraced self-service checkout machines.In High's vision, an intelligent robot who fills an already empty slot makes life better for current employees and customers.""Having a robot, in this case augmenting the staff, benefits the people who are there so that it helps them serve their customers better,"" he said.So, sleep tight: Maybe there's nothing to fear about the robot revolution after all.MORE ON HUFFPOST:How To Stop Worrying And Love Artificial IntelligenceSelf-Driving Cars Could Save Millions Of Lives -- But There’s A Catch"
4,POLITICS,Civil Rights Legend Says Sanders Supporters Yelled 'English Only' At Her,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-english-only-dolores-huerta_us_56c8f49de4b041136f174654,Watch the video for yourself.,2016-02-20,"Dolores Huerta, a Latino and civil rights leader, joins hands with Hillary Clinton during a rally in 2008. Huerta is supporting Clinton again in 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Dolores Huerta, a civil rights leader who has endorsed Hillary Clinton, said Saturday that Bernie Sanders supporters shouted her down when she tried to offer Spanish-language translations at a Las Vegas caucus location -- including by chanting ""English-only"" -- ahead of Clinton's win in the Nevada Democratic caucuses.""Shouting 'English-only' -- that is completely against the spirit of everything that we're working for,"" Huerta told The Huffington Post in a phone interview.Actress America Ferrera, also there to support Clinton, tweeted about the incident, which they said took place at a caucus location in Harrah's Las Vegas Hotel and Casino.Many of the caucus-goers were workers who spoke only Spanish, so she volunteered to do translation, Huerta said. But she said some Sanders supporters began to yell ""No, no, no"" and ""English only,"" and in the end, they went without translation entirely.""To deprive these voters at this crucial time of having a translation of what was going on -- this is something they need to know what's taking place,"" she said. ""The caucus is a kind of complicated procedure. So the Bernie supporters would rather them not have any sort of translation rather than have someone like myself, who just happened to be a Hillary supporter, do the translation."" Had she translated something inaccurately, Huerta said, there were Spanish-speaking Sanders supporters who would have corrected her. MoveOn.org, which endorsed Sanders, replied to Ferrera and Huerta on Twitter to say it would be ""totally unacceptable"" if such reports were true. The Sanders campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Huerta has been highly critical of Sanders, particularly over immigration and his past vote against comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.A number of people have disputed Huerta's story. A video of the event (starting around the 54-minute mark) shows the moderator asking if anyone speaks Spanish. When Huerta stands up, it's difficult to make out what everyone is saying, other than ""No, no."" The man asks the audience to stop shouting and says other Spanish speakers can point out if Huerta said anything pro-Clinton, but yelling continues, including ""absolutely not."" ""We're going forward in English only,"" the man says, adding that people should translate to those sitting around them if needed.Susan Sarandon, an actress supporting Sanders, tweeted that she was also present at the event and none of his supporters had yelled ""English only.""UPDATE: This article has been updated to include video and note the disputed nature of the event."
5,POLITICS,"In An Increasingly Nasty GOP Primary, Ted Cruz Stands Out For The Mud He Slings",Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cruz-campaign-attacks_us_56c8af8ae4b0928f5a6c1aab,No one drives the opposition quite as crazy.,2016-02-20,Cruz's team has pushed out mailers that seemingly darken Sen. Marco Rubio's (R-Fla.) skin while tying him to President Barack Obama.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56c8b0f41500002b000b0698.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It has become trite, in a way, to note that South Carolina has a reputation for dirty politics. Nasty things happen when presidential candidates compete in the Palmetto State. We know.What's stood out about this cycle is not that the attacks have been particularly vicious -- certainly, by South Carolina's standards -- they haven't. It's that one campaign seems to be originating much of them.Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and his allied super PACs are responsible for a solid chunk of the mud being slung. And in the process of doing so, they are relying on standard cultural flashpoints that have moved conservative voters in the past.To wit, a super PAC supporting Cruz has gone after Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump for supporting the removal of the Confederate battle flag on state grounds. His campaign has also put out a robocall attacking Trump for being overly supportive of LGBT rights and equality. Cruz's team has pushed out mailers that seemingly darken Sen. Marco Rubio's (R-Fla.) skin while tying him to President Barack Obama (they're literally pictured split faced) on trade legislation. Cruz has also attacked Rubio for employing campaign aides who are supportive of gay marriage.And this is just the reported and confirmable stuff. Trump has, additionally, accused Cruz of launching a robocall campaign against him, which Cruz has denied. Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), said that Cruz's team put up a fake Facebook page making it appear as if the Congressman had retracted his endorsement of Rubio. The Texan senator, again, denied responsibility. And on Saturday -- election day -- Rubio's campaign claimed that Cruz's camp was robocalling South Carolinians to tell them that the Florida senator was leaving the race. ""The calls claim that based on this, Marco was cutting his campaign short and dropping out,"" a Rubio aide told The Huffington Post. There is no evidence, as of now, that this is true. Certainly, Cruz is not the only candidate in the race using nefarious tactics to help his cause. And, in fact, there is a chatter among operatives that other campaigns (mainly, Rubio's) are deliberately overstating if not outright distorting Cruz's avarice, since, after all, who wants to vote for such an unquestionably dirty trickster? Cruz's press secretary made, essentially, this case.""Rubio’s tactics continue to stoop lower and lower,"" his spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told HuffPost. ""He’s making false accusations against Ted Cruz to distract voters and press from asking him about his own liberal record because he’s unable to defend it on the substance.""Frazier also noted that the campaign can't coordinate with the super PAC, which, she argued, made it unfair to tar the former for the actions of the latter. But there is something to still glean from Cruz's role in these squabbles. The man has a few less scruples than the competition and a touch more chutzpah. Just take the attacks he's launched on the competition over their support for LGBT rights. Cruz himself employs people supportive of gay marriage, despite frowning on Rubio for doing the same. And when he appeared at a New York fundraiser in December, he privately assured a Republican gay rights supporter that he wouldn't fight hard to outlaw same-sex marriage. The Texan's reputation for talking out of both sides of his mouth had, prior to this presidential run, earned Cruz the indignation of this Senate colleagues. Now that it's been filtered through a presidential campaign, it's driven the competition mad.On Friday, it was reported that Cruz and Ben Carson held a meeting to mend hurt feelings over a robocall that Cruz's team had spearheaded on the day of the Iowa Caucus telling voters that the neurosurgeon was dropping out. Carson is the most soft-spoken and mellow of the Republican candidates in the field, the one who has built his appeal on tampering down the rancor in D.C. But even he wasn't in the forgiving mood.  It “did not go well,"" a Carson campaign official told The Daily Beast.Also on HuffPost:"

Weisner and I were surrounded by firearms of all kinds -- as well as an array of DVDs, jewelry, power tools and TV sets.But I was more interested in a baseball cap—specifically, the red, white and blue “Donald Trump 2016” one that Weisner was sporting.“I take it you’re a Trump supporter,” I said.“Hell, yes,” he replied with a self-aware chuckle. “Everybody else can go to hell.”Weisner was kidding -- sort of.During an afternoon of wandering the church-lined streets of this old mill town about 35 miles outside Greenville, most people I talked to about the presidential campaign were either active Trump supporters or leaning in his direction -- especially the men. Trump’s advantage in South Carolina heading into Saturday’s GOP primary has narrowed somewhat in a few recent surveys. But he still leads in every poll in a state that appears poised to springboard him into a commanding position heading into the March 1 Super Tuesday contests. And if anyone is still skeptical about the possibility that Trump’s march to the Republican nomination may already be dangerously close to irreversible, the mood among the people of Laurens should make them reconsider. It is in small towns like this one, after all, where the Republican presidential nomination will be won or lost in states around the country. Laurens sits somewhere near the Bible Belt’s Bible Belt in terms of political geography. But none of the people I spoke to mentioned candidates' faith as being an important factor in how they will decide.They said they want a fighter -- someone with swagger who vows to upend a system that has failed them. And Trump fits the bill. Weisner, for one, said he'd never been much involved in politics before this cycle. He can’t stand politicians, for the most part.It's not that he believes everything Trump says. Weisner said he knows full-well the former reality TV star isn’t really going to build a big wall spanning the entire U.S.-Mexican border.But Weisner doesn’t care. Trump’s his guy because he has the guts to say he'll do it, even if he won't. ""Every country needs a strong leader,” Weisner said. “And we need a strong president.”There are few things that Weisner resents more than phonies. He remembered the time Hillary Clinton came down here last year and affected a Southern twang. He didn’t like that.""Trump tells it like it is,” Weisner said. “The rest of them beat it around the bush. And Jeb Bush is a joke. I mean, he's got his mama down here. That's not gonna help him none."" Trump, Weisner said firmly, is just the kind of tough guy who’s required for tough times. And in that conviction, he’s far from alone in this town.As Weisner’s equally plain-spoken son Jay put it, “It’s a gun store, man. If you’re not with Trump, you’re in the wrong damn spot.”Most of the textile and glass factories that once defined the region closed down over the last couple of decades. The numbers paint a bleak picture. This town of less than 10,000 people has seen its population drop by more than 7 percent since 2000 and its median household income decline from $28,756 to $23,283, according to government statistics.It shows.A two-minute drive down Highway 221 past no fewer than four churches and countless shuttered homes stands Childress Cash & Carry. Inside, Seneca Menthol cigarettes go for $3.59 a pack, and the in-shell Hampton Farms peanuts that are “best for boiling” come in 50-pound sacks. Joey Childress was working the cash register next to two homemade signs that read, “No credit. Don’t ask” and “Returned checks: $35.00."" Childress is a Trump supporter, too.“I like the way he talks,” Childress said. “He’s a regular person.”A regular person? But Donald Trump is a billionaire.“What’s being a billionaire got to do with it?” Childress shot back. “He talks just like everybody. He’s just plain. He ain’t talking above you. He’s talking with you.”Childress said that he believes all politicians are liars, and Trump doesn’t seem much like a politician to him. Didn’t he find any of Trump’s salty language and caustic demeanor off-putting?“Nope, I like it.”What’d he make of what the pope said about how people who build walls to keep others out aren’t Christian?“Pope’s wrong,” Childress said. “He oughta stay where he’s at. All countries in the old days had walls around ‘em.”Did he think Trump was going to win the primary on Saturday?“Yeah, in a runaway.”I drove to the Magnolia Inn. The billboard promoting the place reads, “May God Bless America.” The signs outside the lobby were less uplifting: “No parties, no refunds, no visitors, no pets, no loitering, no soliciting."" Inside, Jack Elders said he probably wouldn’t decide for sure who he'd vote for until later in the evening.“I’m leaning to Trump,” said Elders, who was visiting someone at the inn. “Honestly, I can maybe only tell you two or three that’s running.”When I asked him to name his most important issue, the words had barely escaped my lips before Elders answered: ""The economy.""“It is terrible here,” he said.Elders said that he counted himself lucky for having a decent job at a Michelin Tires facility down the street. But he noted that Laurens has suffered tremendously over the decade since he first entered the workforce.“Most of your good-paying jobs, they’re in Greenville or Spartanburg,” he said. “We lost a lot of big businesses to overseas … We’re just stuck.”Elders said he was put off by some of Trump’s incendiary rhetoric, but was unconcerned about whether the candidate is a genuine Christian believer. “I got a big Christian background, and my mama, my daddy, my grandpa, and all of them are in the church,” Elders said. “You can look at his Christian views, or you can ask: Can this man actually get the job done?”Unlike the pope, Elders said he didn’t see it as his place to judge Trump's religious sincerity. He just liked that Trump wanted to take the country back -- back to another time, that is.“I think he’s doing so well because he’s trying to restructure America the way it was years ago,” Elders said.Editor's Note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist,misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.Also on HuffPost:"

Jeb Bush's claim on Friday that the country's largest seniors group is “supportive” of his Social Security plan. The nonprofit also reiterated that they are not taking a position on specific reform proposals until after the election.Bush, a GOP presidential hopeful, claimed the powerful group’s backing in an interview on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Friday morning.The show’s host Joe Scarborough asked Bush whether he, unlike Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, would commit to raising the Social Security retirement age and other benefit cuts in order to restore the program’s solvency.“Yes, absolutely,” Bush said. “And AARP comes to every one of my town hall meetings and asks this question and they are supportive of our plan, because it’s a serious plan.”AARP, which has over 37 million members aged 50 or older, has indeed dispatched volunteers to ask presidential candidates to explain their plans to shore up Social Security’s finances as part of its “Take A Stand” campaign. The campaign also includes a multi-million dollar ad buy in early primary states.But AARP has insisted -- to the disappointment of many progressive retirement advocates -- that it will not express its opinion of specific reform proposals until the next president takes office and a genuine “legislative debate” about the program begins.In keeping with AARP’s commitment to neutrality on the merits of particular plans, the group issued a statement on Friday disavowing Bush’s remarks.“We are pleased that most of the candidates responded to our efforts, however, this morning, Governor Bush said in an MSNBC interview that we are supportive of his Social Security plan,” AARP senior vice president John Hishta said in a statement. “While we congratulate him for taking a stand on this important issue, it is inaccurate to say that AARP supports his or any particular candidate or their plans.”The incident illustrates the risks associated with AARP’s attempt to remain neutral on Social Security policy recommendations, even as it applauds the candidates for putting forward substantive plans of any kind. Candidates can claim AARP's backing for their plan without explaining that AARP has supported all candidates with a detailed plan.Bush is correct that AARP has given him higher marks than Trump on Social Security, but that is true of all the candidates in the field in both parties.Trump is the only candidate in either party who has yet to put forward a substantive plan for restoring the program’s solvency and ensuring adequacy of benefits, according to AARP. He instead promises to grow the economy and wipe out fraud to protect Social Security from cuts, measures that virtually no policy experts believe would be sufficient -- including those who, like him, oppose benefit reductions.Yet Bush’s remarks and AARP’s disavowal of them also underscore the limited political gains in proposing cuts to Social Security, no matter how much credit it earns you in the media or among donors.In addition to raising the full retirement age from 67, which it is currently on track to reach, Bush repeated on Friday that he would trim benefits for higher-earning retirees in the future, while boosting them for low-income retirees.Bush’s plans to reduce benefits for future beneficiaries, even as he would preserve benefits for people currently receiving them, is similar to that of his Republican rivals.But Trump, no matter his lack of policy detail, continues to lead the GOP field with his promise to not cut Social Security benefits at all -- part of a broader platform of economic populism that bucks traditional Republican trickle-down orthodoxy.Meanwhile, on the Democratic side, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have not only ruled out all Social Security benefit cuts, they are also now locked in an argument over who is more committed to expanding benefits.Americans’ precarious finances and their willingness to pay more to preserve Social Security, regardless of party affiliation, sheds light on why candidates vowing to protect or expand the program appear to be having more success in the polls.Those aged 65 or older withdrew just $1,000 from 401(k)s and other private retirement savings accounts in 2014 -- an amount that is likely to increase over time as the generation of workers with higher rates of the retirement savings plan grow older, but still fall well under what is needed for adequate income in retirement.The limited success of 401(k) plans for those who have them, and lack of access to them for wide swaths of the workforce, may help explain why Americans favor Social Security reform initiatives that protect the programs from cuts, even as the program will be unable to pay out full benefits in 2034 if there are no adjustments to its finances.Seventy-one percent of Americans, including 68 percent of Republicans, prefer a Social Security reform package that shores up the program’s finances by eliminating the cap on earnings taxed for Social Security and increasing the payroll tax rate, while modestly increasing benefits, according to an October 2014 poll from the nonpartisan National Academy of Social Insurance.Also on HuffPost:"

Seas of data analyzed by swift cognitive computing could make the gut instincts of the executives who dominate business obsolete, according to the lone woman on a five-person panel at the MIT Technology Conference at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on Saturday.“A lot of business is run by, no offense, smart white men,” said Amanda Kahlow, chief executive of the AI-driven marketing firm 6sense, as she turned to the four white men serving on the panel. “AI is going to take the ego out of the equation.” Male privilege ripples through the tech industry. Less than 6 percent of venture capitalists -- who provide startups with the financial lifeblood they need to get off the ground -- are women.

Over the years, she steeled herself against the self doubt that can plague women working in male-dominated industries, Kahlow said. “Because, as a woman, I’m told what to do all the time, it might be harder for me to take that data in,” she said. “In the past, I thought ‘they know better than me, I should really think about this.’ Now, I can be less likely to listen sometimes.”Also on HuffPost:"

This month CAL FIRE announced $1.7 million in grants to six central Sierra counties.

Predictions that trends of higher temperatures and decreased precipitation will continue in the future could transform the state’s forests.California is littered with dead trees. Four years of drought have pushed countless lone pines and forests alike to the brink of collapse, turning entire swathes of mountains from verdant to withering rust.Even those grim numbers, gathered through conventional on-the-ground and aerial estimates, were upended by a high-tech assessment done by scientists with the Carnegie Institution for Science. Four dry summers and four winters with a dramatically reduced snowpack have taken a toll throughout the Golden State, and will likely kill 58 million trees due to severe water loss, said Greg Asner, a Carnegie Institution biologist who published his results online on December 28 in Proceedings of the Natural Academy of Sciences. As many as 120 million trees statewide are in jeopardy from loss of water in their canopies, he said.The higher temperatures and reduced precipitation that contributed to the die-off are widely predicted to continue, leaving California's forests poised for radical transformation.Asner converted the 3-D images his equipment captured into topographic maps, which left little doubt about the hot spots. Virtually every corner of California has been affected by the drought, from the forests of the southern Sierra Nevada to the state's northwest. Asner called the mountains ringing Los Angeles ""a tinderbox."" The oak forests in the Sierra Foothills are ""in big trouble,"" and Pinnacles is ""not a happy place for a tree,"" he said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times. Even the forests northwest of Redding are ""surprisingly compromised,"" Asner said.His survey found the trees vulnerable due to extreme water loss represent 20 percent of the state's total.Asner's assessments, combined with those from the state and federal agencies, contributed to Gov. Jerry Brown's October declaration of a state of emergency over dying trees. Brown called it “the worst epidemic of tree mortality” in the state’s modern history. He ordered state agencies to remove dead or dying trees from high-hazard areas and proposed expanding the number of days when tree waste can be burned.That has triggered a variety of activities aimed at reducing the spread of insects infesting drought-weakened and standing dead trees, which are vulnerable to fire. This month CAL FIRE announced $1.7 million in grants to six central Sierra counties. Local projects will focus on removing dead and dying trees to reduce the wildfire threat around homes within Fresno, Kern, Madera, Mariposa, Tulare and Tuolumne counties, said Daniel Berlant, an agency spokesperson.Partnerships are also mobilizing around the use of prescribed fire to improve forest health and minimize the effects of wildfires. The last several years have been a wake-up call urging more attention to putting fire back on the landscape in a more sophisticated way, said Jim Branham, executive officer for the Sierra Nevada Conservancy.Other groups are analyzing the availability and placement of resources such as chippers and log-loaders. Their goal is to mobilize equipment in high-priority areas, moving it around much the way agencies relocate fire equipment, said Berlant.A February 1 report issued by the U.S. Forest Service puts California's forest emergency in the longer-term perspective of a changing climate. The 300-page report cited worsening drought conditions in California and throughout the West that may be more than their ecosystems can handle: ""There is growing consensus that extreme precipitation events will increase in frequency, and warmer temperatures will exacerbate the impacts of drought on forests and rangelands in the future.""Predictions like this foreshadow a series of cascading effects that reach far beyond dead and dying trees. We can, the federal scientists say, expect an increase in bark beetles. Insect infestations are currently the most important biotic cause of tree mortality, killing hundreds of millions of trees throughout the West as temperatures have warmed and precipitation has declined."

(Click here for easier reading)Trump appealed to then-Mayor Ed Koch for a city without “the constant chant of ‘police brutality.’” He wanted death for anyone who looked, acted or sounded like the Central Park Five.“They should be forced to suffer and, when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes,” he wrote. “I want to hate these murderers and I always will … I no longer want to understand their anger. I want them to be afraid.”Even then, Trump was known as an instigator who had the power to influence residents of a city reeling from rampant poverty, crime and drug use. The Guardian this week published a report on his campaign at the time to bring back the death penalty in New York so the Central Park Five could be executed.The teens were convicted, based on flimsy evidence and confessions they said were coerced. The convictions were vacated years later when the real rapist admitted attacking the jogger and his DNA was matched to the crime. The city paid millions to the teens to settle their lawsuits. Trump, however, has continued to call large swaths of innocent people killers, rapists and criminals.

Can Help You Proofread Better ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55ca3f4d170000b70056734e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"(Reuters Health) - Drinking more coffee might help reduce the kind of liver damage that's associated with overindulging in food and alcohol, a review of existing studies suggests.Researchers analyzed data from nine previously published studies with a total of more than 430,000 participants and found that drinking two additional cups of coffee a day was linked to a 44 percent lower risk of developing liver cirrhosis.""Cirrhosis is potentially fatal and there is no cure as such,"" said lead study author Dr. Oliver Kennedy of Southampton University in the U.K.""Therefore, it is significant that the risk of developing cirrhosis may be reduced by consumption of coffee, a cheap, ubiquitous and well-tolerated beverage,"" Kennedy added by email.Cirrhosis involves a hardening and destruction of liver tissue and kills more than one million people every year worldwide. It can be caused by hepatitis infections, excessive alcohol consumption, immune disorders, and fatty liver disease, which is tied to obesity and diabetes.Kennedy and colleagues did a pooled analysis of average coffee consumption across earlier studies to see how much adding two additional cups each day might influence the odds of liver disease.Combined, the studies included 1,990 patients with cirrhosis.In eight of the nine studies analyzed, increasing coffee consumption by two cups a day was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of cirrhosis.In all but one study, the risk of cirrhosis continued to decline as daily cups of coffee climbed.Compared to no coffee consumption, researchers estimated one cup a day was tied to a 22 percent lower risk of cirrhosis. With two cups, the risk dropped by 43 percent, while it declined 57 percent for three cups and 65 percent with four cups.But the results still leave some unresolved questions.One study, for example, found a stronger link between coffee consumption and reduced cirrhosis risk with filtered coffee than with boiled coffee.And, while the studies accounted for alcohol consumption, not all them accounted for other cirrhosis risk factors like obesity and diabetes, the authors note in the journal Alimentary Pharmacology and Therapeutics.Patients also shouldn't take the findings to mean loading up on frothy caramel lattes packed with sugar and topped with whipped cream is a good way to prevent liver disease, Kennedy cautioned. It's also not clear exactly how coffee might lead to a healthier liver, or whether the type of beans or brewing method matter.""Coffee is a complex mixture containing hundreds of chemical compounds, and it is unknown which of these is responsible for protecting the liver,"" Kennedy said.It's also important to note that coffee isn't powerful enough to counteract lifestyle choices that can severely damage the liver, said Samantha Heller, a senior clinical nutritionist at New York University Langone Medical Center in New York who wasn't involved in the study.""Unfortunately, although coffee contains compounds that have antioxidant effects and anti-inflammatory properties, drinking a few cups of coffee a day cannot undo the systematic damage that is the result of being overweight or obese, sedentary, excessive alcohol consumption or drastically mitigate an unhealthy diet,"" Heller said by email.SOURCE: http://bit.ly/1NRwqBW Alimentary Pharmacology and Therapeutics, online January 25, 2016.Also on HuffPost: "

That would be a threefold increase from 2000. Additionally, one out of 10 people are predicted to be at risk of blindness.A likely culprit in the surge in myopia, called shortsightedness in some parts of the world, is the amount of time people are spending inside, staring at computer and cellphone screens, according to the study, published online Feb. 11 in the journal Opthalmology.Kovin Naidoo, a co-author of the study, told The Huffington Post Australia in an interview that the prediction should be taken seriously. ""This is a true global health crisis, and is rare in that whether you live in Africa or Australia, it will have a huge consequence,"" Naidoo said. The study, led by Brien Holden of the Brien Holden Vision Institute in Sydney, crunched data from 145 studies that included 2.1 million participants. It estimated that by 2050, there will be about 4.8 billion people with myopia (49.8 percent of the world population) -- up from an estimated 1.4 billion (23 percent) in 2000.The projected increase in nearsightedness, the authors wrote, is ""widely considered to be driven by environmental factors (nurture), principally lifestyle changes resulting from a combination of decreased time outdoors and increased near work activities, among other factors."" Family history also is a factor.""Among environmental factors, so-called high-pressure educational systems, especially at very young ages in countries such as Singapore, Korea, Taiwan, and China, may be a causative lifestyle change, as may the excessive use of near electronic devices.""Naidoo said there's a simple way to prevent myopia: Go outside.""Some argue it’s about looking at further distances, and there's some evidence that it’s because of a chemical release in the retina,"" Naidoo said. ""More results are coming in around the globe all the time, but the reality is there is acceptance on the fact that spending two hours or more outside is protective.""Equally as important, Naidoo said in a statement, is that children receive regular eye examinations.So, put down the phone, head outdoors and look to the horizon.

25,CRIME,This City's Pit Bull Ban Has Failed Miserably To Prevent Dog Bites,Hilary Hanson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pit-bull-ban-toronto-dog-bites_us_56c8cd2ce4b0928f5a6c218e,Advocates have said for years that breed-specific legislation just doesn't work.,2016-02-20,"Ontario's ban on pit bulls has decreased the number of pit bulls in Toronto, but not overall dog bites, new data suggests.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56c8d1181e000021007027ad.jpeg?cache=9AJWTuN5AX&ops=crop_0_208_1735_1200%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"The Canadian province of Ontario passed a law in 2005 intended to slowly eradicate pit bulls from the region and thus cut down on dog bites and attacks.But since then, the overall number of dog bites in Ontario’s capital Toronto have gone up, according to a new report in the Canadian publication Global News.The legislation defined “pit bulls” as pit bull terriers, American Staffordshire terriers, Staffordshire bull terriers, American pit bull terriers, or any dog that has an appearance “substantially similar” to those breeds. It allowed those who already owned pit bulls to keep them, but outlawed breeding and bringing them into the province. Owning any pit bull born after the law took place was prohibited and illegal dogs could be sent out of the province or euthanized.In 2004, 567 dog bites were recorded in the city, based on reports that doctors who treat them are legally mandated to file. Eighty-six of these bites came from dogs designated as “pit bulls,"" giving them second place on a list of the ""top 10 breeds"" for dog bites. (German Shepherds came in first, with 112 reported bites.)See more in-depth data at the Global News.Clearly, some people continue to breed and obtain pit bulls under the law's radar. But Mary Lou Leiher of Toronto Animal Services told Torontoist in September she believes that ban has reduced the overall number of pit bulls in the city. Though it's tough to count how many illegal, unregistered dogs are in the city, Leiher said that ""anecdotally, we're seeing less.""Ten years later, with fewer pit bulls, it’s unsurprising that there are fewer pit bull bites. In 2014, pit bulls didn’t even make the top 10 breeds responsible for bites in Toronto. German shepherds again had the highest number of bites. The breed in second place? Labrador retrievers.But what the law hasn’t done is decrease total dog bites. There were 767 dog bites in 2014 -- 200 more than the year before the ban went through.And this isn’t a bizarre outlier. Though total bites initially dropped after 2004, the number has fluctuated since then, spiking in 2011, dropping again in 2012 and then steadily climbing for the next two years. Leiher told the Global News that there haven’t been any procedural changes that would increase the proportion of dog bites that got reported to the city.Significantly, these are only raw numbers — they do not account for the number of dog bites as proportionate to the canine population of Toronto. But speaking with Torontoist, Leiher indicated the prevalence of dog bites has remained constant.And countless dog advocates, as well as the American Veterinary Medical Association, have been saying for years that breed-specific legislation, known as BSL -- a practice that is widespread in the United States -- is ineffective. From the AVMA website:Any dog can bite, regardless of its breed, and more often people are bitten by dogs they know. It’s not the dog’s breed that determines risk -- it’s the dog’s behavior, general size, number of dogs involved and the vulnerability of the person bitten that determines whether or not a dog or dogs will cause a serious bite injury. Dogs can be aggressive for all sorts of reasons. A dog that has bitten once can bite again, and a dog that has never bitten could still bite.What breed-specific legislation -- in Ontario and elsewhere -- does do is lead to tragic consequences for dogs and their owners. Take Precious, a pit bull who achieved online fame after being photographed loyally standing over her injured owner during a house fire. She was forced to leave her human family shortly thereafter, since pit bulls are banned in the Maryland county where she lived. And Precious is one of the lucky ones -- she went to a loving foster home, rather than becoming one of the thousands of pit bulls euthanized in shelters each year, largely because of public perception of pit bulls and restrictions on where the dogs can live.The story has been updated for clarity.More HuffPost pitbulls:"

It's a city where rain makes it more beautiful, water flows around every corner, evergreen trees grow far into the clouds, and snow-capped mountains pave the way for adrenaline filled adventure. A city historically known for grunge, Microsoft, and Sleepless in Seattle, however, currently known for artesian coffee, craft beers, world renowned athletes, disruptive technology, intimately raw music experiences, innovative cuisine, ecofriendly fashion, an emerging art scene, and purposeful living. A city experiencing one of the greatest artistic renaissances in the modern world. Stripped down. Natural. Beautiful. And Raw. Just as we are the day we are born. Fearless and ready to create greatness. While the city grows by thousands of new residents each week and countless building cranes shape the skyline, Seattle longtime residents re-enact the Seattle freeze and whisper the new nickname ""The Lost City"" on the streets while something beautiful is happening underground. As an influx of new energy comes in, the old more established energy becomes more grounded, confidently defines what makes them Seattleites.

Michelle Moore, fashion photographer, is Seattle born and bred and her roots run deep. She lives her passion day in and day out shooting lifestyle campaigns, fashion look books, headshots, product lines, magazine spreads, and much, much, more. The spirit of Seattle lives in her blood.

Queen Anne Filter - ""Grab any and all opportunity as a developing artist. Don't be afraid to experiment and try many things. It takes years to develop your style and craft. Early on I took any and all jobs as a photographer, until I began to specialize in portraiture. For many years I honed in on my portrait style and I am now finding myself yet again in a transitional and growing phase of my career as I develop my style and market in fashion photography."" Photo (c) Michelle Moore#2. Seattle Filter - ""Frequently photographers feel that they have to go to NY or LA if they want to have a successful career. Very early on I felt that moving to a different city was what I was ""supposed"" to do, but by my mid-20s I realized that Seattle was where I belonged. The moment I accepted Seattle as the city I was meant to be in was the moment I found clarity with my career and was able to grow a successful business."" Photo (c) Michelle Moore#3. Greenlake Filter - ""Keep at it every day. I've found that focusing on yourself and where you are going is more important than looking at what everyone else is doing. Spend time every day working on your goals - and remember nothing great happens overnight. When we look outside ourselves, find inspiration, but do not copy. Everyone has their own brand of magic."" Photo (c) Michelle Moore#4. Lake Washington Filter - ""I feel at home around water. Explore your own city and find the environments or places that allow you to feel calm, relaxed and inspired. I now carve a bit of time every week for myself when I am not working (you can still work hard - but give yourself some down time too!). This allows me to re-group, spend quality time with friends and family, disconnect and be re-inspired. Taking quality ""personal"" time is a necessity - otherwise you will burn out your creativity.""#5. Ballard Filter - ""Be true to yourself no matter what. At the end of the day people will know if you are being genuine or not - and all you have is your own inner spark. Let that shine."" Photo (c) Michelle Moore#6. Fremont Sunday Market Filter - ""There is beauty in variety. There will be times where your artwork will feel disjointed as you transition and try new things. Be okay with the chaos, going off brand, finding your voice. The more you create, the closer you are to finding yourself."" Photo (c) Michelle Moore#7. Discovery Park Filter - ""Helping others reach their goals and supporting my community and friends is very important to me. If you ask someone for advice and they generously give it to yo¬¬u, don't forget to say thank you, then pay it forward. Don't be afraid to pass on information! We are all in this together, and sharing your knowledge with others will only come back to you ten-fold.""At the end of the day, Michelle and I believe that the best filter you can live by is no filter. You are beautiful as-is. Live each day utilizing passion and purpose to ground you, and guide your creativity."
27,POLITICS,Supreme Court Battle Will Put Democratic Candidates' Ideas To The Test,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/so-that-happened-scalia_us_56c6116ce4b08ffac127fb37,"Does public shaming work? Does compromise? We'll find out, maybe!",2016-02-19,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt). and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton smile as they take the stage before a Democratic presidential primary debate at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Feb. 11, 2016, in Milwaukee.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"So, that happened. With the passing of Antonin Scalia, President Barack Obama now faces the challenge of getting a new Supreme Court justice appointed in spite of Senate Republicans' intransigence. For the Democrats campaigning to be Obama's successor, the president's battle may have significant ripple effects on their own fortunes, as their competing visions of how they'll ""get stuff done"" get put to a real-world test. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have each described what kinds of policies they'd pursue as president. Sanders' are considerably more ambitious than Clinton's, but both candidates face the same obstacle -- a legislature that will likely be in the control of Republicans, who'll be in no mood to help enact liberal policies. Clinton's response to this challenge has been to suggest that her years of experience give her an advantage in making compromises. She's got the skill set, she argues, that will allow her to build on and improve the policy changes of the Obama years.But appointing a Supreme Court justice is no mere incremental change. Should that task fall to the next president, it will have far-reaching and high-stakes ramifications that will alter the court's trajectory for years. Opportunities for deal-making with a GOP-led Senate will be in short supply, even to a deft operator like Clinton.Sanders, meanwhile, is going to want to watch Obama's actions pretty closely as well. With little genuine leverage at his disposal, the president may have to hope that he can muster enough grassroots pressure and public shame to actually get Scalia's replacement to the bench.""Grassroots pressure and public shame"" is not the worst description of Sanders' entire operating theory of his presidency. If Obama fails in the effort, it could bring Sanders' sky-high plans for political revolution back down to earth in a hurry.Also on this week's podcast, Jamie Raskin -- a Maryland state senator and American University law professor who's gotten into the crowded Democratic primary to replace Rep. Chris Van Hollen in Maryland's 8th District -- joins us to make his case for why he ought to get the nomination over some well-funded but less experienced opponents. Meanwhile, we've been talking on this show about the dangers to the economy posed by ""too big to fail"" banks, and we have some good news to report: Our overwhelmingly sound arguments have convinced Neel Kashkari, former bailout czar and current president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve, to join us.

In the classroom of the Senate, he isn't merely the kid who sits in front and raises his hand at every opportunity; he's the kid who glues classmates' textbook pages together when they're not looking.This is a guy, after all, who has time and again brought the Senate to a grinding halt; who organized tea party House members against their leadership; who has so alienated his Republican colleagues that Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolinian, was moved to say that crowning Cruz the party's presidential nominee would mean ""death"" for the GOP; and who on Thursday called Sen. Marco Rubio a ""liberal"" for having supported then-Sen. John Kerry's nomination as secretary of state, despite the fact that Cruz's best friend in the Senate, Utah's Mike Lee -- a man who campaigned with Cruz that very day -- had done the exact same thing. But politics is a fickle business, subject to more than its share of vagaries and vicissitudes. And so against all odds, Cruz is trying to build an actual coalition, namely of libertarians and populists to supplement his already robust constituency of religious conservatives.At first glance, you wouldn't have suspected that coalition-building was on the agenda as Cruz arrived to campaign at Mutts Barbecue in Easley on Thursday afternoon, two days before the South Carolina primary. Easley lies some 30 minutes west of Greenville in the state's largely rural and mostly conservative western edge. It's the sort of place, filled with the sort of people, that would already be in the bag for the Texas senator.Mutts' parking lot was jammed with supporters over an hour before Cruz was expected to arrive. The attendees were almost entirely white, and though a wide range of ages was represented, the crowd skewed older. Confederate flags were visible, including several placed on the back of a pickup alongside two American flags and, given pride of place higher in the center, the Christian flag.Moreover, Cruz was joined that day by some of Congress' best-known conservative firebrands, including Sen. Lee and Reps. Steve King (Iowa), Louie Gohmert (Texas) and Jeff Duncan (S.C.). It was a veritable tea party supergroup, the Traveling Wilburys of reactionary politics.But mixed into Cruz's blustery, socially conservative rhetoric were some not-so-subtle appeals to other wings of the GOP, namely the populist and libertarian elements. On the populist front, a key Donald Trump constituency, Cruz tweaked his border pitch to include language against ""special interests"" and ""hedge fund millionaires."" He answered a question about ""jobs going overseas"" by levying criticism against the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and its alleged lack of protections for U.S. workers. ""This is a president who doesn't fight for American workers,"" Cruz railed.That hint of economic populism resonated with many attendees. ""I don't trust Rubio because of his views on immigration,"" remarked Will Gantt, a late-middle-aged man. Gantt added that he had no problem with legal immigration, ""so long as they learn our language, learn our culture and learn to do as we do, not bring their stuff with them.""Cruz also seemed to reach out to libertarians, at one point referring to ""my friend, Rand Paul,"" the libertarian-leaning Republican senator from Kentucky and recent presidential aspirant. He beefed up his anti-government rhetoric, including calls to abolish the Internal Revenue Service and greatly lower taxes. Cruz even implied that by mimicking Ronald Reagan's ""strength through peace,"" he would pursue a much more isolationist foreign policy.Some attendees seemed to respond to that libertarian posturing.Danielle Jones, a self-described ""libertarian anarchist,"" said she would either support Cruz or Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson.""I think we should be getting back to the Constitution. It's a simple and perfect document,"" said Jones. With a nod to the Transportation Security Administration and the National Security Agency, she added, ""Our rights are being stripped away."" If Cruz can poach just a statistical handful of these populist and libertarian supporters from his opponents, it might be enough to put him over the top in South Carolina, though it remains a steep climb. According to the HuffPost Pollster average, Cruz trails Trump 34 percent to 19 percent as of Friday afternoon.A more immediate concern is Marco Rubio, who, according to that same HuffPost Pollster average, trails Cruz by less than 4 points. While Cruz mentioned the Florida senator briefly, calling him the ""third place candidate,"" he mostly stayed clear of attacking Rubio on Thursday. But his campaign and allied organizations are waging a far dirtier effort.His campaign released a poorly photoshopped image of Rubio shaking hands with President Barack Obama to draw attention to the senator's work on immigration reform. A Spanish-language robocall targeting South Carolina voters emphasized the words ""Marco Rubio"" and ""amnesty."" It's hard to incorporate Christian charity and grace into a presidential campaign. Turn the other cheek and suddenly you're soft on ISIS; loving thy neighbor invites charges that you're weak on illegal immigration; and honoring thy mother and father can lead to charges of being too cozy with the establishment -- if you're Jeb Bush, at least.But the brilliance of Ted Cruz is that he has already built himself up as a kind of ruthless Christian crusader. His supporters expect a fiery, Old Testament style of Christian -- the kind of guy whom God wouldn't need to tell to kill Isaac because he'd already have done so. Let John Kasich have all the wishy-washy, Golden Rule, New Testament stuff. On several occasions during his speech in Easley, Cruz referred to himself and his allies as ""trench fighters.""

30,POLITICS,South Carolinians See Negative Ad Barrage Ahead Of GOP Primary,"Michael Beckel, Center for Public Integrity",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/south-carolina-gop-primary_us_56c7499de4b041136f16b98a,"Ted Cruz and his super PAC allies attack Donald Trump, Marco Rubio.",2016-02-19,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) -- Announced March 23, 2015",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55b7e4ec1d00003000143032.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"This story was originally published by the Center for Public Integrity.The Republican race for the presidential nomination is becoming increasingly nasty as voters prepare to head to the polls in South Carolina on Saturday.So far this month, more than 15,200 TV ads have been blasted at South Carolinians, with nearly two-thirds of them negative, according to a Center for Public Integrity analysis of data provided by advertising monitoring firmKantar Media/CMAG. The negative ad total includes spots that contrast multiple candidates and typically cast at least one in a disparaging light.Since TV ads from GOP candidates, super PACs and political nonprofits firstbegan airing in South Carolina, nearly half have been negative. That’s a marked change from previous contests. In both Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states to host votes for a presidential nominee, only about one-third of all TV ads were attack ads.U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and his super PAC allies are primarily responsiblefor the recent onslaught.So far this month, Cruz and his supporters have aired more than 5,400 TV ads— an average of about one every four minutes. Many of these have gone after his rival Republican White House hopefuls Donald Trump, a real estate mogul who currently leads in the polls, and Marco Rubio, a U.S. senator from Florida.To see a chart on how nasty ads are in South Carolina, visit the Center for Public Integrity.Both Trump and Rubio have also been attacked by super PAC Right to Rise USA, which supports former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in the 2016 presidential race.Meanwhile, in his own TV ads, Trump has repeatedly chastised Cruz, who bested Trump to win the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1.At the same time, both Trump and Cruz have been criticized by groups whose donors are not immediately apparent.Our Principles PAC, a super PAC formed last month by a former aide to 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, has spent nearly $4 million attacking Trump, according to Federal Election Commission records. Because of a quirk in campaign finance regulations, the group won’t be required to reveal any of its donors until Saturday.Meanwhile, an Iowa-based group called the American Future Fund has spent more than $1.5 million attacking Cruz in South Carolina. Because the American Future Fund is organized as a “social welfare” nonprofit whose primary purpose isn’t influencing elections, it’s not required to disclose its donors.“It’s really ramped up recently,” said Jeffrey Peake, a political science professor at Clemson University, of the intense battle in the Palmetto State. “South Carolina is really important for setting the stage for March 1.”March 1 is Super Tuesday, when a dozen states will hold their Republican primaries or caucuses, including several others in the South.Since 1980, the winner of South Carolina's Republican presidential primary has gone on to become the party's nominee every time except one.Also on HuffPost:"
