Now we must wait patiently until June when SCOTUS will announce their decision. Optimism and polls on marriage equality are higher than ever, perhaps because citizens in 36 states and Washington, D.C., already have marriage equality, and the sky did not fall.Metropolitan Community Churches (MCC) are proud to say marriage equality has been part of our DNA for almost 50 years. One of the first things our founder, Rev. Elder Troy Perry, did after forming Metropolitan Community Church in 1968 was to begin performing marriage ceremonies. (MCC Founder, Rev. Elder Troy Perry, and Moderator, Rev. Dr. Nancy Wilson, working for marriage equality for almost 50 years.)Over my decades of ministry, I have married hundreds of same-gender couples, and MCC has performed tens of thousands of marriages.Early in my ministry, two elderly women, Connie and Eva, came to me to marry. They met in 1932 in Marlene Dietrich's lesbian-friendly nightclub in Berlin. Eva was German; Connie was African-American. They were separated by World War II but reunited when Eva came to live with Connie in the United States. For decades, they lived as ""Mrs. Winne and her maid Connie"" until they found MCC and realized they could finally be authentically who they were: lifelong lovers, married in every way but in the eyes of the law. Everything changed when they knelt together at the altar to profess the love they had shared for 40 years. They were finally able to be open.In 1975, Rev. Freda Smith, an MCC pastor, performed the wedding of Anthony Corbett Sullivan and Richard Frank Adams. The marriage laws in Colorado did not specify gender, so a county clerk saw no reason not to give them a license. MCC performed the first legal same-gender marriage in the country!  In June of 1970, The Advocate published ""Perry Plans Marriage Test."" Reporter John Zeh described Rev. Perry's plan to challenge California's opposite-gender-only marriage laws. And he did! Represented by LA attorney Al Gordon, Rev. Perry brought the suit on behalf of Neva Heckman and Judith Bellew, a couple whose wedding he officiated in 1969. MCC mobilized the world's first action for legal recognition for same-gender marriages. The lawsuit was dismissed, but the struggle had begun.In 1971, Life magazine devoted two pages to Metropolitan Community Churches in an article called ""Homosexuals in Revolution: A Church for Homosexuals."" Rev. Perry was pictured performing a wedding ceremony for Andre Charland and Richard Castle. The caption noted that marriages were being performed, but they were not legal -- an indirect recognition of the inequality we faced.All along, we knew that dismissing our marriages was unjust and probably illegal. For decades, MCC members around the world joined Rev. Perry in Valentine's Day actions. We would go to the local officials, as same-sex couples, dramatically ask for a marriage license, and just as dramatically be turned down.When Valentine's Day rolls around next February, it is likely that all couples who choose to marry will be able to do so in the United States and in a growing number of other countries.We know that being true to ourselves and our families is having an impact. When an MCC minister, Rev. Roberto Gonzalez, performed the first public same sex wedding at an ILGA conference in Rio in 1994, no one dreamed that Brazil, Uraguay, Argentina, Mexico City, Colombia, and Venezuela would today recognize legal marriages or civil unions.When Rev. Dr. Brent Hawkes of Canada researched Canadian law and performed Canada's first legal marriage in 2001 -- and it held up in court in 2003 -- we knew the orbit of planet justice had shifted on its axis.History is being made. We have told our stories, claimed our stories, and treasured our stories. As Evan Wolfson stated in a recent Face the Nation interview, even if SCOTUS rules against marriage equality, we will continue to work for equality state-by-state."

It will highlight real life insight on how women have been able to turn weakness into strength. Each interview is the naked truth about breakdowns that inspired breakthroughs. These women have experienced internal changes, which make them quintessential Paradigm Shifters.Everything I have ever done has been focused on this underlying theme of shifting the paradigm because ""what we think determines what we feel and what we feel determines what we do."" Hence why Seven Bar Foundation and Empowered by You takes lingerie, which has traditionally been seen merely as a tool of seduction, and makes it a tool of empowerment.I hope after reading these stories you will look at your own situations, struggles and accomplishments through a different lens and, at the very least, be better equipped to change your own paradigm. At the end of the day, we are our own Alchemists turning the silver we were born with into the gold we are destined to become. Jyothi Rao - President of Intermix, Photo Courtesy of Geordie WoodTell me about your background.I was born in India, moved to Nigeria in West Africa with my family when I was six, and lived there for a few years. Then I went to boarding school in England when I was 10 while my parents continued to live in Africa. I went to an amazing school in Oxford and did most of my education there. Then my parents moved to London. I was admitted into the London School of Economics, but my father was very keen that my sister and I grow up in America because he felt there were a lot more career opportunities for women and women who are minorities in this country. So we moved. My parents moved back to India, and my sister and I moved to the U.S. We went to college and built our careers here. I feel everything in life is an equal measure of effort and of luck. I feel very fortunate, especially coming from a country like India where there are so many girls who are never educated and even those that are educated are often not encouraged to have careers. I'm keenly aware of the opportunities I've had and how important it is that I make the right effort and support progress. How did living outside of the US change your perspective on business?It's made me very adaptable and agile. I've lived in so many different countries and cultures. I have an appreciation for how different cultures approach partnerships and relationships. New York is a wonderfully diverse place where you're required to have a broad perspective in how you approach people.Do you think being conscious of a disadvantage to society has given you leverage in your life?Absolutely. I always feel that if this doesn't work out, I can start over and it's going to be fine. I have an education, incredible mentors, and a great network of professionals, friends, and people around me for support. That's so much more than so many people have and certainly so many women and girls have. No matter what happens, I can always pick myself back up. In the moment, failure can feel like the end of everything, but it isn't. You have to embrace failure and learn from it and you become a richer person from it. We have so many advantages that we can re-launch ourselves in a new direction. We all have such a fear of failure. My father once said to me, ""I have been through a lot in my life, and I've never been insecure."" It astounded me because I certainly can't say that about myself! That's where you want to reach ultimately, to never feel insecure. Not from a place of ego, but a place of feeling that it's okay if this doesn't work out, that I can start over and make things work out for the better.Tell me about your first break and how you've paid that forward.I've had so many great breaks. Out of college, I got hired by Gap Inc. when I was 21 years old. At the time, it was an up-and-coming company. I interviewed with all these different companies and everyone I was meeting were men in suits. Then I go into this interview with the recruiter from Gap, and he's wearing jeans and a blazer and he's cute and fun. He represented the culture that I wanted to be part of and I was very fortunate that I started my career there. I was at that company for 15 years. What was amazing was that when I was there, the company was going through a very high growth phase and there were new divisions being added. I was able to have a variety of experience without actually leaving the company, which is a unique opportunity to have. I was maybe 27 years old running a 200 million dollar business. The fact that I had these managers and mentors that trusted and empowered me with that level of responsibility has really stayed with me. That makes you want to try harder and deliver with incredibly high standards. When I went to Gilt I had no ecommerce experience, no multi-brand experience. Kevin Ryan, the chairman of the company, and the other founders, took a risk on me. Both these experiences left me with some important lessons of building a team around you of people who have the skills to do what you need them to do, but more importantly people who reach and have the capacity to do more, have intellectual curiosity, and more importantly who have great cultural fit. At Gilt, I saw a culture I knew I could thrive in and they saw someone who would thrive in that culture. I love creative, innovative and entrepreneurial cultures.What advice would you give your younger self?It's hard to do when you're young, but try not to be too self-involved. Start developing a great network of mentors and peers and lean on them for advise early on. They will likely help you avoid common pitfalls in your journey.What you would like your legacy to be?To have added value in a positive way in all aspects of my life. Most of all to have raised our daughter to live a life that's grounded in a foundation of sound values.Jyothi is a true inspiration! Keeping a broad perspective and strong core values, she has built a success story anyone can learn from. Jyothi continues to stay true to her threads of authenticity! I have been shifted."

My mother wanted me to admit in the best schools of the town. Therefore, she was under the sun for four hours in a long line just to buy the admission form. Things were going pretty well; she even took me to the photo studio with my old pair of shoes for having photos for the admission. That day, I was very happy until I saw my mother crying in a corner. All the women of our community came to our house just to stop my mother to send me to that school. Why? The reason was very simple: combined education. They told my mother that I will elope with a boy if I went to that school and leave the whole community in unbearable shame! However, my mother sent me to that school and I kept fighting for me. Well unfortunately, I didn't elope with a boy (!). Instead of that, I completed my graduation with an outstanding result and became the first graduate girl of my community.I always tell people that a woman in a developing country is like a circus elephant. What we see in the circus is how the mighty enormous elephant is leashed in a weak chain without knowing about his power of crumbling the chain effortlessly. Likewise, our life without education is just like the circus elephant. It might be tough for some people of the developed world to understand my statement because they take education for granted, but in our culture we have to fight for our education.Anyways, I could have good a job in a multi-national company after completing my graduation in finance, but I didn't because something touched the core of my heart. One day on my way to the university, I saw a very small girl about 3 or 4 years old selling candy on the road. A man kicked her very brutally because she was asking him to buy some candy! I was shocked as I discovered that they are treated everywhere like street dogs. I felt very sorry because I have a niece her age. She is going to school, buying any toys she wants.I found that this discrepancy is only because of the financial freedom and education. After that, I along with my friends started a small initiative at my university campus. We went into slums where the poorest children live and started to convince them to get the basic education from us. We failed again and again. We had to make great efforts to convince the children and their parents to allow us to educate them. Instead of going to school, these children work in dangerous and illegal environments just to afford food to survive. They have no education, so most have only the hard life of a sex worker for their future. After a heart and soul endeavor we were able to convince six slum children to join us. We taught them essential skills for life: fundamental reading, writing and math as well as necessarily social and vocational skills to earn a living. In just four years, we have helped more than 250 children. To further meet their needs, we will begin by providing at least one meal a day. This is a top priority. Most of the students are girls.As I also believe in personal growth, I started applying for foreign programs beside my work. Thus, I was selected last year by Watson University in the United States as a scholar. I went to the U.S. all by myself which was another epic story. As girls are not allowed to travel abroad alone, so before my journey, my relatives forced me to get married so that a man can take care of my security. But again, with their great disappointment, I denied and said ""I am strong enough to take care of myself. I don't need any man to take care of my security.""Moving to the U.S. changed my life. I called it my rebirth. I learned so many things and broke my old shell of low self-confidence. Within a month from an introvert shy girl of 24 years old, I became an extrovert public speaker. At Watson University, with the help of my mentors, I bloomed like a flower. It was the place where I first realized that I want to help as many girls get education as I can. As a result, I founded my own non-profit so that I can help more under-privileged children in my community after completing my semester at Watson University. Our goal is to empower 150 children in 2015 and 500 children by the end of 2016.  I believe the best way of spreading peace in the world is by educating children. Therefore, I will keep fighting to educate underprivileged and street children until the last breath of my life.Apart from that, I am a fun loving person! I love to travel and explore new places, tasting new food & making new friends. Well, I also love to dance and do some dancing when no one is around!"

Abu Dhabi is the eighth stop of Kerry's first official overseas trip. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, Pool)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14b2e240000140a51b911.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Abu Dhabi -- Backed by an impressively lavish lobbying and PR machine -- more expensive than any other middle eastern country -- the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is eager to show that it's a safe and stable business environment, and a dependable U.S. military ally. ""United in Security"" with the U.S., declared the UAE state media this week, reminding readers it's the ""only Arab country to join the U.S. on six military operations over the last 25 years"" (First Gulf war, Afghanistan, Somalia, Kosovo, Libya and ISIL). Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan met with President Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and Defense Secretary Carter in Washington last Monday to discuss, according to him, ""new steps to enhance the already deep security between the U.S. and the UAE."" Sheikh Mohammed is a regular visitor to DC, commanding red carpet treatment and access to the highest possible levels of the U.S. government. He is likely to be back in a couple of weeks representing UAE at the Camp David conference of Gulf leaders. He's also head of the feared state security system, the UAE's Stasi, which regularly suppresses freedom of speech and ruthlessly suffocates civil society voices of those who are critical of the regime. In recent months, the attacks on dissidents have intensified. In November 2014 the UAE cabinet announced a list of 83 ""terrorist organizations."" These included two American NGOs, the Council on Islamic-American Relations and the Muslim American Society. Previously tolerated local civil society organizations have been disbanded, including the Association of Teachers and the Association of Jurists. Former heads of the Jurists Association are now political prisoners, including renowned constitutional scholar Dr. Mohammed al Roken. He's one of dozens serving long prison sentences after being convicted in a mass unfair trial in 2013. Reports of torture in custody have intensified in recent years, and only a tiny handful of dissidents are currently in the country and out of jail. These include prominent Human Rights Defender Ahmed Mansoor, named this week as a 2015 finalist for the internationally prestigious Martin Ennals Human Rights Defender Award. Nearly all peaceful dissent in the UAE is silenced, both on and offline. Abuse of migrant workers' rights persists, and no labor union is allowed to exist to protect them. Meeting me in secret this week in the UAE, human rights activists told me there is now a zero tolerance policy for peaceful criticism of the Emirati regime. ""It's got so much worse in the last few years,"" said one. ""Ten years ago arrests without warrants or disappearances happened but they were rare. Now they're common."" Even relatives of political prisoners have been targeted in recent months, some hit with arbitrary travel bans that prevent them from leaving the country. They blame Shiekh Mohammed's state security for tampering with official government files holding their ID and other information. They said that dates of birth have been changed so that adults are officially registered as children, or other details modified, making it impossible for them to get drivers licenses and other essential documents. This administrative harassment has sent people into an endless bureaucratic loop, preventing them from getting or renewing passports, applying for school, opening bank accounts, and generally operating normal lives. The denial of a security clearance amounts to a denial of a job. Many activists are unable to support themselves financially, some are sleeping rough. ""It's a soft repression but very effective,"" one activist told me. ""State security basically runs the country, no matter who the official government is. It's unaccountable, omnipotent, and scares everyone."" Families of detainees live in fear of reprisals by the state security apparatus. Three sisters who were summoned to a police station in Abu Dhabi in mid-February have not been heard from since. The three women are sisters of Issa Khalifa al-Suwaidi, a political prisoner convicted with Al Roken and 67 others, who is serving 10 years in jail. These three women are part of a pattern of forced disappearances by the authorities. Crushing dissent in the UAE is typically done in the name of anti-terrorism. The UAE regime presents a false stability versus democracy binary as justification for its crackdown. Officials claim a modern country has been built in a generation because strict authoritarianism has enabled galloping economic development. They point to the United States as a key part of this boom -- the UAE is America's largest trading partner in the Middle East with a 90 percent growth in trade over the last decade and over 1,000 U.S. companies in the country. Washington has continued to support the dictatorship politically and militarily, arming it with a vast array of weapons as the repression has intensified. As part of the White House's Countering Violence Extremism initiative, there are plans for a U.S.-UAE social media partnership based in the Emirates, where criticizing the regime on Twitter typically means a long jail sentence. The irony seems lost on Washington, where President Obama has rightfully identified a key problem in the Gulf autocracies as ""a belief that there are no legitimate political outlets for grievances,"" and has promised to raise it with the leaders at Camp David next month. ""Those might likely to turn to extremism here are those under pressure from the government, those who living conditions are threatened, those without hope and those not allowed to live normal lives. Repression will create radicalism,"" said one activist. President Obama said ""America's support for civil society is a matter of national security,"" but that's not how it seems to dissidents in the UAE. Those I met this week are largely scared into silence, feeling abandoned by Washington and cynical that the U.S. means what it says about protecting is values of free speech. ""It's all talk, American talk, supporting human rights. They never back it up, just keep selling weapons to our government while it puts lawyers in jail,"" said one Emirati rights activist. When they meet next month, President Obama should look beyond UAE's fancy PR campaign and ask Sheikh Mohammed why peaceful critics are in jail, why their lawyers are intimidated from representing them and their witnesses harassed, and why the UAE thinks the best way to fight terrorism is with repression."
5,BUSINESS,Jane Goodall Says SeaWorld 'Should Be Closed Down',Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jane-goodall-seaworld_n_7153818.html,"“It’s not only that they’re really big, highly intelligent and social animals so that the capture and confinement in itself is cruel.""",2015-04-27,"British primatologist, ethologist, anthropologist, and UN Messenger of Peace Jane Goodall speaks during the 'Avoided Deforestation' event, within the framework of the UN Conference on Sustainable Development, Rio+20, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on June 21, 2012. World leaders attending the UN summit in Rio weighed steps to root out poverty and protect the environment as thousands of activists held several protests to denounce Amazon rainforest deforestation, the plight of indigenous peoples and the 'green economy' being advocated at the UN gathering. AFP PHOTO / ZULMAIR ROCHA (Photo credit should read ZULMAIR ROCHA/AFP/GettyImages)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb3201c20000030000020b1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- Jane Goodall wants to see SeaWorld go extinct. The 81-year-old primatologist said whales and dolphins should never be held in captivity, and that the entertainment company known for its orca shows should be shuttered.“They definitely should be closed down,” Goodall said in an interview with The Huffington Post earlier this month. She’s not alone. SeaWorld’s stock price has been plummeting since July 2013, when CNN released the documentary “Blackfish."" The film exposed the misery endured by SeaWorld's trained orca and the dangers posed to trainers working with stressed-out carnivorous whales.  SeaWorld's stock price has declined precipitously since the 2013 release of ""Blackfish."" One of the problems highlighted in ""Blackfish"" is that cetacea, the family of aquatic mammals that includes whales, dolphins and porpoises, communicate with sonar-like sound waves. When confined to tanks, Goodall noted, those waves echo back and create a hellish cacophony for the animals“When they are contained in these tanks … that is acoustical hell,” said Goodall, adding that her nonprofit organization, the Jane Goodall Institute, is urging aquariums across the country to free their whales. “The sounds bounce back from the walls of the tank.”SeaWorld aggressively refuted many of the film's claims, including allegations that its whales were unhealthy and that the company tried to cover up details surrounding the 2010 death of trainer Dawn Brancheau, who was mauled by an orca. After the release of ""Blackfish,"" SeaWorld saw a rapid decline in visitors, and with that, in the price of shares. But on Monday, Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock, optimistic that the company can retool its image as consumers start forgetting about the blockbuster documentary.""Jane Goodall is a respected scientist and advocate for the world’s primates, but we couldn’t disagree more with her on this,"" Becca Bides, a SeaWorld spokeswoman, said in an emailed statement. ""Zoos and marine mammal parks like SeaWorld allow people to experience animals in a way that is inspiring and educational.""Asked about the allegation that SeaWorld's tanks are detrimental to whales, Bides denied the claim, arguing that they are specially crafted to keep underwater noise levels quieter than the ambient ocean.As of last December, SeaWorld held 22 orcas in its three U.S. marine parks, five of which were caught in the wild, according to the nonprofit advocacy group Whale and Dolphin Conservation. A total of 57 orcas are held in captivity around the world, the group notes. At least 160 orcas have died in captivity since 1961, and an additional 30 pregnant whales have miscarried or had stillborn calves.Goodall said she remains hopeful that humans are gaining a greater sense of empathy for animals and losing interest in watching them perform for entertainment.“It’s not only that they’re really big, highly intelligent and social animals so that the capture and confinement in itself is cruel,” she said of the captive orcas, but also that “they have emotions like ours.”She welcomed the decision by Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus to eliminate elephants in its shows by 2018.“If you see what happens to those baby elephants, the way they’re trained, it’s absolutely chilling,” said Goodall, who had a pendant in the shape of Africa hanging from her necklace. “They lose all of their young elephant playfulness, and then they can be trained.”"

Her voice needs to be heard. The creativity of her hands need to be seen. Say hello to Nadeesha.  1. Tell Me Your Story! My name is Nadeesha Godamunne, I'm a 27 year old illustrator originally from Sri Lanka. I grew up in New Zealand, and ever since I could remember, was surrounded by art supplies. My mother was a preschool teacher and knew I had a natural talent for drawing. I drew before I could write, it was the fastest way of communicating, and the most enjoyable. Naturally, my parents kept me occupied with copious amounts of coloring books, Crayola packs and extra curricular art lessons. I was fortunate enough to have had all the tools needed to excel.I continued to excel in the arts during high school, and took as many art related subjects as I could; graphic design, painting and art design. Though drawing was a natural part of my being, I never considered it a viable career path. It was a skill I valued, but also something I did for fun. I knew I wanted to work in the creative field, but drawing as a profession made me nervous. Its not the 80s anymore, where illustrations grace the covers of magazines and newspapers, in fact illustration today isn't the most favored form of communication, photography dominates. I went on to do fashion design for my college degree at the Auckland University of Technology. It was another form of expression. Though I enjoyed the design process of draping, patternmaking and sewing, I kept returning to drawing, and concluded my final year with a collection that featured hand drawn garments digitally printed on shift dresses, giving the illusion of many layers of clothes. The collection won multiple prizes, including the Mittelmoda award, which allowed me to showcase in Gorizia, Italy. The Trompe L'oeil aspect certainly rekindled my love for drawing, and opened up another avenue for textile design. My mentor Linda Jones, encouraged me to pursue my Masters in illustration. It was a bizarre concept that seemed almost too self-indulgent. Two years later, I completed my postgraduate studies, and realized that drawing was my life, and there was no going back. I was fortunate enough to have then been approached to teach fashion illustration to freshmans at the Auckland University of Technology. I did this for two years and subsequently relocated to San Francisco where I instructed at the Academy of Art University, teaching along one of my greatest inspirations, Gladys Perint Palmer. Teaching opened my eyes to the lack of visual literacy today, so giving students the confidence and ability to communicate their ideas was rewarding.I continue to collaborate with designers and editors to push forward the potential of fashion illustration. There is definitely a resurgence today, which is uplifting.  2. What is the meaning of Mokshini? Why did you decide to name your brand this? Mokshini is my first name, and Nadeesha, my second. Though I've always been called Nadeesha, I felt it was time to nurture more of my 'true' identity. The name change has also allowed me to shift gears and think of my self as a brand, not just a freelance illustrator.3. That is so dope to see yourself as art! Your art is very inspired by street style. Would you consider yourself a fashionista? The term 'Fashionista' gets tossed around a lot, so I will instead say that I appreciate beautifully made clothes. The feel, drape and construction of a well-made garment are exciting to me and inspire me to draw. As a fashion illustrator one should hope I love clothes and have a keen eye for it. Taking pride in my appearance, experimenting, and expressing myself through attire, is part of my job.  4. How is your work compatible with your personal style? Clothes are definitely an extension of my personality, and like wise my work. I dress according to how I feel. Some days I'm flirty and girly, and play with color and print, other days, I feel dark and grungy, and sport leather and black. I enjoy serendipity, so am definitely not a planner. I'm the same way when drawing. I experiment with certain styles and mediums depending on the way I feel, and try not to let the things around me dictate me. In both the way I dress and draw being bold, confident, expressive, and quirky are common denominators.5. Who are your true inspirations? My mother, who is a large part of why I'm doing what I'm doing. She has always influenced and supported my yearning to draw. My mentors, from college, who continue to give me feedback and critique, and of course the great masters themselves (both traditional artists and contemporary fashion illustrators). Kenneth Paul Block, Rene Gruau, Egon Shiele, Toulouse Lautrec and Gladys Perint Palmer are a few that have influenced my body of work. I have a pin board of many of these figures drawing in their studios, a constant reminder to keep pursuing and excelling.  6. AfroPunk recently picked up your work and features it weekly? How has its large readership affected your work? How did you get involved with the AfroPunk community? The response has been extremely positive; I've been receiving a lot of praise and appreciation for my art and what I do. When I illustrate a person, I feed off their energy, more so than the photograph itself, their demeanour and character is what I try to capture, not so much a likeliness. I think this interpretation is what people find captivating. The fact they are 'real' people off the streets of NYC, makes the work instantly relatable also. More importantly, there is a strong cultural element. Drawing beautiful black men and women, and capturing how they express their identity through dress, is alluring. From striking jewellery to colourful prints, its certainly been fun to illustrate. How I got involved was by reaching out to AfroPunk, who after hearing my story was interested in doing a write-up. What was a feature soon became a weekly instalment after I pitched the idea. It's been a great platform.  7. Humans of New York are certainly super spectacles! However, will you consider expanding your work to other major cities with an immense fashion scene? If so, which cities? Certainly! This is a major goal of mine. I see my tag line 'New Eyes- New York' evolving to say, 'New Eyes- London' or Milan, or Paris; the major fashion capitals. I envision Mokshini evolving into a brand, where I collaborate with photographers from around the globe to capture characters I could illustrate. At its core, the drawings not only aim to capture fashionable people from different geographic locations, but also the zeitgeist in each of these countries.  8. Where do you see yourself in the next five years? I see myself working independently, growing Mokshini, and expanding my network of supporters. It is one thing to be a freelance illustrator, and another to create a brand, where the work comes to you. I envision a collection of prints and textiles for merchandise, and collaborations with leading brands, fashion houses and retail stores.To view more of Nadeesha's work visit: MOKSHINI.com"

Several Baltimore police officers have been suspended after an African American man died of spinal cord injuries in police custody, police said, pledging to thoroughly investigate the incident. AFP PHOTO/JIM WATSON (Photo credit should read JIM WATSON/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f4052200004301dd84a2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Three events in the week beginning April 20, 2015, show convincingly that the American promise of national and global societal justice is a lie. They specifically show that in this new American century, one's economic status, access to power, and place of birth determine one's access to human rights and equal protection under the law. Any illusions to the contrary are just that.The separating of people into groups in which the privileged few look at the disadvantaged other is a byproduct of the extreme nationalism of the modern nation state. The United States has the unique status of being able to apply this ""othering"" to not only the underclass in its own society but also around the globe is due to its position as the world's only superpower.This week has been particularly noxious in terms of showing the intrinsic injustice in the American system, both on a foreign and domestic scale. In truth, any week of the past few decades could. To show the scope and scale of this week's object lessons, we'll forgo chronological order and instead focus on the events broadly to narrowly, from global to local.Globally:This week the president took the unprecedented step of confirming publicly that his administration's drone program was responsible for the deaths of two Al Qaeda hostages. One, Warren Weinstein, was a U.S. national, and the other, Giovanni Lo Porto, was Italian. The president expressed great sorrow at the loss of innocent life and gave his personal condolences to the men's families. A visibly distraught Obama went a step further and took direct responsibility for the loss of innocent life.Contrast that attitude with the administration's words on innocent civilians who are not western nationals and you'll find a very different take. When the administration acknowledges that its attacks kill innocent civilians, those victims are not given the courtesy of being named or even counted. They are, instead, referred to abstractly and their deaths are seen as at most a ""regrettable"" cost of the war on terror. No public official holds a press conference to admit culpability in their deaths. No public official expresses personal, individualized regret, when they express regret at all.Nationally:David Petraeus was sentenced for his role in leaking sensitive documents to his lover for her laudatory biography of him. Given the sentences handed down to such leakers as Chelsea Manning and John Kiriakou, one might expect Petraeus to face some jail time and sever curtailment of his movement. Instead, of course, Petraeus was sentenced to two years of probation and a fine of 100,000 dollars. The probation will not stop his freedom to travel across the country to give speeches, where he will earn more than the cost of his fine and then some for one such stop.This isn't surprising to anyone who has paid any attention to the politicization of the prosecutions of Manning and Kiriakou versus the prosecution of Petraeus. For the former, their actions are seen as ""treason"" and their prosecutions are met with at best a stony silence. For the latter, after being publicly outed as a philandering leaker of documents for self-aggrandizement, his prosecution is deemed ""suffered enough"" and he is welcomed back to the White House in an advisory role less than two years after resigning in disgrace from the CIA, and while his trial was ongoing.Locally:It seems that being the son of a prominent Washington politician gives you a license to abuse the police arresting you in ways that have demonstrably led to death for young men of color in similar situations. Rand Paul's son William discovered this on Sunday morning, April 19, when he was cited -- not arrested -- for DUI. The younger Paul's behavior was described as ""belligerent."" In spite of that fact, William Paul was released from hospital and not held by the police.Contrast that arrest with the arrest and subsequent death in police custody of Freddy Gray of Baltimore, Maryland. Four hours before William Paul was cited, Freddie Gray died in a Baltimore area hospital from complications from a spinal column fracture that happened at some point while in police custody. Gray's crime, almost a week prior to his death, was running away from a police detail in a Baltimore neighborhood looking for drug dealers. Somehow, during his arrest and booking, his spinal cord was broken and he was injured severely enough to kill him less than seven days later. Contrast that with the treatment of the ""belligerent"" Mr. Paul, who was cited and released with no bodily injury.The three examples given here expose the corrupt injustice at the heart of American society. On a global level, the idea of the importance and uniqueness of life being exclusive to the U.S. and her allies leads to the non-western victims of drone warfare being described in broad terms that rob them of autonomy and individual identity. On the national level, those with access to the high reaches of power and influence in the government get a fraction of the punishment for crimes their lesser connected counterparts can lose years of their lives to. And this bleeds down to the local level, where the same institution that kills a Baltimore man in the course of arresting him for running away frees the rich son of a politician for an actual crime.The relentless ""othering"" of the global, national, and local underclass by those in power has consequences. These consequences are obvious this week. Victims of international aggression are only acknowledged as people when they are Western nationals. Architects of policy have rights and privileges those who expose the abuses in the policy do not. A member of the American political aristocracy is treated deferentially for his crime by the institution that kills a poor black man of a similar age for no crime at all.If America wants to present itself as the arbiter of human rights, justice, and upward mobility around the globe and at home -- as its leaders constantly assert they do -- then societal change is needed, desperately. This week has thrown that fact into stark relief."

For half the world every day is malaria day -- a day to keep up the fight against this killer disease. [1]Invest in the Future, Defeat Malaria has been the theme from 2013-2015, and this aims to encourage more individuals, organizations and even nations to do more to support the fight against Malaria.Today's guest, Dr Fatoumata Nafo-Traore is the Executive Director of the Roll Back Malaria Partnership. She has more than 25 years of experience in public health, both in her native country Mali and at the international level.In today's stroll we talk about the Roll Back Malaria Partnership; its successes, losses and goals. Dr Fatoumata also told me a bit about what growing up was like for her. Here's my stroll with Dr Nafo-Traore, I hope it inspires you to join the fight against malaria.Ebenezar: Hello Dr Fatoumata, it's a pleasure having you on the Stroll.Fatoumata: I am delighted to be strolling with you EbenezarEbenezar: What led to the formation of the RBM partnership initiated?Fatoumata: The RBM Partnership was initiated in response to a call from countries in the late 1990s when malaria was killing a child every 30 seconds, and endemic countries were really suffering economically, and socially. Malaria is preventable and treatable, but it is a deadly disease caused by the bite of mosquito. At that time existing treatments were failing due to drug resistance, nets were not available or they were ineffective and more than a million people were dying every year from malaria, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.The World Health Organization got together with UNICEF, the WORLD BANK and UNDP -- and the Roll Back Malaria movement was launched -- to ramp up malaria control worldwide and try and reduce the terrible burden on malaria endemic countries. A little later on it became a public /private partnership which brought together over 500 agencies and organizations involved in fighting malaria, and helped to provide coordination towards an agreed set of goals and targets.Ebenezar: Between when it was founded and now, how much malaria have we rolled back?Fatoumata: We have come half the distance with half the funds! This is tremendous progress -- but we still have a long way to go. Malaria deaths have nearly halved worldwide, and in Africa by nearly 55 percent. As a result, since 2001, more than 4 million lives have been saved, and most of these are the lives of young children -- our precious resource, our future. This has been achieved because of political commitment, new effective prevention and treatment tools, better coordination and increased funding.Ebenezar: That's really interesting. So what are some challenges facing the RBM Partnership, and what are some ways these challenges can be combated?Fatoumata: The challenges facing the RBM Partnership are many and various. This year the Millennium Development Goals come to an end and new Sustainable Development Goals will drive the agenda in the future. Essentially these new targets cannot be achieved if we do not succeed in eliminating malaria. To do this we will need new tools, more investment both internationally and nationally from endemic countries.The Partnership is looking closely at what this will take, in the way we are organized, our structures and how we move forward. What is clear is that malaria countries and communities have gained much from the last 15 years of collective efforts and we must continue to prioritize their needs, and ensure we do not derail progress and allow malaria to resurge while we rethink our architecture. I believe in the old adage "" if it ain't broke, don't fix it "" .....we must build on the progress we have made , a lot of the groundwork has already been done, but we need to reorient our efforts to achieve the new 2030 goals.Ebenezar: How can regular citizens of the world, like me, join this fight against malaria?Fatoumata: Ebenezar, regular citizens like you can lobby their governments, and ask them to maintain their contribution to overseas development to tackle diseases like malaria, which will reduce poverty and bring stability and security to millions of people around the world. People like you can be great advocates, activists and join forces with local NGOs or charities in your countries to make the case for a malaria-free future. To commemorate this 2015 World Malaria Day there are dozens of social-media campaigns running throughout the month of April -- they are gathering momentum.Ebenezar: Just as you've mentioned, April 25 is World Malaria Day, and the theme for the past 2 years has been, ""Invest in the Future, Defeat Malaria."" Often times I've wondered about the impact many of these campaigns we start at the UN have around the world. How will you rate this particular campaign which has been on for about 2 years; do you think it has achieved the desired result?Fatoumata: This World Malaria Day campaign, Invest in the Future, Defeat Malaria was the first three-year theme ever, and was particularly pertinent for the last three years of the MDGS. As I said before, we are entering a new era of development priorities; malaria is included but now there are many additional priorities which also need to be addressed. As more countries set their sights on malaria elimination it will take more targeted programs and therefore more targeted investments.Fatoumata: This campaign has put a spotlight on malaria and health when people were discussing new goals ; I believe it has helped to keep malaria on peoples radar, especially those decision makers and high level thought-leaders who influence global agendas. One should never underestimate the power of suggestion, of repeated briefings, of continued debate and advocacy; it shapes consensus and outcomes. The UN is about uniting nations. If you see how many people are referencing this theme ...it probably runs into millions ! That's a result ! Ebenezar: So let's talk a bit about you now. What was growing up like for you? You grew up in Mali right?  Fatoumata: Yes I did . Growing in malaria endemic country at that time wasn't easy. Like most kids I suffered from malaria at least once a year. This was a reality we all faced. But I was among the luckiest, I survived, I was able to benefit from my education, I was healthy. Later on I was also privileged to visit all the districts in my country as a medical doctor and witnessed the impact of malaria on all our communities. I became well acquainted with the imperative of providing good community health services -- and malaria prevention and treatment close to the home.Ebenezar : You also grew up at a period when the African Continent wasn't so big on women's rights and girls education. How were you able to grow through that to become the global figure you are right now?Fatoumata : Sadly some or many countries still lag behind in a big way on women's rights and girls education. As I said I was lucky enough to have a family that valued girls education, so I had the opportunity to go to school, be further educated abroad and work for International Organization such as the World Bank and the World Health Organization. I had a chance in my career to work with great leaders who valued my work and talent, supported and coached me. We have a responsibility to promote youth, to promote and support girls; we have to trust and empower them and give them enough room to practice, get experiences and lead. They are the leaders of tomorrow and deserve our respect and recognition. (Left to Right: the Chairperson of the AU Commission Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon, Dr. Fatoumata Nafo-Troare, Executive Director of Roll Back Malaria Partnership, and President John Mahama)Ebenezar: What factors influenced your decision to become a Medical doctor?Fatoumata: I lost my mother when I was six. I still have the image of her in a hospital bed. That was more than enough for me to decide to dedicate my life to saving lives and to caring for those who need it most. In addition to my official work I am member of the Lion's Club and many associations and charities.Ebenezar: Okay, finally, Mr Bill Gates and UNSG Ban Ki Moon are really hopeful that same way polio was stopped; someday malaria will be totally eradicated from Earth. Do you think we'll see this happen in our lifetime?Fatoumata: The RBM partnership vision is a ""malaria free world"" . We are all really hopeful that malaria will be eradicated totally from the earth -- and why not in our lifetime ? With the right tools, the right actions, sufficient financial investment, great political will and huge community involvement it is doable.Ebenezar: Thank you so much, once more for your time, ma. I wish you all the best with RBM, and your other projects.Fatoumata: Thank you Ebenezar. I will look for you on Twitter. Don't forget to visit us on www.rollbackmalaria.orgEbenezar: I wouldn't forget. Thank you ma, and I will sure follow back on Twitter. _______________________Food for the Soul: ""You were in serious trouble, but you prayed to the LORD and he rescued you.

One should never underestimate the power of suggestion, of repeated briefings, of continued debate and advocacy; it shapes consensus and outcomes. The UN is about uniting nations. If you see how many people are referencing this theme ...it probably runs into millions ! That's a result ! Ebenezar: So let's talk a bit about you now. What was growing up like for you? You grew up in Mali right?  Fatoumata: Yes I did . Growing in malaria endemic country at that time wasn't easy. Like most kids I suffered from malaria at least once a year. This was a reality we all faced. But I was among the luckiest, I survived, I was able to benefit from my education, I was healthy. Later on I was also privileged to visit all the districts in my country as a medical doctor and witnessed the impact of malaria on all our communities. I became well acquainted with the imperative of providing good community health services -- and malaria prevention and treatment close to the home.Ebenezar : You also grew up at a period when the African Continent wasn't so big on women's rights and girls education. How were you able to grow through that to become the global figure you are right now?Fatoumata : Sadly some or many countries still lag behind in a big way on women's rights and girls education. As I said I was lucky enough to have a family that valued girls education, so I had the opportunity to go to school, be further educated abroad and work for International Organization such as the World Bank and the World Health Organization. I had a chance in my career to work with great leaders who valued my work and talent, supported and coached me. We have a responsibility to promote youth, to promote and support girls; we have to trust and empower them and give them enough room to practice, get experiences and lead. They are the leaders of tomorrow and deserve our respect and recognition. (Left to Right: the Chairperson of the AU Commission Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon, Dr. Fatoumata Nafo-Troare, Executive Director of Roll Back Malaria Partnership, and President John Mahama)Ebenezar: What factors influenced your decision to become a Medical doctor?Fatoumata: I lost my mother when I was six. I still have the image of her in a hospital bed. That was more than enough for me to decide to dedicate my life to saving lives and to caring for those who need it most. In addition to my official work I am member of the Lion's Club and many associations and charities.Ebenezar: Okay, finally, Mr Bill Gates and UNSG Ban Ki Moon are really hopeful that same way polio was stopped; someday malaria will be totally eradicated from Earth. Do you think we'll see this happen in our lifetime?Fatoumata: The RBM partnership vision is a ""malaria free world"" . We are all really hopeful that malaria will be eradicated totally from the earth -- and why not in our lifetime ? With the right tools, the right actions, sufficient financial investment, great political will and huge community involvement it is doable.Ebenezar: Thank you so much, once more for your time, ma. I wish you all the best with RBM, and your other projects.Fatoumata: Thank you Ebenezar. I will look for you on Twitter.

Follow Candice on Instagram and Twitter @candicekp and on Facebook at facebook.com/candicepattonCandice is a talker! Her meaty answers forced me to break this up into a two-parter. I must say, if I'm going to be forced into something, I'm glad it was by Candice! How do you like that pic she took just for this interview?!So many words I don't even have room for more intro. Be sure to watch for Part II where Candice discusses Rizzoli & Isles and The Flash fanfiction!Tell us about your audition for The Flash.My first audition was in December 2013 for the role of Iris West. I first read with our amazing casting director David Rapport. He liked my audition and asked me to come back later in the day with a different shirt. (I was wearing a plaid blue shirt and I guess I looked like too much like a farm girl). I read later that day for David Nutter (the director) and a few producers, I believe. I bombed. I forgot a line, something about ""Channing Tatum"" and had to start over. From that point, nerves took over. That was the end of it as far as I knew and I was pretty bummed about it.I didn't hear back until late January 2014. They wanted me to come back in and read with Grant Gustin. I remember seeing Jordin Sparks in waiting room. In the audition during my first reading with Grant I remember I tickled him. I don't know why I did, but I just had the urge to tickle him.I read for the studio, then the network and remember being sick to my stomach with nerves before the last audition. Hours went by, I didn't hear anything. Then I had to go audition for another pilot. Still hours went by and didn't hear anything. Then, after not hearing anything all day, I was started thinking it was over again. Finally, the call came in from my managers. It was around 6pm on a Friday. I fell to my knees and the first call I made after that was to my parents.Is it nerve wracking never knowing where your next paycheck is coming from? What odd jobs did you hold in between roles?Luckily I didn't have many ""day jobs"" while trying to find success in Los Angeles. When I first moved to LA, I worked at Bubba Gump Restaurant for about two days. I didn't even make it through training before I quit. I just didn't care to memorize all the different types of shrimp.I also worked at Pink Berry. I lasted there a bit longer. Maybe a year. Maybe less. One day I finally left and decided I would try to make ends meet solely on acting. I worked steadily guest starring and doing commercials and I lived meagerly off of residuals for years.  What's the rundown of your day on The Flash set?I find out the day before sometimes pretty late what my call time is for the next day. I know what time I'll be at work, but I don't know how long I will be there. It depends on how many scenes I'm shooting that day, how complicated the scenes are, how fast the director works, etc.I self-drive to set. First stop when I'm on set is my trailer. I like to set my stuff down, and lock the door. Be in my own space for a few minutes. Answer some fan mail, set the lighting just right, turn on my fireplace (it's cold in Canada). Then I'm off to hair and makeup.I usually stay away from Craft Services (food), so I'm not picking. If I'm hungry between meal times, I will have someone go get something for me from Craft Services (my usual: veggie plate - cucumbers, grape tomatoes, bell peppers, carrots, snap peas, avocado and hummus. Having someone get my usual go to healthy snacks keeps me from lingering around the crafty table and picking up that cinnamon roll I really want, but don't need.I learn my lines in a few different ways. A lot of my dialogue sticks with me in a general sort of way when I read the entire script for the first or second time. Then when I get the shooting schedule I have a better idea of what scenes are shooting when. I then will focus on those that are coming up first. I don't worry too much about learning lines per se. The memorization is the easy part for me, usually. For me it more about working on the context, back story, intention, motivation, etc. Once that's in place, the lines come pretty naturally.What's the difference between shooting in Vancouver vs. Los Angeles?Difference between shooting in LA and Vancouver is mostly the weather. It rains a lot here and it's cold. We aren't put up in a hotel in Vancouver. We've essentially moved to Vancouver because we shoot nine months out of the year. July - April. I visit LA very often, however. Whenever I get a few days off. Honestly, it keeps me happy and sane. At the end of the day, I'm a California girl and I miss it all the time. Sunshine, and good vibes. It's hard traveling back and forth all the time, going through customs, having different sim cards for phones, using different currencies, not having access to reasonably priced wine :) . The list goes on. Vancouver is work, California is home. But, I am grateful for what both provide me.Who have you brought to visit the set of The Flash?Only my parents have visited set! They came to set for one day, and I don't know if they enjoyed it because I think they kept feeling like they were in the way. Maybe during season two they will feel more comfortable eating from catering and crafty and walking around set.I introduced them to the cast and and some of the crew, had them watch a scene during one of the crossover episodes with Arrow cast. I think they were surprised and maybe even bored by how long it takes to shoot one scene. I would love for more friends and family to visit, but again, I'm in Vancouver, and it's somewhat of an expense to get here.You recently did some work for Maxim. What made you say 'yes' to that offer?Maxim reached out to me. At first I wasn't sure about doing it, but my manager made a good case for it. My reasons for turning it down were based more in fear than anything else, and I decided that wasn't a good enough reason to not do things anymore. As long as the photos were classy and sexy at the same time, I shouldn't let fear stop me. And hey, I figured, I will never be this young and look like this ever again.As someone who usually hates photo shoots (I can be obnoxiously critical of myself), I am really glad I did it! It was my first magazine feature and it was top to bottom an awesome day and shoot in Malibu. I was very happy with the outcome and I hope I get to do it again.Be sure to read Part II of Candice Patton, coming soon!"

The first set of strikes (which also remains the least confirmed) targeted a Hezbollah weapons convoy traveling in the border area on April 22, hitting at least three trucks and killing at least one commander. The second set of strikes occurred during the overnight hours of April 24-25, and are believed to have hit at least three targets in heavily militarized areas of eastern Qalamoun, north of Damascus, which host some of the Assad regime's most loyal and well-equipped units. The units hit include the 155th Scud missile brigade which has bases near the Damascus suburb al-Qutayfa, and the 65th Armored Brigade in areas around the Qalamoun town of Yabroud. In total, claims by Syrian rebels and foreign media outlets suggest that this set of strikes included at least three targets throughout the Qalamoun region, killing a number of Syrian and Hezbollah troops.These latest airstrikes constitute (approximately) the eighth such actions attributed to Israel since 2013, and at first glance, underscore a continued Israeli policy of preventing 'game-changing weapons' from reaching Hezbollah's bunkers inside Lebanon. In the past, these strikes have targeted anti-aircraft missiles, advanced Yakhont anti-ship missiles, and long range surface-to-surface missiles, with last night's attacks likely aimed at targeting Scud B or Scud D missiles from being transferred to Hezbollah.That said, these strikes are the first of their kind to occur after several key local and regional developments, mainly the launching of Saudi-led intervention against Iranian proxies in Yemen, significant losses by the Assad regime in northern and southern Syria, and Hezbollah's January 2015 announcement that the ""rules of the game"" with Israel had changed. Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah made that announcement after Hezbollah attacked an Israeli military convoy in broad daylight, from Lebanese territory, in which Israel refrained from retaliating. Nasrallah claimed that the attack was an 'eye-for-an-eye' styled response to an Israeli attack on a Hezbollah-Iranian command convoy in the Golan Heights on January 18th. Israel's hesitancy to respond was hailed by the group as a testament to its regional stature, and had left many wondering how Hezbollah would respond to future Israeli attacks against its interests in Syria.Israel's alleged airstrikes this week pose a major challenge to the regional deterrence of the Iranian axis, particularly as an emboldened Saudi Arabia increasingly hints at intervening in Syria. Unlike past attacks, Hezbollah and the Assad regime have refrained from making public threats or even confirming that the strikes took place. On the one hand, this silence may signal that Nasrallah and Assad seek to refrain from committing to retaliation against Israel and risking an escalation. However, it is more likely that they do seek to retaliate against Israel in some way, shape, or form, reserving the right to claim responsibility at a time which suites them, and reduces the risk of a massive Israeli response.Israel's likely has a clear understanding of the stakes in this particularly dangerous game. The Israeli military has been anticipating and preparing for a major conflict with Hezbollah, including preparing its home front to sustain more than 1,000 rocket attacks a day, targeting cities nationwide. Such a conflict would either come as a result of a rapid and unexpected escalation of a localized incident, such as an Israeli airstrike in Syria or a border skirmish, or a calculated aggression by Hezbollah that is endorsed by its Iranian patrons. Such a calculated move would likely aim to suck Israel into the Syrian conflict, should the Assad regime come under attack from the Saudi-led Sunni axis, or lose significant territory in Damascus and the Alawite coastal region to Syrian rebels. While Israel has publicly abstained from taking sides in the Syrian conflict, it has tacitly supported some Syrian rebel groups together with Jordan, and Iran and Hezbollah openly allege Israel of siding with their Sunni rivals.In the coming weeks and months, it can be assumed that Israel will continue preventing weapons transfers to Hezbollah, even at the risk of a major escalation. For its part, Iran and Hezbollah seem willing to drag Israel into the Syrian conflict or into a new war in Lebanon, should it become clear that their key interests in the region have been compromised."

Johnson, ""The Eden Project: In Search of the Magical Other"" by James Hollis and ""Consuming the Romantic Utopia"" by Eva Illouz. To reconstruct romantic love I often recommend ""Journey of the Heart: The Path of Conscious Love"" by John Wellwood, ""Intimacy: Trusting Oneself and the Other"" by Osho, and ""Marriage as the Path to Wholeness"" by Harville Hendrix.Esther Perel commands a much more expansive breadth of knowledge regarding relationships than anyone I have ever read, her insights are blistering, and the manner in which she has aggregated the academic literature and assimilated her clinical observations is nothing short of genius. Ms. Perel's primary gift lies in unearthing apparent paradoxes and this is embodied by her own confident yet humble and respectful presentation style. She does not quote scientific studies; rather she changes the playing field and provides provocatively fresh perspectives on relationship dynamics. Some of the paradoxes she explores are our needs and desires for both safety and adventure, security and freedom, and reality and fantasy. She destroys assumptions about sex and intimacy, monogamy and infidelity, and gives an updated understanding of attachment styles. Anthropologically she observes that the shift during the Industrial Revolution from village to city life caused the burden of selfhood to shift from the tribe to the individual. Just as Sartre posited that we are ""confronted"" by our relatively new freedoms, Ms. Perel notes that contemporary urban life places the onus on the individual to decide ""how much we eat, sleep, work, and fuck.""Ms. Perel is most widely known for her work on infidelity which she reframes as ""a desire to feel alive;"" she claims that the majority of people who stray from their marriages have been faced with their own mortality in some way during the preceding three years and their affairs function as temporary antidotes against their own certain demises. In her renowned TEDtalk, Ms. Perel examines the putative incompatibility of eros and marriage by rhetorically asking, ""How can you desire what you already have?""Ms. Perel is aghast that twenty or thirty year-old marriages can be annihilated by a single transgression stating (unfortunately) that in our culture ""divorce offers more dignity than forgiveness."" Wryly she adds that infidelity is the only transgression that merits two of the ten commandments. In session, Ms. Perel asks patients thought-provoking questions such as ""What do you seek to express through sex? Connection? Contained aggression? Spiritual intimacy?"" Most poignantly, she reframes monogamy as ""a gift - something you give to your partner.""Esther Perel represents the vanguard of the conversation that we need to be having about relationships. She claims not to have answers, which is refreshing; however, her questions are unparalleled. Her enlightening reframing and reconceptualizing of relationship dynamics will help the rest of us transcend the dying white, patriarchal, capitalistic, consumeristic, Judeo-Christian paradigm of monogamous marriage for life to the next paradigm, whatever that may be.If you are interested in the future of healthy loving intimate relationships and have the opportunity to attend one of Esther Perel's vibrant upcoming talks don't miss it!

Within a year, Richard Nixon visited Mao Zedong in Beijing, the Shanghai Communiqué was signed, and the process of normalizing Sino-America relations began. Since then, most scholars and analysts have considered Nixon's opening to China to be a resounding foreign policy success. In the midst of the Cold War, it successfully exploited existing divisions within the communist bloc and improved the U.S. strategic position vis-à-vis the USSR. Rather than three powerful states existing in isolation of one another, it was now 2 against 1: the U.S. and China vs. the USSR.  At the time, however, Nixon's policy did not come without criticism. Mao Zedong's brand of communism along with his brutal implementation of a ""cultural revolution,"" made him an improbable target for U.S. policymakers looking for diplomatic partners. Given the importance of the ""democracy and capitalism"" narrative of the Cold War, trading the recognition of the old Kuomintang government in Taiwan for the Communist Party state in the mainland was a contentious move. Yet, Nixon and Kissinger looked beyond ideology to open dialogue for strategic purposes.  Today, the U.S. is on the other end of an opening.  American and European statesmen are currently boycotting, sanctioning, condemning, and isolating Russia as punishment for its Ukraine policy. In the way that the U.S. picked off China after recognizing the Sino-Soviet split, China is now picking off Russia given the American-Russian split. The Ukraine crisis indirectly created an opportunity for China to expand a ""strategic partnership"" with Russia as the only major power not taking part in the sanctions regime. This is not to say that Russia and China had no diplomatic relations prior to the Ukraine crisis; rather, that Western policy toward Russia is creating an opening that China can easily exploit. As far as Russia policy goes, the further the West goes, the closer China comes.  While it is easy to criticize China's noninterference policy and neutrality on Ukraine, it is not significantly different from Nixon and Kissinger's decision to look beyond ideology in the 1970s. Pursuing a tangible national interest over ideological considerations, China has been able to deepen economic ties with Russia to ease the impact of Western sanctions. To address its growing energy needs, China is working on a second pipeline project with Russia to import much-needed natural resources. And next month, Xi Jinping will be the guest of honor at Russia's WWII commemorative parade, which American and European leaders plan to boycott.  China's strategic opening should come as no surprise to the U.S. There remain significant differences between Russia and China but the more Washington pushes and pivots, the closer Moscow and Beijing will become. Rather than continually isolating Russia over its actions in Ukraine and denouncing China for remaining neutral, the U.S. would be best served to once again cast off ideologically motivated policy in favor of real politik. ​"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4b4aa250000320039095c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When my son turned four he went on a serious superhero kick. One lazy day, I decided to see if I could find some episodes of Batman streaming online. Well, luckily I previewed the show, because it opened with someone being shot dead in a convenience store with a machine gun. Not quite age appropriate for my son. Or for me for that matter. The superhero show of my youth was Super Friends, where the extent of the violence was tricking someone to slip on a banana peel. This show seemed a bit more age-appropriate for my four-year old, so I ordered ""The All-New Super Friends Hour.""Not only is the show relatively violence-free, it is also chock-full of helpful life lessons. In fact, dare I say it? Pretty much everything you need to know you can learn from Super Friends. To wit:1. Surround yourself with friends who challenge you. The Super Friends fit so well together because they each have their own strengths. Need to summon sea creatures? Aquaman is your guy. Need something lassoed? Call in Wonder Woman. Need anything done that doesn't involve water or a lasso? Well, Super Man. He's a bit of an overachiever that one. Outside the hallowed walls of the Halls of Justice, you should also strive to surround yourself with people who challenge you to be better and who have strengths and interests different than your own.2. Take time away from work to do something you love.No matter how busy the Super Friends are, in every episode they manage to take a break for a fun craft or magic trick and a little brain teaser. If people who literally have to save the world for their jobs can take a break, so can you.3. Don't be afraid to laugh at your own jokes. In the episode ""The Whirlpool,"" a ship captain goes mad with power trying to break a speed record, which ends up nearly costing his life and the lives of his crew. A sad but all-too-common state of affairs in the '70s, apparently. After the Super Friends save the day, the captain laments that he will probably lose his license. Aquaman says ""You certainly came close to establishing a speed record,"" to which Black Vulcan adds ""Right to the bottom of the ocean."" Everyone stares at each other awkwardly for a moment and then the Super Friends laugh and laugh and the captain joins in. Potentially awkward moment is broken and levity ensues. It works in the real world too. Give it a try.4. Invest in flattering clothes. Because, Wonder Woman. And also Aquaman. Rrowr.5. It never hurts to ask. There are so many times on Super Friends when a whole lot of trouble could have been avoided if someone had just asked for help in the first place. Need a vacation? Don't stow away on a ship, just ask to come aboard! Need hundreds of tons of bedrock? Don't steal it from the earth's core, just ask someone who is capable of flying into space and retrieving some for you! No harm in asking, and you may just get what you need.6. Pets are a lot of work, but worth it (most of the time). Gleek the space monkey is a total pain. He's always getting into trouble, touching things he's not supposed and just generally making a nuisance out of himself. But every once in a while he totally saves the day. Plus he looks super cute in his little cape. While our cats have yet to save the day or consent to wearing a cape, I know it's coming.7. Never steal someone's airplane, even just for a quick ride. Also don't stow away on a ship -- there might be a dangerous sea storm coming. And hitchhiking is bad. Also, when running a road race, don't shimmy across a rope hanging over a cavernous pit to cheat your way to first place. Apparently these were the biggest issues facing youth back in our day. (Perhaps this life lesson could also be called: Know your target audience.)8. Be careful what you name your children. If you name your kid Newton Domehead, you're probably going to end up with an evil scientist in the family.9. It will all work out, have faith. You may be miles down a bottomless pit and all may seem lost, but with the right tools, perseverance and a little help from your friends, you can find your way out again.This post originally appeared on RunKnitLove.

This is the spirit, but not the heart, of Tumbledown, a rare new movie that had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival last week.That heart is very much still in this world, and alive. Tumbledown, written by Desi Van Til, is the story of a young -- far too young -- widow, Hannah Miles (the beyond excellent Rebecca Hall). Her celebrated, reclusive singer-songwriter husband has died in a fall on Tumbledown Mountain, deep in the Maine woods near their home, and her hometown. She brought him here to escape flashbulbs and fans after his unnamed album of twelve folk songs becomes a sensation. Now she lives stunned, angry, yearning, determined and alone in the log house they shared, shunning society beyond family and girlhood friends and two large, entertaining, and protective boxer dogs.From this quiet premise spins out a tale of passion, wry humor, love, loss, and intelligence, more moving and memorable than movies are these days. Hunter Miles, in his retreat to the woods, shares a lot with Bob Dylan and The Band in Woodstock, circa 1967. In his beauty (we see only a few blurry photos of him; and one flashback of him in a Rick Danko hat, paddling a canoe), and his early, tragic death, he reminds us of Jeff Buckley, of Gram Parsons. But though this movie revolves round and about him, and his growing legend -- and the people who want to control his legend and legacy -- Miles is ultimately to be both praised, and buried.His widow is writing a biography of him. She fills her laptop with fragments, memories, hopes, conversations -- unfiltered, unedited, just as grief and love bring them to her mind and fingertips. Though we discover she has a Ph.D from Brown and has written one book of literary criticism (the dissertation, of course), the task of writing Hunter Miles is too much for her -- as it would be for many who try to resurrect or retain, in words, one they love. Enter Hofstra junior professor Andrew McCabe (Jason Sudeikis).Sudeikis is superb at showcasing both the young professor's genuine affection for Miles and his art, and his entirely unscrupulous smarminess in wanting an academic scoop. Like Tom Stoppard's perfect Bernard Nightingale, in Arcadia, Andrew will say and do anything in his hunt for more -- even after he putatively falls in love with Hannah (who perhaps not coincidentally shares a name with her counterpart in Arcadia). With a gesture, an eyebrow, by swallowing hard, Sudeikis conveys more debatability that other actors do with handwaving and many lines. My stomach clenched as he watches Hannah drive away to town, puts out the dogs who are watching him (humor that makes what he's doing all the worse), locks the door, and begins to systematically search her bedroom -- pausing over bullets in a fiddle case, an x-ray that literally shows him the inside of his hero's head. Again, when he tells Hannah that his father committed suicide, he seems less revelatory than dishonest and fishing. But that's the thing about Tumbledown. You just don't know -- though you sure as hell are made to think. And, increasingly, you like Hannah, and are warmly glad to feel Andrew standing in your shoes as he begins to, too. The cameos shine.

This is the spirit, but not the heart, of Tumbledown, a rare new movie that had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival last week.That heart is very much still in this world, and alive. Tumbledown, written by Desi Van Til, is the story of a young -- far too young -- widow, Hannah Miles (the beyond excellent Rebecca Hall). Her celebrated, reclusive singer-songwriter husband has died in a fall on Tumbledown Mountain, deep in the Maine woods near their home, and her hometown. She brought him here to escape flashbulbs and fans after his unnamed album of twelve folk songs becomes a sensation. Now she lives stunned, angry, yearning, determined and alone in the log house they shared, shunning society beyond family and girlhood friends and two large, entertaining, and protective boxer dogs.From this quiet premise spins out a tale of passion, wry humor, love, loss, and intelligence, more moving and memorable than movies are these days. Hunter Miles, in his retreat to the woods, shares a lot with Bob Dylan and The Band in Woodstock, circa 1967. In his beauty (we see only a few blurry photos of him; and one flashback of him in a Rick Danko hat, paddling a canoe), and his early, tragic death, he reminds us of Jeff Buckley, of Gram Parsons. But though this movie revolves round and about him, and his growing legend -- and the people who want to control his legend and legacy -- Miles is ultimately to be both praised, and buried.His widow is writing a biography of him. She fills her laptop with fragments, memories, hopes, conversations -- unfiltered, unedited, just as grief and love bring them to her mind and fingertips. Though we discover she has a Ph.D from Brown and has written one book of literary criticism (the dissertation, of course), the task of writing Hunter Miles is too much for her -- as it would be for many who try to resurrect or retain, in words, one they love. Enter Hofstra junior professor Andrew McCabe (Jason Sudeikis).Sudeikis is superb at showcasing both the young professor's genuine affection for Miles and his art, and his entirely unscrupulous smarminess in wanting an academic scoop. Like Tom Stoppard's perfect Bernard Nightingale, in Arcadia, Andrew will say and do anything in his hunt for more -- even after he putatively falls in love with Hannah (who perhaps not coincidentally shares a name with her counterpart in Arcadia). With a gesture, an eyebrow, by swallowing hard, Sudeikis conveys more debatability that other actors do with handwaving and many lines. My stomach clenched as he watches Hannah drive away to town, puts out the dogs who are watching him (humor that makes what he's doing all the worse), locks the door, and begins to systematically search her bedroom -- pausing over bullets in a fiddle case, an x-ray that literally shows him the inside of his hero's head. Again, when he tells Hannah that his father committed suicide, he seems less revelatory than dishonest and fishing. But that's the thing about Tumbledown. You just don't know -- though you sure as hell are made to think. And, increasingly, you like Hannah, and are warmly glad to feel Andrew standing in your shoes as he begins to, too. The cameos shine. Joe Manganiello is delightful, and hot, as the local large lineman for the -- appropriately -- power company. Blythe Danner, as Hannah's mother, rules the Easter lunch table with profane, loving brightness, missing Hunter and yet yearning for grandchildren. Griffin Dunne runs the local independent bookstore as well as the town newspaper; I wanted his job(s), and grinned at his David Beckham fetish.

I related to that truth in my own life's experience.",2015-04-27,2015-04-25-1429977465-6000455-dorianddougbrideshead.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-25-1429977465-6000455-dorianddougbrideshead-thumb.jpg,"It's ironic how we all tend to dislike labels or being labeled as anything. I've always shied away from labels because I've felt that they limit one by capping off the entirety of who we are. I've heard people utter that phrase, ""I hate labels"" so many times that I've often wondered what it is that people like about them in the first place. I've also noticed that, depending upon the area of discussion, some descriptives can seemingly go on ad infinitum; and with every nuance, a tag is applied so that others can identify us and relate.This holds especially true in the worlds of both sexuality and gender identification. Where once upon a time, our limited perception remained contained within an acceptable box of ignorant and close-minded thinking, now we are slowly but surely being introduced into the all-too-real knowledge that we are a multi-faceted species who can be defined in so many more ways than what the simple monikers of ""gay"" ""straight"" ""bi"" ""man"" or ""woman"" can cover.After seeing Bruce Jenner's outstanding interview last night with Diane Sawyer, I felt so tightly locked on to some of the things he said that I couldn't shake the feeling of pure truth in his words. I related to that truth in my own life's experience. He really made a great point describing how sexuality and gender identification are two different things, which explained how one could be a ""woman stuck in a man's body"" while still being attracted to women. So, being transgender has nothing to do with who you want to have sex with. Who you find sexually attractive is an entirely different thing than what you experience when you accept or reject the body you were born with. Jenner is attracted to women -- and apparently has loved women all his life.The courage of this person to come out like this is both brave and startling. While he is not the first, he is most certainly the first of this caliber -- being that he, in his most masculine incarnation won the Olympic Decathlon in 1976 and went down in history as the World's Greatest Athlete, not to mention one of the most sexually desirable men ever to grace our planet. This is a person who now has a lot of eyes on him -- and he is making a difference. The effects of this interview will be longstanding. Jenner is doing what he does best: He's taking the lead and going for gold, with a massive trail of inspired followers behind him, all shivering with awe and relief over the fact that someone is ""this"" courageous and true to themselves.And so, on the topic of labels, my feeling is that Jenner found his labels and they have both liberated him and allowed us to know how to think of his status. But what about us? Who are we? What are our labels? Some of us may relate full on to what Jenner is living through -- and then again, some of us may relate in ""ways"" but not identically. I relate... and Jenner's words sent me down the rabbit hole in search of the labels that would describe who I feel I am.Last week, I did myself a disservice -- and I paid for it. I wrote an article for YourTango on asexuality, but I posed the article in an odd way. Instead of coming clean and admitting that I was the asexual ""hero"" of the article, I metaphorically split in two, so that I could basically interview myself by playing the part of the judgmental, sexually active antagonist. At the time, I did it in order to show how asexuality is a real thing and I wanted to show an example of what intolerance and misunderstanding looked like. What I didn't realize is that I wrote it in fear. That is why I unconsciously wrote myself as the adversary -- because on some level, I feared being attacked for not being the cool, sexy sex freak that loves sex, sex and more cool sex. I feared having people tell me, ""Oh you just need to get fucked,"" because isn't that what asexuals are always told? I don't mean that as a joke. I'm serious. People really think asexuality is a thing that can be ""cured"" with a good shagging.The irony was, I did get attacked -- but not for being asexual. I was attacked for being so insensitive and judgmental toward asexuals. And all that time, I thought the ""cooler"" road to take would be the one where I pretend to be the sex beast that can't understand a life without sex. Ha! So, my admission here today isn't because I found out it's cooler to be asexual - it's because I found out it's infinitely cooler to live in the truth.And after Jenner's interview, I wondered, what is my asexuality about? Because I'm not young, and I've certainly understood this aspect of myself for a very long time. I don't know if I can be labeled asexual as a constant; I was sexually active in my life -- yet, my sex life has always been off kilter. After watching Bruce Jenner tell it like is it, I realized who I am, who I've been, what my labels may be, and why my life has been so weird when it comes to sex.I'm not like Bruce. I'm not transgender, but I am something that could use a label. I am sexually attracted to men -- always have been -- but not enough to crave actual sex with them, unless of course they are Mads Mikkelsen, who I would schtupp so hard that his eyeballs would explode. So, I'm heterosexual, but I am not comfortable ""looking"" like a woman. Now, that doesn't mean I'm not comfortable ""being"" a woman, I am. I like being a woman, I like being a mom -- all that woman stuff is great... it's that I want to look like a man, and I always, always have. And that is the bane of my existence. I want to look like a man, so I cross dress, but that doesn't satisfy because I'm personally too fat and round to look like the skinnyass vampire types that I want to look like. This too, is no joke. I want to look like a gorgeous young man -- I mean, this is religion to me. In a way I'm like Eddie Izzard, an ""executive transvestite"" -- a heterosexually oriented cross dresser -- only, he looks better than I do.So, sexually, I love men -- but do not want sex with them. I've been with women in bed as well, and it never really turned me on. Still, I tried. And what being in bed with women brought out in me was my serious male side -- and that, I adored. But here's the kicker -- and this is why I'm asexual -- I don't want to be touched by either sex, and that is because if I am touched, then I will be identified as a woman... and that is what I do not want, because being identified as a woman cancels out my desire to look like a man. And this not wanting to be touched, this is at the heart of why my sex life has always been so weird. I have never had a sexual partner understand me, and so, I have found asexuality to be a much more acceptable umbrella for me to fly under. You see, for all the men and women who have said lines to me like, ""I know how to make you a real woman"" - they never understood that discovering the 'real woman' inside me was not my goal. What they wanted was humiliating to me. Now, had anyone ever said to me, ""Keep that hot men's suit on while we have sex, you gorgeous stud,"" then I'd probably have a happy sex life. But everyone who ever wanted me, wanted a woman. And well, I only ever just wanted to be, well...Alain Delon. Heh.I can fall in love with either sex -- that I've proven. The love of my life was a woman. So, if there's a label for me, it might be ""bi-romantic asexual"". But could I cap it at that?So, even though I still don't know what to do with this unearthed information, I'm grateful to Bruce Jenner for opening up the conversation that allowed me to delve deeper into my own being. I know now ""why"" I've never had a really good sexual relationship. It's not because I'm a man inside; it's because I want to look like a man while remaining a woman, and no one in my entire life has ever accepted or welcomed this into their life -- except for possibly, my gay boyfriend, Douglas, who always loved me just the way I am.Being exposed and owning it definitely makes one vulnerable. But it also comes with a superhero power: the ability to say ""fuck you"" to anyone who worms their way out of their hole to put you down for who you are and what you stand up for.Thanks, Bruce. Dori Hartley and Douglas Rowan, having fun, being themselves.Editors' note: Though Jenner has come out as ""for all intents and purposes a woman,"" he has not yet indicated that he would like to be known by a new name or female pronouns, so this story uses male pronouns.

The enigmas we are incapable of decoding could be the Earth's strategy to safeguard those species which are otherwise vulnerable to man's greed and cruelty. Many are the examples that come to mind. For instance: have you ever heard of the Basking shark? An ocean creature that can grow to be ten meters long. It plows through the waters of the world and, ironically, often goes unnoticed. It disappears during the winter months, but shows up again in the spring. Where do these gentle giants of the ocean go? What do they do? Hypothetical explanations are all we have. Last week an Italian news website, Ravenna Today, reported the sighting of an eight-meter-long basking shark in the Adriatic Sea, at about six miles off the coast of a city called Cervia. Basking sharks are one of the biggest fish in the world, second only to whale sharks. Their scientific name is: Cetorhinus maximus. It derives from the Greek words ketos, marine monster, and rhinos, "" nose "" , because of their long snout. Maximus is a clear reference to the animal's size. Although their dimensions and name might induce us to fear them, basking sharks are harmless to human beings. The Cetorhinus maximus can be sighted traveling alone or in groups. They swim slowly both in deep and shallow waters with their mouths wide open, to catch as much plankton as possible. They often pay us a visit here in the Mediterranean area. Our temperate seas hold precious food supplies for a great number of marine inhabitants and the gentle giants make no exception. After all who doesn't enjoy a banquet! But, and it is frustrating to have to add the word "" but "" on a constant basis, like with too many other living beings on our planet, basking sharks appear on the IUCN's (International Union for Conservation of Nature) red list as an endangered species and are protected under the CITES Appendix II whose website states that although they are not threatened with extinction, "" they may become so unless trade is closely controlled. "" WildLifeRisk, a nongovernmental Hong Kong-based wildlife conservation organization issued a report in January 2014 stating that about 600 whale sharks and basking sharks are being processed by a factory in China every year. This is illegal and an inevitable question emerges: how many other factories could be involved in this unlawful trend? What makes these majestic creatures so appetizing to fisheries around the globe? The fact that a single carcass is worth tens of thousands of dollars. Shark fins are sold to restaurants for shark fin soup. A single bowl can cost over 100 dollars. The skin goes to manufacturers for bags, the oil is bought by companies to make fish oil supplements and the meat becomes food. In one form or another many people consume shark products and in many cases are led to believe that a shark steak or shark fin soup are healthy. It's not difficult to debunk such a misconception. All it takes is one word: mercury. All it takes is a simple search on the Internet to find scientific evidence of the toxic levels of mercury found in shark meat. The mercury present in fins, cartilage and shark flesh can be extremely dangerous to us. Mercury has always been present on Earth, it was produced naturally by wildfires and volcanoes. However 2/3 of the mercury in our atmosphere today is man-made, like coal-burning power plants and waste incinerators. The substance travels in the air for thousands of miles. It is then released into our oceans either directly through rainfall or indirectly through runooff, it enters the marine food chain and eventually becomes products we eat or use.This is the reason why the consumption of shark products carry labels from important organizations such as the (FDA) U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the (EPA) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and (WHO), the World Health Organization. The Web lists a great number of medical studies that indicate how mercury can affect our health. In adults it can cause damage to the central nervous system and cardiovascular system. Many organizations advise pregnant women and children not to consume shark meat at all, because a developing brain is very vulnerable to mercury. As I watched the video of the basking shark's visit to the Adriatic with my ten-year-old son I kept thinking, nature doesn't need us. Nature has always been here, she has always survived. Human beings on the other hand depend on nature; without her we are doomed. It's that simple. ""Mom, do you think I will ever see a real shark in the ocean?""I was about to answer: ""Of course you will Danny "" but I stopped myself. Children need to know the truth, always. ""I'm not sure sweetheart, but I will do my part, I will do my best to give you that chance. """

The platform makes several medical claims that shape its policies. Since public health policy should be based on the best scientific and medical evidence, fact-checking these claims is timely. When judged by published evidence, are these Republican claims the truth (evidence, knowledge, logic, and facts) or truthiness? Coined by Stephen Colbert, ""truthiness"" reflects opinions that stem from the heart rather than from reality. ABORTION Claim (page 33): ""Numerous studies have shown that abortion endangers the health and well-being of women, and we stand firmly against it.""Fact: Legal abortion is dramatically safer than childbirth. The risk of death from abortion is one-fourteenth that of continuing a pregnancy to delivery. Today the risk of death from abortion is less than that from an injection of penicillin. (Perhaps women need state-scripted counseling and a mandatory waiting period before receiving this dangerous antibiotic.) Within two years of Roe v. Wade, the Institute of Medicine had documented that abortion improved women's health. This was soon confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Medical Association, World Health Organization, and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Assessment: Truthiness!ABSTINENCE-ONLY SEX EDUCATIONClaim (page 36):"" It is effective, science-based, and empowers teens to achieve optimal health outcomes and avoid risks of sexual activity.""Fact: Abstinence-only educational programs for teens are expensive and ineffective. This was the conclusion of a 2002 systematic review of the world's randomized controlled trials on the topic. The review found that, Primary prevention strategies evaluated to date do not delay the initiation of sexual intercourse, improve use of birth control among young men and women, or reduce the number of pregnancies in young women. This finding from the medical literature was confirmed in 2007 by a federally mandated study by Mathematica Policy Research; it followed more than 2,000 students in four promising programs for four to six years. The programs had no benefit. During the last Republican administration, the federal government wasted more than $170 million per year on these ineffective, ideological programs. The position paper of the Society for Adolescent Medicine reports that, Current U.S. federal law and guidelines regarding abstinence-only funding are ethically flawed and interfere with fundamental human rights.Assessment: Truthiness again!ADOPTIONClaim (page 14): ""...we take comfort in the tremendous increase in adoptions that has followed Republican legislative initiatives.""Fact: Adoptions have declined dramatically in recent decades, during and after Republican administrations. According to federal data, before 1973 the proportion of babies given up for adoption was about 9% for never-married women under age 45 years. More recently, the proportion has hovered around 1% to 2%.Assessment: More truthiness!  Sources: Chandra and JonesZero for three thus far. Finally, a bonus question for which the answer was predictable (though not yet documented) at the time of the 2012 Republican convention:AFFORDABLE CARE ACT (aka, Obamacare)Claim (page 32): ""Obamacare--was never really about healthcare, though its impact upon the nation's health is disastrous [emphasis mine]. ""Fact: Recent fact-checking by the Washington Post confirmed government estimates that Obamacare has helped to save the lives of about 50,000 Americans. This was predictable, since an estimated 18,000 to 45,000 persons die each year from lack of insurance. The number of lives saved by Obamacare is nearing the number of U.S. lives lost in the Vietnam War. Moreover, the program is costing less than expected.Assessment: Truthiness (and hubris) once againTruthiness In this simple medical fact-checking exercise, the Republican Party was wildly wrong on three important public health issues: abortion, abstinence-only sex education, and adoption. The correct answers had been published and widely known in medical circles a decade or more before the 2012 GOP convention in Tampa.   Why the failure? Two explanations come to mind. The GOP may not have bothered to search for the medical evidence. The Party may have relied on intuition (truthiness) rather than truth. Alternatively, the GOP may have been aware of the facts but intended to mislead the public. Neither explanation should give voters much comfort as the 2016 election approaches."

Celebrating ourselves, our relationships, and life itself is not possible without honesty. When we are dishonest with others, we are living a lie with false words, actions and fake images. If we are dishonest, then we are not honoring and celebrating life; rather, we are degrading life. Lying to others is a sure way to put a distance between us and undermine the foundation of all relationships. On the other hand, being always truthful with others, builds mutual trust and creates a huge sense of openness-cultivating a feeling of safety and comfort. While dishonesty creates only distrust and ultimate isolation. When we take responsibility for our actions and words, which stem from honesty we become stronger in how we feel about ourselves. When we need to candidly discuss something difficult with another person, we must set aside time to focus on the conversation with keen attention and purpose. During the conversation if you find yourself exaggerating or lying, put a stop to it right away. Many times we fake attention and interest in a conversation or activity which is painstakingly boring and of no interest to us; it is perfectly fine to excuse ourselves, or change the topic, with due respect. Also, if you catch yourself lying by omission try not to get onto the subject where you feel compelled to lie by omission. If you have been dishonest about something, apologize for the oversight and put it behind you. Most people will appreciate your honesty. Remove the filters between what you think and what you say. You will notice that you will gain trust and respect from people around you. It is not the most difficult thing to do once you become aware of your thoughts and words. You will not be able to please everyone, but, you will be well-pleased with yourself at the end of the day!One of the best ways to enrich and deepen the love and integrity of a valuable relationship is to develop the habit of completely honest communications. If honest communication is the norm rather than the exception in our relationships, we are freeing ourselves and others to be authentic.Practicing honesty, courage and compassion, in our daily lives is how we cultivate worthiness. The key word is practice. For example courage is a virtue. You get it by performing courageous acts. It's like you learn to swim by swimming. Daily practice after a while becomes a habit. The same is true for honesty. We invite honesty into our lives when we act honestly toward ourselves and others. By making a commitment to be honest consistently and honoring this commitment we can be assured that most will respect us as trustworthy persons with integrity!"

My Yiddish mama, who force-fed us third helpings of dinner and clutched her children to her breast every time we got a bruise, was the doting hen. Dad was the disciplinarian.

When he did speak, he mostly spoke in grunts, or what I call ""Marty Talk.""  ""MMMM,"" meant he wanted more of whatever he was eating, which he almost always did.

""Thank you, Tofutti!""  Old friends can't believe how attentive I have become to my father in the last few years, the first years of his life that he let down his guard and invited me in.  ""How can you be so nice to him, when he was anything but to you?"" they ask.  I can only say that every time I make him laugh, it's like going back in time and giving a high five to the runaway teen I was.  The gift of these last few years with Dad are what a pal of mine calls ""the long goodbye.""  Oh, it's not all sunshine and butterflies with Dad. He is an old, cranky, demanding geezer. I accompanied him on a bus trip with some of his fellow residents from assisted living to see a photography exhibition of photos taken just after super storms like Hurricane Sandy, for which I had a first row seat.  Five minutes into the documentary that was captivating his neighbors and me (Hey, Brad Pitt was in it for his work rebuilding homes after Katrina), Marty yelled, ""I'm bored with this! Get me out of here!""  Sigh.  ""Dad. We're in a group, be patient.""  ""Borrreowwww!"" Marty Talk for ""bored and outta here, now!""  But I find that between Marty Talk and downing kosher hot dogs without chewing (by the way, yech), I am learning from him.  ""Do you have any regrets?"" I asked him recently.  ""Yeah. I wish I had traveled more. Now I'm too old.""  I thought of all the times my girlfriend asked if we could go to Italy. There never seemed to be a right time to get away. There was always some obligation that felt more time sensitive.  That night, I said, ""Honey, we need to plan that trip!""  We went, and it was fabulous. Thanks, Dad. I just needed a little push.  Recently, Dad's beloved Timex broke and went missing.  It didn't take much -- $39.95 at Target -- and I was able to present to him that exact watch he missed so sorely. For five fantastic minutes, Dad was awestruck by me.  Then, of course, he started demanding egg rolls, but you know, those five minutes were sublime.  I think of J.K. Simmons' Oscar speech for Whiplash when he said, ""Call your mom, call your dad. If you're lucky enough to have a parent or two alive on this planet, call 'em. Don't text.""  Thank you, J.K. I hope people listened.  If a former runaway teen with decades of anger and distance and thousands of miles between her and her father could find her way back to a lonely old man in a wheelchair finally ready to talk to anyone who wants to listen, anyone can bridge the gap.  Don't hold a grudge. Call your parents. Life is so short."

The thousands of families who will mourn their loved ones. The thousands of stories that will never be told, jokes that will never be laughed at, and memories that will never be made. According to the Center for American Progress, 33,000 Americans are killed on average each year, with this issue disproportionately affecting young people. In 2010, 54 percent of these deaths were people under the age of 30. Children, teens, and young adults are most likely to be impacted by gun violence, but, far too often, our voices go unheard in addressing these issues.Which is one of the reasons I strongly oppose Ohio's House Bill 152, which would take away the need for any training or permit to carry a hidden, loaded weapon. Anyone over the age of 21, that is not otherwise prohibited from owning a gun, would be granted the same legal right to carry as someone with a concealed carry permit. In Ohio, it is legal for to carry weapons into any establishment with a Class D liquor license. We are gradually taking steps towards allowing people, who have no training or permit, to carry a hidden weapon into a place that serves alcohol. That is not commonsense legislation. That is foolishness. While young people are often the victims of these crimes, they are often the perpetrators as well. Easing these restrictions and allowing young people over the age of 21 to carry a hidden, loaded weapon with no training, permit, or background check can only lead to higher incarceration rates among this group of people. We are not building a future for Ohio's young people, we are taking it away. If we truly value the lives of Ohio's youth, we must advocate for commonsense gun legislation, work to create safer communities, ensure equitable education for Ohio's students, and expand opportunities for our most marginalized communities. As we continue to take steps backwards, I worry about my younger siblings going to school or playing outside. And loosening the restrictions for the concealed carrying of weapons does nothing to calm my fears. We want to believe that bills like this will help protect individual freedom and make it easier to protect ourselves and the ones we love. But the reality is that every 70 minutes, a person under the age of 25 is murdered with a gun. This is not the reality that our children and youth deserve. This is not the reality Ohio deserves. And I have to believe we can do better. I believe in championing the voices of young people to address the issues that affect our everyday lives, but that cannot happen when the lives of Ohio's youth are not valued by the very people who are supposed to represent us."

Dr. Wayne Dyer wrote the book. It's the principle behind The Secret, by Rhonda Byrne, You Can Heal Your Life, by Louise Hay, and E-Squared, by Pam Grout, among others.In the simplest terms it means, what you focus on will manifest in your life. I believe it's true and it works in both positive and negative ways. I've seen it in my own life many times.When I look back on my life and my less than idyllic childhood, I wonder how I ever became the optimist I am. Most of my family held themselves down in the mire. Giving up on education, settling for a life of struggle, and always feeling less than.One of my cousins, a very bright girl, spent a summer with my husband and me when she was 15. Knowing the family history of drop outs, I really felt we'd saved one. But, she went home and dropped out of school after becoming pregnant. She married the young man, who also dropped out. They were doomed to repeat the pattern.When I asked my uncle why he didn't make her finish school he said, ""I can't force 'em to learn."" It's really sad.I was the first in my family to graduate from high school. It wasn't a big celebration at my house. My mother called me smarty pants, bossy bitch, among other lovely names, for years. She was threatened by my love of learning.In that culture, there is a fear of losing someone who becomes ""better than you,"" which is how they feel when you become educated. Education is a threat. Fear of the unknown beats a lot of people down.I used to believe you were born an optimist or a pessimist, but I don't anymore. I believe you can manifest your own destiny in many ways.The years I spent caring for my brothers at the expense of my own childhood never made me give up on wanting a better life. I never felt I was doomed to poverty and ignorance. Quite the opposite. I knew I would have a better life.In my tween years, a friend and I would play house, but not in the stereotypical style. We pretended we shared an apartment while climbing the corporate ladder. We were working girls, in our minds, but not the kind of working girl my mother could relate to.Both of us married younger than we intended and had kids right away. Those choices didn't play into our earlier pretend lifestyle, but our attitudes did. It was, after all, the age of women's lib. Neither of us lived the Father Knows Best life. It was a choice.I was thinking about all this after watching a news story about the families who lost their homes to super storm Sandy, which devastated much of the Northeastern U.S. a few years ago.Some had moved into a motel, with whatever they had left while waiting for assistance. Entire families were full-time residents of a motel that was destroyed by fire.When I watched the report and saw the faces of those who got out alive I saw my uncles and aunts, my cousins, all of those who succumbed to the belief that life, their life, was meant to be a struggle.At that time, we had decided to sell our city home and beach house to move full time to Cape May. Things were moving along really well. I had envisioned the entire process from the moment we put it all in motion. My vision did not include struggle and hardship.In fact, we wouldn't have had the beach house if I had refused to believe it was possible. I didn't have a timeline on that vision, but I knew it would happen, even as my husband doubted it.We sold our city house in three days. My head was spinning but in a good way. The beach house took longer, but it worked out perfectly because we had a place to stay while finding the perfect home in Cape May.There were false starts and offers declined along the way. Then we got a solid offer on the beach house but hadn't found our forever home and, I'll admit, I was nervous. We made offers on two houses that fell through. They weren't really what we wanted, but we had to move. I was beginning to worry. I would check my phone the moment my eyes opened in the morning, waiting for word from our realtor. The market was a bit stagnant in Cape May as the season was coming to a close. Worry.Until the morning, I saw our realtor's message...""Look what popped up overnight!""It was exactly what we wanted. Coincidence? No way.You really are the architect of your life. It's a choice."

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration on Friday, Oct. 30, 2009, issued a record $87 million fine against oil giant BP PLC for failing to correct safety hazards after a 2005 explosion killed 15 workers and injured 170 at its Texas City refinery.(AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez, file)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cf8351c250000590ddc0aa1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"To give voice to 35 workers killed on the job over the past 35 years at a massive refinery in Texas City, hundreds of surviving family members, co-workers and friends gathered there last month to erect white crosses marked with their names.They conducted the ceremony on the 10 anniversary of an explosion that killed 15 workers and injured more than 170, including townspeople.Marathon Petroleum Corp., which bought the refinery from BP two years ago, did its best to shut the mourners up. Marathon uprooted the crosses and tossed them in a box like trash within hours of the commemoration.For years during contract negotiations, the United Steelworkers (USW) union has pressed ungodly profitable oil companies to improve safety. This fell mostly on deaf ears. On Feb. 1, USW refinery workers began loudly voicing this demand by striking over unfair labor practices (ULP). Ultimately 7,000 struck 15 refineries. Within six weeks, all but five oil corporations settled. Marathon is a hold out. It wants to cut safety personnel. It does not want to hear about dead workers. Yet the (ULP) strike is about dead workers. Over the past five years, at refineries nationwide that employ USW members, 27 workers have died – incinerated, gassed or crushed to death. And the peril of refineries spills into communities. In Texas City at the refinery owned by BP in 2005, flying glass from windows shattered in the explosion injured townspeople. In the first six weeks of this year, explosions occurred at three refineries, closing streets, raining eye-irritating white ash on neighborhoods and forcing residents to shelter indoors for hours.As the USW strike over unfair labor practices drags on in Texas City at what is now called the Marathon Petroleum Corp. Galveston Bay Refinery, USW members feel Marathon’s demands for reduced safety measures indicate the corporation refuses to hear the cautionary tales of the facility’s deadly past. Brandi Sanders, treasurer for the local union there and a 10-year veteran maintenance worker, told me that it is as if Marathon believes the 2005 explosion and the 20 other deaths since 1980 don’t exist because they didn’t occur on Marathon’s watch. “But the union does not want to go back. We lived through those experiences. And we learned from that history. And we should not be forced to repeat it,” Sanders said.That was the reason for the candlelight ceremony on March 23. To make those deaths real for Marathon managers who did not experience them in the visceral way that co-workers and families and neighbors did.The mourners marked each of the 35 crosses with the name of a worker killed at the nation’s fifth largest refinery since 1980, which is the year of the last nationwide strike at refineries. A bagpiper played “Amazing Grace” as the participants, holding candles aloft in the dark, marched two blocks from the local union hall to the refinery. They wanted to place the crosses on the site where the workers had lost their lives.But police officers blocked their path. Marathon had called the cops. Marathon refused to acknowledge the tragic anniversary, even with a moment of silence at the refinery as BP had done annually. And it wouldn’t allow a commemoration by anyone else on its property either.The officers permitted the mourners to erect the white markers in a median strip along the highway, as often is done by family and friends of car crash victims. The ceremony participants called out each name, tolled a bell and placed the marker. Tears flowed.Just a few hours later, picketers saw managers leave the plant, descend on the memorial in the darkness and rip each of the 35 crosses out of the ground.Larry Burchfield, a member of the USW’s National Oil Bargaining Policy Committee and a machinist at the refinery for 20 years while it was owned first by Amoco, then BP and now Marathon, told me that disrespect Marathon showed for the dead is the same disregard Marathon shows for the living.If Marathon valued the lives of workers, the corporation wouldn’t try to save a couple of bucks by eliminating the safety measures put in place to preserve workers’ lives after the 2005 explosion, Burchfield said. “Marathon’s safety policies are called life critical policies,” he told me, “But your life is not so critical when it is going to affect Marathon’s bottom line.”Marathon’s “it wasn’t me; it was BP” reasoning for downgrading safety just doesn’t cut it. Don Holmstrom, director of the Western Regional Office of the U.S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB), explained why in an interview with the Galveston County Daily News for a story on the anniversary of the 2005 blast.  “I think it is sad to report that not enough appears to have been learned, and the problem persists. It is not a BP problem. Although the incident occurred at (BP’s) Texas City refinery, there is an industry problem,” said Holmstrom, who was the CSB’s lead investigator into the 2005 blast. Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Assistant Administrator Jordan Barab said of recent refinery explosions, “each repeated a lesson that the industry should have already learned.”Marathon is no outlier, operating in perfect safety. Numerous problems have occurred at the plant since Marathon took over. An explosion and fire at the refinery on Feb. 21 last year critically injured Oscar Garcia, who was employed by a company Marathon contracted to perform work on the site. Garcia has sued Marathon for negligence. The refinery released more than 128,000 pounds of silica and alumina oxide into surrounding communities in two incidents this year. Several fires have occurred since the strike began, including two within 24 hours witnessed by picketing workers.After the BP explosion, the CSB and others recommended refineries refrain from placing personnel in temporary facilities near volatile units, especially during shut downs and startups. Many of those killed in the BP explosion were in temporary trailers during a unit start up. Despite that, within the past year, Marathon erected three lunch tents during a repair cycle on the same ground where bodies and debris had been hauled away after the 2005 blast.Not one of the 1,100 USW members who work for Marathon has crossed the picket line. They’ve gone without pay for nearly three months because they know what’s at stake: their lives.In another attempt to help Marathon hear that, workers replanted the 35 white crosses in a long line in front of the union hall. They managed to get them back from Marathon through the police department.Tomorrow, on Workers’ Memorial Day, which commemorates those who have lost their lives on the job, the USW members will place a solar spotlight in front of each cross, to highlight the lives sacrificed when safety was compromised. Hopefully, that will open the eyes of Marathon managers who deliberately closed their ears to the words of dead workers. "

The Supreme Court continued to hear oral arguments on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f4341f00002501257de9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In a new survey, more than half of self-identified Republicans said they didn’t think the Affordable Care Act is increasing the number of people with health insurance, with a fifth of respondents saying it has actually reduced the number of people with coverage.For the record, the evidence suggests these people are flat-out wrong.The poll is from YouGov.com and, like some other recent surveys, the results suggest hostility to the law is waning. The evolution is slow and, even now, “Obamacare” has lots of skeptics. The YouGov survey asked, among other things, whether respondents think the health care law is “more of a success” or “more of a failure.” Forty-percent chose failure, while 30 percent chose success.  Still, that’s progress from October 2013, when, upon launching, Healthcare.gov and most of the state-run websites for purchasing insurance barely worked. Back then, just 14 percent thought the law was closer to success, while 58 percent thought it was closer to failure. More important, perhaps, 49 percent of respondents in the YouGov poll said the law should be “kept the same” or “expanded,” while just 40 percent said it should be repealed. That’s also a shift from the past, when pluralities in the YouGov poll favored repeal. (In surveys by other organizations, pluralities have generally favored keeping or strengthening the law.)  But the most revealing part of the YouGov poll was a more specific question about how people perceive the Affordable Care Act’s performance -- specifically, whether respondents think the number of people with insurance has increased, remained the same, or fallen over the last 12 months.  The question is revealing because it broke out response by partisan identification. Among Democrats, 77 percent said the number of people with insurance had risen, while just 9 percent said it had decreased. But among Republicans, just 43 percent thought the number of people with insurance had increased, while 21 percent said it had decreased.To put it another way, less than half of Republicans think the number of uninsured is coming down, while one in five think it is going up.  Every major study -- including official estimates by the federal government and analyses by independent researchers -- has shown that the number of people with health insurance has risen substantially since the Affordable Care Act took full effect. While experts disagree over the precise magnitude of the increase, they don’t question its existence -- except at highly partisan, right-wing think tanks and on a certain cable television network. It’s likely that perceptions of the Affordable Care Act are affecting the way some people assess its performance, rather than the other way around. In other words, when some conservative respondents hear a pollster ask questions about whether the health care law is helping people to get insurance, they may simply think about Obamacare and everything they hate about it -- and instinctively give a negative response.That would mean these self-identified Republicans aren’t denying reality so much as refusing to even think about it. Either way, it suggests some people will never support the Affordable Care Act, no matter what its effects on the real world."
