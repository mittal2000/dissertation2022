On Dec. 15, an Albuquerque police officer accidentally shot a bystander when his weapon discharged as he climbed through a window during a burglary investigation.The officer in Friday's underwent surgery at University of New Mexico Hospital, Espinoza said. A second undercover officer was treated and released from the hospital with minor injuries. She said she did not know the cause of the injuries.Wallace Anderson, who was inside the restaurant at the time of the shooting, told broadcaster KOB 4 he saw two unmarked cars pull up.""They surrounded this vehicle so it couldn't back up and escape.

Elite French police stormed a printworks and a Jewish supermarket Friday, killing two brothers wanted for the Charlie Hebdo attack and a gunman linked to them in a dramatic end to twin sieges that rocked France. The dramatic climax to the two standoffs brought to an end more than 48 hours of fear and uncertainty that began when the two brothers slaughtered 12 people at satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in the bloodiest attack on French soil in half a century.

ALL TOGETHER is hosted by Paul Raushenbush, executive editor of HuffPost Religion. You can download ALL TOGETHER on iTunes, or Stitcher. On January 7, three men entered the offices the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and killed 12 people. Witnessed told police that the gunmen had said God is Great in Arabic and they had “avenged the prophet.” Charlie Hebdo was notorious for its brand of vicious humor that skewered politicians as well as religious figures. Islam's Prophet Muhammad was featured several times on the cover in depictions clearly meant to offend. The horrific violence at Charlie Hebdo has been condemned by everyone across the globe including Muslims who rejected that these gunman acted in the name of Islam. The horror at Charlie Hebdo cannot be justified or qualified. However it does raise the question of the uneasy relationship between satire and religion. What right do we have to offend one another? Does living in a democratic and free society require toleration of being offended? Or should society value free speech, while at the same time protecting the dignity of others? In this episode of ALL TOGETHER Raushenbush speaks with a wide range of thoughtful individuals who, within the shadow of the ongoing tragedy at Charlie Hebdo, wrestle with questions of religious sensitivities, the role of satire, and what it takes to live in a free and pluralistic society. Hopefully the conversations will be part of collective effort to create path forward together in what seems like a very sad, and very dangerous moment. Featured in this week's ALL TOGETHER are: the Political Editor for HuffPost UK, Mehdi Hasan; the Muslim Comic Negin Farsad, the founder of Sultans of Satire Jordan Elgrably, Professor Stan Katz, the Director of the Center for Arts and Cultural Policy Studies at Princeton University and Robert Darden, former Senior editor of the satire magazine, The Wittenburg Door."

The auditorium is packed, so we walk along the side row to the front stage, where we sit, facing out, peering over an altar of candles, at a sea of faces. They are numb, too. Just hours earlier a shooting took place on our campus, and we have gathered to pray, to grieve, to grapple. We are Seattle Pacific University.At that moment, we were united in horror, unified in grief. A tragedy such as the shooting last June, however, can have a way, not just of uniting a community -- but isolating us, too. Turning us into protectionists. Xenophobes. This might have happened to SPU. But it didn't.To understand what I mean, fast forward. It is January 8th, 2015, a Thursday night, 7 PM, exactly 217 days -- 5208 hours -- after my daughter and I walked to the front of the auditorium, I walk again onto campus, this time with my wife Priscilla. The reception room is packed, so we nudge our way in, peering out toward a crowd of students.But not just students. We are at a reception for residents of Tent City 3, which Seattle Pacific University is hosting. This community lives in, well, tents, with tarps as roofs, plywood thrown down as flooring. Without these tarps, without a host such as Seattle Pacific University, these people would probably endure a wet winter under various viaducts and bridges in Seattle.Tonight, they do not. Tonight we are sharing a meal together in the campus center. For three months they will live with SPU folk, their tarp fence and the tops of their honey buckets a reminder that they are part of us, at least partly, for the winter quarter. They were part of us two years ago, as well. Over the protests of some residents in the surrounding neighborhood, despite the anxiety expressed by some tuition-paying parents, they lived with us. But then it was on an athletic field tucked in a fenced area, across a very busy Nickerson Avenue, away from the heart of campus. This year Tent City 3 lives on our main quad, smack in the middle of our community, right next to the front gate.Last June, Seattle Pacific University grabbed national attention because of the shooting. We also grabbed the attention of Seattle by the way we grieved. It was, if this is possible, good grief, and our secular city, for a fleeting moment, embraced that.What a tragedy it would have been, however, had we left grief behind and bowed to fear. SPU might have done that. SPU might have reconsidered their invitation to Tent City 3 and succumbed to misinformed and misguided questions: Who needs tent-dwellers ruining the grass of our lovely main quad? Who needs to be greeted by honey buckets and tarps and plywood floors squashing the mud of a Seattle winter? Who wants their college kids rubbing shoulders with drunks and drug addicts? The people of Tent City 3, our new neighbors, are not in fact homeless, as Roger, a member of Tent City 3, explained last night. They have tarps for roofs and plywood for floors, but Tent City is their home. Nor are they drug addicts or drunks. Members of Tent City 3 live by strict rules. Alcohol keeps a person from reasoning, and reason is pivotal to communal life, so alcohol means being ousted. Drugs, too. Theft as well, since theft breaks trust, Roger explained.Reality, however, is not perception, and the homeless are perceived by many of us to be a danger, a hazard to our security. So I might have understood if SPU had said, ""Enough is enough"" and rescinded their invitation to Tent City 3.Instead, I find myself strolling to a reception in their honor. The real test of a community is not its immediate reaction to grief -- but its tenacity. Even after a shooting that rocked us to the core, we can't turn inward. Even after plummeting into a vortex of grief, we can't turn isolationist. Even after numbness, we can't turn away.What happens down the road tests the mettle of a community, when tragedies are put in perspective, when memories fade. That is when communities can build borders and raise walls -- or, as SPU has done, stay the stubborn course of hospitality and hope."

Five years later many of the tent camps and shantytowns that once sheltered some 1.5 million people now hold about 80,000 as the government tries to move them into permanent homes.

""It's inevitable they will come year after year. So we must train people what to do in an emergency and ensure families have an evacuation plan."" NETWORK OF VOLUNTEERSHe belongs to a network of 3,000 newly trained volunteers and paid staff, created in the aftermath of the earthquake, who work across Haiti's 10 provinces.Trained in first aid and emergency response, they are on the frontline of government efforts to ensure Haiti is better prepared to deal with disasters and can save more lives.""We still lack equipment, firefighters and more people need to be trained. But communities are more aware about how to keep safe. One of our key messages is to tell people not to cross rivers during a flood because that's often how people get killed,"" said Enrico at the National Emergency Operations Center (COUN) in downtown Port-au-Prince.Built in 2010 following the earthquake, the center is where government ministries and aid agencies meet to coordinate disaster response. The center, which includes a warehouse stocked with water, mattresses, hygiene and food kits, has been put to the test.A cholera epidemic broke out in October 2010, which has claimed the lives of more than 9,000 people, followed by several tropical storms, including Hurricane Sandy, which killed 54 and forced 100,000 Haitians to evacuate their homes in 2012.""In Haiti, it's the back-to-back accumulation and combination of disasters that puts pressure on the government and the people,"" said Thomas Pitaud, chief technical advisor to the government on national disaster risk management systems.Each year in parts of Haiti, homes and animals are washed away, fields inundated, and food crops and grazing land destroyed by storms and floods, pushing up food prices.With 60 percent of Haiti's population of 10 million living on less than $2 a day, even a small increase in food prices can mean families cannot afford to put enough food on the table. DISASTER PREPAREDNESSFive years after the earthquake, aid agencies say progress has been made in preparing communities on what to do when a disaster strikes, including early warning systems, simulation exercises and identifying shelters.Other projects include building flood walls and drainage ditches, along with embankment and watershed protection projects to conserve water supplies and lessen the impact of floods and landslides.But such schemes, along with the efforts of Haitians like Enrico, can only go so far to reduce the high exposure to disasters Haiti faces.Far less progress has been made on reducing the risk of disasters in the first place, and ensure all new homes, hospitals and schools being built are earthquake resistant.""You have an environment that's very degraded,"" said Pitaud, who also works for the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in Haiti.""We're constantly responding from one catastrophe to another, so it's difficult to focus on reducing risk over the long-term and get funding.""URBAN SLUMSA lack of urban planning and high levels of urbanization have led to more than 60 percent of Haitians living in densely populated slums in Port-au-Prince, which magnifies the damage and number of casualties disasters bring.Angelique Hilaire lives with her three children in a grey brick one-room home perched precariously on a hillside slum.Hilaire is only too well aware that she is exposed to flooding and landslides but has no option but to brace herself for the yearly hurricane season.""I can't afford to rent anywhere else,"" she said. ""Every time it rains I pray to God for it to stop. But what can I do?Even a short downpour can leave the capital flooded as piles of rubbish on the streets and debris filled canals block drains, which exacerbates flooding.Natural disasters linked to climate change will only get more frequent and extreme in the future, experts say.Decades of deforestation have left Haiti even more exposed to natural disasters, with less than three percent of its original forest cover still intact, according to the UNDP.This causes soil erosion and reduces the ability of soil to retain water, making Haiti more vulnerable to flooding and landslides. During heavy rainfall, there are few trees to stop water washing down the bare mountains.While 5.5 million tree seedlings have been planted in Haiti by the UNDP since 2010, not enough has been done to stop people cutting down trees in the first place.Selling charcoal, which comes from burning wood, is used for cooking and is a key source of income for many Haitians living in the countryside.""One challenge is to provide economic opportunities so farmers don't have to cut down trees,"" Pitaud said.

The Republican Party consolidates its strength in Congress. And California gets in on the 2016 speculation. This is HuffPollster for Friday, January 9, 2015.LEAST FINANCIALLY SECURE HAVE LOWEST VOTER TURNOUT - HuffPollster: ""America's most economically vulnerable are also the least likely to vote, according to a new Pew Research report. The analysis divides Americans into five groups based on their level of 'financial security,' a term used to measure both how much difficulty people have with paying bills and affording things like housing and medical care, and how much access they have to resources like checking or savings accounts, a credit card or retirement savings. Financial security turns out to be a pretty good indicator of how active someone is in politics. Just over half of the least financially secure Americans were registered to vote last year, compared with 94 percent of the most secure. Less than a third of the two least-secure groups -- who together make up 41 percent of the U.S. adult population -- were considered likely to vote….[T]he Americans who are struggling most are least likely to have their voices heard on issues like the need for a social safety net, where their views are dramatically different from the most well-off. The least financially secure Americans are 26 points more likely than the most secure to say government should do more for the needy, while the most secure are 25 points more likely to say that 'poor people today have it easy.'"" [HuffPost, Pew Report]THE GOP'S HOLD ON CONGRESS IS GROWING STRONGER - Ronald Brownstein and Janie Boschma: ""The new Congress convenes as a House divided, with Democrats and Republicans representing districts marked by towering contrasts along lines of race, education, and age, a Next America analysis shows. Using census data, the analysis found that Republicans have consolidated a commanding advantage in districts where whites exceed their share of the national population—especially in those places where fewer whites than the national average hold at least a four-year college degree. House Democrats, meanwhile, remain competitive in districts with larger than average numbers of college-educated whites and still control most districts where minorities exceed their share of the national population....That trend toward concentration among their best groups suggests how difficult it will be for Democrats to recapture the House while relying solely on the younger, diverse, and socially liberal 'coalition of the ascendant' that has powered their victories in the presidential popular vote since 1992. While Obama has twice proven that Democrats can capture the White House while losing a clear majority of whites, the patterns of support across the four quadrants signal that House Democrats can't expect to consistently hold a majority any time soon without improving on that performance."" [National Journal]BARBARA BOXER'S RETIREMENT SETS OFF 'BIG SHAKEUP' - Carly Schwartz: ""Sen. Barbara Boxer's (D-Calif.) announcement Thursday that she won't seek re-election when her term ends in 2016 will ignite a scramble among prominent California Democrats eager to fill the role, some analysts said. But the retirement of Boxer, 74, also marks the beginning of a massive overhaul of the Golden State's top elected positions, Larry Gerston, a political science professor emeritus at San Jose State University, told The Huffington Post. In 2018, 76-year-old Gov. Jerry Brown (D)'s term will end, and it's likely that 81-year-old Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D), who has held office since 1992, won't run for re-election that year, either. 'These people are all trying to position themselves,' Gerston said of potential Democratic successors to Boxer, Brown and Feinstein...California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, 47, and state Attorney General Kamala Harris, 50, are the two biggest liberal names being floated to take over Boxer's seat.

Bratton attends Federal Law Enforcement Foundation's 24th Annual Luncheon at The Waldorf Astoria on November 14, 2014 in New York City.

""We're coming out of what was a pretty widespread stoppage of certain types of activity, the discretionary type of activity by and large,"" Bratton told NPR’s Robert Siegel, adding that police were mainly not enforcing low-level, quality-of-life offenses. According to WNYC, Bratton said that despite the slowdown, major crime is still down overall.For the week ending Jan. 4, only 48 tickets were issued citywide for drinking in public, compared to 1,061 tickets during the same period last year, a fall-off of 95 percent, according to NBC. Additionally, there were only nine summonses for urinating in public in the week ending Jan. 4 -- a 94 percent drop from the 160 such summonses during the same week in 2014. Overall, officers issued 92 percent fewer criminal summonses and made 56 percent fewer arrests during the week ending Jan. 4 than during the same week in 2014. The number of traffic tickets, a major source of revenue for the city, has also plunged. Bratton’s comments Friday mark the first time the commissioner has acknowledged that these low numbers are the result of an organized slowdown. He told reporters earlier this week that he’d ordered a “comprehensive review” into the low number of summonses, adding that, if a slowdown were shown to exist, “we will respond forcefully.”The slowdown started over two weeks ago, following the execution-style murders of two NYPD officers, Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos, in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. After the murders, an email allegedly sent by the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association, the city’s largest police union, instructed officers not to issue summonses or make arrests ""unless absolutely necessary."" The PBA denied sending the email, but hasn’t spoken out against the ongoing slowdown. Ed Mullins, head of another New York police union, the Sergeants Benevolent Association, also denied any union involvement in the slowdown, telling reporters instead that ""people are talking to each other” and that “it became contagious.""New York City Council member Rory Lancman (D-Queens) told The Huffington Post this week that “the language of the unions has encouraged the slowdowns.”Lancman accused the union leadership of “fomenting a culture of lawlessness and disrespect among rank-and-file cops.”The slowdown is seen as part of a growing rift between the police unions and Mayor de Blasio. The mayor, unions have argued, didn’t show enough support to police when protests swept the city in December after a Staten Island grand jury declined to indict Daniel Pantaleo, the NYPD officer who put 43-year-old Eric Garner into a fatal chokehold. After the deaths of Officers Liu and Ramos last month, PBA President Pat Lynch blamed the deaths on those who had ""incited violence on the street under the guise of protest.” Lynch said de Blasio had “blood on his hands.” At Liu’s and Ramos’ funerals, many officers turned their backs as the mayor spoke. Although Bratton met with union heads this week to try to alleviate tensions, it’s unclear what progress, if any, was made. After the meeting, de Blasio spokesman Phil Walzak told the New York Daily News that “the mayor is committed to keeping crime at historically low levels, supporting the brave men and women of the NYPD who protect us every day, and bringing the police and community closer together in every neighborhood across New York City.""“Mayor de Blasio has a strong record of supporting our cops,"" Walzak went on, ""from adding more than $350 million in new investments to bolstering our police force to appointing the nation’s finest police leader as NYPD commissioner to clearly denouncing anti-cop rhetoric. That’s leadership."" Neither the mayor’s office nor the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association responded to a Huffington Post request for comment Friday. "

The bill introduced Wednesday by Assembly Speaker Toni G. Atkins and Senator Ricardo Lara does away with that exemption and prohibits “purchasing, selling, offering for sale, possessing with intent to sell, or importing with intent to sell elephant ivory or rhinoceros horn, except as specified under very limited educational and scientific circumstances.”John Casey, a spokesman for Atkins’ office, told The Huffington Post that antiques containing 5 percent ivory or less and antique musical instruments containing 20 percent ivory or less -- usually vintage pianos -- will also be exempt.Allowing the sale of old ivory has let illegal transactions flourish under the radar, a press release from the lawmakers backing the bill says, as certifying when ivory pieces were imported is often impossible. Many merchants have also taken to artificially aging the appearance of new ivory items in order to flout the 1977 rule. Illegal sales are especially pervasive in California, where San Francisco and Los Angeles trail only New York City in ivory imports, according to a Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) study carried out last spring. Even more troubling, up to 90 percent of ivory for sale in Los Angeles and approximately 80 percent being sold in San Francisco is likely illegal, the NDRC found. Much of that ivory is being paraded as antique, but it is not. Overall, the U.S. is second only to China in terms of the size of ivory markets.“As long as demand for ivory remains high and enforcement efforts are low, the legal trade will continue to serve as a front for criminal syndicates,” said John Calvelli, director of the 96 Elephants campaign, which works to end ivory sales, in a press release from Atkins’ office. “A California ban on ivory sales is an important step forward in this global effort to save elephants.”An average of 96 African elephants are killed each day -- roughly one every 15 minutes -- for their tusks, which sell for up to $1,500 a pound on the black market, the San Francisco Chronicle reported, contributing to a 76 percent decline in their population over the last few decades. And beyond conservation concerns, regulators and wildlife conservationists say the ivory trade also provides funding for some terrorist organizations, according to the Chronicle.Peter Knights, executive director of the conversation organization WildAid, told HuffPost that while similar bans were put into place in New York and New Jersey last year, California has a real opportunity to lead the way on further action.“People all around the world see California as cutting edge,” he said. “What happens in California happens around the county.""Casey told HuffPost that Atkins’ office has not received any negative response to the bill so far, but ivory collectors have come forward in recent months to defend their pastime.“All of us want to find the right solution to stabilize elephant populations in Africa through sound economic and conservation policies,” ivory collector Godfrey Harris wrote in a Los Angeles Times op-ed. “But the answer must not come at the expense of collectors who play such an important role in preserving important, interesting and revelatory objects in our cultural history,” he said. Harris added that the International Ivory Society, on whose advisory board he sits, believes removing valuable antique ivory objects from circulation will simply increase the market price for raw ivory abroad and further endanger elephants."

Police have said two officers shot Ford after he struggled with one of them and tried to grab an officer's holstered gun.Melina Abdullah, professor of pan-African studies at California State University, Los Angeles, and an organizer with Black Lives Matter who participated in the meeting, described it as worthwhile.""It shows us, if nothing less, our own power,"" Abdullah told reporters outside the police headquarters. ""It's through the refusal of the community to just let this pass as another shooting we don't respond to that we even got the meeting.""Ford's death came two days after the fatal police shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. A grand jury's decision in November not to criminally indict the officer in that high-profile death led to days of sometimes violent demonstrations in Ferguson.Those protests spread across the country. Demonstrators have also expressed anger at a grand jury's decision in December not to indict a New York City police officer for his role in the July asphyxiation death of another unarmed black man, 43-year-old Eric Garner.The killings of Garner and Brown have aggravated already strained relations between police and black Americans. In Los Angeles, members of Black Lives Matter, which gained prominence in recent months, in addition to wanting the two officers involved in Ford's death to be fired, want them charged criminally.The officers have been placed on desk duty while an investigation continues.Beck told members of Black Lives Matter he cannot legally fire the two officers at this time.A civilian Police Commission will decide if the shooting was justified, said Los Angeles police spokesman Commander Andrew Smith.

Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.).In a statement, Donovan said that since he first announced that he was ""seriously considering"" a congressional bid in the 11th District, he has received an outpouring of support. ""Last week I announced that I would seriously consider running for the vacant Congressional seat in the 11th Congressional District of New York,"" said Donovan. ""I made that announcement after a 24 hour period in which my phone never stopped ringing with expressions of enthusiastic support from elected officials, party leaders, and residents of Staten Island and Brooklyn. ... In the week since my last announcement the enthusiasm for my candidacy has only broadened and intensified, with expressions of support also from beyond the two boroughs.""Donovan has received strong public support from New York Republicans, such as former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and is considered the frontrunner for the GOP nomination. In response, however, some Republicans began warning that Donovan was an unwise choice, due to his role in the Garner case. Garner, an unarmed African-American man, died on July 17 in Staten Island after police officer Daniel Pantaleo put him in a chokehold and pushed him to the ground in order to arrest him for selling untaxed cigarettes. Garner repeatedly said ""I can't breathe"" before he died.Although the scene was captured on video by a bystander, a Staten Island grand jury decided on Dec. 3 not to indict the police officer, sparking nationwide protests. A significant amount of ire has been directed at Donovan for not pushing harder to get an indictment. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), whose district is near the one in which Donovan is running, recently told The Huffington Post that the district attorney's record and his work on the Garner case should be an important issue in the campaign.""I certainly think that his entire public record, including what happened and did not happen in the context of the grand jury investigation into Eric Garner's death, is something that should be heavily scrutinized,"" he said. Civil rights groups have also said they're ready to protest Donovan's candidacy.Grimm announced his resignation in December, after pleading guilty to one count of felony tax fraud. The governor has not yet set a date for a special election. Since it's not a regular election, there will be no Republican or Democratic primaries; the local parties will instead hold conventions to choose their candidates. "

Meteorologists are confidently forecasting frigid polar air will plunge south into the northern plains, Midwest and then the East Coast from next Tuesday, Jan. 6, 2015, through Thursday. National Weather Service meteorologist Paul Kocin, an expert on winter storms, said it will rival last year's January Arctic outbreak that introduced the phrase ""polar vortex"" to America. (AP Photo/Kiichiro Sato, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb162fc2600003600818a4f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Are we becoming a bunch of babies for canceling schools due to extremely cold weather? (""Back in my day, we walked to school in blizzards -- uphill both ways!"") Or is there something wrong with the way people remember the winters of yesteryear? It was so cold in Chicago this week that the city's public school system -- the third-largest in the nation -- had to cancel classes. A similar scenario played out in January 2014 when the polar vortex (a mass of arctic air that moves much farther south than usual) brought sub-zero temperatures to the area. The Chicago Tribune has published an op-ed labeling such school closings as the “continued wussification of society” and calling today's children “wimpy.” “And just what are we talking about? Expected lows of -- hold on tight -- minus 8. Come on, Mike Ditka would play football sleeveless in minus 8. Our kids can go to school,” wrote William Choslovsky in the Tribune. He went on to add: ""Once upon a time, we looked for excuses to work hard and persevere. Today, however, it seems as if we search for opportunities to call it a day and shut down shop.”And it's not just Chicago: Numerous school districts throughout the Midwest and eastern U.S. also closed schools this week because of the cold.So is Choslovsky right? Are schools today more likely to close than they were back in the good old days, and does that mean we've been wussified? The answers are complicated, and psychology plays an important role in our perception of the matter.Scott Sabol, meteorologist at Cleveland-based FOX affiliate WJW, told The Huffington Post that two factors lead people to believe there's a long-term trend of schools closing more often due to extreme weather: ""serial position effect"" and ""confirmation bias.""The serial position effect causes individuals to more easily recall items at the beginning and end of a list than those in the middle. As a result, Sabol says, many adults today recall the extremely harsh Midwest winters of the late 1970s and early 1980s in a “mythical” way that's “chiseled in granite” and serves as a reference point for arctic weather today.“No winter, regardless how extreme, could top those of that time,” Sabol explained.Conversely, individuals are less likely to recall the relatively mild winters of the late 1980s and early 1990s when extreme weather was less common and, as a result, school closings were also less common, Sabol believes.(Story continues below.)  Homebound Chicago office workers beg for rides from what passing motorists there are on Michigan Avenue, Jan. 15, 1979. The storm paralyzed the city and stands as one of the worst blizzards in its history. (AP Photo/Charles Knoblock)Confirmation bias -- the tendency to more easily recall memories that confirm one’s own beliefs -- might explain why some adults view the current generation as less hardworking or tough than previous generations. It might also be the reason why some believe white Christmases were more common in the past, when in reality it appears that snow-covered Christmases in many parts of the U.S. were less frequent from 1966 - 1989 than they were from 1990 - 2013. Sabol argues that the milder winters of further-back decades are easier to forget because they don't jibe with the perception that times were tougher back then. “It’s all about our historical perceptions and our false notion that the past is always more harsh and extreme than the present,” Sabol told HuffPost. “Our biases prevent us from seeing the big picture.""As Chicago magazine’s Whet Moser points out, 1977 was the first year Chicago schools began to close due to cold weather -- as opposed to snow alone -- with some consistency. Prior to the 1970s, existing records suggest that when there was a brutal cold snap, children were forced to go to school, so long as there wasn't extreme snowfall along with the cold.Thus, school closings due to extreme weather seem more likely today than they did prior to the 1970s, but it’s difficult to pin the blame on “wussification.""Forecasting technology has improved drastically in recent decades, and school districts are also more able to accurately anticipate when weather conditions could be dangerous for students. More recently, relatively sophisticated weather apps and social media have proliferated, allowing the public to more easily apply pressure on the matter of school closings.“We’re all more aware of the weather, psychologically,” ABC News chief meteorologist Ginger Zee previously told HuffPost.""We all have a phone. Every hailstorm that falls, every tornado that hits, we can take a video and share it,"" Zee explained."

After nearly four years of civil war, which has claimed more than 200,000 lives, the youngest victims remain most vulnerable, as assailants often deliberately attack areas where children are known to be sheltered. Syrian schools, which were once envied by neighboring countries, have become hotbeds for bloodshed. At least 160 children were killed and 343 were wounded in school attacks last year, the group told The New York Times.""Schools should be respected as zones of peace and safe havens for children where they can learn without fear of death or injury,"" Hanaa Singer, UNICEF representative in Syria, said in a statement. In one particularly horrific incident in October, 41 schoolchildren were murdered at the Akrameh al-Makhzumi school in Homs city.

Two years later, just 30 percent of Syrian children had access to education.Still some Syrian parents remain determined to find ways to bring learning to their kids.In the Turkish border town of Suruc for example, a group of refugee parents and volunteers set up a makeshift school housed in a blue tent in November, Reuters reported.
