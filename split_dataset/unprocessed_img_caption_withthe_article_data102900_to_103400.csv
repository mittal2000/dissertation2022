One day, the Police Athletic League representative dropped off a pile of coloring books for the younger kids. On the cover was a picture of a policeman walking hand-in-hand with a little girl, clearly (or so I thought) helping her across the street. My assumption, however, wasn't shared by 7-year-old Tanya. The minute she was handed her book she shouted out: ""Oh, oh, she's in trouble. He's taking her away to jail.""I shouldn't have been surprised. I had lived in Philly for four years. They were the ""Frank Rizzo years"" -- the notorious ""tough cop"" who was remembered for wearing a billy club tucked into his tuxedo cummerbund. I knew of the ""no holds barred"" way police interacted with the African American community and, though white, I had experienced some this rough treatment myself. Still, Tanya's reaction did surprise me. I tried to tell her otherwise, but she and the other youngsters in the program would have none of it. Police, to them, were not ""Officer Friendly."" As these little ones saw it, the police were not in their community to ""protect and serve.""Tanya and the other kids at that Boy's Club are in their 50's now. As I watched the Michael Brown saga unfold, they came to mind and I wondered how they saw it.The tragedy of Ferguson has certainly generated a national conversation about race, about the over-militarization of local police departments, about the excessive use of force, and about the prosecutor's abuse of the notoriously unfair Grand Jury system. What we have not yet discussed, and need to, is the culture of hostility and impunity that has come to define too much of our nation's approach to policing.When I saw the excerpts of testimony from the Ferguson Grand Jury, I was immediately struck by one glaring discrepancy. It wasn't whether Michael had his hands up or down, whether he was charging or staggering, or whether Officer Darren Wilson gave fair warning before shooting. It was at the very beginning of the story where Wilson claims he said to Michael. ""Why don't you guys walk on the sidewalk?"", while Michael's friend, Dorian Johnson, claims that Wilson shouted, ""Get the F*** on the sidewalk."" I knew which account Tanya would believe.I must admit that I also found Johnson's recollection of the events of the day to be more believable. I've see such displays of ""in your face"" police hostility before. They happen too often, and too often they accelerate into violence, ending in tragedy. And therein lies the heart of the problem that we must acknowledge.After New York City recently declined to charge police in the homicide of Eric Garner, the New York Times ran a string of pictures of young black men who had similarly been victims of what the Times called ""fatal police encounters"" in the last decade. There are too many of these killings. Eugene Robinson, writing in the Washington Post, presents a tally suggesting over 1000 per year -- with too many of them being African American males or young men with disabilities.Reviewing the stories behind many of these killings, a pattern emerges of a hostile ""us versus them"" mentality on the part of the officers escalating into the use of brute force and tragic death.Race is a key factor here, but it is not only African American men who are victims of this pattern of behavior. I recall the story of Ethan Saylor, the young man with Down Syndrome who didn't understand why he had to leave the movie theater after the film he was watching had finished. Three off-duty Maryland policemen, working as security at the theater, instead of recognizing Ethan's disability and dealing with him accordingly, roughly wrestled him to the ground, handcuffed him and watched as he was suffocated to death. They, too, were acquitted. Ethan's story was not unlike that of Eric Garner who was killed when a New York City officer applied a banned choke hold. The video of handcuffed Garner laying on the ground saying ""I can't breathe"" as officers watch him die is sickening.Because of their long experience, African Americans understand the injustice and the horror of this out of control situation. A recent Washington Post poll found that while 58% of whites agreed with the Ferguson Grand Jury's decision not to indict Officer Wilson, 83% of African Americans disagreed. And a New York Times poll showed that 45% of African Americans believed that they had been treated badly by police, because of their race.Now I don't doubt for a moment, that many police officers feel at risk in many of the circumstances they are forced to confront. And I also know many good policemen and policewomen who are motivated by a strong commitment to community service -- and who often perform heroically saving lives, rescuing those in need, and defending the innocent. It is for the sake of these good officers and for the communities they serve that the culture of policing must change.I remember a few years back as we were being inundated by stories of pedophile clergy, a priest at my church took to the pulpit one Sunday and spoke from his heart. He decried the victimization of so many innocent children and condemned those who had committed these horrible criminal acts. But then he went on to denounce the bishops of his church who had for years covered up these crimes. My priest charged that these bishops had not only absolved criminal behavior and continued to put other children at risk, they had also made victims of good priests who were now being looked at, as a group, with suspicion. The same holds true in the case of police. The behavior of the hostile and threatening cop and the acquittal of those who have indiscriminately used unnecessary lethal force has cast a long shadow. That was why little Tanya couldn't even imagine a kind policeman.This is the discussion we must have. It's not just about the weapons police use or making them wear cameras. It's about the culture of hostility and impunity that has separated communities from the police. The problem doesn't begin with the patrolman on the beat. It begins with the training they receive and the bad behavior that is tolerated by those who lead them. And it won't change until the heads of departments take action to hold officers accountable for bad behavior and until prosecutors assume responsibility and indict police who use unreasonable force.Follow @AAIUSA for more."

(Cristina Fletes-Boutte/St. Louis Post-Dispatch/TNS via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8dfe52100002501c96848.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It is not my intention to take sides one way or the other on the decision of the grand jury relating to the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, by Darren Wilson, a police officer. My purpose here is to clear up some misunderstandings and incorrect information.The national news media have, for the most part, portrayed Ferguson as a small town located in the distant suburbs of St. Louis. Traveling by surface roads, Ferguson is about 1.5 miles from the City of St. Louis. St. Louis County is a large county: 524 square miles, consisting of ninety municipalities and ten unincorporated census-designated areas, with a total population of 1,001,500 people. The City of St. Louis is a county in itself and, therefore, is not included in St. Louis County. The City of Ferguson is one of the larger municipalities in St. Louis County, consisting of 6.2 square miles with a population of slightly over 21,000 people. There has been much criticism of the county prosecutor's decision to announce the results of the grand jury at night. The New York Times (11/26/14, p. A24) described it as a ""reckless"" decision because ""darkness placed the law enforcement agencies at a serious disadvantage as they tried to control the angry crowds..."" The prosecutor explained why he waited until 8:00 p.m. The school districts in Ferguson and some of the neighboring municipalities are relatively small, and large numbers of the children walk to and from school. Many stay for after-school activities, such as sports, music, and art. Many parents work, and some children stay at home by themselves until their parents get home, while others stay with neighbors or with babysitters.No one knew exactly what to expect immediately after the grand jury's verdict was announced. Most local law enforcement agencies, however, anticipated that regardless of what the grand jury decided there would probably be widespread demonstrations, expressing either jubilation or anger. There was area wide concern that if the verdict were announced early, the children could have trouble getting home or could be unintentionally injured by riotous crowds. There was also concern, which turned out to be justified, for the likelihood of streets being blocked and metro service running well behind schedule, making it difficult for parents to get home to their children. Even if the children did get home safely, they could well be afraid for their own safety if demonstrators got near their homes or worried about their parents being able to get home safely.   As it turned out, the demonstrations and looting were not restricted to the Ferguson area. There were violent demonstrations in several parts of the Greater St. Louis Area, far removed from Ferguson. To this writer, the prosecutor did not make a ""reckless"" decision in waiting until after children were safely home with their parents before announcing the grand jury decision. Much criticism has been leveled at the various law enforcement agencies for letting the demonstrations get out of hand and then using too much force in trying to keep the peace. But there was much behind-the-scenes planning that went on ahead of time, and hopes were high that the demonstrations would be peaceful.Local leaders of groups planning peaceful demonstrations worked with law enforcement agencies for several weeks, agreeing on ""ground rules"" for the demonstrations, including where the people would go and what they would do. Law enforcement personnel were being careful not to violate the rights of people to demonstrate in orderly fashion, so they worked in advance with leaders especially in the African American community of St. Louis in making plans. The local demonstration leaders assured the police that they would see to it that the demonstrations would be orderly. As it turned out, however, to the surprise of the police and the local organizers, the looters, trouble makers, and professional demonstrators from around the country just began appearing and mixing in with the orderly local demonstrators, and the demonstrations soon turned ugly. No one appeared to be in charge, and the demonstrations soon became angry mobs of looters determined to carry out a mission of destruction. The county attorney was not trusted by the black community because his father had been a police officer who was killed by an African American, and many people wanted him to step aside. But he is known as a very thorough and fair prosecutor, and he and the governor agreed that his stepping down would set a bad precedent for parties in future cases to argue that prosecutors they disliked should be replaced. The county attorney (prosecutor), therefore, took a different approach with the grand jury. Quoting from the same editorial mention above in The New York Times, ""Instead of conducting an investigation and then presenting the case and a recommendation of charges to the grand jury,"" the prosecutor ""made no recommendation on whether to indict the officer,"" leaving it to the grand jury to determine whether or not there was probable cause to indict the officer. The New York Times further suggested that this ""unorthodox"" approach ""undermined public confidence."" The Times said this approach caused the grand jury process to last ""an astonishing three months."" Many locals, however, suggest that the prosecutor was bending over backwards to be thorough and to avoid any perception of unfairness or rushing to judgment and that had he done otherwise the violence would have been even greater. Incidentally, the county prosecutor, Robert P. McCulloch, a democrat, historically has had bipartisan support as a popular prosecutor and has won re-election six times. Periodically major news agencies have reported leaks from the grand jury, the police, and from the prosecutor's office. As it turned out, there were no leaks from the grand jury and much of what was reported as having happened turned out to be the results of over-jealous reporters turning hearsay into fact. As I re-read what I have written, I realized that some readers might conclude that I am supporting the police, the police officer, and the prosecutor. That absolutely is not my intent. My intent is to provide a counter-balance to those in the national media who have added tragedy to an already tragic situation by not digging deeply into the facts prior to reporting or reporting from the perspective of their personal biases.The killing of Michael Brown is an absolute tragedy. I have every reason to believe that many lawsuits and investigations lie in waiting, and new facts may emerge. It is unimportant whether or not we agree with the decision of the grand jury or the juries of future trials and the actions of special investigations. The United States is a nation of laws, and the grand jury has spoken for now. We need to move forward in a peaceful, thoughtful and lawful manner. Regardless of personal feelings about what has happened, all of us need to do what we can to bring peace and understanding to people in Ferguson, the Greater St. Louis Area, and throughout the country. Interrupting public meetings with hate speech, destroying property worth millions of dollars, ruining mom and pop businesses, causing the loss of jobs for scores of people (many of them minorities), disrupting business in malls, and causing delays in local and freeway traffic just doesn't make sense. Let's take a deep breath and think seriously before we speak or act."

The university has suspended activities at all campus fraternal organizations amid an investigation into a published report in which a student described being sexually assaulted by seven men in 2012 at the Phi Kappa Psi house. (AP Photo/Steve Helber)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5fefc240000300098193b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Katie RacineReading Rolling Stone's article about the gang rape at the University of Virginia made bile rise in your throat, tears sting your eyes, and an emptiness grow inside you that anyone could be brutalized and dehumanized to such an extent. Maybe you had to walk away a few times, unable to stomach reading it at one sitting. Perhaps your first thought was for all the women you know in college and felt yourself filled with fear that it could be them. It's even possible it brought back long buried but never forgotten memories of your own of close calls or nights you wish you'd been anywhere else.Jackie's story made you feel. Its sensationalist portrayal of a vicious gang rape transported you into a darkened hazy room the likes of which you see on ""American Horror Story,"" not at the ""Ivy League of the South."" It filled you with rage that this could be happening on our campuses, where instead of being a bastion of learning, social status and the predatory sexual dominance of frat boys are given priority. You were enraged that a school would actively hide cases of sexual ""misconduct"" from its records because ""No one wants to go to a rape school,"" and when you read that her friends actively discouraged her from seeking help because it would hurt their social status, you despaired for humanity.The story spread across airwaves, social media, and campuses. UVa's reputation was unalterably and rightfully sullied as students tagged the building of the frat in question, rallied for change, and demanded their school right the wrongs decades in the making. The ongoing investigation of 55 colleges for mishandling sexual assault under Title IX was finally being taken seriously by the nation. Parents, students, and faculty alike were saying ""No more.""Through its horror, Jackie's story was an impetus, a fire lit in the hearts and minds that the time had come to stop letting rapists get away, to stop letting fear and peer pressure let barbaric acts be acceptable behavior in our society, and to shift the impetus of responsibility for stoping rape off the victims and on to the rapists. Finally, we thought, maybe things will change.And now it has come to light that maybe Jackie's story wasn't entirely true. That this graphic depiction was a combination of Rolling Stone's biased and shoddy journalism predetermining the story without all the facts, and a girl who never wanted to share her tale, who suffers from PTSD, and may not be able to ever remember accurately what happened. This girl who hid her identity and that of her rapists, who never wanted to press charges, and asked to be taken out of the story is now having her account picked apart and derailed. Her friends and activists are doubting her, Rolling Stone is revoking their support, and all the details that viscerally grabbed the nation by its guts are being doubted. It's the Duke case all over again, a woman cried rape, Rolling Stone jumped on the bandwagon, and in the end that case also fell apart. It's the same story, again and again, that discredits rape victims every day.So how are we meant to feel now? Angry? Duped? Disillusioned that yet again, right as the eyes of the world were taking seriously the very real facet of rape and sexual assault on our college campuses, that with one story's unraveling so too goes all that progress?So I say to you, so what? So what if this instance was more fictional than fact and didn't actually happen to Jackie? Do we actually want anyone to have gone through this? This story was a shock and awe campaign that forced even the most ardent of rape culture deniers to stand up in horror and demand action.We imagined ourselves, our sisters, daughters, and friends in the same situation. The countless women on that campus that have been raped, assaulted, harassed, and abused in frat parties and treated like they were nothing but an object to be used empathized with the story. Women across UVA and campuses across the nation were given courage to tell their stories of rape and of times they'd gone to their own school officials and been discouraged to report it. The proof is everywhere that the culture of sexaul assault described is a systemic problem, and not limited to this one brutality. That's why women and men alike took to the streets, to the papers, and the Internet; they rallied and said enough is enough and we will not stand for this anymore. And that is because in that story we were all Jackie. There are thousands of other Jackies whose stories are just as horrific and damning. And what did it hurt? Yes, Greek life was temporarily shut down for a few weeks at a school and investigations were created, but no names were released, no lives were ruined. Instead a school that knew this was a systemic problem took action and with the eyes of the world upon it took responsibility and committed to stopping this from happening. The rape culture we try so hard to deny was brought out from its diseased shadows and shocked people with its true face. Schools across the nation are scared because they knew it could have just as easily been their names in the news and the fear of that backlash can beget the change we so desperately need.Don't let the holes in this story diminish your rage, do not let the fire burning across our schools and nation be smothered by shoddy journalism and a troubled and traumatized girl who has clearly suffered. Don't let Rolling Stone pass the onus of fact finding onto victims for their own failure to investigate. Don't let this systemic disease fester and grow because of doubt and disdain.Fan the flames, stand strong, and remember when you were Jackie. Remember how that felt.And don't ever let it happen again.

John Campbell, the commander of international forces in Afghanistan, said last week the ongoing U.S. role would include limited air support to Afghan soldiers.Hagel, who resigned last week under pressure, said U.S. forces could fall only to 10,800 troops, rather than 9,800 as originally planned. The additional troops could stay until the first few months of 2015.""But the president's authorization will not change our troops' missions, or the long-term timeline for our drawdown,"" Hagel said on his last trip to the country as Pentagon chief.He appeared confident that the United States would secure support from NATO allies in the next few weeks that would allow U.S. force levels to drop back to 9,800. BLOODIEST YEARHagel's visit followed the bloodiest year in Afghanistan since the war against Taliban militants began in 2001.As of early November, about 4,600 members of the Afghan security forces had been killed in 2014, more than 6 percent higher than the same period of 2013.Even as U.S. officials including Hagel praised the accomplishments of Afghan forces, the high rate of Afghan casualties is seen as unsustainable and has raised questions about their vulnerability as foreign troops dwindle.Earlier, Hagel expressed confidence in the ability of Afghan forces to defend Kabul following the spike in attacks.U.S. President Barack Obama's drawdown strategy has attracted criticism, including from Republicans in Congress, who say gains against the Taliban could be lost in much the same way that violence returned to Iraq after the U.S. withdrawal.Hagel warned against drawing comparisons between Iraq and Afghanistan, saying Afghans want U.S. forces to stay.""Are there (security) gaps? Are there continued challenges? And threats? Absolutely,"" Hagel acknowledged, noting Afghanistan would still struggle with ""pockets"" of Taliban resistance.The Taliban have become increasingly bold in their attacks and control several districts across a country where access to many areas is still limited by rugged terrain and poor security.

""The waters have risen now.""There was no word of any casualties.Hagupit had weakened to a category 3 storm, two notches below ""super typhoon,"" but could still unleash huge destruction with torrential rain and potentially disastrous storm surges of up to 4.5 meters (15 ft), the weather bureau PAGASA said.The eye of the typhoon hit the town of Dolores, Eastern Samar at 9:15 p.m. (1315 GMT), PAGASA said, adding the storm maintained its strength, with winds of up to 175 kph (110 mph) near the center and gusts of up to 210 kph (130 mph).""We can expect that heavy rains were dumped on Eastern Samar because Ruby hovered for a long time over the coastal areas,"" weather forecaster Jori Loiz said on radio, referring to the local name of typhoon Hagupit.The weather bureau said Hagupit - which means ""lash"" in Filipino - maintained its projected path towards Masbate, Romblon and Oriental Mindoro provinces, slightly north of areas devastated by super typhoon Haiyan last year.PAGASA earlier said the storm was moving north northwest at 16 kph (10 mph).""Ruby's lashing will be severe,"" Interior Secretary Manuel Roxas told government radio.

Egyptian court had been dropped the charges against former Egyptian stronghold president Hosni Mubarak that he incited the killing of protesters in 2011. (Photo by Stringer/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc141f0240000320076f138.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every week, The WorldPost asks an expert to shed light on a topic driving headlines around the world. Today, we look at the situation in Egypt and former President Hosni Mubarak’s murder trial.In a controversial verdict, an Egyptian court dropped murder charges against the country's former President Hosni Mubarak last Saturday. The ousted strongman was on trial for the killing of 239 protesters during the 2011 revolution against his 30-year-rule. The prospect that 86-year-old Mubarak would walk free sparked both celebration and despair. While the courtroom erupted in cheers, relatives of the slain demonstrators waiting outside fell to the ground in anguish. Following the decision, thousands of protesters headed back to Tahrir Square, the epicenter of the 2011 protests, and at least two were killed in clashes with police. Prosecutors are appealing Saturday’s verdict. Another court ruling on Tuesday further exacerbated tensions. In the third mass death sentence this year, a court ordered the execution of 188 people for a deadly attack on a police station last summer. The ruling is pending approval from Egypt's highest religious authority and will most likely be appealed. The WorldPost spoke to Khaled Fahmy, history professor at the American University in Cairo, about the significance of the latest trials and the state of post-revolution Egypt.Why were the charges against Mubarak dismissed?They were dismissed on technical grounds. The judge argued that Mubarak’s name was not initially added to the prosecutor’s list of defendants in the original trial, but only later because of popular pressure. So he decided that since the original prosecutor had apparently not been confident enough to charge Mubarak, there was no point in investigating whether he was guilty or not of the charges related to the deaths of protesters. How has the judge’s ruling been received in Egypt? While this was in one sense a trial of Mubarak and the other defendants, it was also a trial of the whole revolution. Like in any revolution, there were people who supported it and others’ who didn’t. Some people welcomed this verdict as an indictment of the whole revolution. They are not only people connected to the old regime, but members of the public who fault the revolution for increasing insecurity and for the economic downturn. They don’t love Mubarak or want him back, but many people are tired of the years of turmoil, the dire economic situation and the threat of domestic and international terrorism. Mubarak is a symbol of the anti-revolution. Supporters of the revolution are dismayed by the verdict. It is an important sign -- not the first and it will not be the last -- of the success of the counter-revolution since (current President) Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi took over. There has been an active movement to arrest the revolutionaries and roll back every achievement of the revolution. Now, even Mubarak may no longer be behind bars.What’s the current Egyptian government’s stance? Officially, the government says it does not comment on judicial proceedings, but I regard the verdict as sign that the government is barely even keeping up the pretense of an independent judiciary. The government is willing to sacrifice the whole judiciary for the sake of stability -- and the trade-off is a fallacy.How does the legal system’s treatment of Mubarak and his cronies differ from that of Muslim Brotherhood supporters?When hundreds have been sentenced to death for the killing of several police officers, but not one person has been found guilty for the deaths of hundreds of protesters, the difference is pretty clear. The mass trials were a reckless move. People have no faith in the independence of the judiciary. This is dangerous -- even in an authoritarian system it's important that the judiciary has a semblance of impartiality, otherwise people take the law into their own hands.I don’t think the death sentences will be carried out. But even if they are commuted to life sentences or overturned on appeal, people’s lives have been ruined and many through no fault of their own. The mass verdicts affected all kinds of people, not just Muslim Brotherhood supporters, including Christians, minors, even some people who had died before the trial. This was a travesty of justice on many levels.Will anyone ever be prosecuted for the killing of protesters during the 2011 revolution?The relatives of hundreds of people killed during the revolution still hope for justice. Egypt will see no stability in the long run unless we have a proper process of transitional justice -- firstly, by acknowledging what happened, then bringing perpetrators to justice and compensation for the victims. We’re not even at the first stage yet. The latest trial actually took us back several steps. A previous ruling established that people had died, and said there was compelling but insufficient evidence they were killed by police fire, but that it was unclear who issued the orders to shoot. Now the whole issue of what happened to the hundreds who died is treated as an irrelevance. The government is concerned with exonerating Mubarak, not finding out who killed these people.I think the next stage will be a concerted effort by the government to provide an answer to this question, which will be to blame the Muslim Brotherhood. We will see suggestions that the events of 2011 were not a revolution, but a conspiracy manipulated by the Muslim Brotherhood.Will people accept this answer?Yes, because this government already killed nearly 1,000 people during protests against President Mohammed Morsi’s ouster last summer, and got away with it. Why would they not get away with a lesser lie? People are willing to believe anything to avoid seeing the reality in front of them -- that their fellow citizens have been killed and arrested based on their beliefs. I’m afraid of what will happen when people wake up to how deeply morally implicated they are in turning a blind eye to the treatment of their neighbors, their colleagues, even their loved ones, just because they are members of the Muslim Brotherhood. This realization will be a psychological shock on a national scale.How does the current Egyptian regime to compare that under Mubarak?We are in a much worse situation that under Mubarak. The counter-revolution has won spectacularly. The current regime has killed more Egyptians than under the previous three regimes. And this has happened with the complicity and acquiescence of a huge segment of the population. Did the 2011 revolution change anything at all?Things can never go back to exactly what they were. Things have happened, red lines have been crossed, taboos have been violated, and we can’t just put the genie back in the bottle. Politics is back in Egypt. People breathe, think, talk politics all the time. The revolution opened up big questions about things like the role of the army and the relationship between religion and politics, and they exploded in our faces. But we did something in Tahrir that has never been done in the history of Egypt, going all the way back to the pyramids. We toppled a president, even though we did not topple a regime. The current regime is afraid of people fully realizing their own power. That is why the government is trying to rewrite the history of the revolution and is telling Egyptians that they were manipulated rather than causing change by their own free will. But hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets during the revolution and they were asking a fundamental question -- whose state is this? We want the police to protect, not torture; the army to protect our borders, not kill us in our cities; the judiciary to protect the citizens, not the government. We revolted to say we cannot go on with this. The government drew completely the opposite lessons from the revolution. They rejected reform and now contest the the history of the revolution itself. "
10,RELIGION,Pope Francis Critics Cite Conclave Conspiracy To Question His Papacy,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pope-francis-conclave-conspiracy_n_6277614.html,,2014-12-06,"Pope Francis listens to a speech during a special audience he held for members of the FOCSIV Italian Catholic volunteers, at the Vatican, Thursday, Dec. 4, 2014. (AP Photo/Andrew Medichini)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7f3bb240000300098ad6e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK (RNS) Was there a secret plot to elect Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio at the papal conclave last year?Did Bergoglio — who became Pope Francis at that conclave — give the go-ahead to such a plan?And does that campaign call his election, and his papacy, into question?Such questions might sound like plot twists to a new Vatican thriller by Dan Brown, but they are actually the latest talking points promoted by some Catholic conservatives upset with the direction that Francis is leading the church.The furor stems from a behind-the-scenes account of the March 2013 conclave, presented in a new book about Francis titled “The Great Reformer: Francis and the Making of a Radical Pope.”In the last chapter of the biography, which focuses on Bergoglio’s early life in Argentina and career as a Jesuit, author Austen Ivereigh delivers an insider account of how a group of cardinals who wanted a reformer pope quietly sought to rally support for Bergoglio in the days leading up to the conclave.Cardinals take an oath not to divulge details of a conclave and Ivereigh based his account on background interviews with cardinals who took part.He called Francis’ boosters “Team Bergoglio.” They were led by reform-minded European churchmen like Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O’Connor of England, who Ivereigh once worked for, and German prelates like Cardinal Walter Kasper, who has become a trusted theological adviser to Francis.At one point, Ivereigh writes that members of “Team Bergoglio” sought the Argentine cardinal’s “assent” that he would not refuse the papacy if the voting turned his way. During the 2005 conclave, Bergoglio reportedly refused to take up the mantle when he was running second to Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who would eventually be elected Pope Benedict XVI.This time, Ivereigh writes, Bergoglio “said that he believed that at this time of crisis for the Church no cardinal could refuse if asked.”In conclaves, cardinals often signal whether they would refuse or go along with an election, if it happened.Also, while overt politicking is strongly discouraged, and conclave rules expressly forbid dealmaking, cardinals often coalesce in camps behind one contender or another.But when Ivereigh’s book was published last month (he personally presented a copy to Francis), media accounts of the politics of the conclave prompted some to question whether Bergoglio himself was involved by giving the go-ahead, and whether that could undermine the legitimacy of his election.Murphy-O’Connor’s press secretary wrote a letter to a British newspaper saying that no approach had been made to Bergoglio seeking his assent.And on Monday (Dec. 1), the Rev. Federico Lombardi, Vatican spokesman, issued a statement saying the cardinals cited “have expressly denied this description of events, both in terms of the demand for a prior consent by Cardinal Bergoglio and with regard to the conduct of a campaign for his election.”Church sources said the Vatican’s quick reaction was an indication of how concerned Rome is that Francis’ opponents will use any pretext to try to sow doubts about him and his papacy.Ivereigh, a leading Vatican expert who was in New York this week to promote his book, said Tuesday (Dec. 2) that he stands by his reporting. But Ivereigh said he regretted phrasing the episode to make it seem that Bergoglio had been approached about being a candidate and gave his backers encouragement.“That never happened and I am sorry that I gave the impression that’s what happened,” Ivereigh told Religion News Service. “I think the whole chapter makes clear that he never had any role at all in his own election.”Ivereigh said he was trying to show that as opposed to the 2005 conclave, Bergoglio’s supporters in 2013 “were convinced he wouldn’t resist his election.”“The conclave rules do not prevent cardinals from urging other cardinals to vote for a particular person,” he added. “And indeed that is exactly what happens. That is part of the discernment that happens in a papal election.”Ivereigh said he will be changing the wording of one paragraph in future editions of the book to clarify Bergoglio’s role. (NOTE: See text of the wording change at the end of this story.)Whether that will satisfy the critics is unclear.Some fringe elements in the Catholic Church have proposed various theories they claim might either invalidate the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI in February 2013 or the election of Francis the following month.Others see the accounts of conclave machinations as further evidence that Pope Francis is, for them, a far more manipulative and autocratic figure than the public believes.Ivereigh says that in future reprints of “The Great Reformer,” the paragraph at the top of Page 355 will be amended as follows:EXISTING  They had learned their lessons from 2005. They first secured Bergoglio’s assent. Asked if he was willing, he said that he believed that at this time of crisis for the Church no cardinal could refuse if asked.NEW In keeping with conclave rules, they did not ask Bergoglio if he would be willing to be a candidate. But they believed this time that the crisis in the Church would make it hard for him to refuse if elected."
11,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Gratifies A Major Donor In Israel-Centric Conversation,Samantha Lachman and Donté Stallworth,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-israel-saban_n_6278360.html,,2014-12-06,"Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton waves as she is introduced to speak at the Massachusetts Conference for Women in Boston, Thursday, Dec. 4, 2014. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8dfd92100005002c96846.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton presented herself as both a staunch defender of Israel’s security and a supporter of continued negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program in a wide-ranging conversation about foreign policy Friday. “The relationship between the United States and Israel is solid, and will remain solid, and will be part of our foreign policy and our domestic concerns, our values, ideals, forever,” Clinton said in response to a question about the sometimes fractious relationship between President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. She called the relationship between the two countries ""mature"" and said differences between the two leaders were ""honest."" Clinton spoke at an intimate dinner at the eleventh annual Saban Forum, with billionaire Israeli-American media and entertainment mogul Haim Saban. His forum, in partnership with the Brookings Institution, brings together government officials, policymakers and business leaders each year. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, have made regular appearances at the Saban Forum, which isn’t surprising given that the billionaire has donated millions to the Clintons' philanthropic foundation and was a key player in her first presidential campaign. As Clinton inches closer to a possible bid for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, her sit-down with Saban allowed her to stress her support for Israel in front of a crowd filled with members of Netanyahu’s now-dissolving coalition government, as well as leaders of the opposition parties. Saban has said that he is willing to give “as much as needed” to get Clinton elected and that he would “pitch in with full might” because her presidency is a “big dream” of his. Yet Clinton's conversation with Saban avoided directly addressing the 2016 question, as the two coyly danced around the subject by talking about her new grandchild. The billionaire, who was born in Israel and calls himself a “one-issue guy” when it comes to his politics, has said that he considers a nuclear Iran “an existential danger” to Israel. He is, however, less conservative than one of his billionaire political donor counterparts, casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, and has voiced his support for a Palestinian state. Clinton, who received flack at 2012’s Saban forum for saying that Israel had displayed a “lack of generosity” and a “lack of empathy” toward Palestinians, reiterated her support for a two-state solution to the conflict, but avoided chastising Israel for West Bank settlement construction, as she has in the past. “There is a necessary imperative to continue to try to achieve a resolution between Israel and the Palestinians,” she said. “The two state solution … remains an important and, I would argue, essential concept to bring people together around.” Israel’s government will go to elections next year in an especially fraught period for the stalled peace process. Clinton acknowledged those tensions for those in the room, and beyond, who maintain that Israel cannot relinquish its occupation of the West Bank for security reasons. “Now I’m well aware of everything going on and the increasing tensions in the region, in Israel, in the West Bank to say nothing of the continuing aggressive behavior from Hamas coming out of Gaza,” she said. “But the absence of negotiations leaves a vacuum that gets filled by problems, bad actors, threats, other kinds of behavior that are not good for Israel and not good for the Palestinians.” In November, Saban said President Barack Obama had “shown too many carrots and a very small stick” in his administration’s dealings with Iran, and voiced support for legislation that would require Obama to gain congressional approval for any nuclear deal. Over the last year, Clinton has begun to strike a more cautious tone in her discussions of nuclear negotiations. Though she asked the Senate not to impose new sanctions on Iran in February, she said in May that she was “personally skeptical that the Iranians would follow through and deliver” on a nuclear deal and that “every other option does remain on the table” if negotiations fall apart. Now that the negotiations have been extended for another seven months, Clinton said they should be allowed to continue. “I think its a very important effort to continue to pursue and to see if we can reach an agreement that’s in line with our requirements,” she said, after she explained, as she has in the past, that the United States must be “clear in any deal of what the consequences would be of any violation, and that would include, as we say, keeping all options on the table.” Clinton said the nuclear program isn’t “the only problem we have with Iran.” “Iran’s sponsorship of terrorism, Iran’s support for [Syrian President Bashar] Assad and the havoc that that has wreaked, support for Hezbollah, the continuing pressure on providing arms to Hamas and so much else that it engages in in the region that causes great concern to Israel, our Arab partners in the gulf, that’s all part of the ongoing challenge that Iran poses,” she said. Despite the tensions, Clinton invoked the words of the former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill to make her case that it was worth staying the diplomatic course. “Better to jaw-jaw than to war-war,” she said, paraphrasing Churchill.

It's a fairly new relationship, inspired by Nora Ephron. It elongates my neck, keeps me warm and has a simple elegance to it. It's a perfect winter staple because you can wear it with anything- jeans, skirts, under button-ups or dresses- offering a myriad of versatile layering options. After all, that's what winter dressing is really all about. But, as well all know, it is the ones we love that always end up hurting us. The first sign, like a boyfriend with some major trust issues, is that it's hard to get in. You have to really push! Sometimes my favorite cotton black turtleneck and I fight. It forces me to squirm and pull and yank at a garment that I can't go more than a few days without. The sleeves feel shorter, and it rides up too much, exposing my bare midriff. It closes in on my neck, leaving no room for escape. My hands ultimately come to the rescue, and try to stretch the seams until the claustrophobic feelings are relieved. Dressing for winter means having to troubleshoot wardrobe malfunctions on a regular basis. If your turtleneck doesn't go in for the kill, your scarf will. Sleeves and endless layers bunch up under bulky jackets and have you twisting and turning until you can straighten yourself out. And don't even get me started on the morning commute to work. By the time you make it to the subway with cold flushed red cheeks, waves of heat start coming in. With nowhere to take your jacket off, the most you can do is unzip it. Are you feeling sweaty yet? Probably. And then the ever imminent question, where do you put your scarf, hat and gloves if they're covered in snow? What's a little perspiration compared to frostbite though? While I continue to drag my transitional jackets through puffy jacket territory, I take comfort in the fact Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen look this good while most likely hiding their discomfort while wearing what appears to be at least 6 scarves. But hey, to each their own when it comes to winter fashion in a sea full of White Walkers."

Labor activists and financial reform experts have heralded the rule as a critical step toward enhancing retirement security. The policy would impose a ""fiduciary duty"" on financial professionals who oversee retirement accounts, barring them from considering the potential profits of their own firm when choosing investments. Instead, investment managers would have to pick stocks, bonds and other assets based only on what was in the best interest of retirees.The rule was first introduced by the Department of Labor in 2010, but was tabled in 2011 after massive pushback from the financial industry. Consumer advocates have been pressing the Labor Department to implement the rule. But according to House Democratic staffers, top negotiators in the latest budget talks are considering a plan that would effectively gut it. Republicans are pushing a budget rider that would require the Labor Department to mediate its rule with the more corporate-friendly Securities and Exchange Commission, which financial reform experts said they believe would render the proposal toothless, if it ever made it out of the bureaucratic negotiations at all. The GOP-led House has voted to block the Labor Department from moving forward with the rule in the past.As defined-benefit pensions gradually disappear from the U.S. workplace, workers are increasingly relying on 401(k) plans for retirement security. Backers of the fiduciary rule say it would give workers some basic protection by discouraging 401(k) brokers from pushing plans based on the fees going to those brokers' firms -- fees that, over the course of a worker's career, can significantly eat into a retirement plan's potential growth.""That's why it's needed -- to have some consumer protection,"" said Robert Hiltonsmith, an expert on retirement security at Demos, a left-leaning think tank. ""Now, unless they voluntarily become a fiduciary ... they are not legally required to act in your best interests at all. They work in their firms' best interest, which is not yours.""By subjecting the Labor Department rule to SEC consideration, opponents of the rule would be able to vote to hamstring it without formally casting a vote to terminate a straightforward retirement security provision. Opponents of rules targeting Wall Street derivatives -- the complex financial products at the heart of the 2008 banking meltdown -- have pushed several bills that would have required the SEC to sign off on new regulations required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law.House leadership is taking the plan seriously, however, in talks over the so-called CROmnibus -- a budget package that would fund parts of the government through the end of next year, and other parts for only a few weeks. While most of the talk over the funding bill has revolved around Republican retribution for President Barack Obama's executive order shielding millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation, Wall Street lobbyists have been advocating for their own relief. Banks are also pressing Congress to curb one reform to the derivatives market that were passed under Dodd-Frank. That bill had banned banks from trading some derivatives from subsidiaries that receive taxpayer insurance, a provision that lawmakers are considering delaying or rolling back.""We cannot allow Wall Street banks to add any provisions to the year-end spending bill that would continue to leave taxpayers on the hook and undermine the ability of regulators to prevent future bailouts,"" Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) said Friday in a statement.It was unclear whether either the fiduciary duty law or the derivatives language will make the final House budget bill, or whether the Senate would include either in its own legislation. A House proposal is expected by Monday evening. If Congress does not vote to fund the government for at least a short period by Thursday, the government will shut down."

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8dfdc24000031005775b0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department this week convinced the local prosecutor's office to charge a prominent young Ferguson protester with misdemeanor assault because he allegedly made fleeting physical contact with a law enforcement official blocking access to St. Louis City Hall during a demonstration last month.Rasheen Aldridge, a 20-year-old community activist, has been protesting in and around the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson on a regular basis ever since then-police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown on Aug. 9. Last month, Gov. Jay Nixon (D) named him to the Ferguson Commission, a task force intended to address problems in the St. Louis region that were highlighted in the wake of Brown's death. On Dec. 1, Aldridge was at the White House to meet with President Barack Obama to discuss the relationship between law enforcement and local communities. (He later said he left the meeting ""disappointed"" with Obama, whom he used to consider his ""idol."")It's no surprise, then, that the misdemeanor assault charge brought by St. Louis Circuit Attorney Jennifer Joyce against Aldridge grabbed local and even international headlines and gained traction in conservative circles. After all, a story about a prominent Ferguson protester being charged with assault fits in perfectly with the broad generalizations that many have made about those demonstrators: namely, that they're violent ""thugs"" with no respect for the law.""From street mob activist to White House guest,"" conservative blogger Jim Hoft wrote on his website, Gateway Pundit, about the charge against Aldridge. ""Torch a town -- Get invited to White House!"" he added. But Hoft offered absolutely no proof that Aldridge had participated in any capacity in the looting, vandalism and arson that hit parts of Ferguson after a grand jury decided not to indict Wilson in Brown's death last month.One video of the alleged misdemeanor assault appears to show Aldridge, in a gray cap, attempting to gain access to St. Louis City Hall along with a number of other demonstrators on Nov. 26, less than 48 hours after the grand jury decision was announced. At the time, the public building was on lockdown because authorities thought someone in the crowd may have had spray paint.  Rasheen Aldridge (center in the gray cap) shortly before he came into brief contact with a city marshal (left) as protesters tried to enter St. Louis City Hall on Nov. 26, 2014. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)Aldridge -- who is just 5 feet 4 inches tall and weighs 110 pounds, according to court documents -- seems to be trying to open a City Hall door as a much larger city marshal stands guard. The marshal then appears to shove Aldridge, and the protester's hand touches and perhaps pushes the official.Soon after the incident, police in riot gear wielding pepper spray would break up the demonstration around City Hall, claiming that the entire daytime assembly was unlawful because a few demonstrators ""made contact"" with law enforcement.Susan Ryan, a spokeswoman for the Office of the St. Louis Circuit Attorney, emphasized that the third-degree assault charge against Aldridge is the ""lowest-level misdemeanor available under the law."" Aldridge has not been arrested, according to Ryan. Instead, she said, ""He'll get a note in the mail, just like a parking ticket.""Ryan said that the prosecutor's office had a duty to evaluate the case after it was referred to the office by the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department.""When we've got evidence that somebody has violated the law, then we review that evidence, and if we believe we can prove it beyond a reasonable doubt, we will charge somebody,"" Ryan said. ""All over the county, protesters are being arrested for violating the law, and it's unfortunate. But there are peaceful ways to protest without shoving city marshals or without hurting police officers.""Joyce, the circuit attorney, made a similar point in an interview with a local Fox station.""This has nothing to do with the protest or the speech or anything that anybody was saying,"" Joyce said. ""You can say anything you want, but what you can't do is physically, you know, touch someone or push them or shove them or spit on them. And so that's the line, and that line was crossed here.""Aldridge is a first-time offender, according to Ryan, and it is ""highly unlikely"" that he will face any jail time if he is found guilty. ""He'll probably get probation, and he'll probably get a probation that would require some community service, and after a certain amount of time it would be erased from his record,"" she said, while adding that it was not her decision to make.Ryan said that Aldridge's role on the Ferguson Commission did not play any part in the decision to charge him. She referred questions about the police investigation to the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department, but a spokeswoman there declined an interview request because the case is now in the hands of the circuit attorney. Ryan said that her office was in a ""no win"" situation because of Aldridge's higher profile.""If the evidence was there, and it was, and if we had decided not to charge him because of his role on the commission, we would have been criticized for having him have special treatment,"" Ryan said. ""If we charge him based upon the evidence, then we're criticized for charging someone who is on the commission.""But the lack of any sort of swift disciplinary action against many police officers who used very aggressive force against peaceful demonstrators in the months after Brown's death versus the speedy charges against one prominent protester for very minor physical contact with a law enforcement official raises concerns in the community.""The contrast that we see ... between the actions of police that are caught on camera versus the actions of protesters that are caught on camera, how and whether these things are prosecuted -- the disparity is remarkable,"" Rev. Starsky Wilson, the co-chair of the Ferguson Commission, told The Huffington Post.""I've had a team of my church members who have been involved in actions, including being present for some of those actions downtown last Wednesday, and they were concerned about the level of aggression that they saw from police out on those lines, particularly from City Hall,"" Wilson said.The Don't Shoot Coalition issued a statement condemning the ""retaliatory"" action and declaring that it fit into a pattern of ""exaggerated charges"" being brought against protesters.“Numerous activists in our movement have been followed, harassed and intimidated by the St. Louis Metropolitan Police and other local police agencies,” Michael T. McPhearson, co-chair of the Don’t Shoot Coalition, said in a statement. “The treatment of Rasheen stands out as politically motivated in response to his leadership on the ground and as a Ferguson Commission member.”So far, the charge seems unlikely to affect Aldridge's role on the Ferguson Commission. Wilson said that Aldridge's perspective is ""remarkably valuable for the work that we have to do."" Representatives of Gov. Nixon's office did not respond to a request for comment.Chris King, managing editor of The St. Louis American, said that he was made aware of one of the videos showing Aldridge's interaction with the marshal before the charge was brought forward and that he believed the charge was ""avoidable.""""In a way, if you think about it, it makes him even a better commissioner, given the role he was expected to play on the [Ferguson] Commission, which is a kid that's been there,"" King said. ""How perfect that he's appointed as the youth protester commissioner and then gets [charged].""Aldridge's lawyer told The St. Louis American that he planned to fight the case. “This is a bogus charge. Looking at the video, you don’t see him intentionally act against that law enforcement officer,"" said Jerryl Christmas.Aldridge did not respond to HuffPost's interview request, but tweeted on Friday that ""Fighting against injustices is in my DNA cant stop me even if they tried."""

The Liverpool striker has been charged by the English Football Association over a racially-charged Instagram post.Balotelli, who has been subjected to racist chants by fans during his tumultuous career, reposted an image on Dec. 1 of video game character Mario of the ""Super Mario"" franchise that included offensive text. Beneath the seemingly positive slogan ""Don't Be Racist"" there was an image of the character and text that read: ""Be like Mario, he's an Italian plumber, created by Japanese people, who speaks English and looks like a Mexican. He jumps like a black man and grabs coins like a Jew,"" reported ESPN FC.The 24-year-old Italy star eventually deleted the image, but not before it garnered plenty of attention. In attempting to defend the reposted image, Balotelli pointed out that his adoptive mother is Jewish. A day later, he apologized for the incident, claiming it was an attempt at a humorous anti-racism message that he posted in part because of his own ""Super Mario"" nickname.The defense and apology were apparently not enough to keep the FA from charging him for an alleged ""Aggravated Breach"" of its rules on Friday. Balotelli could face a five-game suspension, reported The Washington Post. According to the FA, Balotelli has until Dec. 15 to respond to the charge.""We acknowledge the FA's decision and the player will work through the process to answer the charge,"" a Liverpool spokesman told BBC Sport.

(AP Photo/Mark Humphrey)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7f3b7240000310098ad6a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON (RNS) “African-American brothers and sisters, especially brothers, in this country are more likely to be arrested, more likely to be executed, more likely to be killed.”It’s the kind of statement that’s often cited by black clergy and civil rights activists. But hours after a grand jury on Wednesday (Dec. 3) chose not to indict the New York City police officer who put Eric Garner into a fatal choke hold on Staten Island, those words came from none other than white evangelical leader Russell Moore.With back-to-back grand jury decisions that white police officers will not face charges in the deaths of unarmed black men, white Christians, including evangelicals, have grown more vocal in urging predominantly white churches to no longer turn a blind eye to injustice and to bridge the country’s racial divides.“It’s time for us in Christian churches to not just talk about the gospel but live out the gospel by tearing down these dividing walls not only by learning and listening to one another but also by standing up and speaking out for one another,” said Moore, president of the Southern Baptist Convention’s Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission.Other white evangelicals issued similar pleas.“I weep & pray for his family,” tweeted Danny Akin, president of Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, the day before he led a prayer for justice at his school in Wake Forest, N.C. “I beg our God to bring good out of this tragedy.”“’Love your neighbor as yourself’ means you picture yourself being choked and surrounded by five men while you say, ‘I can’t breathe,’” tweeted Scott Slayton, a white Southern Baptist pastor in Chelsea, Ala.The Rev. Alan Cross, a white pastor in Montgomery, Ala., said the publicized video of Garner’s choke hold has moved some white Christians to speak when they might not have after Officer Darren Wilson was cleared in the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. Cross is encouraging them to not just speak but listen to black people’s perspectives instead of only considering their own.“What often happens when white evangelicals try to speak into this is that we continue to think first in terms of our own position,” said Cross, a Southern Baptist and author of “When Heaven and Earth Collide: Racism, Southern Evangelicals, and the Better Way of Jesus.”“We should consider what people in the black community are saying, what are they going through, what is their experience.”Cross and others went online in the hours after the Garner decision to share how blacks were reacting. Author Barnabas Piper chose to post what others were saying about Ferguson and Garner on his blog, saying as “a young white man” he wasn’t in the best position to explain it all.“Put yourself in the shoes of the authors and immerse yourself in the experiences they describe,” he wrote. “You and I need to do so if we want to contribute anything to stopping injustice and closing the racial gap that exists.”The Rev. Barbara Williams-Skinner, co-chair of the National African-American Clergy Network, sees a growing interest among white Christians and others to speak up about the “pile on” of events capped with the Garner decision.“It just so offends the human spirit of people of every race that it compels them to act,” she said. “We don’t have to ask young white students and young white adults anymore to act. They understand … if the system will so violate the rights of people of color today, they will violate everybody’s rights tomorrow.”She had already witnessed an interest across races in the Ferguson events when her network’s planned letter on justice from black church leaders took on a more interracial feel.Even before the Garner decision, the progressive Christian group Sojourners had gathered 50 leaders, including black clergy and white evangelicals, for a retreat on Tuesday and Wednesday that included a “historic pilgrimage of racialized St. Louis” and a discussion of theological implications for “our nation’s broken justice system.”“There were white evangelicals in the room in Ferguson who were weeping when the Garner decision came down,” said the Rev. Jim Wallis, founder of the Washington-based social justice group.White Christians beyond evangelicalism added their voices to the outcry about the ruling.“The degradation and demeaning of black life must stop,” said Serene Jones, president of New York’s Union Theological Seminary. “What the hell kind of country do we live in?”Moore, noting some of the reaction after he called for racial reconciliation in the wake of the Ferguson strife, said some white Christians see no reason to speak up for better race relations.“I have gotten responses, and seen responses, that are right out of the White Citizens’ Council material from 1964 in my home state of Mississippi, seeing people saying there is no gospel issue involved with racial reconciliation,” he said in a podcast.He doesn’t agree with them.“Are you kidding me? There is nothing that is clearer in the New Testament than the fact that the gospel breaks down the dividing walls that we have between one another.”"

But based on the exhortation of Jesus to ""the least of these"" in Matthew 25, I do believe that Jesus inhabits the marginalized and oppressed more fully than anyone else. In this society, black bodies are under the constant assault of all manners of marginalizations and oppressions. In the passion of Eric Garner, I believe Jesus died.In the graveyard, Jesus lies dead along with all of us. Our society died when it chose to believe that racism is a historical artifact.

I know I can't trust government to do better. I know that capitalism remains as prejudiced as ever. I look around and see only death. In desperation, I reply to Jesus, ""I don't think so. I think we are too far gone. I don't think there is any hope. People are so racist, and racism is so ingrained in all that we do."" Then Jesus replied to me in the words of Ezekiel 37:9, ""Prophesy to the breath.... [B]reathe into these slain, that they may live."" I remembered the last words of Eric Garner: ""I can't breathe.""

19,HEALTHY LIVING,The Pain of Absence and Presence,"Catherine Nagle, ContributorWife, Mother, Grandmother, Homemaker, Writer, Author",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-pain-of-absence-and-p_b_6274724.html,,2014-12-06,2014-12-05-SeniorsLivingAloneWithAlzheimersDisease.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-05-SeniorsLivingAloneWithAlzheimersDisease-thumb.jpg,"With 23 years between my two children, I entered a different world in 1995 when my second child was born. As an old-schooled mom, I wasn't familiar and grew terribly confused by the aggressive parenting style I encountered the second time around. But I continued raising my second child in the same way as my first, having learned my mother's devout teachings ""to feel what another feels by walking in the other's shoes."" To this day, I'm pleased with the results whenever I put her words into action.An example of my mother's wisdom: When my first husband was critically ill and in the hospital, I spent endless days and nights by his side while my daughter stayed with my parents. Every night I'd come home after my daughter had just fallen asleep. Already feeling guilty for leaving the hospital, I now had to face my mom's complaints that I didn't get home soon enough to tuck my daughter into bed yet again! Heartbroken, I wondered why Mom didn't realize that I had no choice. Yet she could only hear my daughter cries, ""Mom-mom, when are mommy and daddy ever coming home?"" Mom went on to explain that my daughter at only age 5 didn't understand my absence, whether due to being in the hospital with her ill father, working in another town, or even out shopping. At the time, I felt my mother was insensitive to my situation, but I've since realized that she was right, coming to understand that young children feel even more emotional emptiness from a parent's absences, regardless of the reason. In truth, my mother was seeing the larger picture, having put herself in all our shoes, especially her 5-year-old granddaughter's vulnerability.I've since seen the tears that follow when children's needs are not fully considered, regardless of whether the separation results from parents over-working, tending to others, or other demands preventing parents from being with their children. I believe we are missing out when we ignore our most important guidance by busying ourselves with what society values instead of making our children our top priority. Perhaps it was my experience of being left alone and the pressure to keep up that opened up my eyes.  Think about it: Have you ever felt disappointed or sad when your spouse or partner can't make it home for one reason or another? Did you feel a sting from their absence? I don't know about you, but many a time throughout my life, I've felt that sinking feeling of disappointment. Now, can't you imagine how this must feel to a child? How are they supposed to deal with this feeling? And yet, how many times do we disappoint our children who are eagerly waiting for us? This is powerful when we realize what our own absence might feel like for a child and her intense feeling of being let down. Adults talk endlessly about their pain when their spouse is too busy for them and some go into counseling. There is an infrastructure supporting working mothers with day-care that may permit even further absence. We support parents who seek higher education to earn their degrees, which is a blessing for those parents but not always fulfilling for their children. This is a gray area in which we have to consider the entire picture and decide what's best for everyone. These days I sense a silent cry from the children greater than before. I sometimes wonder if we were to ask our children whether they'd prefer their parents be more of a go-getter attaining awards, degrees, and achievements and fatter paycheck or if they'd just want us closer to them. It's not so different from wanting our spouses or partners to be with us as much as possible. I've learned that a great many people feel discontent over their spouse's absences, and yet they still practice arms-length parenting of their children. I wonder if those parents examined their own childhoods if they'd then recall who was there for them, and might still be there, and then ask themselves: ""Do my children have as much support as I did and still have? What more can we do for our children to keep them feeling loved and supported? My wise mother said, ""When we become a mother, we no longer think only for one. We have to think and feel for someone else first. We have to imagine being in their heart and to hear what they are saying."" Her words are as sound and true today as they were when she said them to me over 30 years ago. It's the best advice and might prevent some disappointment for many of us. It might also serve as rule for all your relationships. The simple method of stepping into another's shoes might deliver the love and kindness we all need.About Catherine Nagle: Catherine grew up in Philadelphia with 16 brothers and sisters, reared by loving, old school Italian parents.

Once the riots diminished, however, nonviolent protesters have continued calling for change.I had the opportunity to talk with community pastor and social activist Anthony Grimes while he was in Ferguson. Anthony lives in Colorado and has made several trips to Ferguson.Anthony, why are you in Ferguson?We're here to offer support -- moral, physical, and emotional support to those struggling on the ground. We're here to engage in nonviolent demonstrations. The people of faith on our trip are here to stand with people who need healing. We're also here to bring what we experience and learn back to Denver to help our own community.Why is Ferguson important?What Ferguson is America is. The issues faced by citizens in every community can be found here in Ferguson. It's a battleground for what can be won or lost in regard to urban policing, education, and the mass incarceration system. We know that there was blatant disregard for a young man's life as he lay in the street for over four hours. The lack of a trial to get at the truth of what happened is a slap in the face for people. If we let this instance go, we're saying it's okay to treat black people as if they're not important.What do you want to achieve? What does success look like?First, we want to create a society where people's lives are valued and policies at every level of society reflect the value of all people. We still live in a very racialized society that benefits from racism itself. We need to call out these things and deal with them.While we do want to see justice (not just an indictment for murder) -- when a person's life is taken in this country, if there's any speculation about what happened, there should be a trial -- the bigger issue that we want to change and overhaul is an entire system that has become rotten.We would like to see a new society built where the voices of every person in communities are heard, where lives are valued, where people's worth and gifts are valued and shared within the community, and where justice lives inside the community.Next, one of the major problems is that our policing systems are siloed group of people separate from the community, who aren't from the community, don't know the community, and yet are responsible for policing the community. This isn't about any one officer; our current administrators of justice don't know the people, their stories, or their families.We would like to see communities become their own stewards of justice. If a community has systems inside it that allow it to thrive and hold people accountable, it won't need outside policing.Finally, we need to transform education. Too many of our educational institutions are broken and effectively put people on a path to poverty, incarceration, and failure. That's something we've got to address. What kind of education are we giving our babies, and what chance does that give them to succeed?How do you respond to folks who look at Ferguson and say, ""It's not hard to avoid being shot by the police: Don't rob a store, and don't hit an officer""?For those who immediately jump to blame, I would invite them to start with compassion. There is a big boy by the name of Mike Brown who was shot. There was a seat at the table that was empty at Thanksgiving. When you begin with compassion, you ask questions about how to prevent this from happening again.Next, I would suggest that all of the truth of the situation has not been established, and that's why a trial is important. Then, assuming that he did steal, people have to ask themselves if stealing is reason for an execution on the streets.Finally, there is a pattern in America of black people being killed and then having their life put on public trial afterward. The person pulling the trigger ought to be the one on trial.How do you respond to people who say, ""This isn't about race; we should move on and focus on personal responsibility and stop blaming systems, history, or other people""?There are people who look just like them who are on the ground fighting on behalf of justice. This isn't a black-or-white, left-or-right issue. I was in Palestine two weeks ago, and there are people there and around the globe standing in solidarity with this movement.Also, in reforming the system we are not avoiding personal responsibility. There are people doing all they can do to make it. But all they can do isn't enough. You can't have some people begin a marathon with a five-pound weight on their ankles and then wonder why those with the weights don't keep up.We want individual responsibility, and we want the system to take responsibility as well for what they are doing to exclude or include entire groups of people from society, from opportunity.The St. Louis Police Officer's Association responded to the St. Louis Rams football team members' raised hands by saying they are ""profoundly disappointed with the ... display that police officers around the nation found tasteless, offensive, and inflammatory."" How would you respond to this statement?First, I applaud the athletes for taking a stand, for risking their own celebrity for the sake of the vulnerable. Kudos to them.My question for the police association is: Are you just as critical of all the racist literature and tasteless, offensive, and inflammatory comments made against the community you serve?The statement is an example of the gulf between our police departments and the communities they serve. We need institutions of justice that are integrated with and truly serve community, not just protect their own interests.You have tall goals. How do you believe they'll be achieved?It begins when you recognize Coretta Scott King's words that ""[f]reedom is never really won. You earn it and win it in every generation."" We can't assume that we're in a free country and that it will always be that way. We must earn it in every generation.They'll be achieved when you do your part as a human being. Where injustice happens, slow down, observe it, ask what you just saw, and walk compassionately. Let that compassion work within you. If every one of us would respond to one another with ""My life matters, and the life of my brother and sister matters,"" then that would go a long way.It will happen when we make friendships with people who do not look like and act like us. Build friendships. Alexis de Tocqueville talked about how associations -- relationships across social boundaries -- are one of the most powerful forces we have in our democracy.It will happen when we hold our police accountable. Get to know your local police department and officers. Ask them what they are doing with the resources we give them. How are you ensuring safety and the protection of all people? For people who want to get more involved, I invite them to join local groups working across the country to dismantle a racialized society, to improve education resources, and to raise consciousness. I would invite everyone to read The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness by Michelle Alexander, and Dumbing Us Down by New York Teacher of the Year John Gatto.Finally, as Desmond Tutu observed during the horrific ethnic cleansings in South Africa during the '90s, we must repair the soul of a nation even as we repair it socially and economically. And, for that, we need God's help."

Particularly if that connection pushes humanity to do better and accommodates my ongoing personal agenda to heal and unite, while watching one inspiring film at a time.Here in Doha, where the Ajyal Youth Film Festival has been taking place for the past week, it's easy for me to get emotional. Everywhere I go, I stumble onto culture being celebrated, and at every screening, every press conference and junket, I hear those magical words I've always wanted to hear. Like Salma Hayek-Pinault saying she felt they had ""the world coming together to make this film,"" about Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet, the project she's produced and which will close the festival. Or the film's director Roger Allers stating confidently that ""it's often peacemakers who run into the most trouble,"" or Amber Fares, director of the documentary Speed Sisters which opened the festival, confirming that the ""sharing of stories brings about more understanding.""Score one for the human race in Doha.After watching Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet, a wondrous masterpiece of humanity finding common ground for once, I was amazed to come face to face with the mask from the segment animated by Tomm Moore ""On Love"". Within this stunning illustrator's ode to art and passion, I could initially see references to Gustav Klimt, along with courageous scenes tinted in passionate strokes of Spanish red. But once I entered the top floor galleries of the Museum of Islamic Art, I found this iconic Turkish war mask, reminiscent of the one that had stayed in my thoughts since the film. There it was, hanging hauntingly, within the splendor of the atmospherically lit galleries, in this incredible feat of architecture designed by I. M. Pei. Even though Moore probably never saw this particular mask, in Doha... Magical. From the outside, in the fading light of dusk, the Museum of Islamic Art reminds the visitor of the culture of the region. Viewed from the right angle, in the perfect light, it looks like an elegant ode to the ""batoola"", the face mask that is sometimes worn by women in the region. Inside, the MIA is all wonder and style, unveiling the wonder of Islamic art from the four corners of the globe. From Spain to Iran, from India to Turkey, the collection inspired me deeply and the still darkness of the exhibition halls added to my love for this part of the world. Then the delicious saffron and date cheesecake enjoyed with a backdrop of the sea at the museum coffee shop added the sweet touch needed. Perfection.In the evening it was time for more culture, cinematic of course, in the form of the ""Made in Qatar"" program of short films showcasing in Katara's Drama Theater. The support of Her Excellency Sheikha Al Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani attending the screening raised the bar even higher for these pioneering filmmakers, who represent the powerful beginning steps of an industry in the making, one the Doha Film Institute has been single-handedly responsible for creating. H.E. Sheikha Mayassa is also the Chairperson of Qatar Museums and the innovator who envisioned and established the Doha Film Institute just five short years ago. I found it personally inspiring to see her in the audience.  Fatma Al Remaihi, along with Hala Al Khalifa, Mohammed Saeed Harib and Saad Borshid, the jury for ""Made in Qatar""Before the films Fatma Al Remaihi, acting CEO of the Doha Film Institute and Director of the Ajyal Youth Film Festival, announced a new Qatari Film Fund for Qatari directors and writers to build on history of education, development and financial support from the Doha Film Institute. Up to four feature films and eight short films to be supported, inclusion is open by invitation, and at least one feature film will be selected from the Fund for production in 2016. Of the ""Made in Qatar"" films that stood out for me were Ali Ali Ali's New Day, about illness and new beginnings, He Will Steal It by Abdulaziz Al-Saadi, a young boy's journey to doing the right thing, T Boy by Maryam Al Sahli -- co-written and starring Zakie Khan -- which highlights the compromises we need to make to survive sometimes, Public Phone co-directed by Leena Al-Musalmani and Ethar Ahmed Hassaan, which brings together four stories about four Qatari residents from different walks of life through a phone booth, and 10% by Yousef Almodhadi, which ended up winning the ""Made in Qatar Award"" because of ""the simplicity of its central idea coupled with its excellent techniques in cinematography, direction and presentation,"" in the words of the jury. 10% is a truly humorous but poignant story about one Qatari man's obsession with his cellphone. The jury for the awards comprised of Hala Al Khalifa, Mohammed Saeed Harib and Saad Borshid, three prominent Gulf art professionals. Harib also happens to be one of the nine illustrators on Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet. Seems an evening in Doha isn't complete without the hospitality, friendship and flavor of a group dinner. I've been pampered and fed well here, spoiled by the warmth of the people, and all around made to feel so at home that I may never want to leave. Alas when I finally do, I will take with me the memories of our night at the Souk Waqif, first eating hamour biryani al fresco on the roof of Al Bandar restaurant, and then wandering back to our transportation while cutting through a Qatari music concert, complete with dancing and the ever-welcomed scent of cardamom.Images and videos courtesy of the Doha Film Institute, used with permission.

Throughout the process, I've learned that silence doesn't make things better, but knowing that silence isn't the answer wasn't enough to get me to speak out. Rather, it was you.",2014-12-05,2014-11-13-458012_10150644096944704_345506553_o.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-13-458012_10150644096944704_345506553_o-thumb.jpg,"Dear Martha and Abigail,In the spring of 2013, I was spending a rare night out with some friends, including a friend of a friend that I'd never met before. I had been drinking and we had flirted, and even kissed, earlier that night. But when I went off to sleep in the spare bedroom of the apartment we were in and he, also a guest, asked if I wanted a ""cuddle buddy,"" I responded with what I believed to be a clear and vocal ""no.""When, a while later, I was woken up by him crawling into bed next to me, I again said ""no."" And when he started choking me, I struggled, showing ""no"" through my behavior. As young women, we are taught that there is power inherent in the word no.Unfortunately, in my case, saying no didn't work.After that night, I continued to use the word no. I said no to telling our parents, or you, what had happened. I said no to filing a police report or talking to a therapist about it. I said no to any and all opportunities for support or justice.Turns out, it doesn't matter how many hours you've spent binge watching Law & Order: SVU,  going to the cops is terrifying. Almost as terrifying, I discovered, as living with the pain of sexual assault and not telling anyone.You see, this wasn't the first time that I was assaulted, but it was the first time that I was confident, in that moment, that what was happening was wrong. Sometimes, I feel guilty for not going the legal route. Maybe I could have won? Maybe this time, I could have at least scared him into not doing anything like that ever again?At the time, the hardship on my life -- getting poked and prodded, reliving that night over and over in what I imagined to be a cold, damp interrogation room, the court appearances, and the stigma that comes with being the girl who was sexually assaulted, seemed to not validate prosecution given the high likelihood that my attacker would be found ""not guilty"" anyway.So I started writing. I've been working on this piece for over a year and it's gone through many incarnations. Throughout the process, I've learned that silence doesn't make things better, but knowing that silence isn't the answer wasn't enough to get me to speak out. Rather, it was you.What has scared me more than anything is what my silence may have meant for you. Nearly one out of every five women in America has been the victim of sexual assault. It terrifies me that you might be living with the same secret as I have been, because you feel the same shame, fear, and isolation that I once did.Recently, many college students have spoken out about their sexual assaults online and in the media. I applaud them for their bravery. Watching them helped me come to the realization that holding mine in, or keeping it on paper in a folder in my closet, wasn't me letting it go.Instead of overcoming it, I've lived with it -- sharing my life with a parasite that has eaten away at my ability to form close friendships, trust my peers, and be in a healthy relationship. I am jumpy, nervous, and have trouble spending the night alone in my apartment without waking up every few hours to check the locks and peek behind the shower curtain.Some might say that just talking about something won't make a difference. I respectfully disagree.When Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, he based his decision on the Union's ability to win the war against the Confederate south. But while Lincoln's decision on slavery was centered on the war effort and gaining a competitive advantage, it was informed and driven by a number of his close friends and advisors who believed that slavery was morally wrong and indefensible. It took years of work by abolitionists and activists like Frederick Douglass telling stories and sharing narratives, slowly winning over a large enough group of people to shift public opinion all of the way to the White House.I think that this is something that we can replicate with sexual violence in America. If those impacted most directly by it speak out at a large enough volume for a sustained period of time, even those who don't necessarily feel a strong connection to the issue will eventually join in, building a tidal wave of supporters whether they are there for ethical, moral, legal, or logistical reasons. Supporters who understand that the first step to stopping sexual violence is to start talking about it openly and honestly for what it is, an assault against not just the body, but also the mind and the spirit.Being able to have discussions around sexual assault, while they are awkward and hard, will put cultural reform in the fast lane and result in young women and men who are physically and mentally healthier and safer. It is important to remember, of course, that not all perpetrators are male, and not all victims are women.By being inclusive with the conversation, all people will understand the repercussions of sexual assault on an emotional and societal level. Rather than just being taught that they must control their urges, men and women will have a deep understanding of why sexual assault is a crime that goes above and beyond it's illegality.By way of this public letter, I am speaking out and adding my voice to the growing chorus, but I also have come to believe that my words have power even when shared only with a close group, like you.A 2013 study in New Zealand found that writing does literally have healing powers. Researchers found that adults who wrote about their thoughts and feelings before going into surgery, recovered at a markedly faster rate than those who did not write. This isn't just emotional recovery; they actually healed faster physically.The study concluded that writing about distressing events helped the participants to ""make sense of the events"" speeding up the recovery process down to the cellular level. I find this almost overwhelmingly encouraging. If writing does indeed help, even for those who don't identify as writers, we've found an almost universally accessible method of combatting the trauma associated with sexual assault. Not a fix, but a start.Sharing this letter with you, our parents, and the world, is the hundredth, but not the last, step in my healing process. It's been a tough road and I feel so blessed to have you by my side. Even though you didn't know what I was going through, you were loving and supportive. For that, I am forever grateful.Be strong, speak your truths, and share your stories. Your words have the ability to heal yourselves and change the course of history.You are powerful and inspiring women who are finding your way in a world that can be hard to navigate. I hope that you have not been and will never be the victims of sexual violence, but if you are know that I understand, that I love you no less, and that you still have a voice.
