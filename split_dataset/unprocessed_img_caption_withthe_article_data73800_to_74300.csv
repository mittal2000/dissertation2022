They called the police department, saying a handgun was on the passenger's seat.Police tried for an hour to rouse Demouria Hogg, 30, by using loudspeakers and firing beanbag rounds at the car. Hogg didn’t budge, police said. Hogg finally stirred when police shattered a passenger-side window with a metal pipe. It would be the last movement of his life.One officer used a Taser on Hogg while another fatally shot him. It’s unclear what happened when Hogg awoke. Police said “a confrontation occurred.” An attorney representing the officer who fired the fatal shot said Hogg reached for the handgun.Now, Hogg’s mother and youngest daughter are suing the Oakland police department, accusing officers of excessive force in a federal wrongful death lawsuit. “This use of deadly force was excessive and unreasonable under the circumstances, especially since [Hogg] had done nothing violent before, during and after he was tased and shot to death,” the lawsuit says. Hogg was ""unconscious"" moments before he was shot and ""posed no reasonable or credible threat of violence,"" the suit says.The police department and city attorney declined to comment on the lawsuit.Oakland police officers wore body cameras that recorded the encounter, but the department has declined requests to release footage. Members of Hogg's family were allowed to view portions of the videos and said they don't believe the footage shows him reaching for the weapon. Their lawyer, Jamon Hicks, doesn’t concede that a gun was on the passenger seat. With multiple officers’ cameras recording portions of the shooting, public opinion could be greatly influenced by which version is released. “The video absolutely supports the officers,” said attorney Stephen Betz, who represents the female cop who shot Hogg, whose name hasn’t been released. “But if you’re suspicious of the police, the video that I saw doesn’t necessarily show what happened inside the car.”The June 6 killing was the first fatal police shooting in Oakland in two years. In August, police killed three more people. Hicks has complained about the pace and secrecy of the investigation into the shooting of Hogg. The Alameda County district attorney will decide whether to pursue charges against the officer.An autopsy hasn’t been completed, Hicks said. Tests may explain why police had difficulty waking Hogg.Oakland Police Chief Sean Whent said the name of the officer who killed Hogg hasn’t been released as a security measure.“We believe that there were threats that were credible from a gang to that particular officer,” Whent said.The presence of a gun in the car doesn’t automatically exonerate the officer in the killing, according to Hadar Aviram, a University of California, Hastings, law professor.“Police are justified in using lethal force if it’s reasonable to think that the person is a danger,” Aviram said.Also on HuffPost:"
1,LATINO VOICES,Zoe Saldana's Response To Anti-Immigrant Hate: ‘You Can’t Kill Us. You Can’t Send Us Back’,Carolina Moreno,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/zoe-saldanas-anti-immigrant-hate-you-cant-kill-us_us_563a4372e4b0307f2cab8466,"""Adjust your laws, because it’s not going away.""",2015-11-04,"He Called Latino Immigrants ""Criminals"" And ""Rapists""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55e0e21714000077002e4580.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Zoe Saldana is taking a bold stance against the anti-immigrant and anti-Latino comments that have been making headlines in recent months. In an in-depth interview with Latina magazine, the 37-year-old actress candidly spoke about her views on the immigration debate and why critics should begin to accept the changing demographics in the country. While several political pundits and presidential candidates have actively expressed their plans to build border walls and tighten immigration policy, it’s Donald Trump’s description of Mexican immigrants crossing the border as “rapists” and criminals in June that has received the most attention. The Dominican-raised actress said all the negative comments made about Latino immigrants have certainly upset her personally -- but, more importantly, contradict the immigrant history of the United States.(Story continues below)“This topic of immigration hurts because I don’t want to be angry anymore,” Saldana told Latina. “I don’t believe that what anybody else is saying is true about me or my people. I’m kind of embarrassed when you see all of these people talking on national television, and it’s like, ‘Oh my God, if your grandfather were alive today, when he came here from Ireland, from Italy, escaped the f**king war in Russia. You’re rotting his name to shame. It doesn’t matter how much money you have, or how many degrees from Ivy League schools. You’re such a bigot. You’re such a hick right now.’”The “Avatar” star went on to say people who feel threatened by American Latinos should understand that “the only true American here is the Native American” and Latinos are going through the same acculturation process the Irish and other cultures have gone through before.“You can’t kill us. You can’t send us back. We are millions and millions here because it is our time to migrate,” Saldana told the magazine. “We are the youngest culture. We are doing what your people did. So shut up and just deal with it. Adjust your laws, because it’s not going away. If anything, I want to give them a hug, and say, ‘It’s okay. It’s new. Don’t be scared. We’re great people. We’re gonna do great and better things for your country. Trust me.’ We’re not angry either. We’re a culture that isn’t angry.”To read Saldana's full interview with Latina magazine, and more on how she believes Latinos in the U.S. are evolving, head over to their website.

Don Hutto Residential Center in Taylor, Texas, began the strike last Wednesday in hopes of being released, said Cristina Parker of Grassroots Leadership, a group publicizing the women's protest.""They're only after one thing, and that's release,"" Parker said.Female detainees told Parker's organization this week that almost all of them are now participating in the strike, she said. That could include up to 500 people -- the facility's full capacity. RH Reality Check first reported on the strike's expansion.The women also told activists they are facing retaliation from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Corrections Corporation of America, the private prison company that operates the Hutto facility.Parker said one woman was placed in solitary confinement from Saturday to either Sunday evening or Monday morning, and said prison employees turned up the air conditioning to make it uncomfortably cold. Officials transferred two other women from the Hutto facility and they are now being detained in another immigrant center in Texas, according to ICE's detainee locator tool.ICE agents are pressuring the hunger strikers to eat by placing food in front of them and demanding they eat it, according to Parker. She also said they're being barred from going outside after 5 p.m. Corrections Corporation of America referred questions to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, who denied the women's allegations. “ICE takes the health, safety, and welfare of those in our care very seriously and we continue to monitor the situation,"" a spokeswoman said in a statement. ""Currently, no one at the T. Don Hutto Detention Center was identified as being on a hunger strike or refusing to eat.""The ICE spokeswoman said the agency routinely transfers people to other facilities for various reasons, and that the Hutto center does not have solitary confinement areas. Women are allowed recreation time until 8 p.m., she added. Agents told detainees that failing to eat can have negative effects on health, the spokeswoman said. Immigrant detainees have participated in hunger strikes in the past, and claimed there was retaliation. In April, three mothers in the Karnes County Residential Center sued ICE and the GEO Group, another private prison company that operates the facility, alleging they were punished for participating in a 78-person hunger strike."

The GOP is advocating to empower them with tax debts as part of an effort to pay for highway funding without raising taxes. The idea is that private debt collection companies will be more aggressive with tax delinquents than IRS agents, thus generating more money for the U.S. Treasury.And private debt collectors probably will in fact be more aggressive than the IRS. But about 79 percent of outstanding tax debt is owed by low-income taxpayers who are essentially too poor to pay, according to Chi Chi Wu, an attorney with the advocacy group the National Consumer Law Center.""They're going to try to get blood out of a stone, and that's not good for anyone but the debt collectors,"" Wu told HuffPost.When the Senate passed its version of the highway bill this summer, it included the measure to privatize tax debt collection. If a similar provision is included in the House bill, it would be almost certain to become law. Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) has readied an amendment to strip the measure from the bill, but it is not clear if the Republican majority will even allow a vote on the measure.Federal highway funding has traditionally been supported by a tax on gasoline, which has been fixed at 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993, despite significant increases in prices at the pump in the decades since. Republicans have resisted calls to modestly increase the gas tax, despite support for such a move from their traditional allies at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a lobbying group representing major corporations.Zach Carter is The Huffington Post's senior political economy reporter and a co-host of the HuffPost Politics podcast, ""So That Happened.""

Those three fraternities, along with the North American Interfraternity Conference and the National Panhellenic Conference, have collectively spent $210,000 so far in 2015 lobbying in support of the Safe Campus Act.""I am deeply concerned that this legislation will not keep campuses safe and may actually further exacerbate the issue of sexual assault facing our students,"" McCaskill wrote.

""Their bill would worsen our understanding of a violent crime that is already drastically underreported, and their bill would reduce the school’s ability to properly fight sexual assault,"" Gillibrand said to reporters. NIC responded Thursday saying there are ""misconceptions in the Senators’ letter regarding Safe Campus and Fair Campus that we are eager to correct."" NIC and NPC did not respond to requests for comment about what those misconceptions are.McCaskill's letters invited the student fraternity leaders to discuss her own bill, the Campus Accountability and Safety Act, introduced in the Senate with Gillibrand. Including McCaskill and Gillibrand, the bill has 34 co-sponsors, while the Safe Campus Act has five. Read the letters from Sen. Claire McCaskill to local fraternities in Missouri:______Tyler Kingkade covers higher education and sexual violence, and is based in New York.
