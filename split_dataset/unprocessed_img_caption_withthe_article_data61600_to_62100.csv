If the opportunity presented itself, Ridley would be happy to make time for ""Tomb Raider,"" telling THR that ""I’m trying to fill up my calendar.” Even her ""Force Awakens"" co-star John Boyega agrees that Ridley would be a perfect fit for the adventurer, considering the more realistic direction of Crystal Dynamics' recent video game offerings.“I played 'Tomb Raider' the game, it’s a new take and I think the movies are going to be based on that version,” Boyega told THR. “But I texted Daisy [and] was like, ‘this is you!’ and ‘you need to get on that because you could be Lara Croft.’ She should be.""The last time Lara Croft appeared onscreen, Angelina Jolie was cradling the life of the franchise with a not-so-welcome sequel in 2003 that only slightly improved on the shortcomings of its predecessor.

Sales were up 2.2 percent from a year ago.The median price for a previously owned home increased 4.4 percent from a year ago to $210,800.The housing report runs counter to data showing strong job growth and a stabilization of factory output, which had taken a hit from weaker demand overseas and a strong U.S. dollar.Housing continues to be supported by a tightening labor market, which is starting to push up wage growth, boosting household formation. But a relative dearth of properties available for sale remains a challenge.""Finding the right property at an affordable price is burdening many potential buyers,"" said NAR economist Lawrence Yun.In February, the number of unsold homes on the market rose 3.3 percent from January to 1.88 million units, but was down 1.1 percent from a year ago.At February's sales pace, it would take 4.4 months to clear the stock of houses on the market, up from 4.0 months in January.

""Sound is typically labeled as the forgotten food sense,"" Dr. Ryan Elder, assistant professor of marketing at Brigham Young University’s Marriott School of Management and a co-author of the research, said in a statement. ""But if people are more focused on the sound the food makes, it could reduce consumption.""The research included three separate experiments -- one of which involved 71 undergraduate students who were presented with a bowl of 10 pretzels and were equipped with headphones to wear while they ate the pretzels.Some of the participants heard loud ambient sounds in the headphones, which masked the sound of chomping on the pretzels. Others heard low ambient sound, so that their own chewing was still audible.It turned out that when the participants could better hear the sound of their food while chewing, they ate less compared with those who listened to loud ambient sound, Dr. Gina Mohr, assistant professor of marketing at Colorado State University's College of Business and a co-author of the research, told The Huffington Post on Friday.Participants who listened to louder ambient noise ate four pretzels on average while those in the ""quiet"" group ate fewer than three pretzels on average.The researchers concluded that intrinsic sounds may be an overlooked part of the eating experience, and they may play a key role in why ""mindful eating"" often leads to eating less.""Mindful eating is the practice of giving your attention to the experience of eating, while shutting out other distracting stimuli,"" Mohr said. ""This research points to the food’s sound as an anchor to which consumers can focus.""Giving your attention to eating includes focusing all of your senses, from taste to smell to touch to sight to, yes, even sound.""When you mask the sound of consumption, like when you watch TV while eating, you take away one of those senses and it may cause you to eat more than you would normally,"" Elder said in the statement. ""The effects may not seem huge -- one less pretzel -- but over the course of a week, month, or year, it could really add up."""

9,POLITICS,Supreme Court Almost Ruled That Stun Guns Are Protected By The Second Amendment,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stun-guns-second-amendment_us_56effe0de4b03a640a6afebb,But Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas would've gone further.,2016-03-21,There's no right to keep and bear stun guns -- yet.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56f000ff1500002a000b2ab3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Supreme Court on Monday accepted a Massachusetts woman's argument that a law criminalizing stun guns may violate the Second Amendment.In an unsigned, two-page decision, the court threw out the conviction of Jaime Caetano, who had argued that her prosecution for carrying a stun gun in her purse for self-defense purposes violated her constitutional rights.Quoting its landmark 2008 ruling in District of Columbia v. Heller -- authored by none other than the late Justice Antonin Scalia -- the court said that ""the Second Amendment extends ... to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that were not in existence at the time of the founding.""The court stopped short of saying that stun guns are wholly protected under the Second Amendment. Instead, the justices sent the case back to Massachusetts' highest court to reconsider its earlier ruling against Caetano. That ruling had declared stun guns to be ""dangerous and unusual"" and noted that they didn't exist when the Second Amendment was enacted.The Supreme Court's ruling Monday was ""per curiam,"" which means no individual justice was identified as the author of the majority opinion. Like most per curiam opinions, it was issued summarily and without oral arguments -- which may explain why the justices avoided any sweeping pronouncements on a supposed right to possess stun guns.But Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, who since Scalia's death have formed an alliance of sorts, wrote separately to express at length the dissonance between the Massachusetts law and the right to bear arms for self-defense purposes -- and presumably would've gone further than their colleagues.""Caetano's encounter with her violent ex-boyfriend illustrates the connection between those fundamental rights,"" Alito wrote. ""By arming herself, Caetano was able to protect against a physical threat that restraining orders had proved useless to prevent. And, commendably, she did so by using a weapon that posed little, if any, danger of permanently harming either herself or the father of her children.""Alito continued: ""Under Massachusetts law, however, Caetano's mere possession of the stun gun that may have saved her life made her a criminal."" Drawing a parallel with how electronic communications are protected by the First Amendment, which covers free speech, Alito said stun guns shouldn't be singled out just because they didn't exist at the time of the founding.""While stun guns were not in existence at the end of the 18th century, the same is true for the weapons most commonly used today for self-defense, namely, revolvers and semiautomatic pistols,"" he wrote.Then, as if alluding to the dozens of cases the Supreme Court has declined to hear involving the Second Amendment, Alito closed with this: ""If the fundamental right of self-defense does not protect Caetano, then the safety of all Americans is left to the mercy of state authorities who may be more concerned about disarming the people than about keeping them safe.""That Alito and Thomas felt this language was necessary to expound on the court's decision is yet another example of how much the Supreme Court's conservative wing isn't the same without Scalia on the bench."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). It also appeared to be contradicted by the fact that she had only received 18 percent of her funds from donors giving $200 or below. But Clinton’s campaign actually did far better among small donors in February than any previous month. According to a new campaign report filed on Sunday, the Clinton campaign raised $10.5 million from small donors, which made up one-third of all contributions. The total includes contributions to Hillary Victory Fund, a joint fundraising committee linked to the campaign, that have been either transferred to or spent on behalf of the candidate.The February small-donor haul was a huge improvement for Clinton. She only raised $19 million from small donors in all of 2015 and added another $4.2 million in January. It was also probably a necessary fundraising change as her campaign leaned far too heavily on donors giving the maximum $2,700 in 2015. A heavy reliance on maximum donors is problematic because they cannot give anymore to fund a long primary slog. The campaign can keep tapping a large pool of small donors for money long into both a primary and general election campaign. Her campaign touted the milestone of receiving 1 million individual donors on March 18. The Sanders campaign, however, is approaching the 2 million mark.While Clinton is seeing vastly improving small-donor numbers, the Sanders camp’s almost complete reliance on small donors is unprecedented. The Vermont senator has raised nearly $140 million through February, with two-thirds coming from small donors.Overall, Sanders raised $43 million in February to Clinton’s $32 million (which includes Victory Fund allocations). Both campaigns kept their burn rate -- the rate at which the campaign spends the money it raises -- just below 100 percent that month. "

Nearly half of Americans think Donald Trump is complicit in the violence at his rallies. And most of the public supports renewed relations with Cuba. This is HuffPollster for Monday, March 21, 2016. REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST SEES GOP IN A WEAK POSITION - Stuart Stevens (R): ""The simple truth is that there simply aren’t enough white voters in the America of 2016 to win a national election without also getting a substantial share of the non-white vote. Romney won 17 percent of the non-white vote. Depending on white voter turnout, a Republican needs between 25 percent and 35 percent of the non-white vote to win….Only 12 percent of Hispanics have a favorable view of [Donald] Trump with 77 percent unfavorable. Even among Hispanic Republicans, he has a 60 percent unfavorable ranking. Among African Americans, 86 percent have an unfavorable view of Trump. To have even a chance at winning a national election, a nominee must get 90-plus percent of their own party. But one out of every three Republicans view Trump unfavorably….In my view, Donald Trump, if he does claim the party’s mantle, would be a historically weak and vulnerable nominee. But let’s not kid ourselves. Even if John Kasich or Ted Cruz, the remaining two candidates, were to emerge, the advantage is still very much with the Democrats."" [Daily Beast] Trump remains the frontrunner, but could still fall short - Nate Cohn: ""Donald Trump is about 550 delegates short of earning the 1,237 delegates necessary to win the Republican nomination. If he keeps winning at the pace he has so far, he will probably take around 60 percent of the remaining 900 or so pledged delegates, reaching his target. But Mr. Trump’s path is deceptively tenuous, and it might not take much to knock him off. It all hangs on whether Mr. Trump can continue to fend off Ted Cruz in states where Mr. Trump is relatively weak. He barely did it in Missouri (with an official result still pending) and North Carolina last Tuesday, when Mr. Cruz showed unexpected strength….If the rest of the primary season goes as it did in early March, Mr. Trump could win the nomination with around 1,300 delegates, based on a model of how demographics have correlated with the strength of the candidates so far. The model isn’t perfect….But it nonetheless offers a realistic path that’s consistent with the results so far.""

That's all there is to it (and you can unsubscribe anytime).NEARLY HALF OF AMERICANS THINK TRUMP INCITES VIOLENCE AT HIS EVENTS - HuffPollster: “Half of America believes Donald Trump’s campaign exhibits fascist undertones, with only 30 percent disagreeing, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov poll. The sentiment isn’t contained to Democrats, who unsurprisingly are willing to agree with a negative statement about their political rivals. Forty-five percent of independents also say Trump’s campaign has echoes of fascism, as do a full 28 percent of Republicans. About half the country believes Trump encourages violence at his campaign events, with just 34 percent saying he doesn’t. The rest aren’t sure. Meanwhile, 27 percent of Republicans say it’s acceptable to 'rough up' protesters at political events.” [HuffPost] Trump has activated a mix of latent Republican beliefs - Kirby Goidel and Keith Gaddie: “Trump does better among respondents who believe God chose the U.S. to lead the world and the Bible is the inspired word of God, and who value the role of businesspeople in society and obedience in children. Taken in isolation, none of these appeals is particularly new or unique….The something new about Trump then is the combination of appeals to operate government like a business thus ignoring the constraints of checks and balances, separations of powers, and the protection of individual rights against impassioned majorities. Add in a dose of white ethnocentrism and economic frustration and you have a volatile mix that suggests a lack of commitment to democratic processes….These data indicate the strong prospect that democracy and inclusion are failing among this long-courted, long taken for granted demographic.” [HuffPost]OPINIONS OF A WOMAN AS PRESIDENT HAVE CHANGED DRASTICALLY- Kathleen Weldon: “As the frontrunner in the Democratic primary, Hillary Clinton has already come closer than any other woman to becoming president of the United States. From the earliest days of public opinion research, polls have been documenting the country’s shift from rejection to skepticism to acceptance of the idea of a woman president…Americans may say they are willing to vote for a woman, but when asked to assess the willingness of others, people have not been as optimistic about women’s chances of winning the presidency. In 1984, when NBC asked likely voters if they were ready to elect a woman president, only 17% said yes….The 20% saying the U.S. isn’t ready to elect a woman president is similar to the proportion who said the same about an African-American president in an August 2008 Los Angeles Times/Bloomberg poll. Earlier polling indicated that a plurality of Americans once believed a female president was likely to be elected before a black president.” [HuffPost]MOST AMERICANS SUPPORT RENEWED TIES WITH CUBA - CBS News: “As President Obama travels Cuba for his historic trip, a majority of Americans support restoring U.S.-Cuba diplomatic ties, according to a new CBS News/New York Times poll. Fifty-two percent approve of the president's handling of relations with the island nation, according to the poll released Monday. Six in 10 Americans think restoring diplomacy with Cuba is mostly good for the U.S., but views are mixed on whether it will lead to more democracy in Cuba….In December 2014 Mr. Obama announced that U.S. and Cuba would resume diplomatic ties after more than 50 years. Fifty-eight percent of Americans support this, while just 25 percent oppose it. Most Democrats and independents favor re-establishing diplomacy, while Republicans are divided.” [CBS]More on what public opinion says about US-Cuban relations - Samantha Smith: “Americans are skeptical about whether Cuba will become more democratic in the near future. Fewer than half of those surveyed in July 2015 said they thought Cuba would become more democratic over the next several years. A greater share (49%) said that the state of democracy in Cuba would be ‘about the same...For the first time, a majority of Americans have a favorable view of Cuba. A Gallup survey conducted in February found that 54% of Americans had a favorable view of Cuba. The Cuban American community, long a source of opposition to restoring relations with Cuba, is changing. The number of Hispanics of Cuban ancestry in the U.S. has increased from 1.2 million in 2000 to more than 2 million, with much of the growth coming from those born in the U.S….The U.S. decision to restore relations with Cuba had strong support in Latin America. A majority across five Latin American countries surveyed in the spring of 2015 said they approved of the thawing of relations between the U.S. and Cuba.” [Pew] MONDAY'S 'OUTLIERS' - Links to the best of news at the intersection of polling, politics and political data:-Donald Trump supporters are more likely to judge others for liking their steak well-done.

It happened so fast.”The 52-year-old owner of the Inferno's Challenge entertainment company said he’s spit flames for 35 years, for everyone from high school students to the Miami Heat.When he took the center stage Thursday at Atlantic High School, he didn’t have a concern in the world. But now he says he should have.Charles was trying out of a new type of lighter fluid — Coleman camping oil — and the plan literally backfired. He usually uses charcoal lighter fluid. “I know what I’m doing but I just didn’t practice with that liquid,” he said. “I should have practiced. I didn’t practice.”Dramatic cell phone video showed his face engulfed in flames while sitting on a blow-up basketball court in the center of a packed gymnasium that immediately turned into pandemonium. ""Teachers had to grab fire extinguishers. I saw one girl having a seizure on the floor. Some other girl was having asthma problems and couldn't breathe,"" high school senior Lucas Martins told the Sun Sentinel. ""They had a huge mess … this one was a crazy one.""Asked what was going through his head at that moment, Charles answered: “This is new.”His saving grace was his ability to extinguish the flames quickly, Dr. Jean Farber of the Delray Medical Center told reporters.Dr. Farber said he suffered second-degree burns to his face, arm and thigh. His lips and mouth were not burned. She said washing his face immediately made all the difference.Palm Beach County School District Superintendent Dr. Robert Avossa said they’re looking into possible disciplinary action against school officials who approved the fire-breathing performance.In a statement provided to the Sun Sentinel by the school district, they said the school’s principal signed off on the performance.School officials said they've since learned that Charles has performed the stunt at least four times for the school district since 2011.Charles said he's done the act 200 to 300 times at various high schools in just the last year."

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tore into Donald Trump on Monday, turning the Republican presidential front-runner's favorite insult against him.""Let's be honest -- Donald Trump is a loser,"" Warren wrote in a Facebook post, noting his failed business ventures and bankruptcies as well as the ongoing fraud lawsuit against Trump University.However, Warren warned, it's important to take Trump seriously.""Many of history's worst authoritarians started out as losers -- and Trump is a serious threat,"" she wrote. ""The way I see it, it's our job to make sure he ends this campaign every bit the loser he started it.""Several hours after her Facebook post, Warren continued to make the case against Trump on Twitter: While Warren has not endorsed in the Democratic primary, the progressive senator has strongly condemned Trump -- and the Republican Party for enabling his dominance in the race. Last week, she urged ""decent people everywhere"" to stand up to Trump, arguing the businessman is a ""bigger, uglier threat every day that goes by."" And in an interview with MSNBC earlier this month, she argued the GOP only has itself to blame for Trump's rise. ""They are paying the price for their own extremism. It has now taken them by the throat,"" she said of the Republican Party. ""Guys, this is what you did to yourselves.""UPDATE, 3:01 p.m. ET: When asked about Warren's comments, Trump referred to Warren as ""the Indian,"" an apparent reference to a 2012 controversy over Warren's Native American heritage. Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.This story has been updated to include Warren's later tweets."

He also called on other Jewish groups and philanthropies to redirect any money they received from the presidential candidate.""[O]ur history, our faith and our values teach us that we cannot sit idly by when others are singled out for derision and when intolerance is fed,"" Greenblatt wrote.

Trump has said he's pro-Israel but ""neutral"" in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a stance that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton attacked in her speech to AIPAC on Monday morning.

17,TASTE,The Presidential Candidates Seriously Don't Seem To Care About Our Food Supply,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/presidential-candidates-food-system_us_56f019b8e4b09bf44a9de1d4,"Or at least it appears that way, since none of them responded to our survey on food and ag issues.",2016-03-21,"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and her husband, former U.S. President Bill Clinton eat breakfast at the Chez Vachon restaurant in Manchester, New Hampshire February 8, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587c52da170000880192a41d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last month, we noticed something.Though various media outlets have reported on how much the presidential candidates’ campaigns have spent on pizza and other fast food, we know little about where the candidates stand on the food and agricultural policy matters that contribute to how the ingredients in all that takeout are actually grown and processed. Or how much its delivery person was paid. Or how many families rely overwhelmingly on junk food for survival because they don't have access to affordable, healthy food. So, we reached out to all the Republican and Democratic campaigns -- there were a few more of them at the time -- to see what the candidates had to say on issues including the funding of nutrition assistance programs like SNAP and WIC, healthy school lunches, biodiversity in agriculture and subsidies for farmers.The result? Nothing. None of the presidential campaigns responded to our eight-question survey, though two of them have previously published position statements that address some, but not all, of these issues. Food-focused nonprofit Food Tank raised 10 of their own questions on food to the campaigns last month. They haven’t heard anything back, either, which Food Tank president Danielle Nierenberg called “a shame, because food is the one thing all of us have in common with the candidates and one another.”“I think the candidates are missing a real opportunity,” Nierenberg told The Huffington Post. “I feel bad for them and for us as eaters.”Claire Benjamin DiMattina, executive director of Food Policy Action, a nonprofit group that has pressed the campaigns to address food issues through an initiative called Plate of the Union, also expressed disappointment in the candidates’ silence.""For an issue that is central to the well being of every American, you don’t hear nearly enough about food policy on the campaign trail,” DiMattina said in a statement to HuffPost. “Voters want political leadership on food issues, and we will be working to make sure their voices are heard this fall.""To be fair, the presidential candidates haven’t been totally silent on food and agriculture in recent weeks. In his senatorial role, Bernie Sanders issued two statements in opposition to legislation that would have blocked his home state of Vermont and others from requiring the labeling of foods containing GMOs. That bill stalled in the Senate last week.Early this month, fellow Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton called for the end of the tipped minimum wage, an issue that has gained momentum since major restaurateurs like Danny Meyer moved to eliminate tips over the past year.On the Republican side, we learned that Donald Trump likes his steak well-done — a culinary sin in the eyes of many. Ted Cruz told Us magazine that, when he’s away from his family and in D.C., he mostly relies on canned soups for sustenance. And a strange video of John Kasich ordering a Western omelette and commenting on a waitress’s manicure in what appears to be 1998 was uploaded to YouTube by BuzzFeed’s Andrew Kaczynski.The candidates’ inattention to food issues comes at a time when Americans appear to be more interested that perhaps ever before in where their meals come from. A new poll released last week by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health cited the emergence of a new “food voter,” finding that 92 percent of respondents rated sustainable food production practices as a high personal priority. Fifty-two percent of respondents said they would be less likely to vote for a representative in Congress if they did not back sustainability efforts.That level of support may be a sign of things to come -- if not in this election cycle, than perhaps for the next one.For his part, Josh Tetrick, CEO of Hampton Creek, a food technology company specializing in alternative products like the popular Just Mayo, believes change is coming. After Tetrick took out a series of full-page ads in the New York Times urging the candidates to make the nation’s food system a campaign issue, staffers from multiple campaigns reached out. None of those campaigns, which were from both major parties and include one campaign that’s still in operation, responded publicly. But Tetrick believes the message was clear: They're listening.He is hopeful at least one candidate could still step up to the plate on food policy before November's election.“To be blunt, I think everyone -- Trump voters, Sanders voters -- agrees that if food that is healthier for you and better for the environment can taste better and be more affordable, we should do that,” Tetrick told HuffPost. “No one disagrees with that, but someone has to figure out a way to articulate it.”Below are the questions we sent the candidates. ---Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food and water.

And this includes sources that have undergone improvements.Climate change is believed to be one of the main contributors to such pollution due to its link to an increase in flooding. More flooding means more damage to water and sewage facilities, which spreads feces into water sources. The issue is of particular concern in areas where open defecation is prevalent.About 1 billion people still defecate in the open, according to the World Health Organization, due to a lack of sanitation facilities or ingrained practices. Ingesting contaminated water can lead to such debilitating conditions as cholera and diarrheal diseases, which is a leading cause of death in children under 5. The issue is being brought to the forefront in anticipation of Tuesday’s World Water Day, an awareness event that aims to highlight, and identify solutions for, the most plaguing water and sanitation issues. The new water contamination figures could put the recently adopted Sustainable Development Goals in jeopardy. Among the goals adopted in September, the U.N. vowed to make clean water and sanitation available to all by 2030. But flooding isn’t the only environmental issue that’s affecting water quality.As temperatures rise, people and animals’ need for water to survive will increase, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Yet with higher temperatures come more water-related diseases, such as malaria and dengue, according to UNICEF. And droughts inevitably leave people with no choice but to turn to questionable water sources.To help offset these risks, human rights organizations are working to improve water sources.UNICEF has called for putting the focus on children who are expected to bear the brunt of climate change’s effects.Half a billion children live in extremely high flood occurrence zones and nearly 160 million live in high or extremely high drought severity zones. In the meantime, the group has implemented a number of innovations to protect communities from toxic water.In Bangladesh, for example, an aquifer recharge system captures water during monsoon season, purifies it and stores it underground. It’s now available to 20,000 children there. Kiribati, which is plagued by droughts, now has new rainwater-harvesting and storage facilities to improve access to safe drinking water.“Now that we can test water more cheaply and efficiently than we were able to do when the [Millennium Development Goals] were set, we are coming to terms with the magnitude of the challenge facing the world when it comes to clean water,” Sanjay Wijeserkera, head of UNICEF’s global water, sanitation and hygiene, said in a statement. “It is a whole new ball game.”"

Marco Rubio's presidential campaign was sustained thanks to seven-figure checks written by billionaires to a super PAC supporting him.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56eef9df1e00009500710b8e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- As Donald Trump rolled up early primary and caucus wins, the nation’s Republican billionaires poured money into a super PAC backing the presidential campaign of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.).The $25 million provided by the party’s establishment donors to Conservative Solutions PAC in February, however, was futile. Rubio dropped out of the race on March 15 after losing his home state of Florida to Trump.Among the billionaires and centimillionaires making seven-figure contributions to Rubio’s super PAC in February were hedge fund managers Paul Singer and Ken Griffin, each giving $2.5 million. Poultry magnate Ronald Cameron donated $5 million, as did ex-AIG head Hank Greenberg through two corporations connected to him. Oracle Chairman Lawrence Ellison donated $1 million. So did Rubio’s patron, Miami used-car salesman Norman Braman. Other $1 million donors included Joplin, Missouri, roofing executive David Humphreys and his sister Sarah Atkins; Besilu Stables LLC, a company owned by Miami businessman Benjamin Leon; and Access Industries, a company owned by billionaire investor Len Blavatnik.The seven-figure contributions accounted for $21 million of the $25 million total the super PAC received in February.Other Republican establishment donors seeking to save their party and Rubio’s candidacy included Arizona Diamondbacks owner Earl Kendrick, hedge fund billionaire Seth Klarman, Chicago-based investor David Herro, the DeVos family and Stephens Inc. CEO Warren Stephens. The group also received a $250,000 contribution from Decor Services LLC. The Delaware company has no known owner. It was founded on Jan. 12 and days later donated $250,000 to a super PAC that supported New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s failed Republican presidential bid. Campaign finance watchdog groups Democracy 21 and Campaign Legal Center filed a complaint against Decor Services LLC on March 2 for illegally obscuring the true source of the pro-Christie donation.Conservative Solutions PAC was one of a trio of super PACs that turned their fire on Trump after he won victories in New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. The pro-Rubio group ultimately spent $4.8 million against Trump, but most of its money -- $38.8 million -- went to promoting Rubio.Although the source of the group’s March funding will not be disclosed until April 20, Republican donors continued to pour money into the super PAC up until Rubio left the race. Conservative Solutions PAC received another $17 million in March."
24,POLITICS,Donald Trump Campaign Manager Corey Lewandowski Appears To Grab Protester At Rally,Peter Andrew Hart,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-lewandowski-protester_us_56ee0750e4b084c672207750,Trump's top aide is accused of another physical altercation.,2016-03-20,A CBS reporter says Donald Trump's campaign manager pulled a protester back by his collar at a rally. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56ee08691e00008700704b5d.png?cache=f23TfZF3tQ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Video taken at a Donald Trump rally in Tucson, Arizona, on Saturday appears to show the GOP front-runner’s campaign manager grabbing the collar of a protester, just 11 days after the Trump aide was accused of assaulting a reporter.CBS News reporter Jacqueline Alemany identified the man as Corey Lewandowski in the video she posted from the rally in the Tucson Convention Center. The video shows the protester in a heated conversation with Lewandowski and a man wearing black, and then a hand grabs the young protester by the collar, pulling him back.The Trump campaign claimed that it was not Lewandowski, but rather a person to his left, who grabbed the unidentified man’s collar.""The video clearly shows the protester reacting to the man who pulled him, not to Mr. Lewandowski,"" a statement read.""Mr. Trump does not condone violence at his rallies,"" campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks added.While the presence of bystanders prevents an unobstructed view of the incident, the sleeve on the arm that grabs the protester is similar in color to Lewandowski’s coat.The incident adds to the controversy around Lewandowski and the Trump campaign.Earlier this month, former Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields accused Lewandowski of assaulting her at a news conference in Florida. Since the incident, Fields has resigned from Breitbart and filed a police report against Lewandowski. No charges have been filed.Lewandowski and the Trump campaign have denied the allegations, and Trump has stood by his campaign manager. Lewandowski called Fields “totally delusional,” and Trump said that she “made the story up.”Ken Vogel of Politico reported this week that Lewandowski has a history of inappropriate behavior. While working for Americans for Prosperity in 2013, Lewandowski reportedly castigated a female employee, calling her a “c**t” in front of her colleagues. An unnamed reporter told Vogel that Lewandowski has made sexual comments to and about female journalists that she described as ""completely inappropriate.""At the same event in Tucson on Saturday, a protester was punched and kicked by a Trump supporter while being escorted out of the rally, adding to the long list of violent incidents at Trump campaign events.On Sunday, Trump praised Lewandowski on ABC for ""having spirit"":UPDATE: 3/20 -- The person who the Trump campaign said pulled down the protester was a member of Trump's private security detail, according to Politico. The campaign would not confirm the person was affiliated with Trump, but other sources and reporters said that he works for Trump's security team.""Although we did not identify this individual, we did not make any suggestion as to his affiliation or lack thereof,"" Hicks told Politico.In light of a string of incidents involving Trump campaign officials and protesters, Hicks said that the campaign ""will be dedicating additional security resources to larger events in the future to prevent staff from having to intervene.""Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."
25,POLITICS,McConnell: GOP Senators Can Go Rogue If Trump Wins Nomination,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mcconnell-trump_us_56eea6c0e4b09bf44a9d804c,The Republican Party is having a hard time uniting behind Donald Trump.,2016-03-20,Mitch McConnell is struggling with The Donald just like everyone else.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_15_290_3985_1981%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Republican senators facing tough re-election contests may have to figure out how to distance themselves from the party's presidential nominee, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) suggested Sunday.""Senate races are statewide races. You can craft your own message for your own people,"" McConnell said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""That's exactly what we intend to do this fall no matter who the nominee is.""In other words, Senate Republicans are not exactly uniting behind Donald Trump. CNN's Dana Bash asked McConnell if he's worried having Trump at the top of the ballot will hurt Senate Republicans in those statewide races.""We're going to be running strong with these incumbents no matter who the nominee ultimately is,"" McConnell said. ""I intend to support the nominee of our party, and we'll find out who that is in the coming months.""In a recent New York Times story about Republican efforts to stop Trump, McConnell reportedly said Senate Republicans would ""drop him like a hot rock"" and pitch Republican senators as a necessary check on a President Hillary Clinton. Last week, McConnell spoke to Trump and asked him to please quit encouraging violence at his rallies. Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."
