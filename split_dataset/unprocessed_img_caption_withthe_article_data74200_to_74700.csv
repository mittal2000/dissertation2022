0,TECH,SXSW: 'We Made A Mistake' Canceling Online Harassment Panels,Laura Bassett,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sxsw-online-harassment_us_5633a017e4b06317991226b3,The festival wants to compensate with a full-day summit on the issue.,2015-10-30,"Hugh Forrest, SXSW Interactive's director, speaks during the 2014 SXSW Music, Film + Interactive Festival.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5633a9d9190000a600b95532.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Amid boycott threats from two major media outlets, the director of the South by Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas, acknowledged Friday that he made a mistake by caving to Internet trolls and canceling two scheduled panels about online harassment in the gaming community. Instead of the panels, he said, SXSW will hold a daylong summit March 12, during the festival, with many high-profile speakers to address the issue in more depth.""While we made the decision in the interest of safety for all of our attendees, canceling sessions was not an appropriate response,"" SXSW Director Hugh Forrest wrote in a blog post. ""We have been working with the authorities and security experts to determine the best way to proceed. It is clear that online harassment is a problem that requires more than two panel discussions to address.""Earlier this week, SXSW canceled two panels in response to threats of rape, animal abuse and on-site violence from the very harassers the panels had intended to discuss. One panel, called ""Level Up: Overcoming Harassment in Games,” was intended to combat a movement known by the hashtag #GamerGate, which emerged in August 2014 to fight efforts to make online gaming more woman-friendly. Gamergate supporters are known for harassing and threatening women in the industry and were largely behind the recent online threats that ultimately succeeded in shutting down the SXSW panels. SXSW had later added a second panel, called “SavePoint: A Discussion on the Gaming Community,"" which featured several pro-Gamergate panelists. The festival canceled both panels on Monday, citing safety reasons.""SXSW prides itself on being a big tent and a marketplace of diverse people and diverse ideas,"" Forrest wrote. ""However, preserving the sanctity of the big tent at SXSW Interactive necessitates that we keep the dialogue civil and respectful. If people cannot agree, disagree and embrace new ways of thinking in a safe and secure place that is free of online and offline harassment, then this marketplace of ideas is inevitably compromised.""The move infuriated two major SXSW participants, BuzzFeed and Vox, who threatened to boycott the festival if it did not find a way to address the subject of online harassment. BuzzFeed noted the irony of Forrest's decision in a statement on Tuesday. ""We were disturbed to learn yesterday that you canceled two panels, including one on harassment in gaming, in response to the sort of harassment the panel sought to highlight,"" BuzzFeed said.The pressure achieved its intended effect. On Friday, Forrest released a long list of speakers who have signed onto the new online harassment summit, including former Texas State Sen. Wendy Davis (D), U.S. Rep. Katherine Clark (D-Mass.), noted feminist writer and director Soraya Chemaly and Monika Bickert, head of product policy for Facebook. Forrest said the festival will ""work closely with the authorities and safety experts"" to defend the summit against threats of violence. ""Online harassment is a serious matter and we stand firmly against hate speech and cyber-bullying,"" he said in a statement. ""It is a menace that has often resulted in real world violence; the spread of discrimination; increased mental health issues and self-inflicted physical harm."" But the move has not appeased all of the activists who are working to combat online harassment in gaming. Randi Lee Harper, founder of the Online Abuse Prevention Initiative, expressed concerns Friday that the festival was still including pro-Gamergate panelists in its March summit. While SXSW listed her as a participant in the daylong summit, Harper is not sure she will participate and is concerned for her safety, she said in a series of tweets.""No one would say abusers should be allowed to debate those they abused,"" she tweeted. ""This shows SXSW does not understand online harassment."" She later tweeted, ""What SXSW did was equivalent to allowing a perpetrator of domestic violence to stand on a stage next to the woman he abused. The movement they represent has forced many of us to go into hiding. Giving them a chance to say 'we don't harass women' is bullshit."" Forrest did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton this week said she supported an investigation into the company. ""There’s a lot of evidence that they misled,"" she said at a campaign stop in New Hampshire. The outrage began last month, when InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times reported that Exxon scientists knew decades ago -- as early as 1977 -- that fossil fuels contribute to global warming. Nevertheless, the company has sowed doubt about man-made climate change since then.Exxon has denied suppressing climate research and publicly acknowledged the need to address the problem. But the company has also contributed to organizations like the American Petroleum Institute and the Heartland Institute, which promote climate-change denial.On Friday, a coalition of civil rights and environmental leaders sent a letter to the DOJ, asking the government to investigate Exxon.""Given the damage that has already occurred from climate change -- particularly in the poorest communities of our nation and our planet -- and that will certainly occur going forward, these revelations should be viewed with the utmost apprehension,"" they wrote. ""They are reminiscent -- though potentially much greater in scale -- than similar revelations about the tobacco industry.""Clinton's competitors for the Democratic presidential nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley (D), both previously said they support an investigation.A spokesman for the Justice Department confirmed receipt of the letters but declined to comment further.The strategy to pressure the DOJ gained steam earlier this month when a George Mason University scientist wrote to Attorney General Loretta Lynch. The scientist, joined by 20 of his colleagues, asked her to investigate energy companies under anti-racketeering laws for propagating climate change misinformation. These laws were successfully used against tobacco companies for misleading the public about the dangers of cigarettes. Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), chairman of the House Science Space and Technology Committee, got wind of the letter and all but threatened to investigate the lead scientist in the group for what Smith called an inappropriate use of public funds. Reps. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) and Mark DeSaulnier (D-Calif.) later took up the scientists’ cause and sent their own letter to Lynch.Also on HuffPost:"
4,POLITICS,Paul Ryan's Chairmen Do End Run On 9/11 Responders,Michael McAuliff,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-committee-chairmen-9-11-responders_us_56334e28e4b0c66bae5bf417,"A permanent 9/11 bill has majority support, but two congressmen decided to write their own temporary bills instead.",2015-10-30,"New House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) pledged to put committees back in charge, but two of his chairmen just drew up legislation that infuriates 9/11 responders.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5633ac59190000a600b95537.jpeg?cache=izxkkbkudf&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Two of House Speaker Paul Ryan's (R-Wis.) newly empowered committee chairmen took immediate advantage Thursday of the freshly elected leader's pledge to give power back to committees -- and may have handed him a 9/11-related publicity disaster.Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), the head of the Energy and Commerce Committee, both announced measures to temporarily extend the expiring 9/11 health and compensation programs.In the process, they appear to have ignored permanent 9/11 legislation that was already proposed and sponsored by a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate and a majority of more than 240 members in the House.That bill is universally backed by 9/11 responders and advocates, and they were furious the two chairmen decided to ignore a measure that already has enough support to pass. They wanted to make sure Ryan heard that they were not pleased with the first major legislation to be rolled out on the new speaker's watch.""On a day when Republicans voted for a new speaker of the House, and promised they are turning over a new leaf, the House Judiciary Congressman Bob Goodlatte recklessly and without regard for the actual needs of 9/11 responders introduced his own version of the James Zadroga Health and Compensation Act,"" said John Feal, the head of the FealGood Foundation advocacy group.He left out Upton, because Upton's bill dealing with health treatment was still in draft form. Goodlatte's bill would provide compensation at a similar level to the current Zadroga act, which is estimated to meet less than half of the need identified by an independent evaluator.""This bizarre act of unilateral action was ironically done the same day the James Zadroga Health and Compensation Act crossed the 60-vote threshold to make the bill filibuster proof,"" Feal said, noting that the existing, permanent bill would pass easily. ""Even more bizarre, Chairman Goodlatte didn’t consult with the House bill sponsors.""""It's an insult, is what it is,"" said Karrie Boswell, a Virginia firefighters' union member with 27 years of service in Fairfax, Virginia, who thought Ryan might have to intervene.""It might be the very first test of his leadership, to see how he handles it,"" Boswell told The Huffington Post.Ryan declared Thursday that he wanted the House to return to so-called regular order, where committees work on legislation before it goes to the House floor. If Goodlatte and Upton take up their only measures, the popular one backed by 9/11 advocates will never reach the floor.Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), the lead sponsor of the bill, said Friday if Ryan disregards the decision reached by House and Senate lawmakers, it would ""show a grave lack of judgment to unwind the will of such a vast majority.""""I hope the current speaker can analyze the issue on the facts and the merit and not make such a grave mistake in his first few weeks."" A spokesman for Ryan did not immediately answer a request for comment.Representatives for Goodlatte declined to speak on the record, but a committee staffer said the idea behind writing a new bill was to balance the needs of the victims with the money Congress could raise to fund the compensation program. And since the current program sunsets in 2016 after five years on the books, Goodlatte thought a similar five-year period would be better than a permanent extension, giving Congress a chance to re-evaluate in the future.Goodlatte also wanted to use the bill to raise compensation for victims of Iranian terrorism, and other acts of terror that have been adjudicated in the courts, the aide said, adding that such amendments would not have been possible on the existing 9/11 bill.Gillibrand, however, countered that she would have been happy to work with the House chairmen but they never spoke to her. She said she was particularly peeved because she spoke to Upton just a couple of days ago and asked if he supported her permanent bill.""I’m extremely disappointed that without calling me, without discussing with me, he then introduced a five-year bill,"" she said. ""It feels to me like it was drafted by junior staff who don’t know anything.""Advocates for first responders did not raise objections to helping other victims of terrorism, but weren't sure why that couldn't be done in a separate bill.And they were especially upset that both Goodlatte's measure and Upton's only last five years.“As a responder, that is like saying 'I see you have a fire on the 10th floor, but I am only going to the fifth floor,'"" said Richard Alles, Deputy Chief of the FDNY and a board member of Citizens for the Extension of the James Zadroga Act. ""Anyone else but Congress would fix the problem, not leave it hanging. Cancer does not last five years. This is basically saying we have to drag you all back here again and again to get the help we need.” When the original Zadroga Act passed, it was limited to five years, in part to show that it would not be subject to fraud and abuse. Since it has not been, responders say it's time for Congress to stop making them come hat in hand to lawmakers, and let them just worry about surviving.Boswell recalled how she joined a group of responders earlier this month who came to Washington to lobby their cause, after having already done so the month before when Jon Stewart visited Congress.It was obvious to her why lawmakers should stop requiring responders to trek to D.C. with their wheelchairs and oxygen tanks. And one firefighter offered an especially poignant example.""He was standing down in the Metro tunnel, and he explained to me that he hadn't been down in the subway in a long time,"" Boswell said. ""And as the subway train came rumbling into the station, in advance there was a loud rumble and a big rush of air. He said it took him right back, because he was in the second tower [of the World Trade Center] as it collapsed.""Some 4,000 responders have been diagnosed with 9/11-related cancer, and about 33,000 people are currently getting treatment in the medical program. It expired last month, but has enough cash to keep operating into next year. There are 470 Virginians in the medical program, and 85 who are eligible for compensation. In Michigan, Upton's state, there are about 80 9/11 responders, including 16 who are eligible for compensation. ""I'm just sitting here wondering how people continue to function if they have to deal with this stuff randomly in their life,"" said Boswell, who has been directing other responders to the Facebook pages of Goodlatte and other Virginia lawmakers. ""It's absolutely time to lift this burden off their backs. They should not have to come back down here and fight again in five years.""Alles' group also maintains a site that lets people track and contact lawmakers who support and oppose the permanent Zadroga bill.

5,SPORTS,Runners With Disabilities Gain Confidence And Community Through New York City Marathon,Juliet Spies-Gans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/runners-with-disabilities-nyc-marathon_us_5633b37de4b0c66bae5c5197,"They've run the miles, reached the milestones and accomplished every step of it with the help of others.",2015-10-30,A New York City Marathon participant crosses the famed Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5633c24b190000b100b95584.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After countless loops around Central Park and swings through the city’s avenues, Eliza Cooper took a turn and headed north. Past Yankee Stadium, past Morningside Heights, past that little red lighthouse on the brink of the Hudson River. As part of her training for the 2015 New York City Marathon, she powered up and across the George Washington Bridge before stopping in her tracks and taking a breath -- taking in the air that somehow just smelled differently from that height, from that distance away from the city.She had taken a new route, yes, and she had gone a greater distance, sure. But breathing that sea-stained air was remarkable for Cooper for a different reason: Because as a New Yorker with visual impairment she, for the first time, was able to truly experience this major cultural landmark.“It was kind of like this momentous feeling of not only has she now accomplished these miles but now she’s also accomplishing these new [experiences] -- not just pushing her body but also pushing her senses in a different way,” explained Kathleen Bateman, a director at the non-profit running organization Achilles International. Cooper is just one of Achilles International’s 294 disabled athletes who, paired with a physically abled guide, will be running or handcycling on Sunday in the 45th annual New York City Marathon. And Achilles is just one of countless charitable organizations that have been working with physically and mentally disabled marathon hopefuls around the boroughs, spending months, sometimes years, training them to fight through their ailments and run those 26.2 miles. In fact, according to Stephanie Paddock of the Michael J. Fox Foundation’s Team Fox, this year's marathon is so chock full of foundations and nonprofits that some charities have had to limit their number of runners. Team Fox will see 130 of its members step onto the course Sunday -- a “significantly lower” headcount than usual, but a change it has embraced given the added opportunities for the other grassroot organizations involved. While the marathon is indeed the end-goal for many of these charities, it is certainly not the be-all and end-all. Although Bateman estimated that roughly half of Achilles’ athletes will run the marathon at some point, she is careful to stress that taking part in that race is merely indicative of the athletes’ other, off-the-track successes, where personal bests are measured by emotions and mentality, not minutes and seconds.In other words, for many of these runners, the gold medals they receive after mile 26 are the concretized, tangible forms of their real successes: the struggles they have overcome, the pain they have endured and the lengths that they have gone to to even arrive at the point where they could think about training for a marathon.Achilles' New York chapter alone trains athletes with autism, traumatic brain injuries and partial and full blindness; they work with single and double amputees, those with kidney failure and with a history of strokes.“Some of the athletes who show up may have [previously] felt like they were very isolated with their own disability,” Bateman, who heads the chapter, told HuffPost. “Then they meet someone [at our practices] who, let’s say, is missing a leg. [Then] they themselves have a shift in their own view of their disability and their challenges.”Take Asim Baig, for example, who moved to New York in his mid-20s with virtually no support system and a serious visual impairment. In his words, he was overweight and plagued with self-doubt and low self-esteem. As his visual impairment effectively rendered him without depth perception -- unable to tell, say, whether an object was an inch or 10 feet away -- and with the potential for getting “confused” when he “moved around” if he wasn't familiar with the terrain, he had never participated in organized sports.“[In my family], the thought of having a disability was kind of stigmatized,” he said. “So [I never] learned how to adapt myself into society.”Three years ago, a social worker referred Baig to Achilles, and despite his hesitation, he joined for its social component. Never before having run more than one mile straight, he began to train two days a week. Then, he began to train more often, harder and longer, until he finished a five-mile race then a half-marathon, a triathlon and then the 2014 New York City Marathon.And when he realized that, with Achilles’ help, he could run a quarter, a half, a full marathon, he realized that his training would translate elsewhere in his life, as well. He began to ask for the classroom accommodations he needed at college, felt a spike in his self-esteem and became more vocal and active in the communities he was joining.“I wasn’t afraid [then],” he recalled. “... My ambitions toward becoming a better runner and triathlete helped me with my ambitions … [in all aspects of my life]. As an endurance sport, [running] kind of parallels life -- because life takes endurance, as well.”On Sunday, Baig will be taking part in his second consecutive New York City Marathon.“The best part of running is that it makes me forget about my disability,” he explained. “[Because, running with my guides], at the end of the day, we realize that we all have segments of life where it doesn’t matter if you’re disabled or abled, you still have to overcome the same obstacles.”  The Achilles International Handcycle Division at the 2013 New York City MarathonIt’s possible that Baig has seen fellow Achilles-devotee Michael Ring at some of the local meetings. Ring’s situation is in many ways the polar opposite of Baig’s. Ring had run 29 marathons and was training for his 30th when, in May 2014, he found himself “tripping over stuff” as if his “brain wasn’t talking to [his] feet.” He went to the emergency room, expecting a long day of waiting-room tedium -- instead, he got a four-month hospitalization, diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome and temporarily paralyzed.The man who could run 26.2 miles seemingly at the snap of his fingers suddenly, inexplicably, couldn’t take a step.“That expression ‘relearning to walk’ -- you don’t know what that means until you don’t know how to walk,” Ring told HuffPost. “I was looking at people like, ‘How do you do that? How do you take a step without your knee locking behind you?’”It took him 12 months after he was released from the hospital to be able to walk three miles. But now, with the help of his medical team, running friends and the newly founded Brooklyn chapter of Achilles -- and with those literal and symbolic first steps behind him -- he has settled upon his next goal. So what if he still has to use a wheelchair on occasion -- in 2016, he says, he will compete in the New York City Marathon.“[Achillles] has been really good to me,” Ring said. “... I know in a year I’ll be able to handle 26 [miles] … [My support groups and medical teams] are getting me stronger and they’re helping me figure out how to do things with the [means] that I have.” “I’m an atheist,” he continued. “And I think running did for me what church does for a lot of people. I meet with people who care about each other, we have goals -- when I was in the hospital, 95 percent of the people who visited me were running friends.”If running is Ring's religion, then he’s joined in the pews not just by other Achilles athletes, but also by those throng of other charities that have similarly dedicated time, effort and money to helping those with disabilities experience the marathon’s energy and electricity.Actor Michael J. Fox belongs to that proverbial congregation, which he made well known when he appeared on ""The Late Show With David Letterman"" two years ago, discussing how a single man with Parkinson’s disease motivated him to run the last leg of the 2013 marathon.Fox begins to discuss Mike Kelly and the marathon around the 6:30 mark.The man was 60-year-old Mike Kelly, who has, to date, run the marathon four times after being diagnosed with the disease a decade ago. He ran his first in 2009, when his daughter -- who was running in his honor -- dropped out of the race due to injury. He took her spot, finishing in a little over six hours. And then he ran it the next year, and the next, and then -- after the 2012 event was canceled due to Hurricane Sandy -- the next, in 2013. Each one of his children has ran and completed a marathon with him since that inaugural 2009 race, raising money for Parkinson’s research with each mile.“Just finishing is a big accomplishment for me, physically, as a Parkinson’s patient,” Kelly said. “[The biggest challenge of running with Parkinson’s] is keeping your head straight, thinking about what you’re doing, because it’s easy to wander off mentally,” he added. “It’s a mental game. [But] I can run better than I can walk. I have more balance, or it appears that I have more balance, and I [can] control my movements much better while I’m running.”In the 2011 race, Fox saw Kelly run by. He was so “moved” that he told Kelly that if he were to run again, Fox would join him for the last two or three miles. In 2013, the two made that happen.As they laced their way through Central Park, they heard cheers and shouts of encouragement for “Mike” -- both of their names. Fox turned to Kelly, and told him they were cheering for him -- not for the celebrity, who was hard to recognize in the dark, but for the man who had just run 24 miles with Parkinson's, who was then approaching yet another finish line. Kelly still remembers the conversation, reciting it word-for-word.“Finishing -- that [was] my runner’s high,” he said.For these athletes, who have overcome so many obstacles in order to be able to partake in this 26.2 mile track meet, Central Park is a place laden with symbolism. Training there for so many months with the help of guides, friends, family and strangers, it has become a place of community and growth, of physical and proverbial distances broached and goals achieved. As Baitman and Baig, Ring and Kelly suggested, in the ""religion"" of running, marathon training is simply a means to breaking down other, more critical barriers in these athletes’ lives, as they use groups such as Achilles International and Team Fox to rejoin communities and rediscover themselves. Baig said it well: the training runs simply bleed into “all other aspects” of these athletes’ days, as the impossible becomes attainable, one mile at a time.“There’s just this community built,” Bateman concluded. “So it becomes so much more than running the miles together -- it turns into lifelong friendships … 99 percent [of our runners finish the marathon], and that’s the power of the group. Together we are stronger.”Also on HuffPost:"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=crop_0_4_2000_1204%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Last week, the GOP-led House Select Committee on Benghazi held an 11-hour hearing with Hillary Clinton that was supposed to, in the words of chair Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), help deliver ""justice"" to the four Americans who died in the 2012 attack. ""Chris Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods served this country with courage and with honor,"" Gowdy said in his opening statement. ""And they were killed under circumstances that most of us could never imagine. ... They were more than four images on a television screen. They were husbands and fathers and sons and brothers and family and friends. They were Americans who believed in service and sacrifice.""Yet three years after that attack, the family of Doherty, a CIA contractor and former Navy SEAL, is still waiting for about $400,000 in survivor benefits it believes it deserves. Doherty was unmarried and had no children, and family members said they never realized they would be ineligible for financial support after his death. Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) said he watched nearly the entire hearing with Clinton last week and was struck by the irony of the affair. ""I think the perfect way to honor Glen's memory would be to pay the benefits that would have gone to his family,"" Lynch said. ""We're not asking anything that he did not expect here.

8,POLITICS,Family Of Slain Benghazi Contractor Waits For Benefits As Congress Focuses On Hillary Clinton's Emails,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/glen-doherty-cia-contractor-benghazi_us_563257e4e4b0c66bae5b7443,It's been three years since the attack.,2015-10-30,"CIA contractor Glen Doherty lost his life in the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=crop_108_41_1051_646%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Last week, the GOP-led House Select Committee on Benghazi held an 11-hour hearing with Hillary Clinton that was supposed to, in the words of chair Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), help deliver ""justice"" to the four Americans who died in the 2012 attack. ""Chris Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods served this country with courage and with honor,"" Gowdy said in his opening statement. ""And they were killed under circumstances that most of us could never imagine. ... They were more than four images on a television screen. They were husbands and fathers and sons and brothers and family and friends. They were Americans who believed in service and sacrifice.""Yet three years after that attack, the family of Doherty, a CIA contractor and former Navy SEAL, is still waiting for about $400,000 in survivor benefits it believes it deserves. Doherty was unmarried and had no children, and family members said they never realized they would be ineligible for financial support after his death. Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) said he watched nearly the entire hearing with Clinton last week and was struck by the irony of the affair. ""I think the perfect way to honor Glen's memory would be to pay the benefits that would have gone to his family,"" Lynch said. ""We're not asking anything that he did not expect here.

The debate drew an average of 14 million viewers, according to ratings agency Nielsen. The “undercard” debate earlier in the night featuring second-tier candidates drew a far less impressive 1.6 million viewers.By comparison, Fox News’ GOP debate drew an astonishing 24 million viewers, while CNN’s Republican debate garnered 22.6 million. The Democratic debate on CNN, meanwhile, brought in 15.3 million viewers.CNBC's previous record was set during the Winter Olympics in 2002, when the network scored 3.9 million viewers.While CNBC has called Wednesday’s forum a “hard-hitting debate that changed the course of the Republican primary,” the network has been roundly criticized by conservatives and liberals alike for asking impertinent questions, appearing caught off guard and unprepared, and asking “gotcha” questions. As The Huffington Post's Michael Calderone put it, “Media types, partisan and nonpartisan alike, seemed to agree the big loser was CNBC.”The network, however, seemed to make out well financially, charging a whopping $250,000 for each ad slot during the debate.
