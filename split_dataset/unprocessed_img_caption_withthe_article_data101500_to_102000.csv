Security Council on Monday voted to override China's objections and formally add North Korea, including allegations of grave human rights abuses, to the council's agenda.There were 11 votes in favor, two against and two abstentions. Russia and China voted against the inclusion of North Korea on the council's agenda, but as there are no vetoes in procedural votes of the council, the Chinese attempt to defeat the measure failed.It has been nearly a decade since the council held a similar procedural vote. Previously, the council's discussion of North Korea was limited to its nuclear weapons program. But with the vote, all aspects of the country can now be scrutinized by the 15-nation body.Before the vote, China's U.N. ambassador told council members ""the Security Council is not the forum to get involved in human rights issues"" and that it ""should refrain from doing anything that might cause an escalation.""After the vote, a formal meeting on North Korea began immediately, as requested by Australian Ambassador Gary Quinlan, who described the council move as ""an historic step.""The discussion comes after the General Assembly on Friday urged the council to consider referring North Korea to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity as alleged in a U.N. inquiry report released in February.In an address to the council, Assistant Secretary-General Taye-Brook Zerihoun raised the hacking of Sony Pictures , which Washington has blamed on North Korea, though he said the United Nations was not privy to FBI information.""The rise in the incidence and severity of cyber-attacks is of increasing concern,"" he said.The U.N. Commission of Inquiry report details wide-ranging abuses in North Korea, including prison camps, systematic torture, starvation and killings comparable to Nazi-era atrocities.""Rarely has such an extensive charge-sheet of international crimes been brought to this council's attention,"" Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights Ivan Simonovic said.""It documents a totalitarian system that is characterized by brutally enforced denial of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, as well as the rights to freedom of opinion, expression, information and association,"" he added.Council scrutiny is unlikely to lead to action at the ICC, which looks at serious abuses like genocide and other crimes against humanity, as China could veto such a move.China is Pyongyang's principal ally and protector.

1,POLITICS,Marijuana Prohibition in Nebraska and Oklahoma Is the Real Nuisance,"Bill Piper, ContributorDrug Policy Alliance, Director of National Affairs",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marijuana-prohibition-in-_b_6368574.html,"Leaving aside the fact that states, and for that matter the federal government, cannot force states to criminalize marijuana, the lawsuit gets things backwards -- it is Nebraska, Oklahoma and other states with marijuana prohibition that are creating a public nuisance.",2014-12-22,"LOS ANGELES, CA - OCTOBER 19: Dave Warden, a bud tender at Private Organic Therapy (P.O.T.), a non-profit co-operative medical marijuana dispensary, displays various types of marijuana available to patients on October 19, 2009 in Los Angeles, California. Attorney General Eric Holder announced new guidelines today for federal prosecutors in states where the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes is allowed under state law. Federal prosecutors will no longer trump the state with raids on the southern California dispensaries as they had been doing, but Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley recently began a crackdown campaign that will include raids against the facilities. Cooley maintains that virtually all marijuana dispensaries are in violation of the law because they profit from their product. The city of LA has been slow to come to agreement on how to regulate its 800 to 1,000 dispensaries. Californians voted to allow sick people with referrals from doctors to consume cannabis with the passage of state ballot Proposition 215 in 1996 and a total of 14 states now allow the medicinal use of marijuana.

If people want something, someone somewhere will make it and sell it to them. The U.S. has spent decades trying to stop marijuana and other drugs but the demand for them, like the demand for alcohol during Prohibition, ensures that they are widely available.Nebraska and Oklahoma were awash with marijuana before Colorado and three other states legalized marijuana. And marijuana will be widely available in their states regardless of what policies Colorado and other states set.The debate over marijuana legalization is not about whether people should use or sell marijuana, millions already are. The debate is about who should control the marijuana trade -- drug cartels or regulated business owners -- and where should the proceeds from marijuana sales go -- to organized crime bosses or government coffers, for machine guns and hit men or education and treatment.Colorado has chosen to take marijuana off the streets and control it through a regulated system where young people do not have access. Nebraska and Oklahoma have chosen to let criminal organizations decide where marijuana is sold and who it is sold to.One of Nebraska's complaints is that they are forced to spend law enforcement resources dealing with marijuana, but they would be doing that regardless of what kind of marijuana policy Colorado set. As long as there is a demand for marijuana in Nebraska, there will be a supply.And of course, Nebraska does not have to waste law enforcement resources on marijuana. Colorado voters adopted marijuana legalization in part because they wanted to stop wasting law enforcement resources filling jails and prisons with nonviolent offenders. Nebraska could make money instead of wasting money if it followed Colorado's lead.Legalization and regulation bring control. Colorado has 500 pages of marijuana law and regulations that include mandatory state and local licensing, background checks, financial disclosures, video surveillance, alarm systems, seed-to-sale tracking, RFID tags, child-resistant packaging, labeling and testing.In contrast, policymakers in Nebraska, Oklahoma, and other states where marijuana is prohibited have no control over marijuana, its use, production or distribution.It is marijuana prohibition that is the real nuisance. It is is costly and dangerous to Nebraskans and neighboring states.Bill Piper is the director of national affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance.This piece first appeared on the Drug Policy Alliance Blog: http://www.drugpolicy.org/blog/marijuana-prohibition-nebraska-and-oklahoma-real-nuisance"
2,POLITICS,Howard Kurtz Is Wrong About April Ryan's Press Conference Question,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/howard-kurtz-april-ryan-obama-presser_n_6368566.html,,2014-12-22,"President Barack Obama speaks during a news conference in the Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House in Washington, Friday, Dec. 19, 2014. The president claimed an array of successes in 2014, citing lower unemployment, a rising number of Americans covered by health insurance, and an historic diplomatic opening with Cuba. He also touts his own executive action and a Chinese agreement to combat global warming. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais )",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e1ea2100005002c968e6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In a very perplexing column Monday, Howard Kurtz of Fox News reflects on President Barack Obama's year-end press conference last week with the White House press corps. He has a hard time making up his mind about what he saw. What a mess! Kurtz begins by lamenting a perceived lack of tough questions (the headline asks, ""Where were the tough questions?), proceeds to say that it's okay if there are not tough questions at a press conference with the president (""I’m not saying the press has to be prosecutorial toward the president"") then goes on to note that there were tough questions (from The Wall Street Journal's Colleen Nelson and The Associated Press' Julie Pace), and only gets around to criticizing anyone at about the eighth paragraph -- where he runs down McClatchy Newspapers' Lesley Clark for asking a ""five-part question"" that allowed Obama to filibuster. (Which is, I'd say, a fair point, though how often does Lesley Clark get a chance to ask questions? Maybe she has a lot of them.)But then, Kurtz gets around to the question asked by American Urban Radio Networks White House correspondent April Ryan. And by all appearances, it is something to which he was not paying close attention:Radio reporter April Ryan asked about black America, which could have been a provocative question in the wake of Ferguson and Staten Island. But she simply asked, “What is the state of relations?” And that allowed the president to hold forth on how things have gotten better but there’s more work to do.Kurtz' characterization of Ryan's question is almost entirely untrue.In the first place, some context is needed. Obama had, moments before, called a halt to the press conference and was preparing to quit the stage (as one member of the gathered press corps attempted to ask Obama the ultra-hard hitting inquiry, ""Any New Year's resolutions?"") when he reconsidered and called on Ryan. One might be inclined to give Ryan a break if, amid the hullabaloo, she didn't ask the most composed question. But Kurtz sells her several miles short by reporting that she ""simply asked"" this question: ""What is the state of relations?"" That's not the question she asked, however:RYAN: Six years ago this month, I asked you what was the state of black America in the Oval Office, and you said it was the “the best of times and the worst of times.” You said it was the best of times in the sense that there was -- has never been more opportunity for African-Americans to receive a good education, and the worst of times for unemployment and the lack of opportunity. We're ending 2014. What is the state of black America as we talk about those issues as well as racial issues in this country?Ryan didn't ask about ""relations,"" she asked Obama for his assessment on the ""state of black America."" In so doing, she referenced a (somewhat glib) comment Obama made to her back in 2008 and asked if he could stand behind it six years later. Now, perhaps Kurtz is unsatisfied with Obama's answer. If so, he should say so. (Feel free to make your own assessment.) But this interrogative technique -- in which the interlocutor brings up a past statement to see if the person who made the statement can still defend it -- is fairly de rigeur for political reporting. It's basically what the hosts of every Sunday show do on a weekly basis. Of course, in order to have moments like these, a reporter has to plant a seed in the first place. That's why I'm surprised that Kurtz doesn't see the value in the question that Bloomberg's Cheryl Bolen asked at this same press conference:BOLEN: Looking ahead to your work with Congress next year, you’ve mentioned as an area of possible compromise tax reform. And so I am wondering, do you see a Republican Congress as presenting a better opportunity for actually getting tax reform next year? Will you be putting out a new proposal? Are you willing to consider both individual and corporate side of the tax ledger there? And also, are you still concerned about corporate inversions?That question led to a lengthy answer in which Obama spoke very optimistically about the work that could get done between his administration and the Republican-dominated Congress. ""The tax area is one area where we can get things done,"" he said, adding that there were ""principles"" that he and the GOP had in common. And he didn't stop there. The president also suggested that he was going to try to move on infrastructure spending with this Congress.All of which means that by this time next year, if nothing has been achieved on either of these fronts, some enterprising reporter is going to get to reference these statements and ask the president why he got that wrong, and whether there was more he could have done to hatch an agreement. Perhaps Bolen will get to ask that herself. More likely than not, it will be another reporter who closes that circle -- and the credit Bolen deserves for planting that seed will go unmentioned. But it is upon the work of people like Bolen that future ""tough questions"" are built.April Ryan, by contrast, was fortunate enough to be able to ask her own follow-up of the president. She literally did the same thing that Tim Russert once did every single Sunday. The only difference is that if it had been Russert asking that question, he'd have been hailed as a genius.

3,MEDIA,No Limits to Freedom of the Press?,"Amitai Etzioni, ContributorUniversity Professor and Professor of international relations,...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/no-limits-to-freedom-of-t_b_6368446.html,"As long as one grants that the United States' security requires that the state be able to keep some secrets, the question stands: should there be some limitations on the freedom of the press and who and how will determine what these ought to be?",2014-12-22,"MEET THE PRESS -- Pictured: (l-r) James Risen, National Security Reporter, New York Times, appears on 'Meet the Press' in Washington, D.C., Sunday, June 16, 2013. (Photo by: William B. Plowman/NBC/NBC NewsWire via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5c28c260000360082c6c4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Few things bring about so furious a storm of media protest from the Left and the Right as does jailing a reporter. No wonder Attorney General Eric Holder, who is about to leave office and is no doubt concerned about his legacy, did not want to end his years in office by jailing James Risen, a Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times reporter. At issue in the Risen subpoena case is his source for details of an operation bungled by the CIA. According to Risen, the CIA provided Iran, via a Russian scientist, with blueprints for a ""nuclear bomb-triggering device"" that the CIA had deliberately sabotaged by including a flaw. The Russian scientist told Iran about the flaw, and Risen alleged in his book that this operation consequently ""assisted the Iranians in joining the nuclear club."" In 2011, the court subpoenaed Risen to divulge whether former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling had leaked to him state secrets about that operation and other United States intelligence activities in Iran. Risen appealed the subpoena and announced that he would go to jail sooner than reveal his source. In his recent book, Pay Any Price: Greed, Power, and Endless War, Risen argues that his refusal to testify is doing the Lord's work, or at least that of the people, because the government protects its failures by making them into state secrets. The Supreme Court rejected his final appeal in 2014, which paved the way for the Justice Department to prosecute him for contempt of court should he refuse to testify. However, the Department of Justice announced on December 12 that it would not seek or enforce such a subpoena. Most readers of the preceding lines, me included, would hold that the public should be informed about a poorly-designed operation such as the one at issue in the Risen subpoena case. This disclosure would cause no harm to national security, because Iran has already discovered and avoided the flaw. However, the question stands: Who is to judge whether the publication of other state secrets harms national security? Should each reporter or publisher be free to make this ruling? If yes, who qualifies these days as a reporter or publisher? One may trust the editor-in-chief of The New York Times, The Washington Post, or The Wall Street Journal -- but what about the editor-in-chief of The New York Post? The Village Voice? The National Inquirer? What about anyone who reports to or runs a blog?Also, whoever leaked the information committed a crime and violated his sworn oath not to reveal state secrets. Risen seems to know who committed this crime. Indeed, as Sarah Chayes points out, that reporters are often ""goading"" government officials to hand over classified documents. Many believe that reporters should be protected by a 'shield' law when they seek such information. However, until Congress passes such a law -- should they be free to ignore laws all others have to abide by?Last but not least, the Espionage Act of 1917 criminalized ""provid[ing] classified information to those persons not authorized to receive it."" ""As it is currently written,"" writes the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, ""Knowingly receiving classified information that has been obtained illegally, as well as passing it on, also runs afoul of the Espionage Act."" The press argues that reporting leaked state secrets is not a violation of the Act because reporters -- who have aired many other state secrets, including the names of CIA agents in the field, nuclear bomb designs, and the fact that the United States has a mole somewhere in al Qaeda's headquarters -- report to the public and not to the enemy. However, this is a questionable defense, because one must assume that ISIS, al Qaeda, and others who wish the United States harm will read such reports and draw on them.Finally, Risen and others argue that the United States systematically over-classifies government information, and hence reporters cannot do their jobs without publishing classified information. This argument has considerable merit. Indeed, too much information is classified and the United States should classify less of it and declassify more. But as long as one grants that the United States' security requires that the state be able to keep some secrets, the question stands: should there be some limitations on the freedom of the press and who and how will determine what these ought to be?

""I think it’s a time for everyone to put aside political debates, put aside protests, put aside all of the things that we will talk about in due time.

Braton's comments came after NYPD officers turned their back on the mayor following a visit to Woodhull Hospital, where the two fallen cops were pronounced dead Saturday.""I think he has lost it with some officers,"" Bratton said. ""I was at the hospital when that event occurred.... I don't support that particular activity, I don't think it was appropriate, particularly in that setting, but it's reflective of the anger of some of them.""De Blasio angered the police union after he admitted that he had to train his bi-racial son to be extra careful during interactions with police.""What parents have done for decades who have children of color, especially young men of color, is train them to be very careful when they have a connection with a police officer,"" de Blasio said. ""It's different for a white child. That's just the reality in this country.""Previous research has shown that black men are 21 times more likely to be killed by police than their white counterparts.

5,FIFTY,The 5 Best Moments For Those 50 And Older In 2014,Yagana Shah,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/baby-boomer-news-2014-_n_6317196.html,,2014-12-22,"Actress Monica Bellucci poses for photographers at the announcement for the new Bond film, the 24th in the series, at Pinewood Studios in west London, Thursday, Dec. 4, 2014.

Post 50s have been making headlines in all sorts of amazing ways -- and it's mostly been good. The bad news is that our two favorite Post-50 hunks, George Clooney and Brad Pitt, are officially off the market! We never thought we'd see the day when Clooney would tie the knot again, but 2014 just happened to be the magic number. Here's the good news:1. Older women are hot-hot-hot in Hollywood.  If you've been watching TV or movies, you're bound to have noticed that older women are hot in Hollywood. Just this month, 50-year-old bombshell Monica Bellucci was picked to be the oldest Bond girl in the upcoming film, ""Spectre."" Helen Mirren is one of the newest and oldest faces of cosmetic giant L'Oreal Paris. Soon-to-be-50 actress Viola Davis is the star of a new hit show, ""How To Get Away With Murder."" Christie Brinkley posed in a bikini on the cover of People Magazine at 60!If that's not enough, beloved fashion icon Barbie herself turned 55 this year and she's still got it! 2. Post 50s are taking social media by storm.  Forget the notion that older folks aren't a part of communities like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Everyone from former presidents, diplomats, actors and actresses are acing social media. Here's the proof, in case you missed it. Comedian Conan O'Brien was put in his place after he sarcastically tweeted he was going to be ""slutty Madeleine Albright for Christmas."" Albright tweeted back, reminding us you should never ever mess with a former Secretary of State. ""I'm considering going as hunky Conan O'Brien -- but that might be too far fetched.""Former Presidents Bush (Jr.) and Clinton also enjoyed some lighthearted fun, taking jabs at each other on both Twitter and Instagram. Basically, what we're trying to say is, you should get in on the fun if you aren't already. 3. Turns out, aging is mostly in your head.  Perception really does trump reality, it seems, when it comes to getting older. The proof: recent studies that suggest you may be able to think yourself younger. In October, researchers from Yale and University of California, Berkeley released a study which highlighted the power of stereotypes when it comes to aging. After just four weekly sessions of brain training, in which participants were shown positive words associated with youth and those representing aging, participants saw improvements in physical ability. Some of these words included, ""wise,"" ""spry"" and ""senior."" Another British study found that older adults who felt fulfilled in life were 30 percent more likely to live longer than their unfulfilled counterparts. Just a reminder that the mind really is stronger than the body.4. Hugs could help turn back the clock.  Warm, comforting embraces may be good for more than just the positive vibes. Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley believe that oxytocin, the ""love"" hormone, released from bonding with loved ones, could help repair damaged muscles, making you (almost) as good as young, once again. Older mice injected with the hormone were able to repair deterioration making them 80 percent as strong as younger mice, when it came to muscle repair abilities.So go ahead, hug it out in 2015. 5. Life expectancy is greater than ever.  While Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel may have sparked a national debate about aging, when he wrote a controversial blog, ""Why I Hope To Die At 75,"" a new report from the Centers For Disease Control says Americans are likely going to live a little longer. The report says Americans have a life expectancy of 78.8 years as of 2012, ""a record high."" As we all know, women's life expectancy is on average, slightly longer than for men, at 81.2 years, compared with 76.4 years for men. The CDC attributes the rise to falling cancer and heart disease rates, the two leading causes of death, which have been on a decline since 1999. "

What motivates individuals to dive into the throes of a dangerous pandemic in order to save innocent people's lives? An Ebola worker named Moses recently shared his story with me. This Moses, a 46 year old Sierra Leonean man, may not walk on water, but he has walked the walk of a public servant for decades, working tirelessly to lead children and shunned individuals out of the red sea of blood and trauma in Sierra Leone and nearby Liberia.Moses was called to action early. After graduating with Honors in Linguistics in a Freetown college and working as a language arts school teacher, the Sierra Leone Civil War exploded on him and his country. Rebel troops abducted over twenty thousand children, drugging, molesting, and forcing them to serve as child soldiers. Moses formed the Defense for Children International SL and became a project supervisor at the International Rescue Committee for the psychological adjustment and social integration of former child soldiers. He writes: ""I felt deep satisfaction with this work which definitely made a difference to families uprooted and ravaged...I have been drawn to this kind of work since."" After 2002, Moses worked for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to help Liberian refugees coerced into becoming child soldiers. He explained that he also co-founded Green Africa SL (Sierra Leone) where he still works:...for the economic empowerment of especially rural women and youth when, alas, the epidemic (Ebola) struck...This epidemic threatens not only our lives and that of our loved ones but also everything we have worked for. We have seen...stigmatization of people only because they or their loved ones were sick or killed by the disease...myths and misinformation about Ebola were widespread.One such myth spreads the falsehood that survivors are contagious. In truth, survivors to date seem to be immune from the disease. Many of the individuals who lived in Ebola-riddled households are children - over 11,000 children are now directly affected, with over 5,000 having lost one or both parents. The littlest boy in the photograph below is a double orphan now living with relatives - his mother died in July and father passed away in August. But the boy goes back every day to the house where he lived with his parents, hoping miraculously to find them there one day. Double Ebola Orphans  Photo courtesy of Moses ZomboHis teenage sister, also shown in the photo, has become pregnant since the parents died. Part of this may be due to all schools in Sierra Leone being shut down since September. One hundred teachers are under quarantine, and others are attending the sick. Two million children are NOT attending school. Fifty thousand children live on the streets, vulnerable to trafficking. Moses' colleague, Harvard Professor Theresa Betancourt, who studies resilience among children in adversity in Sierra Leone and many other settings, refers to this dilemma as the ""second wave of problems...orphaned children on this streets and teen pregnancy...(there are) few safe places for them to find acceptance."" Moses treads a lonely trail through Ebola barricades to provide psychosocial aid so that these traumatized victims do not become another lost generation. Sierra Leone, one of the poorest countries in the world, has only one psychiatrist (retired) and 20 psychiatric nurses (one trainee just died from Ebola) toil for 6 million citizens. Moses donated his own money to train Ebola survivors and people from social work backgrounds. Ebola Fighter Trainees - Moses on the far right  Photo courtesy of Moses Zombo He worries that ""the social fabric of this society is going to pieces as it did after the (Sierra Leone Civil War) conflict."" In fact, many Ebola victims were previously victims in the Sierra Leone Civil War. Dr. Betancourt notes:One of the most troubling things we are seeing in this epidemic are the consequences of health systems and public trust that were never restored after the devastating civil wars in Liberia and Sierra Leone...This crisis must be seen as a chance for the region to ""build back better"" in order to move ahead in advancing human health and well-being. A very critical part of this in the light of the massive trauma that children and families have experienced is community-based psychosocial support.Moses is excited that the Irish charity GOAL has supported setting up a Kenema interim care center for homeless children. UNICEF is establishing interim care centers for the children of people with Ebola. He is in awe of the heroic resilience that affected individuals have shown. For instance, Juliana is 22, a nursing student. Her mother, a nurse who worked in the X-ray department at the Kemena government hospital, became infected with the Ebola virus. Juliana, who cared for her mother, caught the virus as did her younger son, fiancé, and sister. All these family members died except for her. Ebola Survivor/Fighter Juliana and her Son  Photo courtesy of Moses ZomboJuliana completely recovered in a month, then immediately joined volunteers giving psychosocial support to affected people while also taking care of her other son, her young brother and the daughter of her deceased sister. As Ebola Fighter Juliana put it, ""There is not a nobler job in the world than that which saves lives.""Moses agrees: ""This is a critical time...In spite of the world seeming to crumble around us,...we recognize that with our lives and that of our loved ones at stake, we owe it to ourselves to do this."" And so, Moses and Juliana walk the Ebola Worker walk, guiding Sierra Leoneans toward resilience and emotional health."

Once the fifth interim distribution is complete, he said, 1,154 accounts will be fully satisfied.A court hearing to consider approving the payout has been scheduled for Jan. 15.Madoff, 76, is serving a 150-year prison term after pleading guilty in March 2009.Five former Madoff employees were sentenced to prison terms of two to 10 years earlier this month, following their conviction in March of fraud and other charges for helping Madoff conceal his fraud for decades.Fifteen people, including Madoff himself, have been convicted at trial or pleaded guilty in connection with the Ponzi scheme.

(AP Photo/John Amis, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e1ed2500008e013a57bb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The climate movement tends to talk about ""theories of change"" rather than ""theories of power."" But if you think about power -- who has it, what are its mechanisms, how can it be used -- then government looms large. Government is more than one-third of the economy; its judicial and regulatory apparatus touches everything; the private sector depends almost entirely on the infrastructure of the public sector; and during times of crisis the state is private industry's life-support system.When pondering mechanisms that the climate movement might use to maximize its impact in the short time still available, consider this: The federal government could, without any new laws, significantly restrict both the supply of, and demand for, fossil fuels. In other words, if the climate movement is serious about controlling Big Carbon it needs to get serious about Big Government.Only the state has the power to euthanize the fossil fuel industry. Divestment and marching are good and important tactics; they demonstrate popular power but that power needs to be brought to bear on mechanisms -- like government regulation -- that can directly control the fossil fuel industry.The federal government could restrict demand for fossil fuel by making it expensive, and it could do that by implementing legally mandated, strict EPA regulations on greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. Polluters would have to pay heavy fines and that would raise the cost of dirty energy. As for supply, the government could start by taking its own fossil fuel reserves off the market.The time is right to press on both mechanisms, but neither will happen unless green activists demand robust federal action. Good news: that's starting to happen.Obama may have even cracked opened a door that the movement can push further. He has said, ""We're not going to be able to burn it all."" And his mildly ambitious though inadequate emissions reduction agreement with China, will be implemented (if at all) through enforcement of existing laws, most importantly, the Clean Air Act as interpreted by the 2007 Supreme Court ruling in Massachusetts v EPA. If aggressively applied the Clean Air Act could severely restrict the demand for fossil fuels across the entire energy and transportation sectors.Less discussed is government control of the fossil fuel reserves beneath public lands. Shockingly -- if you consider the climate science -- federally owned coal, oil and gas reserves account for more than one-quarter of all fossil fuel production in the U.S. (That is down from public property sourcing about a third of all production just prior to the fracking boom on private lands.) Control of these massive reserves lies with the president -- he could start pulling public fossil fuel reserves from the market now, without congressional approval.Mass v EPAHow did the EPA get this climate specific power? The story goes back to 1997 when President Clinton signed the Kyoto protocol, an international agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions, but the Senate never ratified the treaty, and President Bush subsequently renounced it. In response, Massachusetts, several other states, and various green groups all sued the EPA in 2003. The plaintiffs argued that the federal government was obliged to use the Clean Air Act of 1970 to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.In 2007, the Supreme Court finally ruled. Yes, the EPA was legally bound to use the Clean Air Act to regulate GHG emissions. At the time it was estimated that the new regulations could achieve a 40 percent reduction of U.S. Carbon emissions over 1990 levels by 2020. Then came years of deliberate inaction and foot-dragging by two administrations.Now the Agency is finally starting to promulgate the specific GHG rules required by Mass v EPA. The two regulations issued thus far have been politically easy: a federal standard for passenger vehicles, which was largely redundant with already existing state regulations; and restrictions on new coal-fired plants which were not actually going to be built because of a glut of cheap fracked gas.More importantly, the EPA is currently crafting rules for existing power plants. The Agency took comment all summer and fall and will issue the new rules in June 2015. A number of large green groups mobilized members to comment at EPA hearings, and an impressive 8 million public comments were logged. But, with the exception of a few small and midsized groups such as the Center for Biological Diversity, most of the green groups did not demand that these new rules be science-based, i.e. much tighter than those on offer. And the effort has been strangely low profile; there is no robust campaign of popular education, mass mobilization, protest, or direct action aimed at the EPA.There was very little, if any, mention of the Agency among the signs, chants and media comments at the otherwise wonderful and massive Peoples Climate March. Alas, many of the youth and high-profile troublemakers in the movement too often write government off as ""broken"" and deliberately turn away from even trying to understand it. (I realize government is not ""sexy"" or simple, but to deliberately turn away from it courts disaster.)Industry, on the other hand, takes government and the EPA very seriously. Their fear of the Agency has been expressed in a 15-year long crusade against it. The offensive began in 1999 when the American Petroleum Institute, the trade association of Big Carbon, called an anti-EPA war council attended by players from: aluminum, petrochemicals, electric power, aerospace, airlines, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the Chamber of Commerce. This mob has been fighting the EPA ever since.As a result, the EPA is feeling much more pressure from industry than it is from the climate movement. This is unfortunate. As shown by the successful defense of USDA organics standards a decade ago, the so-far-successful mobilization to defend net neutrality, and the fight against the as-yet-not approved Keystone XL pipeline, citizen campaigns can positively shape government regulations.Other EPA rules that the climate movement should get ready to try and shape include those regulating oil refining, the cement industry, paper, chemical and fertilizer production, air, rail, and shipping.Government-Owned Fossil FuelsAnother important point of leverage is the federal government's direct control over the supply of fossil fuels. According to the U.S. Energy Information Agency, 26.4 percent of total U.S. fossil fuel production is sourced from federal and tribal lands. That means about a quarter of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions originated as publicly owned fossil fuel reserves. According to Stratus Consulting, these government owned fuels produce annual greenhouse gas emissions equal to 283 million passenger vehicles.Since 1982, the federal government has, according to the Environmental Working Group, ""leased or offered for oil and gas drilling 229 million acres of public and private land in 12 western states."" Worse yet, most of these reserves aren't even sold at a decent price. A report by Oil Change International estimates the U.S. Government loses $2.2 billion a year due to low royalties on public reserves; that's 10 percent of the $22 billion annual subsidy the U.S. Government gives to the petroleum industry.Translation: the federal government owns vast amounts of fossil fuels and if we are serious about not burning all existing hydrocarbon reserves, that is the most feasible place to start. Unlike Exxon Mobil the government is, at least in theory, a publicly accountable institution.Even as a lame duck president -- or especially so as he is not worried about re-election -- Obama could be forced to use his power to severely limit the amount of fossil fuels produced on our public lands. Like EPA enforcement of the Clean Air Act, aggressive presidential action on this front does not require approval from Congress.If pressured by a movement, Obama could do several things. First, he could direct the secretary of the interior, Sally Jewell, to issue a Secretarial Order banning all further petroleum leasing until there is a federal energy strategy that takes into account the climate consequences of fossil fuel combustion.Though the Interior Department is tasked with making public resources available for private exploration, it also has the well-established power to pull lands from development ""in order to maintain other public values."" Protecting the climate would fit the definition of a ""public value.""Imagine putting a quarter, to one third, of all known U.S. fossil fuel reserves beyond the reach of Big Carbon. The economic and ideological impact would be tremendous; among other things this would send an important message to the rest of the world.Lest that sound impossible, the Obama administration has done this sort of thing already. The previous secretary of the interior, Ken Salazar, withdrew one million acres of land around the Grand Canyon from possible uranium mining. The ""other public values"" he cited as justification included pollution risks to waterways and public health.(Alas, Obama usually does the opposite. In 2013, the Administration, via the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management, offered up 5.7 million acres for lease to industry. The Interior Department also sped up the permitting process for drilling and opened an additional 59 million acres for oil and gas drilling offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. And, the BLM approved more than 800,000 acres for extra-filthy tar sands and oil shale development in the Green River Formation, a vast stretch of terrain in Utah, Wyoming and Colorado that contains 2 to 7 times more energy and pollution than the Alberta Tar Sands. All very, very bad.)A second, more difficult action would be to cancel existing leases whenever there can be found sufficient technical, financial, or environmental problems. Under the Mineral Leasing Act any non-producing lease can be cancelled automatically when the lessee violates the law, regulations, or lease terms. The Interior Department could be instructed to search for such violations and cancel leases accordingly.The third thing Obama could do is go after producing leases, which can be cancelled for violations of law, regulation, or lease terms, but only after a judicial proceeding. That would be more difficult, but not impossible.As Taylor McKinnon of the Center for Biological Diversity put it: ""Averting the worst global warming means leaving most proved fossil fuel reserves in the ground. If the world is going to act, Obama will need to lead, and that leadership should start on U.S. public lands. He has the legal authority -- does he have the political will?""Obviously, he does not. But, like other presidents before him who have faced mass and disruptive protest, he could be forced to acquire it.How to AttackClearly, the Obama administration will not use its control of public lands and the Clean Air Act unless hounded, harassed, and humiliated into doing so. How might activists intervene to shape these processes? That has to be worked out in practice. Thankfully we have examples.Tim deChristopher struck directly at the misuse of public lands when he sabotaged a BLM petroleum lease auction. Ingeniously, deChristopher just joined the bidding, out-bid the companies, and then refused to pay. Valiantly, the price deChristopher paid for calling attention to the BLM's disgusting, reckless, profligate, totally insane folly was two years in prison. But, in proof that direct action gets the goods, then secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar, soon canceled many of the worst Bush-era oil and gas leases -- including the patch deChristopher bid on.If there is one thing we know about Obama it is that he is vain, wants to be loved by everyone, and absolutely hates criticism from the left. Perhaps that's why he seems to respond to it. Consider the fact that he is all but publicly committed to vetoing the Keystone XL pipeline. Clearly, the president did not like having Michael Brune, Bill McKibben, and scores of other high profile figures arrested at the end of his driveway anymore than he like tens of thousands of activists -- many of them veterans of the 2008 Obama canvas -- condemning him personally for selling out his daughters' futures. Nor does he like many young activists who use nonviolent direct action against Big Carbon's extraction and transportation operations. One suspects the equally self-regarding Sally Jewell, current Secretary of the Interior and former REI executive, is similarly sensitive.Government gets such a bad rap that many on the Left overlook the good it does. But history is full of examples of state power serving as a progressive force and crystallizing left victories. It was not just the tenacity of CIO organizers against the bosses that led to the massive boom in union density during the 1930s and 1940s, the Wagner Act helped catalyze their power. Nor did the white power structure of the Jim Crow South ever relent, change its mind, say it was sorry, or in anyway not pursue it's agenda of racist segregation. But it was eventually forced to restore the vote to southern African-Americans by way of Federal laws and troops, which were forced to intervene by the Civil Rights Movement. When Act Up demanded AIDS research, they did not just target the medical industry, they also had a direct action campaign targeting the regulators of that industry, the USDA. From those efforts came an HIV treatment protocol. (For details check out the excellent documentary How to Survive a Plague.)Or, more directly connected to the climate issue, recall the improbable origins of the EPA and the Clean Air Act, both signed into law by rightwing Richard Nixon; his hand forced by the massive protests of Earth Day, and all the other movements of that era. Today is different, but not entirely.There are signs that the climate movement is thinking of creative ways to pressure government to lead on climate. Litigation by the Sierra Club and the Center for Biological Diversity has blocked all new public lands lease sales in California for over two years, and Friends of the Earth just filed a lawsuit demanding a halt to all leasing of U.S. government-owned coal. The Center is planning an advocacy and protest campaign around both the EPA and leasing on public lands to start early in 2015.The climate science is very clear: We do not have many years left to avoid the worst of runaway climate change, the movement's ultimate short to medium term goal must be closing the fossil fuel industry. What force, what mechanisms, which institutions could actually do this? Does anyone really imagine that the fossil fuel industry can be convinced to change by way of smart arguments, or shamed out of existence, or tricked into believing there is a carbon bubble by way of spin and headlines, or even starved of investment capital?Let's be as radical as reality itself. Ultimately, only Big Government, (if forced to by the people) will be strong enough to subdue and euthanize Big Carbon.--Christian Parenti teaches at New York University in the Global Liberal Studies program.

Bernice Johnson Reagon later wrote ""Ella's Song"" based on those words, made famous by the a cappella group, Sweet Honey in the Rock.Baker's words certainly resonate today, as we witness the rebirth of a new civil rights movement, sparked by the police killings of young black men, but rooted in the underlying grievances of racial injustice around jobs, housing, schools, and the criminal justice system. As the protests spread from Ferguson to Los Angeles, New York, Cleveland and around the country, today's young activists can learn much from Ella Baker's ideas. Working behind the scenes, she helped transform the Southern sit-in protests into a powerful movement for racial justice, led by young people with lots of anger and determination, but little political experience.Late in the afternoon of February 1, 1960, four young black men -- Ezell Blair Jr., David Richmond, Franklin McCain, and Joseph McNeil, all students at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College in Greensboro -- visited the local Woolworth's store. They purchased school supplies and toothpaste, and then they sat down at the store's lunch counter and ordered coffee. ""I'm sorry,"" said the waitress. ""We don't serve Negroes here.""   The four students refused to give up their seats until the store closed. The local media soon arrived and reported the sit-in on television and in the newspapers. The four students returned the next day with more students, and by February 5 about 300 students had joined the protest, generating more media attention. Their action inspired students at other colleges across the South to follow their example. By the end of March sit-ins had spread to 55 cities in 13 states. Many students, mostly black but also white, were arrested for trespassing, disorderly conduct, or disturbing the peace.  Over Easter weekend, April 16 to 18, many of those students came to Baker's alma mater, Shaw University, a black college in Raleigh, North Carolina, to discuss how to capitalize on the growing momentum of the sit-ins. The fruit of the meeting was the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), an organization to translate these local actions into a wider movement. SNCC would expand the sit-in campaign, but it also used other tactics, such as freedom rides and voter registration drives, to tear down segregation. SNCC's work reinvigorated the civil rights movement.  Many accounts report that the Greensboro protest ""sparked"" or ""catalyzed"" the sit-in movement that led to SNCC's founding. But in the middle of all this was Ella Baker, a 57-year-old veteran organizer. She had spent decades traveling throughout the South for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). Long before there were Rolodexes, e-mail, and Facebook, she was famous for her vast social network of contacts. She gently encouraged the young activists to build a movement from these isolated local protests. It is no accident that SNCC's founding convention took place at Baker's alma mater.  Many of the young civil rights activists called her ""Fundi,"" a Swahili title for a master technician who oversees apprentices, to acknowledge Baker's role as their mentor. She eschewed a visible role, concentrating on patiently training the next generation of social change leaders. She spent more than 50 years as an organizer but was less well-known than many of those she trained and nurtured with the NAACP, SCLC, SNCC, and other organizations.Born in 1903, Baker grew up in rural North Carolina not far from where her grandparents had been slaves. As a girl, Baker listened to her grandmother tell stories about slave revolts. Her mother, a former teacher and deeply religious, tutored Ella at home and coached her in public speaking. As a child, Ella was part of a supportive and tightly knit black community, where friends, relatives, and neighbors helped each other out. Her grandfather mortgaged the family farm to help feed families in need. For high school, Baker's parents sent her to the boarding school affiliated with Shaw University. She remained at Shaw for college, edited the student newspaper, and graduated as class valedictorian in 1927.  Then she moved to Harlem. Financial hardship forced Baker to set aside her dream of getting a graduate degree in sociology. Despite her college education, her race and gender limited her job prospects, and she wound up waiting on tables and working in a factory. She began to write articles for the American West Indian News and in 1932 found a job as an editorial assistant and office manager for the Negro National News.  The suffering brought on by the Depression troubled her deeply. Harlem was a hotbed of radical activism, and Baker soon got involved in local groups working on behalf of tenants and consumers. In 1931 she organized the Young Negroes' Cooperative League and became its national director. The group sponsored cooperative buying clubs and grocery stores both to reduce prices and to bring people together for collective action. In her next job, paid for by the New Deal's Works Progress Administration, she organized consumer cooperatives among housing project residents. She taught adult literacy and consumer education, often with a focus on young women and housewives. In 1935 she wrote an exposé of the exploitation of black domestic servants for the NAACP journal Crisis.  Baker started working for the NAACP in 1938 and three years later became its assistant field secretary. For five years, she traveled throughout the South, recruiting new members, working with local leaders to strengthen their chapters, and helping them organize campaigns against lynching, for equal pay for black teachers, and for job training. One of the leadership-training workshops she organized was attended by Rosa Parks, an active NAACP member in Montgomery, Alabama.  Baker understood that local activists in the South always risked facing financial and physical threats for their involvement with the civil rights organization. Baker's speech at the NAACP's annual conference in 1942 outlined her focus on identifying concrete, winnable local issues that could build the organization: What are the things taking place in our community which we should like to see changed? Take that one thing--getting a new school building; registering people to vote; getting bus transportation--take that one thing and work on it and get it done.At the time, the NAACP's leadership was dominated by middle-class black businessmen, male professionals, and ministers, but most of its grassroots activists were working-class women and men. Baker's experiences convinced her that ""strong people don't need strong leaders."" She worked to cultivate what she called ""group leadership"" in contrast to leadership by charismatic figures or by people of higher economic status. She would carry these lessons with her the rest of her life.  In 1946 Baker left her NAACP job and returned to New York City to raise her niece. While working as the Harlem director of the American Cancer Society, she volunteered with the NAACP's New York City chapter, organizing protests demanding school desegregation. In 1952 she was the first woman elected chapter president. In 1951 and 1953 she ran for the New York City Council as a member of the Liberal Party, losing both times. It was the only time she allowed the spotlight to shine on her. Fannie Lou Hamer singing at MFDP boardwalk rally in Atlantic City in 1964. From left -- Emory Harris, Stokely Carmichael (in hat), Sam Block, Eleanor Holmes, and Ella Baker.   Soon after the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott erupted, Baker, Bayard Rustin, and Stanley Levinson (a close adviser to Martin Luther King Jr.) used their connections with northern liberals and unions to establish In Friendship, which raised funds and provided support for the boycott campaign. At the end of 1956, the Supreme Court ruled that Montgomery's segregated bus system was unlawful. The victory could have remained a local triumph rather than a national bellwether. Rustin, however, laid out the idea for building what he called a ""mass movement across the South"" with ""disciplined groups prepared to act as 'nonviolent shock troops.'"" Rustin, Levinson and Baker talked extensively with King about establishing a new organization to build similar campaigns throughout the South. This was the genesis of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), which catapulted King from local to national leadership. Rustin convinced Baker to run the new organization. The initial plan was for her to spend six weeks based in Atlanta, but it turned into a two-and-a-half-year stint.  During this time she had many titles, but she was never given the title of director, which was reserved for a male minister. Baker bristled at the sexism and outsize egos of the ministers who ran SCLC, including King. Despite her long experience as a successful grassroots organizer, they treated her as if she were the hired help. Moreover, King and his fellow ministers lacked the time and experience to build a grassroots organization. SCLC drew on the reputations of its ministers to draw attention to racial injustice and to help sponsor voter registration drives, but it never became a mass-membership organization.  Baker was on the brink of resigning from SCLC when the student sit-in movement began in early 1960. Baker wrote, and she and King cosigned, the invitation letter to SNCC's founding meeting.  Baker took responsibility for organizing the event. The SCLC leaders figured that they could recruit its leaders into forming a youth branch of the organization, but Baker counseled the young activists to shape their own organization. She expected 100 participants to attend, but more than 300 activists showed up. These included black students from 56 colleges and high schools across the South, a handful of white southern students, and students from northern and midwestern colleges (including representatives of Students for a Democratic Society) who had been organizing pickets at Woolworth's stores to show support for the sit-ins.  Baker made sure that students were well represented among the speakers. She enlisted as key speaker James Lawson, a theology student at Vanderbilt University who had organized workshops on nonviolence for students in Nashville, Tennessee, and had helped lead the sit-ins in that city.  In her closing speech, ""More Than a Hamburger,"" Baker pushed the students to dream of how their lunch-counter sit-ins could develop into larger efforts to challenge racism in ""every aspect of life."" She emphasized the importance of growing grassroots group leadership rather than relying on the charisma of any individual, a not-too-subtle dig at King and his fellow ministers. The SCLC ministers asked Baker to convince the students to become part of their organization. Baker refused, but with her blessing, the students voted to form their own organization, SNCC.  SNCC might have quickly disintegrated had Baker not nurtured it and helped the students learn to run the organization on their own. She resigned from SCLC and worked as a volunteer for SNCC, supporting herself as a paid consultant for the Atlanta YMCA. She recruited Jane Stembridge, a white Virginian who was a student at Union Theological Seminary in New York, to run the Atlanta office. With Baker's support, Bob Moses, a black math teacher from New York who traveled to Atlanta to volunteer for SCLC's voter registration drive, soon defected to SNCC.   The volunteer staff put out a newsletter, Student Voice, that helped give the new group an identity and helped spread the word. One of the first checks sent to help the new organization came from Eleanor Roosevelt.  As Baker guided SNCC's young activists, she reminded them of her belief in radical democracy: ""People did not really need to be led; they needed to be given the skills, information, and opportunity to lead themselves."" As students took on more leadership responsibility and worked on the freedom rides and voter registration, they put her ideas into practice and continued to ask Baker for advice. Those attending SNCC's marathon meetings recall that Baker, who by that time had thirty years of experience in movement building, would sit silently much of the time and then make a few comments. Reflecting on Baker's talent for listening to everybody and then summarizing what was most important, former SNCC chair Charles McDew explained, ""Somebody may have spoken for 8 hours, and 7 hours and 53 minutes [of it] was utter bullshit, but 7 minutes was good. She taught us to glean out the 7 minutes.""  In 1964, Baker went to Mississippi to participate in SNCC's Freedom Summer project that brought over a thousand college student volunteers to the state to register black voters and help lead ""freedom schools."" That summer, hundreds of volunteers were arrested; 67 churches, homes, and stores were bombed by racist thugs. Three of the volunteers -- black Mississippian James Chaney and white radicals Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner -- were murdered by segregationist vigilantes. The murders, including the hunt for the bodies of the victims, drew national media attention. When Baker was asked her reaction, she said: The unfortunate thing is that it took this... to make the rest of the country turn its eyes on the fact that there were other (black) bodies lying in the swamps of Mississippi. Until the killing of a black mother's son becomes as important as the killing of a white mother's son, we who believe in freedom cannot rest.The summer campaign culminated in a mock election organized by SNCC volunteers across the state. Black voters elected an integrated slate of 68 members, under the banner of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP). Their plan was to attend the Democratic Party's national convention in Atlantic City in August and ask the credentials committee to recognize the MFDP. This was a direct challenge to the official all-white delegation, which brutally excluded blacks from voting.   Baker, along with John Lewis, Marion Barry, and others, began contacting Friends of SNCC and other civil rights activists around the country, asking their help enlisting Democratic Party officials, elected officials and convention delegates to support the MFDP delegation. By the beginning of August, they report that nine state delegations from the North and West, and 25 Democratic members of Congress, had promised to support MFDP's claim to represent the state at the convention. On August 6, Baker gave the keynote speech at the MFDP's statewide convention at the Masonic Temple in Jackson, reminding them that their struggle in Atlantic City was only one part of a broader movement. When they arrived in Atlantic City, the MFDP voiced their demands, made famous by Fannie Lou Hamer's moving testimony about her harsh life as a sharecropper on a Mississippi Delta cotton plantation and the retaliation inflicted on her for simply trying to register to vote.   President Lyndon Johnson, fearful of alienating southern white voters, rejected the MFDP challenge but offered a compromise, offering them two seats in the state delegation. Led by Fannie Lou Hamer and Bob Moses, the MFDP rejected the compromise, but the controversy pressured the Democratic Party to change its rules for subsequent conventions to require more women and minority delegates. SNCC's Freedom Summer campaign had not only helped turn the nation's eyes on southern racism and the repression of civil rights activists, but also played a key role in the passage of the 1964 Voting Rights Act, one of the movement's landmark victories.  Baker was not pleased with SNCC's turn toward ""black power"" in 1966 under the leadership of Stokely Carmichael. She gradually drifted away from SNCC, but for the remainder of her life, she continued to work on progressive issues. She spent several years working on school desegregation efforts with the Southern Conference Educational Fund. She also expanded her work to include independence struggles in Puerto Rico and in Africa. She also allied herself with the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom and other women's rights groups. She remained an activist until her death on her 83rd birthday -- December 13, 1986.   John Lewis, a SNCC leader and now a Congressman from Atlanta, recalled that Baker ""was much older in terms of age, but I think in terms of ideas and philosophy and commitment she was one of the youngest persons in the movement.""

Patty Murray, D-Wash., talks with reporters in the Capitol, December 12, 2014.

Patty Murray (D-Wash.) prepares for her new role as the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, she is gearing up a big fight with Republicans over women's reproductive rights.Murray told The Huffington Post in an interview on Monday that even though some Republicans moderated their positions on abortion and birth control access during the midterm election, she expects the new GOP-led Senate to try to slash federal family planning funds, repeal the Affordable Care Act and ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy. ""It's really disappointing that Republicans who ran on a very different economic agenda, one of the first things they're going do is go after a woman's right to have a constitutional choice when it comes to their own health care,"" she said. ""We are of course going to fight back hard, and we'll need women's voices across the country to join with us. And we will need men to join with us as well."" When Republicans took control of the House of Representatives in 2011, they threatened to shut down the government if Democrats would not agree to defund the Title X family planning program, which Planned Parenthood and other women's health organizations use to provide low-cost birth control and health exams to women. House Republicans failed to get Title X defunded after President Barack Obama dug in his feet on the issue. But they did manage to pass a ban on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, which doctors say is two to four weeks earlier than the fetus would be viable outside the womb, and they voted dozens of times to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which requires most employers to cover birth control and well-woman visits in their insurance plans.Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has promised to bring up the 20-week abortion ban in the Senate when he becomes majority leader in January.""They're already making noises that that's going to be a priority for them in the Senate,"" Murray said. ""I think that will be a huge disappointment to women who are counting on the people they elected to focus on the economy.""Murray said she was disappointed that Congress passed a spending bill earlier this month that included a GOP-authored provision incentivizing states to embrace abstinence-only education. The bill offers states millions of dollars in federal funding if they teach students that sexual activity outside of marriage is “likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects.” Murray said abstinence-only education funding has long been Republicans' ""go-to."" ""They say maybe if we all just preach abstinence that women won't get pregnant,"" Murray said. ""But we know the history on that. We know obviously abstinence is important to talk about, but if that's the only focus we have, we're going to go backwards in terms of unintended pregnancy.""While the Democrats were not pleased with the abstinence-only education funding, they managed to hang onto federal family planning funds in the spending bill, as well as a provision providing abortion coverage for rape victims in the Peace Corps. ""So we got back a compromise bill,"" Murray said, ""and we're going have to continue to make sure all areas of women's health are funded, and not just a narrow part of it.""Murray has some legislative priorities of her own in her new leadership role. She said she plans to reintroduce legislation to require every federally funded hospital to provide survivors of sexual assault with unbiased information about abortion and access to emergency contraception. She also plans to continue her fight on the ""Not My Boss' Business Act,"" which would effectively override the Supreme Court's decision in the recent Hobby Lobby case and compel for-profit corporations to cover the full range of contraception in their health insurance plans, as required by the Affordable Care Act.""In this country, women want to make their own health care choices,"" she said. ""They don't want somebody sitting in Washington, D.C., to make a decision for them when it comes to these fundamental choices."" Murray said she would be pleasantly surprised if Republicans back off of their fight to limit access to abortion and affordable birth control now that they control both chambers of Congress.""I think a lot of women probably listened to some these Republican candidates that they're not going focus on this, and I really hope so,"" Murray said. ""But we'll see when they get back. If their first priority is to introduce legislation to defund Planned Parenthood, or if they push to do, as Sen. McConnell has said, extreme unconstitutional abortion bans, I think women are going to rise up and say, that is not what you told me in this election."" "
14,POLITICS,"White House Needs To Stop Shielding CIA Director John Brennan, Senator Says",Ali Watkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cia-senate-spying_n_6368634.html,,2014-12-22,"Director of Central Intelligence Agency John Brennan takes questions from reporters during a press conference at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, December 11, 2014. The head of the Central Intelligence Agency acknowledged Thursday some agency interrogators used 'abhorrent' unauthorized techniques in questioning terrorism suspects after the 9/11 attacks. CIA director John Brennan said there was no way to determine whether the methods used produced useful intelligence, but he strongly denied the CIA misled the public. AFP PHOTO/JIM WATSON (Photo credit should read JIM WATSON/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e1ec240000510098f976.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- An internal CIA accountability board weighing penalties for the spies who snooped on Senate Intelligence Committee investigators is reportedly punting on disciplining the five agency employees fingered as the culprits. The five employees apparently defended the snooping as legal, and in some cases, as directed by agency leader John O. Brennan. Outgoing Senate Intelligence Committee member John Rockefeller (D-W.Va.) is not hearing any of it. “Plain and simple, the search was deeply inappropriate and shows a major lapse in judgment. If it was conducted without Director Brennan’s approval, whoever ordered it should be held accountable,” Rockefeller said in a statement Monday. “If Director Brennan called for the search, then the White House needs to hold him accountable. Period.”The New York Times reported late last Friday that the internal review board -- which was commissioned by Brennan after the agency’s inspector general found wrongdoing on behalf of the five agency employees -- would not recommend disciplining the individuals responsible for the computer searches, which involved access to a walled-off Senate network drive used to compile the Intelligence panel’s torture study and searches of certain staff emails. By recommending against discipline, the accountability board recognizes the CIA officials’ defense that, in certain cases, Brennan himself signed off on the computer intrusions, a fact that will no doubt incense lawmakers who have pressed the spy chief for months for answers on the computer search, to no avail.“The CIA’s unauthorized search of computer files and emails belonging to its Congressional oversight committee was a massive breach of the separation of powers and very well may have violated federal laws,” Rockefeller’s statement continued. “Added to this is the CIA’s baseless and retaliatory criminal referral against Committee staff, and the fact that Director Brennan continues to impede oversight by refusing to answer repeated and basic bipartisan questions from the Committee about his role in the search.”The computer search occurred early this year as staff finished constructing the panel’s study on the agency’s post-9/11 use of torture, the executive summary of which was released earlier this month. The agency, upon realizing in late 2013 that staff had apparently accessed and taken a highly sensitive agency document from a secure CIA facility, conducted a security review of the computer network used to construct the study. That computer network, which was designated in a user agreement to be solely accessed by Senate investigators, was supposed to be off limits to the agency.Additionally, the agency filed a criminal referral against panel staff for improperly accessing the document, a charge that the CIA inspector general found to be based on inaccurate information. The incident, which resulted in an unprecedented public feud between the agency and its Senate overseers, has festered for months with a lack of resolution. The agency’s inspector general determined earlier this year that the five agency personnel did violate protocol by accessing the committee’s side of the network, prompting a personal apology to panel chair Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) from Brennan. The Accountability Review Board -- which consisted of three agency personnel and two outside members -- was tasked with weighing the inspector general’s findings and determining what, if any, punishment should be doled out.The White House has consistently backed its spy chief throughout the feud, often to the chagrin of Democratic lawmakers. Rockefeller’s statement pulls no punches in demanding the Oval Office hold Brennan -- who formerly served as an Obama counterterrorism adviser -- accountable for the agency’s actions.The White House and CIA declined HuffPost requests for comment."

Obama announced plans to restore diplomatic relations with Cuba, over 50 years after they were severed in January 1961. In a prisoner exchange, U.S. contractor Alan Gross was freed after being held in Cuba since 2009 and sent to Cuba three Cuban spies who had imprisoned in the U.S. since 2001. (Photo by Doug Mills-Pool/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e1ed2400005100577648.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Obama's bold announcement last week on Cuba has upended the conventional narrative that his administration, buffeted by foreign policy crises throughout 2014, had lost its ability to set the international agenda. Instead, he seems poised to make 2015 a year when he at last realizes his earliest supporters' hopes for dramatic change, and makes irreversible the new direction for America's role in the world whose promise had earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in his first months in office.The twinned crises that dogged Obama's foreign policy team this past year, and led to declining approval ratings for the president's conduct of foreign affairs, have certainly not gone away. Russian president Vladimir Putin's challenge to Ukraine after it slipped out of his orbit in February, and the metastasis of the international jihad against Syria's suffocating regime into a cross-border ""Islamic State,"" remain to be resolved.But the sanctions regime targeting Russia's elites that Obama forged with Europe has proved remarkably successful, in tandem with the fortuitous crash in oil prices, in imposing costs on Putin's aggressiveness. And the carefully calibrated American efforts to marshal an international coalition to contain and reverse ISIL's explosion into Iraq and to encourage political transition there are producing successes.The prospects are brightening for a slow-motion end to both crises in 2015. The run on the ruble appears to be chastening Putin, one of the world's most reviled leaders in global opinion surveys even before the Ukraine crisis. The United Nations mediator Staffan DeMistura is finding growing receptiveness to prospective ceasefires among the belligerents in Syria's civil war, which could end the slaughter and start a political transition as ISIL begins to buckle.Turning the corner on these two crises, or at least containing them, has liberated Obama to reclaim the initiative on the world stage. The Cuba opening will not transform global power relations as did Jimmy Carter's announcement of diplomatic relations with Beijing 36 years before (almost to the very day!). But it disinfects a longstanding abscess in U.S. relations with Latin America and ends an annual embarrassment at the United Nations, where the entire international community denounces the folly of Washington's Cuba embargo by votes of 188 to 2. In denouncing Obama's Cuba initiative, Republican political figures have planted themselves firmly in the past, just as they had denounced diplomatic ties with China and the Panama Canal treaty. They have done the same with Obama's other major break with Washington's paralysis this fall: the sweeping executive orders tightening enforcement of environmental emissions, which have proved the crucial shock therapy to put languishing climate change negotiations back on track.From his first days in office, Obama identified climate change as an urgent priority. It is no accident that he combined his Nobel lecture in Oslo in 2009 with a stop in Copenhagen to try personally to keep foundering negotiations alive. For five years he felt constrained by congressional conservatives' success in blocking climate legislation. His resort to executive orders has quickly paid off in a November accord bringing China aboard, the world's other top greenhouse gas emitter, and in broad agreement at U.N. negotiations that ended in Lima last week. Prospects now look much brighter for a breakthrough pact emerging from the final round of negotiations scheduled for Paris next fall. Moreover, U.S. public opinion, after a dip following the 2008 economic meltdown, has congealed behind the need to halt global warming. Obama is effectively daring any Republican challenger to try to reverse the climate course he hopes to enshrine in 2015 in a global pact of universal reach.Yet another breakthrough after Cuba that is likely to be consummated in the coming year is with Iran. Iranian president Hassan Rowhani is as motivated as Obama and his secretary of state, John Kerry, to seal a nuclear deal that can clear the decks for formal diplomatic relations. Beyond that, closer cooperation will depend on whether Rowhani's allies in Tehran can outmaneuver entrenched fanatics in Iran's political and security apparatus. Still, as with Cuba, it is hard to see how a Republican successor to Obama could sever diplomatic relations with Iran once they have been restored.Of course, the main driver of Washington militancy against any deal with Iran has been the intensely nationalist government of Binyamin Netanyahu in Israel. Yet Israeli politics themselves are in flux, and as 2014 draws to its end there appears to be a real chance that Knesset elections at winter's end may produce a new political constellation, one that can resume the negotiating track with the Palestinians that former prime minister Ehud Olmert insists was on the brink of success six years ago.An Israeli-Palestinian peace accord would of course be the big megillah, one that would crown Obama's last two years. It is something in which Kerry invested major effort with difficult partners after becoming secretary of state, and in which he would readily reengage with a new Israeli government. Perhaps concerns about a European economic noose tightening around the West Bank settlement project will factor in as well. Whether change becomes possible is in Israeli voters'--and Palestinians'--hands, though, not Washington's.So Cuba will almost certainly prove to be just the first of several breakthroughs that Obama can make on the global stage in 2015. Climate change and Iran are likely to follow. More uncertainly, and more gradually, progress in restoring Ukraine's political integrity and moving Syria to a nonviolent political transition is certainly possible. And the biggest, most elusive prize of all, peace in the Holy Land, is not yet inconceivable for the supposed ""lame duck"" Barack Obama."
16,WORLDPOST,Cuba Announcement 'A Truly Historic Moment',Eline Gordts,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cuba-announcement_n_6357584.html,,2014-12-21,"A mural of Fidel Castro playing baseball decorates a wall at the Latin American baseball stadium in Havana, Cuba, late Thursday, Dec. 18, 2014. The announcement on Wednesday that the U.S. plans to restore diplomatic ties with the Caribbean nation could usher in a new era in U.S.-Cuba baseball relations, which were strained after the Castro revolution and the U.S.-led economic embargo.

(AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc142bd2400003500229cfb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every week, The WorldPost asks an expert to shed light on a topic driving headlines around the world. Today, we look at the future of U.S.-Cuba relations. The United States and Cuba announced on Wednesday that they will start talks to restore ties, a landmark announcement given the decades-long hostile relations between the countries. The announcement came alongside a prisoner swap that includes a Cuban who was arrested on the island while working for American intelligence more than twenty years ago, and the three of the ""Cuban Five"" who remained jailed in the United States. Cuba also released Alan Gross, an American aid worker who was arrested in Cuba five years ago. The WorldPost spoke with Julia E. Sweig of the Council on Foreign Relations about this week's developments. Wednesday's announcement was hailed as ""historic."" But how much does the announcement really change? And how quickly will we start to see change?The announcement truly was a historic moment, not only for the Americas, but also for Obama’s legacy. The executive action is fairly comprehensive in terms of what he has the power to make happen. It expands general licenses for travel to Cuba, allows travelers to use American credit and debit cards, significantly eases restrictions around remittances, make it easier for Americans to provide support to and help grow the emerging private sector in Cuba, expands commercial sales and exports, and initiates new efforts to increase access to the internet and other telecommunications services, among other important changes. Obama and Castro are also going to convert the existing interest sections into embassies in Havana and Washington and name ambassadors. On the travel end, which I think has been the most confusing part for a lot of people, American visitors to Cuba will no longer have to go through cumbersome bureaucratic processes prior to their travel to the island. All they have to do is sign a document saying what they’re going to be doing in Cuba and then go. And that is a huge difference. It does not lift the travel ban because it doesn't permit tourism, but it does streamline travel and will help it grow quite substantially.As far as how quickly these changes will take root, I think diplomatic ties will move fairly rapidly. The assistant U.S. secretary of state for Latin America, Roberta S. Jacobson, is leading a delegation to Cuba in January for immigration talks and to further conversations about diplomatic relations. However, the implementation of new economic openings is going to take some time. Various agencies will have to write and roll out regulations, which, of course, means bureaucracy and at least some politics. Though, I suspect that, given the Summit of the Americas in April and the upcoming shift in Congress, a lot of the regulatory framework that is needed to ease trade and travel restrictions is probably close to complete if not fully ready for primetime. Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker already seems to be organizing a business delegation to Cuba, and I suspect Barack Obama and John Kerry will both make it to the island over the next two years. Can’t get more historic than that. Will the embargo be lifted as well? And if so, when do you think that will happen? Implementation of the steps the president announced Wednesday will create their own political momentum, not only in the United States and Cuba, but also in the U.S. Congress. However, officially lifting the embargo is an entirely different process that has to go through Congress due to the Helms-Burton Act signed into law by Bill Clinton in 1996. Though we are on the verge of having a Republican majority in Congress, pollsters now see that 60 percent of Americans, including those in Florida, support the kinds of changes Obama announced on Wednesday. Staunchly supporting the embargo is getting less politically tenable, and both parties, yes even the GOP, are beginning to recognize that. I think the expectation with Obama’s executive order is that it will help grow certain kinds of trade and investment in, for example, construction, pharmaceuticals, agriculture and telecommunications. This kind of investment, restoring diplomatic lines of communication, getting more Americans down to Cuba, and allowing banking services and credit cards – sort of laying the scaffolding to ultimately shift opinion inside Congress – will help create the political space to push for a full nullification of Helms-Burton to lift the embargo. Though, I do think that will take some time. What concessions did the U.S. and Cuba have to make respectively to make this agreement happen?I think the biggest negotiation that compelled these talks was the Alan Gross situation and the imprisonment of the remaining three of the Cuban Five, the intelligence officers who penetrated into the United States in the 1990s and were imprisoned in American jails. For Raul Castro, and even before his presidency, getting the rest of the Cuban Five back was a huge foreign policy priority. On the other hand, U.S. government officials repeatedly warned that if anything ever happened to Gross, reestablishing relations would be near impossible. I think a breakthrough in negotiations came when the Cuban government agreed to release Gross on humanitarian grounds, and exchange Rolando Sarraff Trujillo, an intelligence officer who the Cubans had been holding for the last twenty years or so, for the remaining three of the Cuban Five. It unlocked the policy changes the president announced on Wednesday. There were also a number of other areas of compromise to get to where we are now. Raul agreed to release 53 political prisoners, all of whom were given the choice of staying in Cuba or leaving, rather than being given exile as their only option, and the Cuban government agreed to allow American telecommunications providers to help build the infrastructure that they need to increase broadband access, which is very low, perhaps even the lowest in Latin America. The Cubans also agreed to allow ICRC visits to the island, and they haven’t been there since the late 80s I believe.Of course, a number of outstanding issues were not agreed upon during these conversations. For example, the U.S. government would not end its democracy promotion programs – a la the infamous Cuban Twitter – despite Cuban protest and did not include negotiation of the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in the conversations. How have Cubans reacted to the announcement?As far as I’ve seen, across Cuba, the reaction has been very favorable. Even sharp critics of the government -- like dissident blogger Yoani Sanchez -- view the changes with a degree skepticism, but also as potentially beneficial to the country. In her editorial the other day in the New York Times she wrote, “For everyone, a new era has begun. We cannot confirm that it will be better, but at least it will be different.” There seems to be euphoria around the island, a lot of expectations, and the Cuban blogosphere is full of fascinating analysis about what this will mean for the country. I think most Cubans on the island are at least relieved, and definitely filled with anticipation for what’s to come."

According to the poll, from ABC News and the Washington Post, 61% of likely Democratic voters say they would vote for Clinton. This is down from last month's lead of 63%, and January's 73%. This latest poll was conducted earlier this month and released on Sunday.Vice President Joe Biden is a distant second with 14% of the potential vote. Mass. Senator Elizabeth Warren comes in third at 13%. The same survey last month found that she was only commanding 11% of the vote. In January, that number was only 9%. Warren has repeatedly denied that she is seeking a bid for president. To read the full results of the poll, click here.Meanwhile, 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney is leading the Republican pack. Several recent polls surveying the 2016 Republican landscape have found Romney ahead by a slight margin over former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who announced earlier this week that he is considering a run for president, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. "

Among them: In a Scrooge-like Christmas gift, it cuts $93 million from the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, or WIC.So it’s both timely and ironic that a newly published study concludes WIC doesn’t just boost the health of young children and their moms: It also plays a positive role in kids’ cognitive development.“These findings suggest that WIC meaningfully contributes to children’s educational prospects,” Brown University sociologist Margot Jackson writes in the journal Social Science and Medicine.WIC is a large-scale government program serving 53 percent of all infants born in the United States. It provides vouchers that are redeemed at supermarkets for healthy, nutritious food such as fresh fruits and vegetables. Pregnant and breastfeeding women are eligible, as are children up their fifth birthday; parents also receive nutritional education and counselingJackson analyzed two sets of data. One was the birth cohort of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, which followed about 11,000 children from age nine months to kindergarten. It includes information on WIC participation, as well as the results of a standard test given at age two, “an assessment general mental ability that indicates problem-solving and language-acquisition skills.”The other was the Child Development Supplement of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, a nationally representative, longitudinal study of families. It included information on both WIC participation and the results of standard math and reading tests administered when the children were, on average, 11 years old.Both sets of data linked participation in WIC with positive outcomes. The first showed that “prenatal/early childhood WIC exposure is associated with significantly stronger cognitive development,” Jackson writes. The second provided evidence that “the benefit associated with WIC participation persists into the school years.”To reach that second conclusion, Jackson compared test scores of children from the same family, comparing those who grew up with WIC nutritional assistance with those who did not. (For a variety of reasons, some mothers do not participate in WIC until they have had at least one child.)These within-family comparisons “suggest that children who receive prenatal/early childhood exposure to WIC perform significantly better on reading assignments—up to 0.3 of a standard deviation—than their siblings who do not,” she writes. “This association is not explained by measured differences in prenatal behavior toward siblings, such as time spent reading with children or breastfeeding behavior, nor is it explained by differences in families’ economic circumstances during the child’s birth year.”So WIC works. Kids who ate healthier food show signs of stronger cognitive development early in life, and their later test scores prove these initial indications were not a fluke. The incoming Congress may want to keep this in mind as it draws up the next federal budget."
