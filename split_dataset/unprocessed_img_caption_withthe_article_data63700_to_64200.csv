Chris Christie (R) surprised everyone Friday afternoon by endorsing Donald Trump for president.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56d09f401e0000230070ed74.jpeg?cache=f3nOOnJIZ5&ops=crop_0_760_5184_2636%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"As governor, Chris Christie committed himself to building bridges with the Muslim American community in New Jersey. He named Muslims to positions in state government, brought religious leaders to his house to break the daily Ramadan fast and warned his party not to embrace anti-Muslim bigotry in the name of fears about terrorism.On Friday, however, Christie threw all that out the window and endorsed GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, a man who wants to ban all Muslims from entering the United States. ""There is no one who is better prepared to provide America with the strong leadership it needs than Donald Trump. ... Trump is rewriting the playbook of American politics,"" Christie said in a surprise press conference in Texas. Christie dropped his presidential bid on Feb. 10. In December, following deadly terror attacks in California and France, Trump called for a ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States."" It doesn't matter that the vast majority of Muslims have nothing to do with terrorism. Trump said he didn't want to take any chances. ""Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life,"" he said. Trump has also said he isn't sure whether he could support a Muslim in the Oval Office because there is a ""very severe problem"" with some Muslims in this country. That sort of approach is exactly what Christie has said he is against. Just days after Trump announced his Muslim ban, Christie spoke passionately about the need to reach out to Muslim Americans and avoid caricaturing an entire religion. ""I went to mosques all around New Jersey, and I met with the people in those mosques so that they could see me, and I could see them,"" he said during a campaign stop in New Hampshire. ""And what you realize over the course of time is that they're Americans too. And they love this country. And they care deeply about its future and their children's future. And this is just common sense, everybody. You can't paint everybody with the same brush. You just can't. We're all individuals."" In a radio interview at the time, Christie also called Trump's proposal ""ridiculous"" and ""the kind of thing that people say when they have no experience and don't know what they're talking about."" One of Christie's most public fights against Muslim bigotry was when he nominated Sohail Mohammed for a seat on the New Jersey Superior Court of Passaic County in 2011. Mohammed, an immigrant from India, rose to prominence as a leader in the Muslim community. He helped the FBI understand Muslim culture, and after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, he spoke out against the government's targeting of Muslim and Middle Eastern individuals.But Mohammed still faced intense criticism from conservatives who were worried he might have ties to terrorism. Those accusations were unacceptable to Christie, who publicly called out members of his party.""They are criticizing him because he is a Muslim American ... Sharia law has nothing to do with this at all -- it's crazy! It's crazy. The guy’s an American citizen,"" Christie said at the time.""This Sharia law business is crap. It’s just crazy, and I’m tired of dealing with the crazies,"" he added. ""It's just unnecessary to be accusing this guy of things just because of his religious background.""The New Jersey Legislature did end up confirming Mohammed to the bench. He is still a judge in the state.Even before Friday's endorsement, however, Christie, at times, hesitated in criticizing Trump too harshly for his comments about Muslims.In November, Trump made the outrageous, unfounded claim that there were thousands of Muslims in New Jersey who cheered when the World Trade Center came down on 9/11. ""I do not remember that, and so it's not something that was part of my recollection,"" Christie replied simply. ""I think if it had happened, I would remember it, but, you know, there could be things I forget, too.""Many Muslims in New Jersey, who considered the governor their champion, have also been disappointed that Christie has not been as forceful in speaking out against Trump and anti-Muslim bigotry on the campaign trail.""He has abandoned us,"" Mohammed Hameeduddin, a councilman in Teaneck who was the township's first Muslim mayor, told The New York Times in December, ""and has moved on."" Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."
1,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Says Trump's Bigotry Doesn't 'Fit With What I Thought I Knew' About Him,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-donald-trump_us_56d05fd7e4b03260bf76656f,"Trump, she hardly knew ye.",2016-02-26,"Hillary Clinton said that Donald Trump's ""mean-spirited"" comments don't ""fit with what I knew about him.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56d060711500002b000b0bed.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Hillary Clinton doesn’t recognize the vile bigotry of Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump as the man she, sort of, used to know.In an interview with Morning Joe hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, the Democratic presidential candidate stated that Trump’s “divisive” and “mean-spirited” comments do not “fit with what I thought I knew about him.” Of course, Clinton said, “I didn’t know him that well, but I did know him.”Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, attended Trump’s third wedding in 2005. She has since said that she attended because she thought it would be fun -- something Scarborough could understand.“I actually said she's exactly right when you answered the question, 'Why did you go to his wedding.' He's fun, he's an interesting guy, he's fun,” the host said.But he wanted to know, “How surprised are you that we woke up after Nevada and everybody in Washington said, oh, my God, this guy is most likely going to be the next nominee?”“I think it's been most surprising to me to see somebody who was affable and was good company and had a reputation of being kind of bigger than life really traffic in a lot of the prejudice and paranoia,""Clinton said. ""Some of the comments he has made which have been so divisive and mean-spirited doesn't fit with what I thought I knew about him.” “It's going to be interesting to see, if he does get the nomination, what he decides to do with it -- how he presents himself,"" she continued. ""But he has really been offensive and, in many respects, surprising to those of us who did know him.”Scarborough also asked Clinton if Trump benefits from a kind of double standard, seeing as investigative reports and attacks on his personal life, business failures and alleged fraudulent schemes have bounced off him while any and all allegations against her have gotten 24/7 media coverage going back nearly 25 years.“I think part of the reason why I'm going to be the nominee and I'm going to be the next president is because I have withstood all this,” Clinton said. “I have been vetted. I mean, I've been at this for decades now and despite all the incoming I'm still here, I'm still forging ahead because I think in most cases, most people kind of see through it and we go on together.”As for Trump’s ability to deflect attacks, she said, “The vetting on these other candidates has not even begun.”"

As Phillips wrote in an email to to DFA members: After centuries of racial and gender exclusion, America has a lot of catching up to do. Since the creation of the Supreme Court in 1789, America has had 112 justices, and 106 have been white men. ...Senate Republicans, led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), have promised to block any nominee Obama puts forward. They argue that it is too close to the presidential election for him to choose someone, so the decision should be left to the next president.Their fear, of course, is that Obama will choose a progressive nominee who will shift the ideological makeup of the court, which has favored conservatives for years. This week, word started to leak out that Obama was considering Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, a moderate Republican, as a potential candidate. Recognizing that he would be used as a political pawn, he took himself out of the running on Thursday.Senate Republicans said they would have blocked even Sandoval, who represented the consensus approach Obama could take: Pick a moderate nominee and dare Republicans to show how extreme they are in opposing the choice.That trial balloon didn't go over well with progressives. ""It's downright absurd that President Obama would risk his legacy by appointing another anti-labor Republican like Governor Brian Sandoval to an already overwhelmingly pro-big business Supreme Court,"" DFA Executive Director Charles Chamberlain said Wednesday. ""Nominating Sandoval to the Supreme Court would not only prevent grassroots organizations like Democracy for America from supporting the President in this nomination fight, it could lead us to actively encouraging Senate Democrats to oppose his appointment.""The other approach would be to pick a strong progressive trail-blazing candidate -- maybe someone who made it through the Senate already for a lower court -- and then paint Republicans as obstructionists. That's the approach progressive advocacy groups are hoping for, and they're promising to fire up their base to support the president.Already, groups like CREDO Action, MoveOn.org, EMILY's List, People for the American Way and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights are pressuring vulnerable Senate Republicans to give Obama's nominee a chance.Obama would need the votes of all 46 Senate Democrats and at least 14 Republicans to get his Supreme Court nominee through."
3,POLITICS,HUFFPOLLSTER: Hillary Clinton And Donald Trump Look Strong In Super Tuesday Polls,"Natalie Jackson, Ariel Edwards-Levy, and Janie Velencia",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-clinton-super-tuesday_us_56d053c4e4b03260bf766193,"But polling is sparse in several states, and Ted Cruz might get the biggest prize -- Texas.",2016-02-26,http://assets.bwbx.io/images/inVSDC5auYgk/v1/-1x-1.jpg," 
http://assets.bwbx.io/images/inVSDC5auYgk/v1/-1x-1.jpg","Hillary Clinton looks strong in South Carolina and many Super Tuesday states, leaving Bernie Sanders with a challenging path to the nomination. Ted Cruz might or might not have a substantial lead in Texas. And opinions on diversity in Hollywood vary by race. This is HuffPollster for Friday, February 26, 2016.HILLARY CLINTON IS IN GOOD SHAPE IN SOUTH CAROLINA - South Carolina holds its Democratic primary on Saturday, and the state looks to be a good one for Hillary Clinton. Polls, which have been sparse or unreliable in other primary states, tell a much clearer story here, showing the former secretary of state beating Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) by a margin of at least 18 points. While only one poll has been released since Clinton won last week’s Nevada caucuses, there's nothing to suggest the dynamics of the race have changed. If Clinton doesn’t win in South Carolina on Saturday, it will mean one of two unlikely scenarios: the polls were massively wrong, or there was a huge shift of opinion in the last week. SUPER TUESDAY IS UP NEXT, AND POLLING IS SPORADIC - Voters in twelve states will head to the polls on Tuesday. Georgia, Oklahoma, Texas and Virginia have been polled regularly in the last few weeks. There have been very few polls, however, conducted in the rest of the Super Tuesday states: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Tennessee and Vermont. That’s 272 Republican delegates and 485 Democratic delegates that hang in the balance with little indication of which candidates they might go to.Texas has been especially heavily polled - Texas is the biggest Super Tuesday prize for both parties -- the Republicans have 155 delegates at stake, and Democrats have 251 up for grabs. The Democratic side isn’t much of a contest, according to the polls. Sanders has made considerable gains in the state, but still trails Clinton by a substantial margin. On the Republican side, a plethora of polls released in the last week show conflicting views of how Sen. Ted Cruz is doing in his home state. Some polls show Cruz up by as much as 15 points, while others show him tied or nearly tied with Donald Trump. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is in third place in all the polls, but his support varies from 8 to 25 percent. The HuffPost Pollster average shows Cruz leading with 34 percent over Trump’s 26 percent, and Rubio trailing behind at 13 percent. Trump would continue to lead in the ""SEC primary"" even if the field winnows to two candidates - John McCormick: ""Donald Trump holds a substantial lead in the southern region where Republican voters have their say on March 1….An online Bloomberg Politics poll shows the billionaire is backed by 37 percent of likely Republican presidential primary voters in the seven states surveyed, while Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas are tied at 20 percent….[T]he poll included the so-called 'SEC Primary' states of Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia….Trump beats both Rubio and Cruz in one-on-one matchups, with Rubio getting the closest at 48 percent to 44 percent. Trump wins a contest with Cruz, 49 percent to 40 percent. If the race were between only Rubio and Cruz, Rubio wins 45 percent to 40 percent."" [Bloomberg]Where Sanders needs to win on Super Tuesday - Nate Silver: “Our benchmarks suggest that Sanders ought to win Vermont, Minnesota, Colorado, Massachusetts, Oklahoma and Tennessee to be on track for the nomination. Sanders is going to rout Clinton in Vermont, of course; he’s also slightly ahead in Massachusetts polls, although not by as much as our targets say he “should” be. There hasn’t been enough recent polling in Colorado or Minnesota for us to make forecasts of the caucuses there, but we’d probably consider Sanders the favorite in those states also. Sanders trails in polls of Oklahoma (narrowly) and Tennessee (badly), however, when he probably needs to win those states too. Meanwhile, he’s losing states such as Georgia by a wider margin than our benchmarks suggest he can afford. The Democrats’ delegate allocation is quite proportional, so these margins matter; underperforming his targets on Super Tuesday would mean that Sanders would have to make up more ground later on with less time left on the clock.” [538]HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

For all the noise online surrounding #OscarsSoWhite in the lead up to the 88th Academy Awards on Sunday, the truth is that white people on the whole believe the status quo in Hollywood to be perfectly acceptable, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov poll. The survey...found one in five white people believe Hollywood does not provide an adequate number of roles to minorities and should produce more films by and starring them. But for the most part, they are totally cool with how things are going….62 percent of white people are happy with the number of movies by and starring racial minorities and 74 percent believe there to be an adequate amount of work available for them. Fourteen percent would even like to see fewer films by and about non-white people. Black Americans, on the other hand, disagree. Seventy-five percent of black people with an opinion would like Hollywood to produce more movies by and about racial minorities, and 87 percent believe the industry does not provide enough opportunities to racial minorities.""

Hall directors are paid non-students who carry some authority.The Review noted that the complaint carries a specific definition -- “incidents that make people feel targeted because of their social identity group membership,” according to the Student Life Website. ""University Housing takes bias incidents very seriously and is committed to supporting the targeted individual or group.""Maybe the university ought to investigate snowballs, too. The author of the Review article, junior and residential advisor Erin Dunne, cracked that the report was perhaps triggered because ""no efforts had been made to create a snow vagina.""A school spokesman told The Huffington Post: ""The report of this snow sculpture has been documented and, as for any report, the next step would be for the bias response team to determine an appropriate follow up. In this case there is no indication that any students have been affected so no follow up is required.""In the meantime, at least one other outlet was having fun with the political correctness gone wild.The College Fix also presented a quick solution: ""Did anyone – anyone – consider just walking over and toppling the frigid phallus if it was so damn offensive?""This story was updated with a comment from the school."

Courser was also charged with perjury.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55c4dc931400002e002e24d5.jpeg?cache=VReGO2h546&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Todd Courser and Cindy Gamrat, former Michigan lawmakers who left office after they hid an affair, have been charged with several felonies, state Attorney General Bill Schuette announced Friday. Gamrat was charged with two counts of misconduct in office, while Courser was charged with three counts of misconduct as well as perjury for lying under oath about having a staffer sign his name to a proposed bill.“Instead of serving their home towns, they served only themselves at the expense of everyone else,” Schuette said in a statement. “With the filing of these charges, it is my hope that citizens of Michigan see that no one is above the law, not even those who walk in the halls of power; that no one is beyond the reach of the law, not even those who make the laws and when laws are broken, that justice can and will be delivered.”Schuette accused Gamrat and Courser of engaging ""in a pattern of corrupt conduct.” They are both accused of lying to the House of Representatives Business Office during an official investigation.Courser and Gamrat, both tea party Republicans, served in the state House of Representatives until September when Gamrat was expelled and Courser resigned. Both failed to win back their seats when they ran for re-election in November.The criminal charges stem from a bizarre scandal, first exposed in August when the Detroit News published audio of Courser talking about his extramarital affair with Gamrat. In the recording, he instructs an aide, who secretly taped the conversation, to send an anonymous mass email accusing Courser of paying a man for sex: the fake story was intended to distract from the actual affair.The staffer, Ben Graham, said he refused to send the email and was later fired.Josh Cline, another former staffer, said his bosses created a hostile work environment and ignored his requests that they behave more professionally. He claimed the lawmakers would often embrace, skip meetings, go on long walks together and that Gamrat would ""tuck in"" Courser when he napped in her office. After the Detroit News report, Courser issued two long statements explaining his actions. In one, he said that if a lawmaker doesn’t go along with the “Lansing [Michigan] mafia,” they will “destroy you by doing what they can to malign, smear and undermine you.”Gamrat apologized for her behavior but said she believed an ""open and honest"" investigation would vindicate her. She said she was not aware of the email Courser planned to send.Only Courser was charged with misconduct for allegedly soliciting a state employee to send a false email to the public.The criminal charges underscore the need to hold elected officials accountable, state House Minority Leader Tim Greimel (D-Auburn Hills) said in a statement Friday. He called for the Freedom of Information Act to be extended to include the legislature and governor's office, “so that we can finally eliminate Lansing’s culture of corruption.""Courser’s perjury charge carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison; the misconduct charges each come with a 5-year maximum. Arrest warrants have been issued for the former lawmakers. Courser blasted the charges as ridiculous in a statement on Saturday.""These baseless criminal charges are political in nature and have come at a time to take heat off the misconduct of others,"" Courser said in a statement posted on Facebook. ""After months and months of investigation, spending tens of thousands of your dollars, and claiming that Todd Courser misused taxpayer funds, Attorney General Schuette has charged him with a nonsensical claim of perjury and three counts of misconduct under a rarely used and vague 'catchall' statute.""UPDATE: This piece has been updated to include Courser's statement.See the warrants below:Tips?

6,POLITICS,Trump's Opponents Bash Back In Their Most Desperate Hour,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/so-that-happened-trump-debate_us_56cf6e9be4b0871f60eab084,"Rubio and Cruz bring the hurt to Trump on the debate stage... but is it too little, too late?",2016-02-26,GOP presidential candidates Ted Cruz (left) and Marco Rubio (right) need to pick up some delegates in the upcoming primaries to have a chance of catching Donald Trump (center) for the nomination.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56cf6f2a1500002a000b0b89.jpeg?cache=y7iDx7U9W5&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"So, that happened. Days after reality TV star Donald Trump pasted the competition in the Nevada primary, it's looking more and more like beating him for the nomination is a lost cause for the remnants of the GOP field. Still, this week, the party scheduled a debate anyway! The National Review's Charles C.W. Cooke -- a fierce Trump critic -- is begging Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz to ""find their resolve and all-but-machine-gun the man to the floor.""As the old ""Animal House"" line goes, ""This situation absolutely requires a really futile and stupid gesture be done on somebody's part."" And so we turn to the anti-Trump forces' last stand in Thursday's Texas debate. It's been a rough week for those Republicans who have sought to prevent Trump from taking over their party. For a long while, they have clung to the notion that Trump would eventually hit his ""ceiling"" of support, and as the field winnows, he'd bump up against the reality that he's only earned the support of some 35 percent of GOP voters. It's not turning out that way. Not only is Trump pulling way above his presumed 35 percent weight class, it’s not clear that voters whose first-choice candidates have suspended their campaigns are naturally sorting themselves into an anti-Trump stance.Meanwhile, as HuffPost's Sam Stein reported earlier this week, the opposition research effort against Trump has fallen prey to some GOP consultant version of the ""tragedy of the commons,"" in which ""none of the remaining candidates for president have completed a major anti-Trump opposition research effort."" In the mistaken belief that someone else might jump into an oppo war with Trump first, everyone held their fire.And so, Rubio, Cruz and the rest of the remaining candidates were left to face Trump's electoral juggernaut on their own Thursday night, split between the need to damage the front-runner and the need to damage one another. At Thursday night's debate, Rubio was the first to hit Trump for opting to hire foreign guest workers at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida, at a time when qualified United States residents could fit the bill. And after enduring a raft of criticism for his debate style, Rubio was noticeably calm and precise making his case. ""I think people in Florida would be surprised, because, [The New York Times] interviewed a number of people that would have been willing to do those jobs, if you would have been willing to hire them to do it,"" he said.When Trump attempted to break the Florida senator's stride, Rubio coolly escalated the case: ""This is a big issue for Texas and a huge issue for the country. But I also think that if you're going to claim that you're the only one that lifted this into the campaign, that you acknowledge that, for example, you're the only person on this stage that's ever been fined for hiring people to work on your projects illegally.""Trump did earn applause for his riposte: ""No, I'm the only one on this stage who's hired people.""Cruz followed with a line that dinged both Trump and Rubio: ""In 2013, when I was leading the fight against the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, where was Donald? He was firing Dennis Rodman on ""Celebrity Apprentice,"" and indeed, if you look at the Gang of Eight, one individual on this stage broke his promise to the men and women who elected him and wrote the amnesty bill. But Donald funded the Gang of Eight. If you look at the eight members of the Gang of Eight, Donald gave over $50,000 to three Democrats and two Republicans.""Minutes later, however, Rubio launched what was probably the most sustained fusillade of attacks on Trump that these debate stages have seen. Seemingly in one breath, Rubio hit Trump for employing undocumented immigrants, his four bankruptcies, the scam ""Trump University"" that's earned the mogul a lawsuit, and all the Trump-branded products that are made in Mexico and China. ""Make them in America,"" Rubio repeated over and over again. It was as close as anyone's come yet to the ""machine-gunning"" that Cooke called for.Cruz joined in the fray when the conversation turned to health care. Recalling Trump's vow that he'd not allow Americans to ""die on the sidewalks"" if he were president, Cruz asked Trump to explain how he could reconcile that promise with his insistence that he didn't support socialized medicine. Trump wobbled in his reply: ""My plan is simple. We'll have private health care, but I will not allow people to die on the sidewalks and the streets of our country if I'm president."" Rubio quickly joined in once it was clear that Trump didn't actually have a plan.It was a much better night in general for Trump's primary opponents -- Rubio especially. The only problem is that it might not matter. After all, the next time one of these candidates knocks Trump off-stride will be the first time. And practically speaking, the road ahead for Trump's opponents is daunting. Based on the primary calendar and the voter profiles in the states to come, Cruz will need to build a delegate lead on Super Tuesday if he ever plans to have one -- later states don't match up with the Texas senator's evangelical-heavy profile. And Rubio seems to be planning on beginning his ascent to victory in the March 15 Florida primary, which polls indicate he is losing. If Thursday's efforts to knock Trump down don't pay off quickly, then it's probably already too late for anything else to succeed.Also on this week's podcast, one of President Barack Obama's oldest campaign promises -- his pledge to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility -- is back in the news after the Pentagon put forth the latest version of a plan to finally fulfill this commitment. We'll discuss whether this final effort will do the trick.Meanwhile, Michigan Gov.

Hughes' decision surprised staffers given that he'd committed last year to steering the magazine for the long term. Hughes, who pocketed around $700 million as a co-founder of Facebook and helped direct digital organizing for Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign, entered the journalism world with great fanfare four years ago upon buying the storied title. He rehired former editor Franklin Foer, poured resources into relaunch, and expressed ambitions to hire the best magazine writers in the country. It seemed like an ideal situation, with a young rich publisher funding quality political and cultural coverage. But Hughes, and his newly installed CEO Guy Vidra eventually clashed with Foer and longtime literary editor Leon Wieseltier over the direction of The New Republic, a dispute that played out at a party celebrating the magazine's centennial in November 2014. Two weeks later, Foer and Wieseltier quit, followed by most of the magazine's editorial staff. After that, Hughes relocated the magazine's headquarters from Washington D.C. to New York, cut its print frequency from 20 to 10 issues a year, and relaunched last year under editor-in-chief Gabriel Snyder. The magazine appeared to be on steadier footing. Then Hughes announced last month that after sinking $20 million into the publication, he was selling it. Since then, there's been another talent drain, with writers and editors such as Suzy Khimm, Jamil Smith and Elizabeth Stoker Bruenig -- all of whom joined after the 2014 turmoil -- leaving the company. McCormack comes to The New Republic with decades of experience in media and liberal politics. He founded Oregon Magazine in 1976, has produced numerous documentaries, and launched Tin House in the late 1990s. He tapped Hamilton Fish, a former publisher of The Nation, to handle day-to-day operations of The New Republic as publisher and editorial director.In a statement, Hughes said McCormack and Fish's ""backgrounds in journalism and progressive politics make them uniquely qualified to lead such a historic institution.""The magazine did not immediately announce any other changes to its masthead. A New Republic spokeswoman said that McCormack and Fish only arrived in the office Friday. ""Their plan is to get acquainted with all of the staff and with the rhythms of the company before developing any long-term strategic decisions,"" she said."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) made his populist presidential pitch to voters in both Kansas and Missouri.“In Kansas, you’ve got a governor who likes to beat up on the poor,” Sanders said, taking a jab at Gov. Sam Brownback’s series of welfare changes in the state. The crowd of thousands was receptive to that message, booing in response.Instead of campaigning in South Carolina, where Democrats will hold their primary on Saturday, the independent Vermont lawmaker is setting his sights on Super Tuesday and beyond, making stops in Missouri, Oklahoma, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota.With Clinton likely to win many delegates from seven Southern states on Super Tuesday, Sanders is banking on the Midwest for a shot at an upset. Caucuses in states like Minnesota, Kansas and Nebraska could work in his favor, since the process typically brings out only the most motivated voters and the electorate is predominately white and liberal.Voters' enthusiasm was overwhelming in Kansas City on Wednesday afternoon, with the crowd of over 7,000 chanting the Vermont senator’s name. The major question is whether that enthusiasm will translate into support. So far, voter turnout in the Democratic caucuses has been down -- nowhere near the numbers of 2008. According to Democratic Party officials, 80,000 voters turned out for the caucus in Nevada last week, compared with nearly 118,000 in 2008.Sanders’ losses in both Nevada and Iowa increase the value of states like Missouri and Kansas, where he seeks to run up his delegate totals. Missouri will hold its primary on March 15, while Kansas holds its caucuses, which require a major investment in time and resources, on March 5. Both Democratic campaigns are operating in high gear to turn out as many voters as possible in a short time frame.“As organizers, you feel nervous to enter a state with 15 days left to identify support,” said Shelby Iseler, who is Sanders’ Kansas state director and previously served as a deputy field director in Iowa. Iseler, along with six other paid staffers in Iowa, were redeployed to the Great Plains the day after the first-in-the nation caucus.“We woke up, and then at noon the next day we got our redeployment assignments and then I was writing the state plan,” she said with a laugh.Iseler and her team arrived in Kansas to find a ready-to-go army of volunteers who had been organizing for Sanders on their own since April.“What we know and what we have known is that the majority of our supporters are people that aren't tapped into politics, they are first-time volunteers, first-time voters,” she said. “It’s a challenge. You know, we don’t have the upper hand.”Clinton’s team seems to be using a different strategy in Kansas this cycle, vowing not to repeat the mistakes of 2008, when the former secretary of state suffered a devastating loss to Barack Obama in Kansas and other caucus states.While there has been grassroots organizing throughout the state as well, the Clinton campaign began deploying paid staff in November 2015, two months before Sanders’ campaign staff were on the ground. Former Clinton staffer Pat Rynard said that could make a difference.“The campaign strategy is night and day,” said Rynard, who organized for Clinton in Iowa and Kansas in 2008 and has witnessed both campaign operations on the ground in several Midwestern caucus states this cycle. “They are investing the staff that they need in order to win delegates or mitigate delegate losses in states that Sanders might win.”Rynard recalled arriving in Kansas with another paid staffer after the Iowa caucuses in 2008, immediately learning it would be tough to compete with Obama’s campaign -- which had deployed dozens of staffers, some of whom had been on the ground for months.“The difference in organization was just staggering,” Rynard explained. “There was a reason Clinton lost last time, and a large part of it was because of those caucus states. The Clinton campaign for some reason got it in their head that they weren’t going to do well in caucus states, so they didn’t even try that hard. That is a failed strategy; you should actually do the opposite. You should send more staff to caucus states that have low turnout, where it’s harder to get your people out to caucus.”Lauren Brainerd, the Kansas state director for Clinton’s campaign, also arrived in the state after the Iowa caucus about a month ago, but says the operation was officially up and running before her arrival. The campaign recently opened its fourth field office in the state; the Sanders campaign has three.“We joined a team that was already on the ground here in Kansas,” Brainerd explained. “When this campaign first launched, we made sure we weren’t just focused on the early states.”The Clinton camp is focusing on covering every part of the state, even the rural areas, which requires some manpower. The campaign even has a phone bank in Garden City, a town located near the Colorado border.“Where it’s rural, we’re continuing to knock on as many doors as possible, while also making sure to include some more densely populated places as well,” Brainerd said. “We are making sure not to ignore any part of Kansas. We are literally fighting for every single vote, every delegate we can.”Kansas, home to just six electoral votes in the general election, will allocate 37 delegates for the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia this summer. The Democrats will have 47 caucus sites based on state Senate districts, which is different from how the Iowa caucuses operated. That's why the Sanders campaign is changing its strategy in the state.“In Iowa we had over 1800 precincts, so we had to be in each of those tiny precincts,” Iseler said. “Here, there are only 47 of them. We need to go where the support is. Find the support and harness it.”Iseler said the campaign is primarily focusing on phone banking because the large amount of terrain to cover makes door-knocking a bit of a challenge.“You could knock on two doors in an hour, they are so spread out,” Iseler said. ""When we walked through the door, we had phone bankers that had already been hosting phone banks in their living room. People we were able to reach out to, build relationships with, we’ve used them as a spokesperson for us in those rural areas, so we don’t need to be everywhere physically.”Campaign rallies like the one in Kansas City this week, filled with thousands of adoring Sanders supporters, show why campaign staffers in the region feel confident, although Iseler admits she sometimes feels like she’s in a bubble.“It’s hard being a Bernie organizer, working for Bernie and not feeling like you’re going to win,” Iseler said. “You see the support everywhere, and so we feel good, we feel like we’re going to win, but we feel like we have our work cut out for us.”Based on his observations over the last week, Rynard says Clinton has a stronger organization in a few of the Midwestern caucus states, but admits the Sanders operation is decent. He believes the Vermont senator’s campaign needs to perform well in the early March caucus states to stay competitive against the former secretary of state.“The caucus states should be good for Sanders, and they haven’t been so far,” Rynard said. “If Clinton is able to take that potential advantage Sanders would have, that’s a huge blow to him if he’s unable to win, or win big, in these caucus states.”"

The space technologies company went ahead with the countdown, scrubbing the launch seconds before liftoff. A new launch date has not been released.Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX, had previously a delayed a launch of the Falcon 9 rocket that was scheduled for Thursday night. SpaceX delayed the launch over concerns with the rocket's propellant, according to a webcast from the company. It decided to postpone the launch less than two minutes before the rocket was scheduled for takeoff. John Insprucker, Falcon 9's product director, said at the end of the live webcast that they would try another attempt, “hopefully within another couple of days.""The main goal of the launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, was to deliver a commercial communications satellite called SES-9 into orbit for the company SES. A secondary objective of the event was to land the 14-story rocket booster upright on a floating, football field-sized drone ship named Of Course I Still Love You.However, SpaceX has said ""a successful landing is not expected,"" and predicted its fourth at-sea landing attempt would end much like the previous three: in flames.A SpaceX landing off the coast of California ended in flames last month after a successful launch to deploy an international ocean-monitoring satellite. In December, however, SpaceX made history when a Falcon 9 landed successfully on the ground about 6 miles from where it took off.

The pair was snapped entering Justin Bieber's after-party in London, looking very friendly and holding each other's hands and waists. Diplo, whose real name is Thomas Wesley Pentz, escorted the singer into the venue, signaling to the world that there's no bad blood between the two. This isn't the first sign that the singer and the DJ producer have mended fences. Lorde opened up about their friendship in an interview last year, chalking some of the feud up to misinterpretation. ""I think often I say things and realize that Americans hear what I say differently to how I hear it,"" she told The Fader in November 2014. ""I love Wes and he's a big brother to me and one of my first friends in the industry, and part of having a friendship with someone like that is not letting them say stupid shit. Taylor's my friend as well, and I'm a girl, and if I see some weird body-shaming on my feed I'm going to be like, 'Hey man ...

It was Colombia's second consecutive appearance at the tournament.72 percent of Americans and 69 percent of British fans, meanwhile, supported adding more women to FIFA's voting congress, which is made up of delegates from the organization's 209 member associations.In the wake of a global corruption scandal that has cast a shadow over the sport, FIFA could soon take a major step toward bringing more women into global soccer's governing structure. On Friday, it will vote on a broad package of reforms that include a mandatory increase in the number of women on the FIFA Executive Committee.That provision, which would require that women hold six of the 36 executive committee seats (up from three out of 24 today), was created by Moya Dodd, an Australian who is one of the few women on the committee.""This is a market that's unexploited for the world's most popular game. You have half the world's population who haven't really been given a full opportunity to participate,"" Dodd told The Huffington Post in January, adding that her reform proposal is only a first step.""It will be a very big step forward, but not the last,"" she said. ""What you're talking about here is culture change. That takes time.""Yet the survey suggests that bringing more women into FIFA's fold won't be enough to fully restore fans' confidence in the beleaguered organization.The survey found that 43 percent of fans say they enjoy soccer less than they did before the scandal, which became worldwide news last June, when American and Swiss authorities indicted more than a dozen FIFA officials on various corruption charges.69 percent of fans said they had no confidence in FIFA to govern the sport, compared to just 19 percent who do. And few seemed to believe the upcoming election would bring about necessary changes.Among the five major candidates for FIFA president, only Gianni Infantino, the general secretary of the European soccer federation, received more than 10 percent of the fan vote in the survey -- and even then, it was just a modest 19 percent. Meanwhile, 3 in 5 fans considering the candidates said they'd choose ""None of the above."" That option won out in every country surveyed, except for Saudi Arabia.The lack of confidence may only get worse: Bahrain's Sheikh Salman, the president of the Asian Football Confederation, has recently emerged as the favorite to succeed outgoing FIFA President Sepp Blatter, who received a six-year ban from international soccer and is being investigated for corruption. Salman, however, has been linked to a cash-for-votes scandal in the election for his current position (he denies the allegations). His alleged connection to human rights abuses in Bahrain is also a source of concern.Yet the poll also shows that fans aren't ready to completely give up on the organization that oversees the world's most popular game. Half of respondents said that they believed FIFA could successfully rehabilitate its reputation.That should lead FIFA's next president to heed the warnings of soccer fans and truly reform the way the organization does business, the groups behind the poll said. “The poll results show us beyond any doubt that FIFA has lost the trust of football supporters,"" Transparency International's Gareth Sweeney, who edited the report, said in a release.""But they also show it is still possible for FIFA to regain that trust,"" he added. ""At least half those polled will give FIFA a second chance. That’s why FIFA must not only put serious reforms in place but be seen to do that. The new president should also be ready to listen to football fans to address this lack of trust.” Also on HuffPost:"

A new report illustrates minority voters' power to change an election. And so far this year, polls are doing pretty well at predicting the primary. This is HuffPollster for Thursday, February 25, 2016.LATINO REPUBLICANS PREFER MARCO RUBIO - Philip Bump: ""A new poll from The Washington Post and Univision finds that Hillary Clinton is the most popular candidate among Hispanics who plan to vote in the Democratic primary, and Sen. Marco Rubio is the most popular among those who plan to vote Republican…. [Rubio] also picked up the largest chunk of support from those who at first said they backed Jeb Bush, and is also the most popular second choice of the voting group….As is the case in other polls, Donald Trump's support is fervent but not very deep.….Hispanics who were born in the United States were slightly more likely to back Trump than those who weren't -- the opposite of the support enjoyed by Marco Rubio.."" [WashPost]Trump has the highest negatives among Latinos - Dana Balz and Scott Clement: ""Donald Trump has used the issue of immigration to help make himself the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, but his harsh rhetoric also has earned him the highest negative ratings among Hispanic voters of any major GOP hopeful….Strongly negative views of Trump have intensified over the past seven months, as the New York billionaire has repeatedly pressed his call to build a wall along the length of the U.S.-Mexico border and seek to deport undocumented immigrants currently residing in the country. Today, 8 in 10 Hispanic voters have an unfavorable view of Trump. That includes more than 7 in 10 who have a “very unfavorable” impression of him, which is more than double the percentage of any other major candidate. Should Trump become the Republican nominee, his current low standing among Hispanic voters could jeopardize the party’s hopes of winning the general election in November."" [WashPost]Entrance polls in Nevada told a different story - HuffPollster: ""Donald Trump, who has spent much of his presidential campaign loudly disparaging Latino immigrants, seems to have won a plurality of the Latino vote in Nevada's GOP caucus on Tuesday. Per entrance polls, he had the support of 45 percent of Latino caucus-goers to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's 28 percent and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's 18 percent. The statistic, while striking, needs a few caveats. Entrance polls, like other surveys, aren't an exact science, especially when it comes to very small populations. Just 132 of the caucus-goers surveyed were Latinos, giving the results a margin of error of plus or minus 10 percent….Trump's supporters, though, aren't a good representation of Nevada Latinos as a whole. Most of them don't vote Republican…[exit pollster Joe] Lenski estimates that about 1 percent of all Nevada's voting-age Latinos turned out on Tuesday."" [HuffPost] AMERICA'S RACIAL, GENERATIONAL DIVIDES COULD DECIDE WHO WINS IN 2016 - A report from the Center for American Progress, AEI and the Brookings Institution looks at how demography could shape the election: ""Results from the past two presidential elections provide evidence that the changing demography of the electorate—with its increased racial diversity—can affect election outcomes in ways that could not have been anticipated even a decade ago. A solid case can be made that the nation’s racial minority populations put President Barack Obama over the top in both 2008 and 2012. But racial diversity is not the only demographic change that may have an effect on future presidential elections. In addition to greater diversity—which is primarily affecting the younger part of the electorate—the older part of the voting population is growing more rapidly as the huge Baby Boom generation ages."" [America's Electoral Future]The report considers six possible scenarios for what voter turnout might look like this year, with the predicted outcomes ranging dramatically. Two, Scenarios A and B, which assume that racial groups would turn out in the same proportion and support the same parties as they did in either 2008 or 2012, highly favor the Democrats. A third, Scenario C sees the electorate returning to its relatively GOP-friendly state in 2004. The remainder, rather than emulating past electorates, imagine future elections in which minorities vote as often as whites (Scenario D), the GOP succeeds in winning over Hispanic and Asian voters (Scenario E) or white voters swing increasingly toward the GOP (Scenario F). More from the report: ""[N]either party can be assured of long-term dominance simply from shifting demographics….both parties will have considerable work to do in order to adjust to the changing structure of the eligible electorate. While shifting demographics favor Democrats when all else is held equal, the party has significant vulnerability among aging white voters, who will remain quite important in slow-growing Midwestern and Rust Belt swing states. Democrats will therefore have to think hard about how to balance appeals to their growing and younger minority base with outreach to older white voters—particularly in Middle America. On the other hand, Republicans face a clear need to enhance their appeal to America’s rapidly growing minority population—especially the new minorities of Hispanics and Asians. If they do not, Republicans risk putting themselves into a box where they become ever more dependent on a declining white population— particularly its older segment."" POLLS HAVE BEEN PRETTY SUCCESSFUL SO FAR - HuffPollster: ""Donald Trump has now won three GOP contests in a row, but many pundits are still expressing shock at his success. 'What's actually -- what is happening out there?' Joe Scarborough pondered on 'Morning Joe' on Wednesday after Trump came out on top in Nevada...But HuffPost Pollster’s polling averages have pointed to Trump as the front-runner in most contests for several months -- and with the notable exception of Iowa, they’ve been mostly right in the primaries and caucuses that have taken place….That doesn’t mean HuffPost Pollster’s averages will continue to successfully reflect outcomes. But given that HuffPost Pollster’s averages have correctly indicated the winner in six of seven primaries and caucuses so far, it might be time to believe the polls when they say Trump is leading and the Democrats are in a tight race.""

Brian Sandoval (R) on Thursday asked President Barack Obama to take his name off his list of potential Supreme Court nominees, in an attempt to avoid becoming a pawn in the nasty partisan battle raging in Washington.""Earlier today, I notified the White House that I do not wish to be considered at this time for possible nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States,"" Sandoval said. ""I have also spoken to Senators Reid, Heller and McConnell and expressed the same desire to them. The notion of being considered for a seat on the highest court in the land is beyond humbling and I am incredibly grateful to have been mentioned.""Sandoval, a relative moderate who supports abortion rights, became caught up in the Senate's political fight on Wednesday, as soon as news leaked out that the White House was vetting him for the seat vacated by the late Justice Antonin Scalia. Senate Republicans, led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), have said they believe the next president should get to choose Scalia's replacement -- and have promised to obstruct any nominee Obama puts forward. On Wednesday, they responded to the mere mention of Sandoval's name by saying that they would block him, helping Democrats in their efforts to paint Republicans as extreme.""I don't pick the justices, but I know if he were picked, I would support the man,"" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) told CNN Wednesday, trying to show his desire to compromise. ""He's a good person, has a great record, and has been a tremendously good governor in spite of having to deal with some very big problems there.""Reid no doubt knew the trouble Sandoval would cause for the GOP. As John Fund of the conservative National Review put it, ""How better to apply pressure than to appoint a Hispanic Republican -- and former federal judge -- who might fracture the united front of GOP senators who have come out against an Obama nomination?""But there's little doubt that some Democrats would have objected to Obama choosing a Republican nominee, passing up a historic opportunity to shift the ideological balance of the Supreme Court in a far more progressive direction. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton told reporters in South Carolina Thursday that while she admires some of the work Sandoval has done, she hopes Obama will choose ""a true progressive.""Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) said he still hopes to see Sandoval on the Supreme Court someday.“As a friend and former colleague of Governor Sandoval's, I believe he is eminently qualified for this position,"" Heller said. ""But, I support his decision to withdraw his name from consideration for the Supreme Court vacancy. I hope the next president will consider him in the future."""

The report focuses on eight immigrants who died in detention from 2010 to 2012. In each case, reviews from within the agency found that a contributing cause had been non-compliance with the agency's medical standards. The internal reviews identified four of those deaths are specifically as preventable.ICE has been producing reviews of deaths in custody since 2009. Yet all but one of the facilities the civil rights groups highlighted were given a passing grade, even after those deaths and the reviews that found failures in health care, the report found. ""They made these findings in the death reviews and then swept them under the rug,"" said Carl Takei, an ACLU attorney who worked on this report, told The Huffington Post.ICE spokeswoman Jennifer D. Elzea said in a statement on Thursday that the agency ""takes seriously the health and welfare of all those in its custody,"" and will review the report ""to assess what actions, if any, should be taken in response."" The death review for Gracida-Conte concluded multiple problems with his medical treatment at Eloy Detention Center in Arizona, which the for-profit Corrections Corporation of America operates. The review said there was a failure to provide efficient care and difficulties in communication because he spoke ""very little Spanish"" and an interpreter was never called in to talk to him in Mixteco. One doctor cited in the report wrote that his ""death might have been prevented if the providers, including the physician at [Eloy], had provided the appropriate medical treatment in a timely manner."" The report drew similar conclusions in other cases, including that of Amra Miletic. The 47-year-old from Bosnia-Herzegovina was in ICE custody at Weber County Correctional Facility in Utah, died in 2011 after 47 days in detention. She had complained of abdominal pain, blood in her stool and a fever, but did not receive lab tests until she had been in detention for five weeks, according to the review. She lost 15 pounds in a nine-day period and was eventually placed under doctors' supervision, but in a separate unit because the medical segregation unit was full. On the day she died, Miletic had shown signs of distress. Her last known movement was around 6:30 p.m. She wasn't discovered until about 45 minutes later. A doctor said in a mortality review that it ""was a death that was preventable"" and questioned the competence of the physician who failed to understand the urgency of emergency care.The ACLU, Detention Watch Network and National Immigrant Justice Center called on ICE to make changes, including reducing the number of people in detention in general by using alternatives so people with serious health needs can access care and have support from their families. They also called for ICE to stop using private for-profit detention facilities and medical care subcontractors, and to end contracts for centers if there were repeated preventable deaths. Inspections should report on whether the problems in death reviews had been addressed before giving any facility a passing rating, they argued. ""The delivery of medical care and the inspection process both need to safeguard the welfare of the people inside detention,"" Takei said.The ACLU filed subsequent requests for reports on deaths after those provided in the initial release, but has not yet received them. Elzea said the agency has implemented “significant changes” to ensure more efficient access to medical care, including staffers at each ICE field office to monitor complex cases.Notably, six of the eight facilities referenced in the report, including the Adelanto Detention Facility, Eloy Detention Center, ICA Farmville, Denver CDF, Elizabeth CDF, and the El Paso SPC, have since transitioned to meet ICE’s 2011 Performance Based National Detention Standards, the most rigorous operating requirements imposed by the agency. A seventh site, Weber County, has not been used by ICE to house immigration detainees since 2011."

I think that respect certainly extends to members of Congress on Capitol Hill.”The bill’s proponents were unmoved by the petition.“I think it’s easy for chefs at high-priced restaurants to make these statements,” Claire Parker, spokeswoman of the Coalition for Safe Affordable Food told HuffPost. “These restaurants are exempt from the law but it’s not so easy for families who are facing more than $1,000 in increased grocery bills.”Parker was referencing an analysis commissioned and released this week by the Corn Refiners Association, a member of the CFSAF group, which estimated that Vermont’s labeling law would result in increased food costs for consumers totaling an estimated $1,050 a year per capita. Those costs, the analysis argued, would stem from manufacturers removing GMOs from their products should consumers view GMO labels as a warning not to buy products in their current form.Further, supporters of the legislation say the Vermont law going into effect would help usher in a patchwork of state labeling laws “that simply will not serve the American people well,” Parker said.That concern was reflected in an open letter addressed to the Senate Agriculture Committee and signed by some 650 groups that the coalition issued Tuesday. Among the signers were industry heavyweights including ConAgra, DuPont, Coca-Cola, General Mills, Kellogg, PepsiCo and Walmart, plus coalition members including the Grocery Manufacturers Association and the National Restaurant Association.In remarks before a hearing of the agriculture committee on Tuesday, U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack echoed the same fear, arguing that the Vermont law will “create chaotic circumstances” if it goes into effect.Still, the opposition to the legislation is spirited and it appears the legislation faces an uphill climb to passage. And even if the bill is to succeed in the Senate, it’s unclear whether President Barack Obama would sign it in into law.Democratic presidential candidate and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders stated his opposition to the bill and support for state labeling laws in Tuesday's remarks, though he has previously noted that he does not believe GMOs cause health problems.Two other states, Connecticut and Maine, have also passed state-level GMO labeling laws, though both laws only go into effect if additional neighboring states pass similar legislation.Most Americans appear to be in favor of mandatory labeling of products containing GMOs. An Associated Press/GfK poll released last December found 66 percent of respondents supported labeling versus just 7 percent who were opposed. A separate poll commissioned by a coalition of advocacy groups last November found even higher support for labeling -- 89 percent.Roberts’ office did not respond to The Huffington Post’s request for comment by publication time.---Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food and water.

But it seems that the stellar student's perfect life was built on a lie. He was allegedly unmasked Tuesday as a 23-year-old Ukrainian immigrant who had managed to fool school officials for more than three years while studying at John Harris High School, Harrisburg Bureau of Police said.Artur Samarin, as he was identified by police, allegedly used the alias Asher Potts and a fake ID to enroll at the Harrisburg school in the fall of 2012.""I marveled at his maturity,"" Gene Veno, the school district's former chief recovery officer, told PennLive of the young man he thought he knew.Veno described him as ""focused and driven"" and ""always a gentleman.""Samarin was part of the school's ROTC program and the National Honor Society. In 2014, he was recognized for his accomplishments by Rep. Patty Kim (D-Pa.), who tweeted out a photo of them together using the hashtags ""going places"" and ""proud.""Police got a tip about Samarin about two months ago, Sgt. Terry Wealand told the Associated Press. He said they believe he enrolled as a freshman after entering the U.S. under his real name. While studying, he lived with people he had befriended.""I would think there would have to be someone who knew,"" Wealand said of Samarin's alleged scheme. ""And if there is, they are going to pay, too.""In a statement obtained by CBS 21, Harrisburg School District public relations spokeswoman Kirsten Keys said they are cooperating with the police investigation.""While we do not know all of the details surrounding the arrest, we are treating this as a serious matter. At this time, the investigation is in the hands of the Harrisburg Bureau of Police. The district will continue to cooperate fully with the police department as they move forward with their investigation,"" Keys said.As of Thursday evening, Samarin is listed as remaining behind bars at the Dauphin County Jail on charges of identity theft and tampering with public records.The John Harris High School's ROTC leader didn't immediately respond to a request for comment."
25,POLITICS,GOP Congressman Circulates Letter Urging Rubio Or Cruz To Drop Out Of Presidential Race,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trent-franks-rubio-cruz-drop-out_us_56ce57cde4b0bf0dab30ce42,Rep. Trent Franks says he's trying to save his party from Donald Trump.,2016-02-25,Republican lawmakers are kind of freaking out about the possibility of Donald Trump being their presidential nominee.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56ce58171500002a000b0a64.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- A Republican congressman is asking his colleagues to sign onto a letter urging either Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) or Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas) to pull out of the presidential race, in an effort to unify conservatives behind one candidate capable of stopping Donald Trump.Rep. Trent Franks (Ariz.), a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, began circulating his letter Wednesday night. In it, he pleads with Rubio and Cruz to decide that one of them will be the other's vice presidential running mate and focus on defeating Trump, who Franks fears can't beat Hillary Clinton in the November election.""Now is a time for choosing -- for you, and for us,"" reads the letter. ""Through rivalry, disunity, and baseless hatred in our ranks, conservatives are now in danger of splintering our voice and ensuring that the Republican Party’s nominee in the general election is Mr. Trump who is incontrovertibly, the weakest General Election candidate in the Republican field with the strongest probability of allowing Hillary Clinton to become President.""""We call upon all national security, free-market, and pro-family conservatives to boldly rally around the two of you together and ask you both to answer the call of statesmanship and decide between yourselves which shall be the candidate for President and which shall be the candidate for Vice President,"" the letter says.(Story continues below letter.)A Franks spokeswoman said the congressman has gotten some verbal commitments to his letter so far, but no signatures yet.Franks discussed his concerns about Trump earlier Wednesday.""His positions are so undeveloped at this point, it's a little difficult to go from a businessman to the leap of the president of the United States, no matter how it might play with everyday folks,"" he told The Huffington Post. ""I understand they are tired, and certainly I concur with how tired they should be of this process, but in this case, it could be jumping from the pan into the fire.""It's not just conservatives agitating for Cruz and Rubio to team up against Trump. Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R), a moderate from Florida, said the two need to seriously think about which is more important: their own campaigns, or the cause of the Republican Party and the nation.""The question is, do the other candidates in the race, does their ego allow them to do the right thing for the party and ultimately for the country?"" he said. ""If Ted Cruz believes in the conservative cause, I would think that he would do everything he can to prevent this phony, this faux conservative, from winning with a minority of support.""Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.), who endorsed Cruz last week, said Wednesday that he only did so because of the recent primary election in his state and the pressure he felt to endorse someone. He's not actually committed to Cruz. He'd just as easily support Rubio.""It was not frankly so much about Cruz as it was about Trump,"" Sanford said of his Cruz endorsement. ""I've grown very, very concerned about the Trump phenomenon ... I don't really have a particular dog in the fight other than anyone but Trump.""The lawmakers were divided on whether they'd vote for Trump if he ends up winning the party's nomination.""If Mr. Trump becomes the nominee, I will support him robustly,"" said Franks.""No. I would not support Trump,"" said Curbelo. ""I have left ballots blank in the past."""
