How much should character come into play, and can you excuse a checkered past? And how much stock do you put into upside and overall potential, compared with a prospect's floor?My previous sleeper picks include: Klay Thompson, Steph Curry, Elfrid Payton, Kenneth Faried, Dennis Schroder, Giannis Antetokounmpo and C.J.

1,POLITICS,Guess How Many Members Of Congress Have More Cash On Hand Than Donald Trump?,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congress-cash-trump-campaign_us_57694712e4b0fbbc8beba7c9,"Quite frankly, it's a yuge number.",2016-06-21,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks to a crowd of supporters during a campaign rally on June 18, 2016 in Phoenix.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576952801500002b0073bb37.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- According to the most recent campaign finance filings available, 121 members of Congress -- 78 representatives and 43 senators -- have more cash on hand than presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.Trump's Federal Election Commission filing, filed Monday night, indicated he had just under $1.3 million at the end of May.Because the filing deadlines for members of Congress and presidential candidates are different, a perfect comparison between the Trump campaign's finances and the campaign finances of senators and representatives is impossible. But Trump's filing shows that his campaign has less cash available than 121 members of Congress, based on their most recent FEC reports.While the comparisons aren't exact, the point is the same: Trump has raised an astonishingly paltry sum of money and has hardly anything to show for it. His $1.3 million just edged out Rep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.), who ended March with $1,287,168.83. Members of Congress like Jeff Fortenberry (R-Neb.), Mike Thompson (D-Calif.) and Blaine Luetkemeyer (R-Mo.) -- who should all elicit a resounding ""um, who?"" -- have more campaign money at their fingertips than Trump, according to their most recent filings.Trump may argue that his meager cash on hand doesn't matter because he can supplement his campaign with his own money. But he's yet to show a real willingness to come anywhere close to his opponents' spending, and he's raised such an extraordinarily small sum that Republicans could struggle funding basic campaign functions.All of which is to say: Donald Trump’s Latest Campaign Finance Report Makes Dumpster Fires Look Good.Jennifer Bendery and Paul Blumenthal contributed to this report.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

It would also have required law enforcement to present probable cause to a judge in order to stop the sale.Echoing the NRA, Sen.

3,POLITICS,Here’s Yet Another Campaign Ad Implying Police Brutality Protests Are A Bad Thing,Julia Craven,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/catherine-hanaway-police-ad_us_57698630e4b099a77b6e6e9c,"It’s getting old, y’all.",2016-06-21,"Demonstrators protest in front of the Ferguson police station on March 12, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576986c42200002e00f82336.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Catherine Hanaway wants to make Missouri safe again. The former U.S. attorney, who is running as a Republican in the state’s gubernatorial race, on Friday released a short, straightforward campaign advertisement describing how she plans to restore law and order to an unruly state. “Crime is out of control in Missouri,” Hanaway says in the ad, “and career politicians are to blame.”With this ad, Hanaway joins a larger trend of GOP politicians branding themselves as tough on crime. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) released a campaign ad in March implying that black people who protest police brutality are criminals. Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee, has said police are ""the most mistreated people in this country"" and promised to give them more ""strength and power."" Hanaway's TV spot cites the “riots” that occurred in Ferguson, Missouri, after 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed by a white police officer in 2014. It also mentions the “lawlessness at Mizzou,” a reference to protests against racial inequality at the University of Missouri in 2015.At one point, the ad cites rising crime rates in St. Louis and Kansas City, saying murders have increased by 18 percent and 42 percent in those cities, respectively. (The figures are year-over-year increases between 2014 and 2015.)""The riots in Ferguson, protests at Mizzou and spiking murder rates in Missouri’s major cities all symbolize an utter failure of leadership by our current leaders,"" Hanaway told The Huffington Post in an email. ""No one wants to move to unsafe neighborhoods or move jobs to unsafe areas. As an experienced prosecutor, I will make Missouri safer by restoring law and order to our streets and economically stronger by reforming our economic policies.”But what's missing from Hanaway's ad is the context behind the events in Ferguson and at Mizzou. The Ferguson protests were explicitly a reaction to police violence in black communities, as well as ongoing, systemic corruption and abuses of power. The protests at Mizzou didn't happen out of the blue; they came after a series of racially charged incidents -- including white students allegedly shouting racial slurs at their black peers and someone drawing a swastika in feces in a dorm bathroom. For the calculations of the homicide rates increases, the Hanaway campaign used reports from The Kansas City Star and the The Riverfront Times, a St. Louis-area media outlet. It's become common to hear certain public officials claim there's a link between rising crime rates and the Black Lives Matter movement, or to suggest that crime is up in some places because of protests against racial inequality and police violence in general.People who suggest these things are related can often be heard promoting the idea of a so-called “Ferguson effect” -- the theory that murder rates are on the rise in some U.S. cities because police are afraid to ""do their jobs"" amid an atmosphere of heightened public scrutiny. This idea is disputed, to say the least. A separate but related theory -- that the past couple of years have seen the rise of a ""war on cops"" -- has essentially no basis in reality. (Hanaway endorsed the idea of the ""Ferguson effect"" in a February interview.)Hanaway, who would be Missouri’s first female governor, has said that during her time as the federal U.S. Attorney in St. Louis, she prosecuted more than 4,000 crimes. She's also said she will strengthen community policing to protect citizens and the police, uphold Missouri’s “constitutional carry” measure allowing people without felonies to carry concealed weapons without a permit, and institute harsher penalties for violence against police officers.

In a June 21 press release, ESPN officials representatives announced the inclusion of Team USA's Chris Mosier in the eighth edition of the Body Issue, which hits newsstands next month. Mosier, who competed in the run-bike-run race at the 2015 International Triathlon Union world duathlon championship, will be featured along with Olympic diver Greg Louganis, three-time WNBA All-Star and 2015 MVP Elena Delle Donne, Antonio Brown of the Pittsburgh Steelers and U.S. women’s national soccer team forward Christen Press, among others. The 35-year-old Mosier, who has said he began questioning his gender identity at age 4, told The Huffington Post that he was ""really grateful for the opportunity"" to be included in the magazine, and called the photoshoot ""a great opportunity to push my own boundaries."" ""Even two years ago, I wouldn't have imagined I would have the courage or desire to do the Body Issue. But I'm more and more comfortable and confident every day, and I finally feel at home in my body,"" he said. ""I love my body. It took a long time for me to get to a point where I could say that, so I'm happy to be in a place where I can share that with the world.""It isn't the first boundary that Mosier has smashed. In 2015, he became the first trans athlete to make a U.S. national team, and participated in the International Triathlon Union world duathlon championship. He successfully pushed for the International Olympic Committee to be more inclusive of transgender athletes, and has been an outspoken critic of North Carolina's House Bill 2, which effectively prohibits transgender people from using public restrooms which best correspond with their gender identity. Neely Lohmann, senior deputy editor and the producer of ESPN magazine's franchise issue, praised the Body Issue as a ""powerful storytelling platform"" in a press release. “Year after year, the athletes allow themselves to be completely vulnerable with our audience—not just in the photographs but with their interviews as well,"" Lohmann said. ""It’s an honor to tell their stories.”So fantastic to see you making history, Chris! "
9,POLITICS,American Mosques Are Actually A Great Deterrent Against Violent Extremism,Christopher Mathias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-mosque-surveillance_us_576462a0e4b0853f8bf0f5d5,"And surveilling them, as Donald Trump has proposed, is a bad, bad idea.",2016-06-21,"Donald Trump has spewed some vile anti-Muslim rhetoric during his presidential campaign, saying once that ""Islam hates us.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576840d11500002f001ba633.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the week since the deadly terror attack in Orlando, presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has repeatedly called for the surveillance of mosques as a means of stemming terror attacks. ""We have to go and we have to maybe check, respectfully, the mosques,"" he told a crowd of supporters who cheered on his proposal. ""And we have to check other places. Because this is a problem that if we don't solve it, it's going to eat our country alive, OK? It's going to eat our country alive."" ""We have to be very strong in terms of looking at the mosques,"" Trump told Fox News. And on ""CBS This Morning,"" the Republican candidate got a little more specific. “We need justice, we need vigilance, we need great intelligence gathering systems, which we don’t have,” Trump said. “We had them in New York City as an example, probably the best in the nation, and the new mayor just broke it all up and disbanded it; he thought it was inappropriate. … that was unbelievable, that was one of the best of all systems. We need intelligence gathering like never before.”It's a proposal Trump's made before, along with other dragnet counter-terror strategies like a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. and a database of all Muslims living in the country. But blanket surveillance of American Muslims would be -- and, in fact, has already been proven to be -- wildly counterproductive. Take, for example, the New York City intelligence gathering system Trump hailed as the ""probably the best in the nation."" For more than six years after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, this secretive police spying program targeted New York and New Jersey Muslims solely because of their faith. Officers in the New York City Police Department's Demographics Unit infiltrated Muslim student groups, eavesdropped on conversations between Muslims, spied on Muslim-owned businesses, recorded the sermons of imams, catalogued Muslims who Americanized their surnames, and placed informants and undercover officers inside mosques. But after the program was exposed in a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigation by The Associated Press, an NYPD officer was forced to admit that all that spying had been for naught. In a sworn deposition submitted to the court as part of a lawsuit, the chief of the NYPD Intelligence Division, Lt. Paul Galati, conceded that the mass NYPD surveillance of Muslims had yielded exactly zero leads into criminal or terrorist activity. That's right: zero leads. And while the Demographics Unit has since been disbanded amid multiple lawsuits challenging its constitutionality, the effects of the NYPD spying program linger.A 2012 CUNY Law School report, ""Mapping Muslims: NYPD Spying And Its Impact On American Muslims,"" found that ""surveillance of Muslims’ quotidian activities has created a pervasive climate of fear and suspicion, encroaching upon every aspect of individual and community life."" ""Surveillance has chilled constitutionally protected rights—curtailing religious practice, censoring speech and stunting political organizing,"" the report said. The surveillance also ""severed the trust that should exist between the police department and the communities it is charged with protecting.""Surveilling a group of people based on their religion is always a bad idea, says David Schanzer, director of the Triangle Center On Terrorism And Homeland Security at Duke University.""First, it's almost certainly unconstitutional,"" Schanzer said. ""Second of all, it's a big waste of time. That's what the NYPD found. If you have limited resources, and you surveil people without any sort of evidence that they're likely to engage in crime, then you're spending a huge amount of resources surveilling the innocent. It's a big waste of time and money.""""The third reason it's problematic: If people feel like they are being pursued and surveilled by the government and they've done nothing wrong, you're going to destroy the kind of trust you need to combat extremism. Communities that are fearful of government backlash, of religious-based discrimination, are going to be fearful of cooperation and of coming forward with knowledge that they might have about a suspicious individual."" Schanzer co-authored the 2010 report ""Anti-Terror Lessons Of Muslim-Americans,"" which found that ""the creation of robust Muslim-American communities may serve as a preventative measure against radicalization by reducing social isolation of individuals who may be at risk of becoming radicalized."" And the mosques Trump wants to surveil are an integral part of those robust Muslim American communities. ""All the research shows that people who engage ... in violence are not highly religious and don't have deep connections to their mosque or their community,"" Schanzer said.""To the extent people are engaged in mosques, they are taught mainstream principles of Islam, not fringe principles of Islam, and they become more tightly bound to communities -- which helps them become well-grounded, integrated citizens, as opposed to these destructive loners,"" Schanzer said. ""There's absolutely no evidence that there are large mosques in the U.S. that are hotbeds of extremism and incubators for radicalization,"" he continued. ""If there were, we'd know about them, they'd be reported on and uncovered and subjected to huge public scrutiny and scorn."" Yet mosques often bear the brunt of violent American Islamophobia. A new report released Monday by the Council on American-Islamic Relations found 78 instances in 2015 in which mosques were targeted for vandalism, arson and other types destruction. Thirty-four of those incidents came in the last two months of the year, after the terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California -- while Trump and other political figures were ratcheting up their anti-Muslim rhetoric. Similarly, in the last week alone, authorities in Ohio arrested an intruder for harassing worshippers inside a mosque; someone threatened an Islamic center in Indiana; a man was arrested for threatening a mosque near Seattle; a woman in Texas drove up to a mosque and threatened congregants there; police are investigating a tweet directed at a mosque in Michigan that said, ""We must execute the Muslim scum. Full on eradication”; Chicago-area mosques received multiple threats; and mosques across Florida have also received multiple threats. The Council on American-Islamic Relations has since recommended that mosques across the country beef up security. ""Because of the recent tragic attack in Orlando and the anti-Muslim political climate, we urge local community leaders to seek increased police patrols in the areas surrounding mosques and Islamic institutions nationwide,"" CAIR National Executive Director Nihad Awad said in a statement. ""The targeting of one minority group by hate should not result in the targeting of another.""This type of anti-Muslim behavior is deeply concerning, Schanzer says.American Muslims, he said, are a ""key part of the solution to problems like Orlando, not part of the problem -- and if we disparage them and accuse them of being un-American, un-patriotic, suspicious, we're going to damage our key ally, cutting their legs out from under them.""Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

We need intelligence gathering like never before.”It's a proposal Trump's made before, along with other dragnet counter-terror strategies like a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. and a database of all Muslims living in the country. But blanket surveillance of American Muslims would be -- and, in fact, has already been proven to be -- wildly counterproductive. Take, for example, the New York City intelligence gathering system Trump hailed as the ""probably the best in the nation."" For more than six years after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, this secretive police spying program targeted New York and New Jersey Muslims solely because of their faith. Officers in the New York City Police Department's Demographics Unit infiltrated Muslim student groups, eavesdropped on conversations between Muslims, spied on Muslim-owned businesses, recorded the sermons of imams, catalogued Muslims who Americanized their surnames, and placed informants and undercover officers inside mosques. But after the program was exposed in a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigation by The Associated Press, an NYPD officer was forced to admit that all that spying had been for naught. In a sworn deposition submitted to the court as part of a lawsuit, the chief of the NYPD Intelligence Division, Lt. Paul Galati, conceded that the mass NYPD surveillance of Muslims had yielded exactly zero leads into criminal or terrorist activity. That's right: zero leads. And while the Demographics Unit has since been disbanded amid multiple lawsuits challenging its constitutionality, the effects of the NYPD spying program linger.A 2012 CUNY Law School report, ""Mapping Muslims: NYPD Spying And Its Impact On American Muslims,"" found that ""surveillance of Muslims’ quotidian activities has created a pervasive climate of fear and suspicion, encroaching upon every aspect of individual and community life."" ""Surveillance has chilled constitutionally protected rights—curtailing religious practice, censoring speech and stunting political organizing,"" the report said. The surveillance also ""severed the trust that should exist between the police department and the communities it is charged with protecting.""Surveilling a group of people based on their religion is always a bad idea, says David Schanzer, director of the Triangle Center On Terrorism And Homeland Security at Duke University.""First, it's almost certainly unconstitutional,"" Schanzer said. ""Second of all, it's a big waste of time. That's what the NYPD found. If you have limited resources, and you surveil people without any sort of evidence that they're likely to engage in crime, then you're spending a huge amount of resources surveilling the innocent. It's a big waste of time and money.""""The third reason it's problematic: If people feel like they are being pursued and surveilled by the government and they've done nothing wrong, you're going to destroy the kind of trust you need to combat extremism. Communities that are fearful of government backlash, of religious-based discrimination, are going to be fearful of cooperation and of coming forward with knowledge that they might have about a suspicious individual."" Schanzer co-authored the 2010 report ""Anti-Terror Lessons Of Muslim-Americans,"" which found that ""the creation of robust Muslim-American communities may serve as a preventative measure against radicalization by reducing social isolation of individuals who may be at risk of becoming radicalized."" And the mosques Trump wants to surveil are an integral part of those robust Muslim American communities. ""All the research shows that people who engage ... in violence are not highly religious and don't have deep connections to their mosque or their community,"" Schanzer said.""To the extent people are engaged in mosques, they are taught mainstream principles of Islam, not fringe principles of Islam, and they become more tightly bound to communities -- which helps them become well-grounded, integrated citizens, as opposed to these destructive loners,"" Schanzer said. ""There's absolutely no evidence that there are large mosques in the U.S. that are hotbeds of extremism and incubators for radicalization,"" he continued. ""If there were, we'd know about them, they'd be reported on and uncovered and subjected to huge public scrutiny and scorn."" Yet mosques often bear the brunt of violent American Islamophobia. A new report released Monday by the Council on American-Islamic Relations found 78 instances in 2015 in which mosques were targeted for vandalism, arson and other types destruction. Thirty-four of those incidents came in the last two months of the year, after the terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California -- while Trump and other political figures were ratcheting up their anti-Muslim rhetoric. Similarly, in the last week alone, authorities in Ohio arrested an intruder for harassing worshippers inside a mosque; someone threatened an Islamic center in Indiana; a man was arrested for threatening a mosque near Seattle; a woman in Texas drove up to a mosque and threatened congregants there; police are investigating a tweet directed at a mosque in Michigan that said, ""We must execute the Muslim scum. Full on eradication”; Chicago-area mosques received multiple threats; and mosques across Florida have also received multiple threats. The Council on American-Islamic Relations has since recommended that mosques across the country beef up security. ""Because of the recent tragic attack in Orlando and the anti-Muslim political climate, we urge local community leaders to seek increased police patrols in the areas surrounding mosques and Islamic institutions nationwide,"" CAIR National Executive Director Nihad Awad said in a statement. ""The targeting of one minority group by hate should not result in the targeting of another.""This type of anti-Muslim behavior is deeply concerning, Schanzer says.American Muslims, he said, are a ""key part of the solution to problems like Orlando, not part of the problem -- and if we disparage them and accuse them of being un-American, un-patriotic, suspicious, we're going to damage our key ally, cutting their legs out from under them.""Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

Marc Benioff, the outspoken “social activist” leader of software company Salesforce, has so far said next to nothing about the presumptive GOP presidential nominee. Pressed repeatedly by The Huffington Post for his thoughts on Trump, whose stances against Muslims, immigrants and women have earned him, most recently, the ire of tech powerhouse Apple, Benioff has declined comment.Just last month, The Wall Street Journal dubbed the 51-year-old Benioff an “activist CEO,” a new kind of corporate leader unafraid to take on the kinds of controversial issues typical corporate chieftains fear to touch. Over the past two years, Benioff not only aggressively spoke out against anti-LGBT laws in Indiana, Georgia and North Carolina, he rallied other CEOs to his side. He's also become outspoken on the issue of equal pay for women.“Mr. Benioff [is] a master promoter in the movement toward social activism among American chief executives, one that’s increasingly influential,” Monica Langley wrote in the Journal.The thing is, coming out against a presidential candidate is a far riskier undertaking for a CEO than championing the causes of LGBT rights or women’s equality, already popular with tech company employees and customers. (Trump's stance on LGBT issues is murky. He's said he does not support same-sex marriage, but has been outspoken about his support for ""the gays."")The number of people who will stop buying your products or dealing with you because you support LGBT rights is not a real problem, Gautum Mukunda, a professor at Harvard Business School, told The Huffington Post. But there are a lot of people who are going to vote for Donald Trump. Even if Clinton wins in a landslide -- 60 percent of the vote, say -- you’re still talking about 40 percent of the voting population, he noted. “That’s a gigantic portion of the U.S,” said Mukunda, author of the book Indispensable: When Leaders Really Matter.We’ve arrived at a point, exemplified by leaders like Benioff, where it’s OK for businesspeople to oppose certain policies and support social issues like LGBT rights. But opposing an entire political party, which is what it would mean to speak out against the Republican presidential candidate, “is a very big step,” Mukunda said.Besides, would a CEO's support or opposition actually sway voters? Trump supporters say they want a businessperson in the White House, but they've also got a strong anti-establishment bent, and it's not clear if they'd actually listen to any true corporate leader's opinion on the candidate. Though he’s stayed silent on Trump, Benioff has opened his wallet to Hillary Clinton. In March, he gave $2,700 to the presumptive Democratic nominee, but that same month he told CNN he wasn’t sure Trump would be terrible for business. (A recent analysis from Moody’s that examined Trump’s economic proposals said a Trump presidency would throw the global economy into recession.)Formerly a registered Republican, Benioff is now unaffiliated with either party. Since June 2015, he has donated to a handful of Democratic politicians, including New York Senator Chuck Schumer and California Attorney General Kamala Harris, who is running to replace Sen. Barbara Boxer when she steps down later this year. He has given money to Republicans, too. In March, he donated to both Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader. Meanwhile, Benioff’s contemporaries are tentatively starting to act and speak out against Trump, as liberal activists pressure businesses to take a stand.Apple is reportedly withholding support and funding from the Republican presidential convention because of Trump’s comments on women, immigrants and minorities, according to sources quoted in Politico over the weekend. Coca Cola also scaled back support for the convention -- giving just $75,000 this year as compared to $665,000 in 2012. Microsoft is not giving any cash to the GOP convention, just technical support. The Redmond, Washington-based company is doing both for Democrats. Microsoft declined to comment further on Trump when asked by HuffPost.On Monday, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky reportedly said Trump’s nativist policies -- like building a wall between the U.S. and Mexico -- are “on the wrong side of history.” Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman, a major GOP donor, has been calling out Trump for a while. Whitman reportedly compared him to Hitler and Mussolini earlier this month in a meeting with GOP leaders.Facebook chief executive and founder Mark Zuckerberg, a big proponent of immigration, obliquely criticized Trump at a recent conference.“I hear fearful voices calling for building walls and distancing people they label as others. For blocking free expression, for slowing immigration, reducing trade and in some cases around the world even cutting access to the internet,” Zuckerberg said. “It takes courage to choose hope over fear.” Buzzfeed CEO Jonah Peretti turned down Trump ad money. These seem like small steps, but are pretty remarkable. Mukunda who's written and studied presidential campaigns extensively, could not recall a major company taking a strong position on a presidential candidate.""If you talk to senior businesspeople, genuinely successful ones, the level of contempt [for Trump] is amazing. They’ll tell you stories, saying, 'This guy’s a moron,'"" Mukunda said.Benioff first waded into the turbulent world of social politics in March 2015, when he threatened to scale back his company’s investment in Indiana over a so-called “religious freedom” bill that allowed businesses to discriminate against employees and customers based on sexual orientation and gender identity. He had unique clout in the state: Salesforce became the state’s largest tech employer when it acquired the Indianapolis-based marketing software firm ExactTarget in 2013.A day after Gov. Mike Pence (R) signed the bill into law, Benioff ramped up his opposition, vowing to cancel all Salesforce programs that would require customers or employees to travel to Indiana. Soon after, he promised to pay to relocate any employees living in the state.Between appearances on CNN and CNBC during which he strongly criticized the law and its backers, Benioff rallied other big-name companies and executives behind him. With his prodding, Apple, PayPal and NASCAR stood up against the law. After a week, the governor signed a revised version of the law that included protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.Benioff had won.“I was completely blown away,” he told HuffPost in April 2015. “This is really the first time that we have started something, and the reason it got started -- the reason it was successful -- is because it was so many different CEOs banding together.”For about a year, Benioff stayed relatively quiet. Meanwhile, mostly Republican lawmakers began pushing similar anti-LGBT bills in state legislatures around the country. In February, when one of those bills passed in the Georgia Senate, Benioff once again strapped on his boxing gloves. After battling one of the bill’s co-sponsors on Twitter -- Benioff is a prolific tweeter -- he renewed his call to corporate leaders to rally against the measure, which he said was pushed by “bigots.” Under pressure from the more than 400 companies that came out against the bill, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal (R) vetoed it in March.That same month, a new front in Benioff’s fight opened up. A day after North Carolina lawmakers held a special session to draft and pass its own law legalizing discrimination against LGBT people in the name of religious freedom, Benioff started making calls and sending emails.Facing fierce criticism from a corporate base emboldened by the Georgia victory, legislators in North Carolina amended its so-called “bathroom bill” to add protections for some queer people. But, as the nickname implies, the law left in place measures meant to keep transgender individuals from using the restrooms that correspond with their gender identity. Still, Benioff’s multi-pronged policy war cemented his status as an “activist CEO.”This February, Benioff hosted a dinner in Beverly Hills for many activists, executives and actors to discuss equality. There, Benioff pushed Tesla and SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk to stand up before the room and talk about gender pay equality. Musk, admitting he hadn’t thought about the issue much before, told HuffPost later that night he’d consider reviewing pay at his company to make sure it was equitable.“Marc rallies CEOs when business and trade groups are much slower to act, particularly on noneconomic issues,” Dow Chemical chief Andrew Liveris, who weighed in against the North Carolina law, told The Wall Street Journal.Now that a presidential nominee is espousing the kinds of policies that seem to run counter to the notions of equality and fairness Benioff spoke so movingly of at that winter dinner, it seems a good time to see how far Benioff could take those skills.UPDATE: 7:54 p.m. — Four hours after this story was published, Benioff posted a tweet noting his longstanding support for Hillary Clinton:Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misidentified the senator for whose seat Kamala Harris is running.

15,BUSINESS,Owner Of Company That Makes AR-15s To Attend Donald Trump Fundraiser,Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-fundraiser-cerberus_us_5769a3f8e4b09926ce5ce6b0,Trump is trying to erase the huge financial disadvantage he faces against Hillary Clinton.,2016-06-21,"In this Aug. 15, 2012 file photo, three variations of the AR-15 are displayed at the California Department of Justice in Sacramento.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- The founder and CEO of a private equity company that owns a leading maker of AR-15s will attend a fundraiser for Donald Trump in New York on Tuesday evening.Stephen Feinberg, the co-founder and CEO of Cerberus Capital Management, will attend the event, along with hedge fund manager John Paulson, debt investor Wilbur Ross, real estate developer Peter Kalikow and Trump fundraiser Anthony Scaramucci, The New York Times reported last week.Cerberus owns Remington Outdoor, which makes the Bushmaster AR-15, one of the weapons carried by the gunman who killed 20 children and six adults in the 2012 Newtown, Connecticut school massacre.Cerberus said in 2012 it would sell Remington Outdoor in response to calls from public pension funds for the private equity company to get out of the gun business. However, it was unable to find a buyer. It announced in 2015 that it would allow investors to sell off their stake in the gun company while remaining in Cerberus’ other investments.Tickets to Tuesday's fundraiser cost $50,000, with the hosts paying $250,000. HuffPost was unable to identify the hosts or confirm the location of the event.Cerberus and the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from HuffPost.The event comes the day after the Trump campaign’s paltry fundraising haul was disclosed in filings with the Federal Elections Commission. Trump’s campaign began the month of June with just $1.3 million in cash on hand, compared to rival Hillary Clinton’s $42 million in the bank. In May, Trump raised $3.1 million, while Clinton brought in $26.2 million.The Times wrote that Trump “enters the general election campaign laboring under the worst financial and organizational disadvantage of any major party nominee in recent history.”And as The Huffington Post’s Paul Blumenthal detailed, things don’t look much better for the campaign, even after accounting for funds from the candidates’ respective parties and friendly super PACs. “The astonishing gap in funding has produced massive disparities in both television advertising and staff on the ground,” Blumenthal reported. Last August, Trump excoriated hedge funds for using the tax code to ""[g]et away with murder."" Assailing the carried interest tax loophole -- which is, in fact, regularly used by private equity executives and very rarely by hedge funds -- Trump told CBS's ""Face the Nation"" that “they’re paying nothing. And it’s ridiculous.""“Half of them, look, they’re energetic, they’re very smart, but a lot of them, it’s like they’re paper pushers,"" Trump said. ""They make a fortune, they pay no tax. It’s ridiculous, OK?”But that rhetoric vanished as Trump campaigned in the New York state primary with an eye to raising money for the general election. “He can’t be in midtown Manhattan launching attacks on hedge funds and not expect that to have a negative effect on him,” Doug Heye, the former head of communications for the Republican National Committee, told HuffPost in April.What former Ted Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler once described as Trump's ""crass political calculation"" is still on display as he approaches the very people he said he would never be beholden to for money. Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

Paul LePage (R) wants to wash his hands of the federal food stamp program because beneficiaries eat so much filthy junk food. LePage told the Obama administration that he'd end the state's administration of food stamps if the U.S. Department of Agriculture won't let him decide which foods Mainers can buy with their benefits. “It’s time for the federal government to wake up and smell the energy drinks,” LePage wrote in a letter to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack.“Doubtful that it will, I will be pursuing options to implement reform unilaterally or cease Maine’s administration of the food stamp program altogether,"" LePage wrote. States distribute the benefits but the federal government sets the rules for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which serves roughly 44 million Americans nationwide, including nearly 200,000 in Maine. LePage spokeswoman Adrienne Bennett told The Huffington Post in an email that LePage doesn't want to end SNAP benefits in Maine, just that he wants to let the USDA handle it. LePage's letter to Vilsack tells the secretary he ought to ""start browsing the Maine classifieds for commercial real estate leases.""""The governor knows how to get attention,"" Bennett said on a radio program where she announced the letter. LePage had asked the feds for permission to ban sodas and sweets from food stamp sales last year, which LePage's letter indicates had been denied earlier this month. The USDA has blocked similar requests from a handful of other states.LePage wrote in the letter that the Obama administration must be in thrall to Big Candy, since it has cracked down on unhealthy food in the National School Lunch Program and also sought to spur healthier eating among SNAP recipients.""The Obama administration goes to great lengths to police the menus of K-12 cafeterias but looks the other way as billions of taxpayer dollars finance a steady diet of Mars bars and Mountain Dew,"" LePage said.""I can think of only one reason why the federal government would refuse to eliminate junk food from the EBT menu: special interests,"" the governor wrote. ""Only when Washington politicians stop kowtowing to powerful retail grocer and junk good manufacturing interests will American taxpayers have a respectable food safety net.""In a statement, a USDA spokesperson said Maine couldn't show how its junk food ban would reduce obesity among Maine SNAP recipients. ""USDA has given Maine the opportunity to provide further clarifying information about their proposal, and we look forward to their response,"" the spokesperson said.LePage isn't the only Republican governor challenging federal SNAP rules -- Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has sued the Obama administration for the right to make beneficiaries take drug tests. Food stamps, which average $125 per month, can be used in grocery stores for any type of food except alcohol and hot prepared meals. Federal data show SNAP recipients' diets are basically the same as everyone else's, which is not very good. This story has been updated to include comment from the USDA. "

In comparison, 14.7 percent of Lyfts and 12 percent of Ubers have the same problem.Nationally, about 10 percent of vehicles on the road have at least one bald tire.The study is based on a survey of tread depth on 300 different cars used by Lyft, Uber and taxis, and was conducted across Chicago, Dallas and Miami, for a total sample size of 1,200 tires.A tire's tread depth affects its ability to grip the road, especially in less-than-perfect driving conditions where snow or water is on the road surface.

This change to the law provides ""the very religious accommodation Davis sought from the beginning of this litigation,"" her lawyers wrote in their petition, thus effectively rendering the whole case moot.Her lawyers also asked the appeals court to vacate the lower court order that had found her in contempt and sent her to jail for five days.Notably, the legal team for the same-sex couples who were turned away by Davis -- they were seeking licenses after the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage nationwide -- will not oppose the clerk's latest move.""We agree that Kim Davis’s appeals should be dismissed,"" Daniel Canon, one of those lawyers, said in an email to The Huffington Post. ""Once the new Kentucky law becomes effective, all loving couples seeking to obtain marriage licenses will be able to do so on an equal basis.""That the attorneys for the same-sex couples -- including Canon's firm and the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky -- support dismissal of the case strikes a symbolic note nearly a year after the landmark decision in Obergefell v. Hodges.""On the eve of the one-year anniversary of the Supreme Court’s ruling, we’re pleased that same-sex couples can fully realize legal recognition of their love, including in Rowan County, Kentucky,"" said Canon, who was also involved in the Supreme Court case.Since the beginning of Davis' legal troubles, when she instituted a blanket ""no license"" policy in response to the Supreme Court's decision, she has had trouble convincing courts that her religious defiance has any legal merit. But with this new development, it is highly likely that the 6th Circuit, which was set to hear oral arguments in Davis' case in July, will simply put the matter to rest.In effect, Davis would get a win not because she was ever right on the law, but because the law was changed to spare her.As Canon's partner Joe Dunman said in a follow-up email, ""If the court grants their motion, it would be their very first legal victory of any kind."""
20,SCIENCE,Positive Results From Brain Games May Be Just A Placebo Effect,Bahar Gholipour,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brain-games-placebo-effect_us_57693035e4b015db1bca8519,A new study deals a blow to the billion-dollar industry.,2016-06-21,Two different flyers used to recruit study participants.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5769320a1500002a0073babf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The brain-training apps that promise to improve memory and boost your IQ may have nothing more than a placebo effect, according to a new study.The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Monday, found that people perform better in intelligence tests if they expect brain-training games to help them. There's already growing debate over the efficacy of products that claim to train people's brains. The burgeoning industry -- which was forecast to make $6 billion by 2020 -- is already taking hits. The Federal Trade Commission fined the company behind the brain training program Lumosity $2 million in January for deceptive advertising. Lumosity sold game subscriptions to its 70 million customers ranging from monthly payments of $14.95 to lifetime memberships for $299.95, marketing the games as tools to keep the brain sharp and healthy. But the FTC said the program “preyed on consumers’ fears about age-related cognitive decline,” and it “simply did not have the science to back up its ads.”Matters are not any less turbulent in the scientific community. In 2014, about 70 neuroscientists signed an open letter pointing out the lack of scientific evidence for claims about positive effects of brain games. Another group of scientists have argued in response that “a substantial and growing body of evidence shows that certain cognitive training regimens can significantly improve cognitive function.”Studies showing the brain-train games work may be inherently biased from selecting participants who expected to get smarter by playing brain games, according to Cyrus Foroughi, who co-authored the latest research pointing to evidence of a placebo effect.“Placeboes are very pervasive and they have to be controlled for in a tremendous number of fields. This field is no different,” the George Mason University researcher told The Huffington Post. “So we put together the study to actually test whether expectation for a positive effect can lead to a positive outcome.”Foroughi and his colleagues put up flyers around the campus inviting students to take part in their research. Half of the flyers were highly suggestive, mentioning brain training and cognitive enhancement. The other half were standard, generic ads that didn’t mention the type of study. Both groups, each made up of 25 volunteers, did a pre-test to measure their baseline intelligence. They then played a game involving a task called dual n-back for an hour. This task aims to engage and train working memory. The next day, the participants returned to the lab for a second intelligence test.Previous research, including a meta-analysis of 20 studies published in 2014, had suggested that training working memory could improve intelligence -- particularly the fluid type of intelligence that refers to problem-solving abilities and using logic.The participants who had responded to the suggestive flyer showed improvement at the second intelligence test amounting to a 5- to 10-point increase on a standard IQ test. The other group, however, showed no improvements, according to the study. This placebo effect may have infiltrated a considerable body of research on brain training. Foroughi’s team contacted authors of 19 studies and found 17 of them in some way had introduced bias; they mentioned brain training, for example, or used a set of words that could have influenced the participants, Foroughi said.Many researchers purposely do this to get motivated participants because people who are interested in playing brain games are more likely to take part than those who have no interest, he added. To account for the bias, researchers divide their participants into two group. One group plays the real game while the other group plays a fake game or some similar alternative. They then subtract the improvements. This study design may seem logical at first glance. And it seems to be the type of design that Lumosity has used in its research. “Our scientists had 4,715 participants complete the study,"" the company states on its website. ""Half trained with Lumosity, while the rest did online crossword puzzles to control for placebo effects. After 10 weeks, the Lumosity group improved more than the crosswords group on an aggregate assessment of cognition.”But the new finding that just expecting to get smarter might make people test better questions the real reason behind people’s improvements in those studies. Lumosity said in a statement to HuffPost: The recent study on placebo effects in cognitive training is interesting and underscores the importance of proper study design, suggesting that appropriately accounting for confounds such as self-selection bias and expectancy effects should be an important aspect of study design.Other popular brain-training products include Happy Neuron, which has about 11 million users; Rosetta Stone's Fit Brains and The British Cogmed, which has games for children and students to improve learning. Neuronation, which has 7 million members, even claims that “working memory is directly related to intelligence -- the more you train, the smarter you can be.”While the new finding doesn't prove that none of these brain training programs work, it does provide an alternative explanation for effects observed in the cognitive-training research and the brain-training industry, ""revealing the need to account for confounds in future research,” Foroughi and his colleagues wrote in their study.Jacky Au of University of California, Irvine, who authored the 2014 meta-analysis, agrees that a placebo effect ""almost certainly"" exists, but points out that we don't know if it explains all of the improvement people see from brain games. ""The critical question is to parcel out the relative contributions of placebo and training,"" Au told HuffPost. Foroughi said the George Mason University study doesn't mean the debate is over. ""I think we are moving in the right direction, getting better data and eliminating possible confounders like placebo effects,"" he said. ""The brain training industry is growing. It may or may not work but we need a lot more evidence before we come to something conclusive.”"

Back in January, senators introduced the idea of issuing $2 billion in bonds to provide at least 14,000 units to house homeless people, the Los Angeles Times reported. The bonds would be repaid over about 20 to 30 years using funds from a “millionaires tax,” which would raise taxes on millionaires by 1 percent, according to the AP. The plan is moving forward at a time when cities, including Los Angeles, are declaring homelessness states of emergencies in order to free up disaster funds to address the issue. But Gov. Jerry Brown isn’t in favor of the approach, the AP noted.While Los Angeles’ Skid Row often serves as the “face” of California’s homeless issue, it’s hardly the only area that’s facing staggering figures.In the city of Los Angeles, homeless figures jumped 11 percent from 2015 to 2016. In San Francisco, homelessness increased 3.9 percent from 2013 to last year. On a given night last year, there were 6,686 homeless people in the city, according to the annual point-in-time survey. Brown remains focused on providing housing for people in need, a method that has repeatedly proven to work.A recent study out of San Francisco found that the city saved 56 percent in expenses over the course of four years after housing for homeless people. Part of the state plan will involve organizations in counties providing services to homeless people. That includes mental health programs and case workers, among other services.“The problem is getting worse everywhere,” Darrell Steinberg, the former California Senate leader who was elected to be mayor of Sacramento earlier this month, told the Times back in January. “At the same time we know what works.”"

""I do apologize for venting to the church. I was out of line."" On June 11, Jansen drove by St. Paul's United Church of Christ in Dallastown, Pennsylvania. Outside the church, he noticed a sign that read ""Wishing a blessed Ramadan to our Muslim neighbors."" The sign so incensed Jensen that he promptly called the church and left a voicemail, calling the sign ""despicable."" “I am completely shocked by that sign out in front of your church, that you are wishing people who subscribe to a faith that is not only godless but pagan, in front of your church, aligning it with the name of Christ,” Jansen said. “It is unbelievable that you would wish them a blessed Ramadan.”""Are you sick?"" Jansen said. ""Is there something wrong with you?""The voicemail concluded with a warning from Jansen that he was going to share a photo of the sign on Twitter and Facebook, along with the church's phone number, “so everyone can see this.”He followed through on his threat: Jansen did not respond to requests for comment from The Huffington Post. But after the York Daily Record published a story about the voicemail, Jansen defended himself in a series of bizarre and Islamophobic statements. “I don’t see Islam — or the Muslim belief — I don’t see it as legit,” he told The Associated Press. ""It’s not a religion,"" he told the York Dispatch. ""It’s not a cult. It’s a system” designed to enact ""global Sharia."" ""Sharia law is inconsistent with the values and philosophies of western cultures,"" he said. The idea that Muslims want to replace the government of western democracies with Sharia, or Islamic law, is a popular -- and thoroughly debunked -- conspiracy theory held by anti-Muslim hate groups.Among many vague Islamophobic and xenophobic tweets, Jansen earlier this month tweeted that ""Islam needs to be stopped.""Jansen will attend the Republican National Convention in Cleveland next month as a delegate representing Pennsylvania. Once there, he intends to vote for Trump, a candidate who has called for a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. and has proposed that the U.S. government surveil mosques and profile Muslims. The presumptive GOP presidential nominee once said that ""Islam hates us."" Earlier this month, The Washington Post reported that former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney expressed concern about Trump's bigoted rhetoric, warning of potential ""trickle-down racism."" “I don’t want to see a president of the United States saying things which change the character of the generations of Americans that are following,” Romney told CNN. “Presidents have an impact on the nature of our nation, and trickle-down racism, trickle-down bigotry, trickle-down misogyny, all these things are extraordinarily dangerous to the heart and character of America.”Anti-Muslim rhetoric and violence have surged in recent months. Following the terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California, hate crimes against Muslims tripled. A new report released on Monday by the Council on American-Islamic Relations found 78 instances in 2015 in which mosques were targeted for vandalism, arson and other types destruction. The Huffington Post has recently documented multiple instances of Trump supporters and other individuals harassing or attacking Muslims. Jansen, a proud Trump supporter, is also a school board member in Spring Grove, Pennsylvania. At a school board meeting on Monday night, he told reporters that he won't heed calls to resign from the board.""Everyone's got an opinion,"" Jansen said, according to The York Dispatch. ""It was a First Amendment right. I didn't break any laws, I didn't break any rules. I didn't mention the school board or the Republican Party. I brought a lot of unnecessary attention to the school, which of course wasn't my idea. I just wanted to rant about this silly sign."" And although Jansen said leaving the voicemail was ""out of line,"" he also stood by the comments he made. ""I'm still a Christian, and [Christians and Muslims] don't share the same belief system,"" he said.But Rev. Christopher Rodkey -- who was the first to hear the voicemail Jansen left for St. Paul's United Church of Christ -- has a different take on religion. ""You know we've had some media attention here at St. Paul's for the radical practice of wishing our neighbors who are Muslim a blessed Ramadan,"" he told his congregation during his sermon on Sunday.""We've had a lot of calls of support, we've had some calls that you can say weren't so supportive. The whole episode has unveiled the ugliness and the racism that lies just beneath the surface in our community."" ""But I don't care,"" he continued. ""The gospel is love God, love your neighbor. So out of darkness, let us find light. Out of ugliness, let us find beauty. Out of all the messiness, let us learn to love messiness. Out of all our pain, and all the suffering and war, let us at some time arrive to a time of true peace.""""And out of all the hate that characterizes our time at this point in history, let us respond as Jesus taught us: Love God, love your neighbor. I'll wish my Muslim neighbors a blessed Ramadan until it ends on July 5."" Rodkey said that while he has received anti-Muslim phone calls about the church's sign, most responses have been ""absolutely overwhelmingly positive."" ""I am really touched by the messages from American Muslims in particular who have been thanking me for their support,"" he said. ""I don't want to act like I speak for them at all, but I am hoping that all of this creates some public space for their voice to be heard and for the rest of us to be silent and dare to listen.""Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

Most politicians would fire a top aide for far less. But until now, Trump had stood by Lewandowski through it all.In March, Politico reported that Lewandowski made sexually suggestive comments toward female reporters covering Trump and, according to many sources, veiled threats against Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly in a conference call with Fox News executives in January. In March, Lewandowski pushed CNN reporter Noah Gray for asking Trump a question. A few months prior, Lewandowski got in Gray’s face after he tried filming protesters at Trump’s rally.Lewandowski’s attacks on journalists and women was something I experienced firsthand. In March, when I was working as a reporter for Breitbart News, Lewandowski manhandled me.Trump had finished giving his speech at Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter and was walking around the venue space, signing books and fielding questions from reporters, when I asked him about his position on affirmative action. Before I could finish my question, Lewandowski grabbed me from behind and pulled me away hard enough to leave bruises on my arm.Instead of apologizing, Lewandowski took to Twitter to deny the entire episode, despite the fact that there was overwhelming evidence, including a Washington Post reporter who witnessed the incident.“You are totally delusional,” Lewandowski tweeted. “I never touched you. As a matter of fact. I have never even met you.”The incident would spark a political firestorm. After Lewandowski and Trump lied about the incident and defamed me on national television, I filed a criminal complaint against Lewandowski with the Jupiter Police, who found probable cause to charge him with simple battery. Although Palm Beach County prosecutors decided not to prosecute the case, the investigation unearthed security video backing up my story. Lewandowski’s tendency to physically manhandle people at Trump rallies didn’t stop with me. Within a few weeks of my incident, Lewandowski was caught grabbing a protester by the shirt collar. Grabbing reporters and protesters is not a normal responsibility for a presidential campaign manager.Lewandowski also clashed with his coworkers, especially with Trump’s senior advisor (and now campaign chairman) Paul Manafort. Manafort, a seasoned political operative, was brought on in March to make the campaign run more professionally ahead of the general election. According to reports, Lewandowski and Manafort engaged in a power struggle from the moment Manafort was hired, undermining each other at every turn.That Lewandowski survived a series of moments that would have spelled doom for any other aide on any other campaign was remarkable. But so, too, was the fact that he was atop the campaign of a presumptive nominee in the first place. Lewandowski was a little-known political operative before Trump plucked him out of obscurity to “run” his campaign. But his bad temper and combativeness were well known among those who worked alongside him for years.Before his job on the campaign, Lewandowski worked for the Koch brothers organization Americans for Prosperity. During his time there, Lewandowski reportedly threatened to blow up his boss’ car and called a female coworker a “c**t"" in front of coworkers.It was at an Americans for Prosperity event in New Hampshire that Lewandowski crossed paths with Trump. Trump was impressed with Lewandowski, despite him never having run a national campaign, and ultimately hired him.What Trump seemed to like most about Lewandowski is that he didn’t really try to control Trump or change his persona. The campaign strategy Lewandowski set was described as, “Let Trump be Trump.”On Monday, Trump fired him. And in the days ahead, we will learn in greater detail what exactly was the final straw. One initial report suggests Lewandowski was fired to allay the concerns campaign allies and donors had over his competence and behavior. NBC reports Trump’s daughter Ivanka has been pushing for Lewandowski’s firing for some time for a number of reasons, including his attack on me. After it was all done, Lewandowski continued to play good soldier, going on cable news to praise the man who had just axed his job. Perhaps he was gunning for a triumphant return to Trump's campaign sometime down the road. Perhaps he was just paying Trump back for standing by his side through the prior controversies.

The colorful structures turn ghostly white, and if temperatures don't ease, coral often die.Such an event along the Great Barrier Reef off Australia's coast has caused 93 percent of the structure's coral to show signs of bleaching. More than one-third of the coral in some parts of the Great Barrier has already died. NOAA scientists said reefs around Palau and Micronesia have a 90 percent chance of showing signs of bleaching this year. Hawaii, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands and areas throughout the Gulf of Mexico are also on high alert for damage through fall.More than 70 percent of U.S. reefs have already been exposed to long-lasting high temperatures that can cause bleaching, NOAA said. Scientists have linked the growing intensity of bleaching events to climate change. Man-made global warming has warmed the oceans, causing seas to rise, ice sheets to melt and corals to bleach. When events like El Nino show up, effects are compounded and can cause worldwide events, like the one ongoing. Two previous bleaching events were in 1998 and 2010.“Rising temperatures due to climate change have pushed corals beyond their tolerance levels,” Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, director of Australia's Global Change Institute, told The New York Times.Coral can recover from bleaching if water temperatures drop back to normal. But scientists have warned repetitive, years-long bleaching events act as a one-two punch to a species already beaten down from past traumas.The state of coral reefs, scientists say, is an early indicator of planetary health and an urgent call to halt climate change.Coral ""is the bellwether for the changes that are occurring in our oceans,"" said Jennifer Koss, NOAA's coral reef conservation program director. ""If you think of coral as the canary, they're chirping really loudly right now. ... The ones' that are still alive, that is."""

""You know that by stepping up, your action has the potential to create a domino effect. Have the courage to do it. We have done it before. We can do it again.""The Senate is voting on four gun-related bills after Democrats, led by Sen. Chris Murphy (Conn.), staged a 15-hour filibuster last week to pressure GOP leaders to do something about gun violence in the wake of a shooting massacre at a gay club in Orlando, Florida.Democrats have two bills: One would expand background checks for gun sales to those made at gun shows and on the internet, and the other would let the U.S. attorney general deny guns to people on a terrorist watchlist.Republicans have their own, watered-down versions of those bills. Their bill pertaining to background checks doesn't actually expand checks; it just gives more money to the agency that runs them. Their terrorist watchlist bill would still let the attorney general deny firearms to a suspected terrorist -- but only if she could prove to a judge, within three business days of an attempted gun purchase, that there is probable cause for suspecting the person has ties to terrorism.None of these bills is expected to pass. Democrats are pushing their bills to at least get everyone on record on the issues, and the GOP bills are designed to give political cover to Republicans running in tight re-election races.Biden noted that the vast majority of Americans support both of the Democrats' proposals, and said people need to speak out if they don't like the way their senators vote on Monday.""Use your voice,"" the vice president says in the video. ""It matters. We need you. This will only change if we continue making ourselves impossible to ignore.""The Senate is voting at 5:30 p.m. EST to advance each of its four gun bills.

37,POLITICS,Dump Trumpers Think They Need Just 57 Votes To Win,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dump-trump-unruh-rules_us_57675d8ae4b0fbbc8beac99c,"Anti-Trump Republican delegates want a ""conscience"" clause as an out from any obligation to vote for him.",2016-06-20,Republican delegates who are against a Donald Trump nomination have a new plan. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57675f2d1500002a0073b676.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There will be 2,472 Republican delegates going to Cleveland for the national convention, with 1,237 needed for a candidate to secure the nomination -- but those intent on blocking Donald Trump are focused on a much more manageable number: 57.That figure is 50 percent plus one of the 112-member Convention Rules Committee, the group with the power to end Trump’s grip on the GOP nomination. A victory there, said the leader of the “Free the Delegates” group on a Sunday night conference call, and it would be all downhill.“Once it passes Rules … it’s just kind of an easy sell,” said Kendal Unruh, a delegate from Colorado, who predicted that with the committee’s approval, winning over a majority of the full convention would be easy. “They’re not going to be putting up strong resistance to this.”Trump’s campaign did not respond to a Huffington Post query about Unruh’s new group. Trump himself has called the plan “illegal” -- although Supreme Court rulings suggest it is perfectly legal -- and a “hoax” by the media.Unruh is a high school history teacher at a Christian school in suburban Denver. She supported Cruz during the primaries, and a week ago became the latest in a line of Republicans working to keep the nomination from the reality TV star.Conference call organizers said some 1,000 people participated in the call, up from 30 or so on last week’s, including “hundreds” of delegates and alternates. They announced a new website, freethedelegates2016.com, and urged Republicans around the country to contact their states’ convention delegates for their support.Unruh specifically will be asking the Convention Rules Committee, of which she is a member, to pass a “conscience” clause to let delegates out of their obligation to vote for the winner of their state or congressional district. She said that because many Republicans are by their nature “rule-followers,” they would be grateful for “a permission slip” to let them off the hook. She said she was heartened by House Speaker Paul Ryan’s remarks to NBC on Sunday that he wouldn’t be telling delegates what to do.“They write the rules. They make their decisions,” said Ryan, who as chair of the convention will hold extraordinary power over its actions. “The last thing I would do is tell anybody to do something that's contrary to their conscience. Of course I wouldn't do that.”Unruh and her supporters, though, face a hard reality: Ryan, like many party leaders, has endorsed Trump. He will enter Cleveland with 1,457 delegates “bound” to vote for him through at least the first ballot. And top Republicans warn that taking the nomination from Trump will be far worse for the party than losing the presidency in November.Iowa state party chairman Jeff Kaufmann called the new attempt naïve and hypocritical for trying to undo the will of Republican voters. “The people have spoken in overwhelming number,” he said. “If they pull off what they say they will, we will not have a party. Period.""The Republican National Committee’s chief strategist, Sean Spicer, called Unruh’s efforts “silly” in a statement late last week. “There is no organized effort, strategy or leader of this so-called movement. It is nothing more than a media creation and a series of tweets,” he said.And a longtime member of the RNC who will also serve on the Convention Rules Committee said privately that Unruh’s plan is too little and too late. “I don't think anything happens. It's over. He won,” he said of Trump.Republican Party members’ angst about Trump has only gotten more acute in recent weeks. Trump’s fundraising has been sluggish, he has allowed Democrats to outspend him by tens of millions of dollars in advertising in key swing states, and he has shown little interest in building an organized voter-turnout effort.Most baffling of all, said Texas GOP consultant Matt Mackowiak, is his preference for staging rallies in places like Texas -- certain to vote Republican in November-- and California -- equally certain to vote Democratic -- rather than the 10 or so states that will actually decide the outcome.In the hours he wastes performing those, Trump could be on the phone, making fundraising calls or encouraging volunteer organizers. “Even if he's just taking a nap and getting recharged, that's probably a better use of his time,” Mackowiak said. “The last four weeks have been disastrous.""Still, Republicans are probably better off trying to persuade Trump to drop out than taking the nomination away from him, because doing so would alienate the millions who voted for him this spring.“It risks losing this base of support Trump has, if not forever, then at least for this election cycle,” Mackowiak said, adding that as bad as Trump’s performance and polling have been, they’re not bad enough yet for party leaders to actively dump him. “I don't know if there's enough evidence for skittish Republican leaders to take a bold stand.”Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

(Reuters) - The maker of the assault rifle used to kill 26 children and educators at a Connecticut school in 2012 argued on Monday that attempts to limit the sale of such weapons to civilians are best left to lawmakers and not families of the victims who sued the company.A lawyer for Bushmaster Firearms LLC, which manufactures the AR-15 that 20-year-old Adam Lanza used in his attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, told a Connecticut judge the 2005 federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act prohibited the suit.""It's not the role of this court or perhaps a jury to decide whether civilians as a broad class of people are not appropriate to own these kinds of firearms,"" James Vogts, an attorney for Bushmaster's parent company, Remington Arms, told a courtroom so packed that more than a dozen spectators were watching the hearing standing in a hallway outside the court.The families of nine people who died in the attack sued Bushmaster in 2014 in Connecticut Superior Court in Bridgeport. The lawsuit said the AR-15 should never have been sold to thegunman's mother, Nancy Lanza, because it had no civilian purpose.""It was Remington's choice to entrust the most notorious American killing machine to the public,"" said the families' attorney Joshua Koskoff. ""They know where it’s going to end up ... in an environment it was never meant for, an environment that has proven time and again to be not safe for these weapons.""Judge Barbara Bellis heard arguments on Monday, eight days after a gunman armed with another model of assault rifle killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.The wholesaler and retailer involved in the sale of the Sandy Hook gun also said the PLCAA protects them from lawsuits having to do with the gun's sale.Boston College Law School professor Robert Bloom said the federal law gave the companies a strong defense.""They (the families) have an uphill battle, but given the climate and the judge's previous rulings, it seems that she is sympathetic to the argument,"" Bloom said.The U.S. Senate's strongest push in years to tighten gun controls was likely to fall short on Monday. Lawmakers scrambled to forge a compromise that might keep firearms away from people on terrorism watch lists by later this week.Adam Lanza began his Dec. 14, 2012, attack by shooting his mother dead in their home and ended it by turning his gun on himself as he heard police sirens approach.(Reporting by Scott Malone; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Howard Goller)"
