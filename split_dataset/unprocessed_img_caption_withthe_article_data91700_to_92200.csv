They don't want a cease-fire now.""Asked whether Obama broadly shared his concerns, Abadi said the administration did.The White House, however, denied Obama had criticized Saudi Arabia in his talks with Abadi and renewed U.S. support for the anti-Houthi military campaign by the Saudis and other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council regional grouping.""We firmly support current GCC-led operations ... which is why we have been providing support for coalition operations,"" said National Security Council spokesman Alistair Baskey.Saudi Arabia's Ambassador to the United States Adel al-Jubeir said he had not heard any U.S. criticism of the operation.""I don't know how the Iraqi prime minister got to that assessment. But I would think the Iraqis should really focus on the problems that are in their own country,"" al-Jubeir told a press conference.Abadi noted his country had suffered from a spillover of hostilities from neighboring states, including the advance by Islamic State militants into Iraq from Syria.""This (Yemen war) can engulf the whole region in another conflict,"" Abadi said, adding: ""We don't need another sectarian war in the region.""The United States is in an awkward position in both Iraq and Yemen. In Iraq, it is supporting Abadi's Shi'ite led-government in its war against Sunni extremists from Islamic State, which puts it on the same side of the battle as Iran-backed fighters.But the United States is also an ally of Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia in its battle against Iran-backed Houthis, deepening its intelligence cooperation.Abadi noted the U.S. position, with some unease.""Can you work both? Both sides? Here (you) are with Iraq against (Islamic State), there, against Yemen?"" (Additional reporting by Jeff Mason, Warren Strobel and Emily Stephenson; editing by David Story and G Crosse)"

Huh, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f2ca2500008b013a5ca6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Nathan Layne and Lisa BaertleinApril 15 (Reuters) - Tens of millions of dollars and counting. That's how much the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) has spent so far on a three-year campaign to improve the plight of low-wage retail and fast-food workers, an analysis of public filings shows.The money, which has gone to labor groups, lawyers and others involved in the effort, has provided financial firepower for a movement that has made surprising progress in its push for lifting wages, successfully making the issue part of the public conversation.In recent months, cities have passed or introduced laws to require higher minimum wages within their boundaries. Wal-Mart Stores and McDonald's Corp, among a number of big employers, have raised minimum pay. And on Wednesday, organizers say, tens of thousands of people will fan out across 200 U.S. cities in the biggest rally since the campaign got its start in late 2012.But the union's critics are focused on another number: zero. That's the tally of fast-food workers who have joined SEIU's membership rolls since the campaign began. And with McDonald's and other deep-pocketed fast-food chains determined to fight back any attempts at unionization, organizing the industry is an objective that even labor advocates warn might not be achievable.The lack of organizing success to date has led some to ask whether the union should continue spending large sums to better the lives of workers who are unlikely to become members. One SEIU organizer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said members would get ""restless"" if progress on boosting membership wasn't evident after a few years.U.S. fast-food workers have been notoriously difficult to organize due to high turnover and a fragmented industry structure. Most outlets are independently operated by franchisees and have generally been considered legally separate from the parent chain. That means organizing efforts would have to be waged restaurant by restaurant.""The SEIU is on a failed mission,"" said Rick Berman, a powerful lobbyist for the tobacco, alcohol and food and beverage industries, who is using his groups such as the Center for Union Facts (CUF) to oppose SEIU and low-wage workers. ""Most of these fast-food strikes are the equivalent of a Potemkin village.""Mary Kay Henry, president of the SEIU, which has nearly 2 million members, disagrees, saying the McDonald's and Wal-Mart pay hikes have helped shift the balance of power toward workers. She said pundits and business groups had underestimated the movement's impact on wages and was doing so again on its prospects for unionizing low-wage workers.""We are quite confident there will be a breakthrough in having the union recognized as part of this growing movement,"" she told Reuters. ""We think a settlement in fast-food would be catalytic for other kinds of workers in the service sector, like Wal-Mart, like home care workers, like childcare workers, like workers at airports all across this nation.""The SEIU wouldn't say exactly how much it has spent in its efforts on behalf of low-wage workers. But the Employment Policies Institute (EPI), a research arm of Berman's CUF, estimates the union has spent some $50 million on an array of local worker committees, lawyers and consultants that have worked on a broad campaign to help low-wage workers, including efforts to influence legislation at the state and city level.Of that total, Reuters was able to independently verify in SEIU's annual filings $24 million allocated to 8 worker organizations whose stated purpose, as cited in labor department filings or online job advertisements, was to work for better conditions in the fast-food and retail industries. That compares to the approximately $28 million the union put toward getting Barack Obama elected president in 2008.SEIU's annual report showed a pattern of increased spending last year. For instance, outlays to the Fast Food Workers Committee, one of the worker organizations, more than doubled to $3.8 million, while public relations firm Berlin Rosen took in $1.3 million, up from around $850,000 in 2013. TOUGH OPPOSITIONHenry said the SEIU in the United States is following examples set in Australia and Denmark, where unionized fast-food workers have hammered out labor agreements. The union here faces well-funded opposition on myriad fronts, however, something that was not as big a factor in the other countries.The National Restaurant Association and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which are among the roughly two dozen business groups to have opposed raising the minimum wage, together spent $342.4 million to lobby U.S. lawmakers from 2012 to 2014, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics' OpenSecrets.org.Groups such as Berman's CUF fight the fast-food industry's public relations battles. And, the International Franchise Association, which represents large franchisors and franchisees, is flexing its political muscle as well.Still, Sarita Gupta, executive director at Jobs With Justice, a worker advocacy group involved in the ""Fight for 15"" campaign, said worker groups will continue to target state and city efforts to improve pay and working conditions for workers whether or not they are in unions. She cited as an example a bill introduced in Connecticut, co-sponsored by the local SEIU chapter, that would fine large employers who fail to pay at least $15 per hour.For SEIU the question of whether it can turn fast-food workers into dues-paying members is nevertheless important. Critics say failure to make gains quickly could raise doubts among the more highly skilled workers whose dues are financing the campaign.SEIU's Henry brushed aside such critiques, saying union members were solidly behind the movement and seeing tangible benefits. She pointed to the Los Angeles Unified School District and Johns Hopkins Hospital among employers who had agreed to a $15 an hour wage floor in recent negotiations with SEIU members.""Frankly I'm not worried about it,"" she said.

Despite what hardships they may have experienced in their own careers, women should pull other women up with them, rather than paying the hardship forward.",2015-04-15,"CORRECTS SPELLING TO SANDBERG NOT SANDBURG Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook, responds to questions during a news interview with Megyn Kelly on the show, The Kelly File, on the FOX News Channel, Wednesday, April 9, 2014, in New York. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb603063c000032000d1fc4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On April 9, Facebook Chief Operating Officer and thought leader Sheryl Sandberg gave a version of her Lean In presentation to employees of the Department of Defense at the Pentagon. It was a fitting time for her visit, as more and more women are reaching the ranks of general and flag officers and senior executive service, and the Department is leading a concerted effort to embrace diversity and inclusion within the workforce. Sheryl Sandberg has spoken a number of times to Defense audiences. In April 2011, she was the keynote speaker for the Forrestal Lecture at the U.S. Naval Academy. In 2012, she met then-Commandant of the Marine Corps General James Amos and within six months, he made her book, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, required reading for Marine general officers. During her talk, Sheryl highlighted several areas that have limited the leadership opportunities for women in both the tech industry and the military. When she looks around her own workplace, she notices a paucity of women engineers and coders. This, of course, makes it very difficult for women to advance to the corporate suite. Similarly, in the military, women primarily are serving in the support fields, at least to some extent by self-selection and due to the fact that many of the combat operational positions have been officially closed to women. In today's military, a lack of combat leadership experience makes breaking the brass ceiling extremely difficult for servicewomen. Less diverse teams, she explained, are more sure of their ability, but more likely to make bad decisions (likely due to the rush toward groupthink). Therefore, increasing the number of women and opportunities for women in all industries in America is not just a matter of equal rights -- it is mission critical. Enterprises need diverse teams that are able to question assumptions and consider different viewpoints when building plans, whether they are for a new software rollout or a humanitarian operation. It is imperative, then, that women in these situations, Lean In. The women serving in the military since 9/11 have been doing just that. And since January 2013, when then Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta announced the repeal of the Combat Exclusion Rule, even more opportunities have opened up for servicewomen. An especially exciting development is that next week, several soldiers will become the first women to undergo Ranger training at Fort Benning, Georgia. Though, not all of the force seems supportive. The Associated Press reported that a recent survey found that men in U.S. special operations doubt the abilities of women to meet the demands of commando jobs. The survey respondents fear that the Pentagon's leaders are integrating women due to political pressure and that training standards (primarily physical) will erode. Having followed the developments on this topic for over a decade now, I gather that part of the confusion may arise from the frequent use of the term 'gender neutral' in many articles. This term leads people to believe that female accessions will be carbon copies of their male counterparts in the combat and special operations specialties. We've also heard many commanders and leaders say that things will remain 'exactly the same.' From my point of view, if women are mainstreamed properly, things will not be the same -- and that's a good thing. Women will come to the force with different life experiences and perceptions of the security landscape. These different viewpoints and approaches will enhance operational planning and execution. For example, as we have seen exhibited by the Female Engagement Teams in Afghanistan, servicewomen are able to exclusively build bonds with tribal women, which allow combatant commanders to receive a more comprehensive picture of the environment. In Africa, the treatment of school girls and kidnapping of women often serves as a precursor or early warning to coming civil wars and other situations of massive instability. Servicewomen in the most forward-deployed units will be key to engaging these segments of the local population and providing the Pentagon with a more complete picture of the security environment. Let's look at the alternative -- continuing to have a dearth of women in various positions in national security and government. Women are a rising force in groups such as ISIS. In fact, it is estimated that 20% of ISIS fighters are women; that is a higher percentage than women serving in the U.S. military. The low percentage of women in the service and in various occupational specialties creates a blind spot. Without a diverse workforce, it is difficult for our forces to analyze and understand the intentions of our adversaries. It is imperative and mission critical that our forces are as diverse as our country. So how do we accomplish this? The Pentagon is continuing to open occupational specialties to women throughout the year. Along with this, women need to encourage, mentor and challenge other women. Despite what hardships they may have experienced in their own careers, women should pull other women up with them, rather than paying the hardship forward. Men are also integral to the Lean In concept. Men should question their biases in the workplace and work to recognize, appreciate and reward the specific and unique contributions that women coworkers and leaders contribute. Under Sheryl's leadership, Facebook now has over one billion users globally. Defense leaders are wise to seek Sheryl's advice on building a winning team."
4,BUSINESS,Why Smaller Teams Are Better Than Larger Ones,"Jacob Morgan, ContributorAuthor, The Future of Work, Speaker, Futurist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-smaller-teams-are-bet_b_7069616.html,"This is going to be a two-part post.

In this first part, I want to share research that I have come across around why smaller teams are better than larger ones. In part two of this post, I will explore some strategies for how organizations can help make sure their teams avoid many of the traps mentioned below while keeping employees accountable, productive, and engaged. Let's get started.Jeff Bezos has a rule at Amazon -- or perhaps more aptly -- a philosophy. If a team cannot be fed by two pizzas then that team is too large. The reasoning is quite straight forward and basic. More people means more communication, more bureaucracy, more chaos, and more of pretty much everything that slows things down -- hence why large organizations are oftentimes pegged as being so inefficient. When I first heard about the ""two pizza rule,"" I thought it was a fascinating concept. So, I did more research on it and included it in my recent book on The Future of Work where I cited several pieces of research that I want to share with you here. As the title of this post suggests, smaller teams are indeed better than larger ones.EngagementIn 2013 Gallup released a report called ""The State of The American Workplace."" In it they found that smaller companies had more engaged employees. In fact, 42% of employees working at companies of 10 or fewer were engaged at work versus only 30% of employees at large companies. Now in this instance, these 10-person companies can easily be equivalent to 10-person teams.The Ringelmann EffectMost people are not familiar with the Ringelmann Effect, which is the tendency for individual members to become less productive as the size of a group increases. This concept was named after Maximilien Ringelmann, a French professor of agricultural engineering who passed away in 1931. In one of his experiments he asked volunteers to perform a very simple task -- to pull on a rope. He found that when only one person is pulling on the rope they give 100% of their effort. However, as more people are added the individual effort goes down.Social LoafingThis experiment was recreated in the 1970s by Alan Ingham who came up with the concept of ""social loafing,"" which helps us understand why the individual effort decreases as the team size increases. So why does this happen? Because it becomes harder to extract the individual contributions and performance of each person. So the individual rationale is ""I don't really need to pull as hard because other people are contributing and nobody will really know how hard I'm pulling anyway."" The same concept explains why many people don't vote, why bystanders don't take action when needed, or why some people within teams slack off.Relational LossEven further research by UC San Diego Professor Jennifer Mueller corroborates this. She introduced something called ""relational loss."" This concept describes how individuals feel as though the amount of support they get from others decreases as the size of the team increases. This is a very common feeling inside many organizations. How can one single manager possibly be responsible for evaluating and providing support to large groups of people? It's just possible.The LEGO StudyLast, but certainly not least, we have another study that was conducted by three professors from UCLA (Staats), Penn State (Milkman), and Chapel Hill (Fox). In the experiments that these professors ran, they utilized LEGO bricks and two teams comprised of either two people or four people. The goal was to see which team could put together a certain LEGO structure together. By now you shouldn't be surprised to know that the team comprised of two people accomplished the task in 36 minutes. Whereas, the team comprised of four people finished the task in 56 minutes.Organizations should really think about what their team structures look like, and I would encourage them to create and follow similar ""two pizza rules."" It's no coincidence that smaller organizations are oftentimes more nimble and agile while large organizations look like they are walking through sludge. In part two of this post, I'll explore what steps organizations should take to solve this problem.In the meantime, I'm curious to hear from you. How big is your team? Do you see issues with team dynamic and team size at your company?

What I am is a working mother of a 5-year-old boy.Recently, there was a study that came out that suggested that parenting time doesn't matter in a child's ultimate success in life. It didn't seem to add up to me, and while it seemed like a bit of a relief that the hours I spend away from my child aren't affecting him, I knew there was probably something wrong. The word ""Duh!"" comes to mind...Justin Wolfer, journalist for The New York Times dug deeper, and he found out what I had felt must be the case: The study is skewed, so you're not getting off the hook for spending time with your kid. (Nor do most parents want to, but we are tired, we are overworked, and we are burning it at both ends...)It got me thinking about the choices we have to make as parents, and how difficult it can sometimes be. Is spending time with my kiddo important? Absolutely, and for a long time I thought work-life balance meant that I work, and I leave time for my kid. But I've been learning more recently that there's a third part, that I think, we as parents are inclined to neglect... for the best possible reasons too -- because we love our kids so damn much. That third part is our own happiness. Outside of work and outside of being a parent, finding joy in our life that is not tied directly to our children. The reason, I believe, parents wanted the skewed study to be true comes from fear, and ultimately, guilt. I'm no exception... I have guilt for the business trips, for working and missing the karate classes, for.... not always being there. And that's before I even factor in taking any time for myself.So, I started thinking, what if we replace guilt with faith?  Faith that we can exist in a world where we work hard, take care of our kids but also take care of ourselves and trust that they will be ok. I put this out to friends, co-workers, anyone who would answer. I was immediately struck by how it resonated with so many people -- single dads, single moms, divorced couples, happily married folks. All of them with one thing in common: they want their kids to thrive, but they would love to have a life in the process, and all pretty much agree that they would be better parents if they did. One person I spoke with summed it up simply and beautifully:""The best gift i can give my child is showing him what a happy person looks like.""I'm reminded of the expression ""do what I say not what I do."" I want my child to grow up with a healthy sense that he matters in this world, so what would I be showing him if I didn't find a way to take care of myself, and show him that I matter as well? This is hard because we want to protect them... But kids are insightful -- they know if we are phoning it in. They know if we are faking it.  (Creating moments with my son: The Annual Easter Egg Hunt)So, how do we balance it all? Perhaps the question is better phrased like this:How do we give our kids the best of ourselves during the times that we are there?  To me, it's a matter of quality. It's so easy to be there without actually being present. We live in a world of distractions, cell phones, computers, and good lord even now our watches are becoming devices connected to the digital world, so it can be very difficult to unplug enough to be there. I believe that one hour of true quality time is better than four hours of half-assed, cell-phone-attached-to-my-hand time, so I try everyday to be mindful of this.It's about love.As I typed this article on a train from Boston to NYC, I saw a mother sitting with her 16-year-old son. I decided to break the rules of train travel and talk to the person across from me, so put the question to her that I had already put out to so many people, just to see what a complete stranger would say to me. Once she realized I wasn't a lunatic but was actually making pleasant conversation on Amtrak, she thought about it, and her response was brilliant. I believe is a fitting conclusion to this article.She said that while she was fortunate to have a job that kept her close to home for most of her kids lives, she believes that the most important thing a child can feel is loved, and the more of it the better. Parents are great, she said, but if you can ever get the whole ""it takes a village"" thing going for your kids, they will be surrounded by so much love that they will absolutely thrive. So maybe that's it. Maybe we need to, as a society pull together more, help each other, and in that, perhaps we can also thrive ourselves and give our kids the best gift we can give them: showing them what a happy person looks like."

She's committed to elevating the status of women, and others. She has terrific political skills, and often a political tin ear. And she's the frontrunner.Her campaign launch was smart and effective.

And it's helpful, but only if she's able to use it to move forward.Note that Mayor Bill called her and told her what he was doing before he did it. I'm not suggesting this was scripted, but all things are possible. Note also that this was a smart thing for de Blasio to do for his own reputation and influence. He's become the avatar of income inequality as a defining issue in the election. He was on Meet the Press. He's going to Iowa.There was a rush to condemn him by a variety of Clinton pipsqueaks and the New York Daily News (""Stabbed In The Back!!""). Relax fellas. Hillary has a set of real problems with voters and the best thing she can do is address them now, calmly and repeatedly. And Mayor Bill set the scene: ""We're still beginning to hear what she stands for. It's normal to want to hear more. And I look forward to that.""I could be wrong but watch for Hillary to roll out ideas, and make political gestures that respond to the de Blasio invitation.

This superintendent, in many cases, will have a doctorate in education and guidelines they must follow under statewide rules. They are usually hired by the board of education in the district and go under an annual review to make sure they are doing a good job. Why? Because superintendents deal with the well-being and education of lots of young people within their respective districts. Parents wouldn't have it any other way.Now, let's compare that to the youth sports scene in the same school district.Using my son-in-law Tim as an example, let me suggest a comparison to what goes on in the world of youth sports in Tim's community.First of all, Tim has never had any training in the area of youth development. As a matter of fact, he is a plumber by trade. Tim has an 8-year-old son who plays baseball and because Tim is a great guy, he has been elected by the board of directors in his son's league to be the league president. Mind you again that Tim has no experience in child development and only became part of the league because his son is playing baseball.In a game like baseball, as in other sports, there are all types of concerns that Tim will face such as safety; making sure that those coaching are doing so in the best interest of the kids; how to deal with injuries; addressing the needs of parents; the list goes on and on, which Tim will find out about in due time.Now, since the same kids go to the same school where Tim's youth league exists, the question is: Why is the superintendent who is dealing with these same children required to have a significant background in education and yet Tim has no requirement?The natural tendency is to say, ""This is just kids' sports. You can't begin to compare this with a kid going to school!""But I beg to differ. Whether we want to admit it or not, youth sports are really about education. Our organization says that sports are the outdoor classroom whereby young people are learning a host of life lesson and they are not always good lessons. Too often, instead of those lessons being about abiding by rules, they turn into ""it's okay to cheat, as long as we don't get caught."" Or instead of it being about perseverance and never giving up the lesson is, ""stay in there and play, I don't care how bad you are injured. Just shake it off!"" There have been national standards developed for youth sports leagues that give people like Tim guidelines to follow and adhere to so that sports leagues can be just as good an experience as going to school. Granted, Tim won't be as equipped as his local superintendent of schools but by Tim and his board of directors following the ""National Standards for Youth Sports"" the kids in his program might just have a much better education while in the ""outdoor classroom."""

After years of GOP attacks on the inheritance tax, also known as the estate tax, only a few thousand of the wealthiest families are subjected to it -- 4,700 total in 2013, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Only individual fortunes worth over $5.43 million can be taxed under current law, an amount that doubles to $10.86 million for wealthy couples. The Republican proposal would eliminate all of these estates -- which are over 15,700 percent richer than the median American household -- from taxation. Inheritance taxes are at the center of the policy debate over economic inequality. French economist Thomas Piketty has called for a global wealth tax to combat widening economic inequality based on unearned wealth passed between generations. But the Republican bill scheduled for a vote this week would move in the exact opposite direction, eliminating even the limited taxes on family capital that the United States currently deploys.""There has been a very aggressive lobbying campaign by some of the wealthiest families in the country for a couple of decades now,"" said Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning think tank. ""But this is more radical than other recent efforts.""No Democrats voted for the GOP bill, dubbed the Death Tax Repeal Act of 2015, in committee. And the legislation wouldn't just eliminate the estate tax -- it would also allow heirs to escape the already-generous capital gains tax on any stocks and real estate they receive. The change would significantly alter the meaning of the capital gains tax, since capital gains taxes only hit the wealthy when they actually sell an asset. Moguls could keep their wealth in the stock market and pass it down from generation to generation without ever being taxed.The result is an economic inequality double-whammy in which two of the most pro-rich elements of the tax code are further weakened, costing the federal government $269 billion over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.Half of all capital gains flow to the richest 0.1 percent of Americans, and they are taxed at just 20 percent, well below the 39.6 percent rate for ordinary income. But the estate tax is even more regressive, applying to just 0.2 percent of estates a year, at an average effective rate of less than 17 percent, since millions of dollars of the inheritance are exempted from the formal 40 percent rate.Federal inheritance taxes used to be broader. In the 1970s, according to the JCT, about 6 percent of all estates were subject to the estate tax. During the Great Depression, the rate on the estate tax was 70 percent. But the Republican campaign against it went into overdrive in the 1990s and hasn't let up, even in the Obama era. Conservatives routinely make a moral argument against what they call ""the death tax,"" saying it is unfair to tax a family just because one if its members has died. Economists point out that shielding unearned inheritances from tax doesn't encourage any useful activity, and Democrats have typically opposed efforts to chip away at the estate tax. But they have allowed a host of Republican efforts to go through in broad bipartisan deals. In 1997, President Bill Clinton's budget secured child health care funding in exchange for a GOP item narrowing the estate tax to exclude a host of wealthy families. In late 2010 and again in the 2013 fiscal cliff deal, Democrats included generous inheritance tax measures into a bargain with Republicans.The GOP has more than enough votes in the House to pass its latest proposal. But the legislation would likely succumb to a Democratic filibuster in the Senate or to a presidential veto. But while the bill has almost no chance of passing on its own, it could spur lawmakers to include a new break for the super-rich in must-pass legislation later this year, when Congress will need to raise the debt ceiling or fund the government, particularly if the GOP is able to peel off a few dozen conservative Democrats to vote in favor of this week's bill.

I loved being a research analyst but once I drifted up into senior management (eventually as Head of Equities in Europe for Lehman Brothers), I became part of the world that I didn't find especially comfortable. Research analysis was meritocratic -- being a manager at an aggressive investment bank was anything but. At the same time, I was getting to an age where existential questions began to feature and my four children were getting to an age where their questions about ""the meaning of life?"" became increasingly challenging. When you are dispensing moral messages aplenty, but work in an environment that is morally uncomfortable, your kids notice this disconnect; I was unwilling or unable to live such a bifurcated life. I felt the work I did needed to be something that was consistent with my values and would make my kids proud. It took me a while to figure out what to do.Fortunately three simultaneous roles helped clarify things. I consulted at a world-leading investment bank, and I was Chair of one of the country's largest charities and also Chair of Justgiving. Let's just say that I found the first two dispiriting. I realized the City and I were finished with each other, and that the governance issues at the charity raised questions. On the other hand, Justgiving was inspiring as a well-run business that was creating value for shareholders and customers. At the same time, it was generating enormous social impact (well over $3 billion in charitable donations has been facilitated through the website, making it the world's largest player). It became obvious to me that doing well and doing good were not mutually exclusive - and my life's mission became how to use my skills to ""create 100 JustGivings"". This was the genesis of ClearlySo.ClearlySo is an unusual investment bank, which only raises capital for businesses with a high social or environmental impact. It does so from 700+ European institutional investors and the U.K.'s largest network of HNWIs. The businesses we assist range from early stage growth ventures looking for as little as £100,000 up to mature businesses and charities seeking £20 million or more. In addition, we are a placement agent raising tens of millions for impact investment funds. We have helped 50+ organizations; they have raised about £70 million in transactions in which we have assisted.Putting the money to the side, what really gets me out of bed is the amazing work that is enabled by the capital we help to find. I am often moved to tears when hearing of the beneficiaries of the work our clients do - they all change lives for the better. Aduna's superfood products, for example, create sustainable livelihoods for farmers in sub-Saharan Africa, while Framework's innovative homelessness intervention models help some of the most vulnerable in society. What could possibly be more inspiring work? What's unique about us is that we seek to bring impact into all investing. I don't see impact investment as a niche, but rather a way for all investment to be a force for good. Whereas others talk about an ""asset class"", I see social (and environmental) impact as the third dimension to all investing, alongside financial return and risk.Our industry is booming as financial institutions and their clients begin to analyze and assess the impact of all their investments and seek financial instruments which explicitly take that into account. We are at the forefront of this movement and see ourselves operating at the edge between impact investing and mainstream pools of capital.Looking back 10 or 20 years from now, ClearlySo will be successful if we do not need to exist. In such a world, it would be perverse not to consider the social, ethical and environmental impacts of all investments, and investors will be making conscious allocations on these three dimensions. I also believe that in the years ahead the negative and positive impacts (""externalities"") of organizations will be ""internalized""; if you cause society pain, you pay the full price of that pain, and if what you do benefits society, you secure a large portion of that benefit. Under such a system we would all be better off; if I were Prime Minister I would implement this tomorrow.These are some of the themes explored and celebrated by UK based social enterprise Pioneers for Change.

Here are the top five-and-a-half takeaways from a record-breaking Augusta weekend: 1. Youth movement. At 21 years young, Spieth is now the No. 2 ranked golfer in the world, behind 25-year-old Rory McIlroy. In a game stereotypically reserved for stuffy old guys wearing goofy pants, there's a movement to a younger and more athletic player. The business world is in the midst of a similar trend -- young guns are coming into the office with a technological advantage, increasingly becoming business leaders. Rather than view them as the competition, see what you glean from their perspective. 2. Everyone loves a comeback. It's not just the young guns playing well. The ageless Phil Mickelson looked very sharp, finishing in second place, and even the much-maligned Tiger Woods was in the mix over the weekend. Slumps happen in the professional world just as they do in sports, but thankfully, we don't have to go through our slumps on national TV. If you're in a funk, keep at it and channel your inner-Phil.3. It's hard to be on top. Since the Masters began in 1934, only five players have won the tournament wire-to-wire. This makes Spieth's feat even more impressive and it reminds us that being on top is tough, but staying on top when everyone is gunning for you is even tougher. Kodak used to rule the photography world, AOL used to be king of the internet, and if you look back between 1880 and 1960, Sears was the top retailer. It's hard to stay in first place, and when everyone is trying to take you down, it requires laser-like focus.4. If you have a good plan, stick to it. Last year, Spieth was runner-up to Bubba Watson; in the interview after the tournament, he was asked if he was disappointed. His response was surprising. He indicated that he wasn't discouraged because the runner-up finish showed that his plan was working. So if you aren't getting the results you are looking for but believe you have a good plan, hang in there. You just might be the champion next year. 5. Execute the things you're supposed to. Some other golfers looked better than Spieth at moments. In fact, Dustin Johnson had a Masters record three eagles in one round. But he mixed in plenty of bogeys and finished in sixth place. Spieth may not have had the top highlights of the week, but he was steady and made the putts he needed to make. If you do things you're supposed to do in the professional world, you increase your chances for success greatly.And five-and-a-half: Look good wearing green. If you win the Masters, your reward is a hideous jacket, so be ready to win and wear something that complements green!Jack Stahlmann is a corporate speaker and Huffington Post blogger.

Last weekend Wacker discussed his book at the Cushwa Center of the University of Notre Dame with a crowded, hall-full of historians of American Christianity who have been invited to enjoy the hospitality of that Center for now three decades.Wacker's book was critiqued by Richard Bushman, expert on Mormonism and much more, and Christian Smith, a sociologist who strains beyond the disciplinary confines of his field. Both were laudatory, and, after three hours of my note-taking, I find that I (almost) never heard a disparaging word, though questions were apt and expertly handled by the panel of three.Some seasons ago we historians enjoyed a dry-run or preview of the book at the Billy Graham Center at Wheaton College in Illinois, the evangelist's alma mater. There and then many participants talked about how their students, even at evangelical-rooted colleges (including Wheaton), have a hard time locating and relating to much of Grahamism.Graham, now far into his nineties and afflicted by Parkinson's disease, cannot participate in book-related events, but, humble though he is -- according to all accounts which were heard at Notre Dame -- he could take justifiable pride in the record of his achievements as ""America's Pastor.""This is not a review of the rich, 400-paged, hyper-indexed Wacker book, but an attempt in a brief space to locate him. The author is by no means uncritical, but he did not need to blame or praise Graham, whose stature and record among America's religious leaders have been much appraised and appreciated. (The more critical assessments from early in the evangelist's career are remembered, but are not focal or newsworthy any more.)Wacker told us of letters to Graham in his prime, delivered weekly by the semi-truck full, or when Madison Square Garden was overflowing nightly during the 1957 ""Crusade."" Certainly, no other Christian figure has been heard by as many people and potential converts as has Graham, who led rallies in ninety nations.The friend of U.S. Presidents, the intentionally non-political preacher was inevitably drawn into politics, and is remembered there for a mixed record, e.g. in the ""social justice"" areas.Now: how would I frame him? More and more I would locate his years as one episode in the long career of episodic American religious phenomena. At Notre Dame no one could come up with the name of a true potential successor, and most agreed that his legacy is mixed.But they also saw Graham as a leader in a revival that came and went.In its peak years foes and friends alike planned strategies in light of where Grahamism might go. Some thought his version of Christian gathering and activity was becoming and would remain normative. But that was in the 1950s, and the episode was replaced during the fabled ""1960s"" and ever since. As implied here, Graham once belonged to the public, but now he belongs to the historians and sociologists.That should surprise no one and does not detract from his legacy. It merely shows that the moment and movement that he enjoyed and fashioned, or which in many ways fashioned him is now past, thanks to cultural shifts.Several commentators, led by Wacker, stressed that changes in family structure and ethos during and after the 1960s helped form our current ""episode"" with its declining religious participation and favor, and with its polarization in theology, politics, and practice. All of these changes make it hard to conceive of any forthcoming ""America's Pastor"" or a flock for one.That does not mean that religion as such will fade and its record will only show ""decline."" But it calls for new assessments, strategies, and for the religious, new resourcing in the reservoirs of hope--which, in his ""episode""--Graham drew upon and, remarkably, fed.Sources:Wacker, Grant.

One year on, the majority remain in captivity.The abduction of women and girls are among crimes - including crimes against humanity and war crimes - documented by Amnesty researchers, who interviewed nearly 200 people, including 28 women and girls who had escaped their captors.Boko Haram fighters have killed thousands of people in their six-year bid to create an Islamist caliphate in northeastern Nigeria.""Men and women, boys and girls, Christians and Muslims, have been killed, abducted and brutalized by Boko Haram during a reign of terror which has affected millions,"" said Salil Shetty, Amnesty International's secretary general.""Recent military successes might spell the beginning of the end for Boko Haram, but there is a huge amount to be done to protect civilians, resolve the humanitarian crisis and begin the healing process.""Aisha, aged 19, told researchers she was abducted from a friend's wedding in September along with her sister, the bride and the bride's sister.She was repeatedly gang raped, trained to fight and forced to take part in an attack against her home village. She saw Boko Haram kill her sister and about 50 others.""Some of them refused to convert, some refused to learn how to kill others,"" she told Amnesty.Amnesty also gathered reports of widespread abuses of people living in areas under Boko Haram's control.Hundreds of men and boys have been forcibly recruited since the start of 2014, Amnesty said.The number of forced recruits rose when Boko Haram began losing public support, after its campaign for an Islamist state in northern Nigeria became increasingly violent, following the death of its leader Mohammed Yusuf in police custody in 2009.Many men who refuse to join Boko Haram's ranks have been killed. Two young men told researchers that at least 100 were executed in one day in December when the armed group took over Madagali town, near the border with Cameroon. They survived because the killers' knives had become too blunt to slit more throats.One 15-year-old boy from Bama town in Borno state described how children were forced to stone people accused of adultery to death.""These appalling executions, the sexual violence, the recruitment of child soldiers, these are war crimes and crimes against humanity and they need to be investigated (by the Nigerian authorities),"" Daniel Eyre, author of the report, said in an interview.""It's clear that the extent of destruction by Boko Haram and the toll it has taken on the civilian population is huge, so the kind of investment that's needed to rehabilitate communities is enormous,"" he added.Nigerian, Chadian and Niger forces have driven militants out of a string of towns in simultaneous offensives over the past few weeks.More than 3.5 million people in Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and Chad have been affected by the insurgency, and face months of food shortages as a result, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network said last month.About 800,000 children have been forced to flee fighting, according to the United Nations children's fund.
