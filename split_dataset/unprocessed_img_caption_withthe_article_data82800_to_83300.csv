What should we do if a person is angry or a large group of voters is angry and frustrated? Call that person names, tell them they shouldn't be angry, ignore it?Observing the last few weeks, especially the rise of Donald Trump, and to some degree Sen. Bernie Sanders, made me cognizant of the brewing anger and distrust that exists in America today. And made me pause and wonder about the questions posed above, and what to do with the anger and distrust that resides in a large part of the American public whether it be Republican, Democrat or independent. This anger is about race, inequalities at many levels, being forgotten, war, loss of opportunity and hope, or being lied to too many times.Anger isn't bad in and of itself. It is just a feeling, not a moral position. Jesus was angry as He turned the tables over in the temple. Gandhi was angry at injustice around the world and especially in India. Martin Luther King Jr. was angry about the unfulfilled promise of America. The question becomes what to do with that anger in ourselves, and how to respond to anger in others.There are really three options to choose from as regards our own or someone else's anger. As with all things in politics, it plays out always in the lessons we learn in relationships. Politics is nothing but a broader and more public manifestation of what we learn in private and the intimate circles of our life. For personal and political, there are three ways we can approach anger in our relationships and deal with it.One, we can ignore the anger that bubbles up in ourselves or another and not try to understand it. We can look at it as crazy (Sen. John McCain's philosophy in calling Trump supporters ""crazies"" or what some people do in relationships by ""gaslighting"" others), and attempt to disregard it as inappropriate or wrong. This basically puts us in a place of denial, and is definitely not a path for success of our own growth or leading others. By ignoring, downplaying, denying or not understanding the anger this leads us on a movement towards disintegration or disconnection from our own hearts or the heart of another. Many partisans have made this mistake, as well as many in the media, by not trying to understand this anger and give it some validity. They underestimate the undercurrent of frustration and anger that exists in our country today.The second choice of dealing with anger is to tap into its incredible force, but only use it as a plaything for our amusement or to get what we want. This way is just venting this anger outward in ways that are destructive or don't bring us closer to the life we want to live or the kind of country we want to live in. In this mode, anger is used to make a bad situation worse, or it appeals to our darker angels, and divides rather than unites. In this place we seek to find enemies at whom to vent our anger -- pointing fingers and casting blame. We have had many political figures in our history who did this and weren't helpful for our country. Donald Trump falls into this category of using anger destructively for his benefit, rather than constructively for the country's benefit.And the third option, which is where leaders fall -- whether in our intimate circles or in the country as a whole -- is understanding someone's anger, meeting them there, and then channeling that anger in a constructive manner. By leading in the midst of anger in a positive way is where all reform and change has come from. This route is by connecting with an angry person or an angry group so they feel understood, and then appealing to their better angels and using that anger for good. The abolition of slavery, the civil rights movement, the movement surrounding the Special Olympics, peace movements, and the American Revolution all had anger as a big component of the demand for change and assistance for a neglected group of people. This anger moved towards a positive outcome with the help of leaders who understood its power in achieving good. And in the case of our founding fathers and mothers, instead of destroying a country they built a new one the world had never seen before based on principles of liberty, freedom, and compassion.If you want to be successful as a leader today in your homes or at the White House, you must come to terms with this anger and figure out ways to move it in a direction of good. Leadership is about understanding the place many are at today, and figuring out a way to achieve a higher and laudable purpose. Don't deny the anger, name-call people who are angry as crazy, play with anger for your own gain, make the situation worse by fomenting anger. Be a leader, and accept that anger, and then use it as a creative powerful instrument in doing good in this world. And like the peace movements, use anger to stop wars, and not start them.There you have it.Matthew Dowd is an ABC News analyst and special correspondent.

While Disick was busy playing host at 1Oak, Kardashian was clearly having a more low key night at home, watching ""Scooby-Doo"" with her son.

Lorenzo Davis, an Independent Police Review Authority supervisor who was fired this month, said Chief Administrator Scott Ando asked him to change his findings in three police shootings in which he had determined officers committed wrongdoing.The authority was formed in 2007 amid mounting frustration with the city’s handling of police misconduct cases. The agency, independent from the police department and staffed by civilians, handles all allegations of misconduct against officers.Davis said the authority is failing its mission to maintain “the highest level of integrity while conducting objective, thorough investigations, striving to reach a sound and just conclusion.” “The Independent Police Review Authority is being used to deflect protest and criticism from the police department,” Davis told The Huffington Post. “What they’re concerned about is the careers of the police officers.”  Ando and the authority denied Davis’ claims.“No one at IPRA has ever been asked to change their findings,” Ando said in a statement to WBEZ, which first reported on Davis’ termination. Shortly before he was fired, a performance evaluation said Davis “resists making requested changes as directed by management in order to reflect the correct finding with respect to [officer-involved shootings],"" the Chicago radio station reported.Of several hundred police shooting cases the IRPA has reviewed since its creation, only a few were found unjustified, the Chicago Reader reports. The agency recommended firing a cop involved in a shooting for the first time ever last month, according to the news site. In that case, Officer Francisco Perez, working security while off duty, witnessed a drive-by shooting and then fired at the wrong car 16 times. Davis said that during his seven years at the agency, he and his team submitted findings on 13 police shootings, and found six of those unjustified.According to Davis, three of those cases have not been completed by Ando and one has been assigned to a new supervisor and investigator. In the remaining two cases, Davis said Ando disagreed with the findings. Davis alleged he was told to change findings to exonerate officers in at least three investigations, which he said he resisted. He said he could not discuss specifics of each case, as they are considered confidential. Davis started at IPRA in 2008. He supervised a team of five investigators when he was fired. Previously, he was a Chicago police officer for two decades.Davis said he has no bias against cops, as his recent performance review alleged. He said part of IPRA's problem is that it’s run by people who worked in law enforcement for most of their careers, instead of civilians without strong ties to police.“The problem is the people at the top. The problem is the administration,” Davis said. “Why are they justifying all these hundreds of police shootings and finding none of them to be not justified? Either that’s what they’ve been told to do, or that’s their mentality.”In a statement emailed to The Huffington Post, Ando said supervisors had determined that some of Davis' investigations were incomplete. As a matter of policy, they requested he review the cases and ""include all available evidence"" in his findings.Ando said that Davis didn't include all available evidence in a number of cases, some of which ""were built on assumptions.""“In some cases Mr. Davis rejected the recommendations of his subordinates and told them to change their recommendations,"" he added.   Davis insisted he had completed the investigative work in the cases Ando said were ""incomplete."" Officer-involved shootings can take a long time to investigate -- sometimes more than three years -- because of their complexities. But Davis said some cases were intentionally delayed. “Many [police shooting investigations] are held up by the administration,” he said. “Particularly [with] cases that should be ‘not justified’ or sustained, they just don’t want to deal with them, so they hold onto them for months trying to decide what to do.”  Civil rights attorney Jeffrey Granich represents two people who allege police used excessive force arresting them. Within 48 hours of the arrest, Granich said, IPRA had taken statements from both his clients. As of this month -- almost two years since the arrests -- authority investigators had not interviewed the accused officers, Granich said. “This is the problem with IPRA,"" Granich said. ""They take audiotaped statements of complainants and witnesses basically to be used against them later at trial ... and they don’t interview the cops. They're just an arm against the city to hurt people bringing complaints.""IPRA has been criticized before for delays. The Chicago Tribune reported that IPRA took more than five years to file excessive force charges and recommend the firing of an officer who allegedly cracked a man in the head with his baton in 2012. The case was dismissed in 2012 because the statute of limitations had expired. Ando noted that IPRA has sustained 20 percent of the complaints against police this year, a record, compared with 13 percent in 2014. IPRA’s investigative process had led to prosecutorial action against several officers, he said, including Dante Servin, who in April was found not guilty in the fatal shooting of Rekia Boyd, and Glenn Evans, who faces trial next month on charges he put his gun in a suspect’s mouth. IPRA’s spokesman didn't immediately respond to questions about its handling of Davis’ investigations.Granich said IPRA sustained a complaint against an officer his clients accused of misconduct, which may help in their defense. But his opinion of the authority remains overwhelmingly negative.“It’s like a clock that’s broken. Two times a day it’ll be right,” Granich said. “IPRA is part of the systemic culture in Chicago of not investigating the police and making sure that the police are not held accountable.”"

Chris Christie (R) got into a heated exchange with an activist over gun control in Iowa on Saturday.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55b3edfc1400002e002e0bd8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ANKENY, Iowa -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) got into a heated exchange with a skeptical voter who accused the presidential candidate of being “anti-gun” during a town hall on Saturday, citing New Jersey’s tough gun control laws.Responding to the man, who did not identify himself but mentioned he was part of the Iowa Gun Owners organization, Christie defended his record, refuting every claim the voter mentioned, and, at times, even raising his voice. “Come up with one fact that shows one thing I’ve done as governor in New Jersey that’s done anything, anything not to support the rights of legal gun owners,” Christie said as the crowd gathered inside a local community college auto body shop erupted in applause. “Don’t come in front of this group of people and lie about my record, which is what you did.” The voter accused Christie of proposing to ban .50-caliber rifles, requiring a government-issued ID for every firearms purchase and setting up a statewide firearms registry of guns and gun owners. Christie responded harshly, holding true to the theme of his campaign, “Telling it like it is.”“I don’t know where you’re getting your information from, but your information is wrong,” Christie told the man.Christie noted that he vetoed the .50-caliber ban, the statewide ID system and the law that was passed to reduce magazine sizes from 15 to 10.The man in the crowd then asked if Christie is planning on pardoning Brian Fletcher, a North Carolina man who is facing prison time after telling a police officer in New Jersey that he had a gun in his vehicle, which is the customary and legal thing to do in his home state. Christie said he hasn’t made a decision yet, but is reviewing the situation.“I’m not going to make that decision in 15 minutes nor should I. Nor should you want me to,” Christie said. “I see you shrugging your shoulders, why are you shrugging your shoulders about? You have your point of view, but have some facts about it.”The confrontation lasted over five minutes, as others in the crowd seemed to shift uncomfortably in their seats. The voter brought up an ad that ran in 1995, which shows Christie criticizing his opponent for wanting to repeal the assault weapons ban in New Jersey. Christie pointed out that his views have changed over the last 20 years.“If you haven’t changed your mind once in 20 years on any issue, then I’ll tell you, you’re not a thinking, breathing, living human being,” Christie said as the crowd applauded. “If you want to debate me, come to the top 10, run for president and come to Cleveland on Aug. 6, and I’ll happily debate you,” he added.In Iowa, Christie’s favorability ratings are under water. A recent poll of Iowa caucus-goers shows 45 percent of registered Iowa voters have negative feelings about Christie, while only 24 percent view him favorably. At the town hall, Christie continued to blame New Jersey’s Democratic-controlled legislature for anti-gun measures occurring in his state.“As governor and as president, you’re not an emperor or dictator,” Christie said. “You want better gun laws, elect a Republican legislature, and these laws will be changed.” Watch the video above."

Today, we speak with author Fred Abrahams about politics and the past in Albania.While it may be little known to many in the West, Albania is a country with a unique and tragic history. Under a brutal communist dictatorship for much of the 20th century, it was almost completely cut off from the world until the regime finally began to deteriorate when the Berlin Wall fell.After thousands of Albanians stormed foreign embassies in 1990 to seek asylum during the breakup of the Soviet Union, the western Balkan nation's government began to create a path to elections.Albania's transition to democracy is a case study in the successes and failures of a country emerging from years of isolation. Now, as a candidate for the European Union, the nation still faces immense challenges left over from a legacy of repression and hardship. In his new book, Modern Albania, author and Human Rights Watch special advisor Fred Abrahams details the country's struggle and drive for change. The WorldPost spoke with Abrahams about his research into a fascinating transition that is still continuing today.How repressive was Albania's government before it broke with communism?Well, it’s difficult to imagine a country being more repressive. I think North Koreans would feel at home there; probably Russians in the darkest days of Stalin would feel familiarities with communist Albania, but almost no one else.It was totally isolated from the outside world. Almost nobody got into Albania as a visitor. Almost no one except for the most trusted party elite got out of Albania, and [the Party of Labor of Albania] ruled with fierce discipline and control. I say party, but actually what was unique about Albania was that it was really just one man. The dictator of Albania was a guy called Enver Hoxha, whose rule was unbroken from World War II until his death in 1985, and who tolerated no dissent. The slightest indiscretion or divergence from his ideology would land you and your family in prison. I believe you’ve mentioned that it could be things as minor as playing The Beatles?Exactly, very minor acts could condemn you and your whole family to lifelong internal exile or prison.Listening to forbidden music like The Beatles, for instance, or trying to watch television from neighboring Italy, Greece or Yugoslavia. As a result, there was a state of fear and a near total lack of dissidents.Was there a Stalinist-style cult of personality around Hoxha?The cult of personality around Enver Hoxha was intense, cultivated and craftily implemented. He was the guiding light, the Big Brother. They called him “Uncle Enver.”People viewed him as this patriarchal figure, who, in his wisdom and benevolence, would guide Albania out of poverty and into modernity. His image was on every wall, his speeches were cited in every article and his name was literally engraved into mountainsides.Following the fall of communism, how would you describe Albania’s transition from a fully closed society to a somewhat open democracy?It’s been chaotic, ad hoc and at times violent -- but also moving towards more openness. Albania is a far better place today than it was before. It’s a place now where people can more or less express their opinions, [and have] freedom of religion and freedom of speech. You can’t compare the Albania of today to that of [the communist era], but after suffering almost five decades of dictatorship, democracy is not easily built. One of the huge mistakes from Western policy was believing democracy comes with elections and free market reform, and Albania is a case study of that not being true. Democracy comes from democratic institutions anddemocratic culture, and those are two things lacking in Albania today.What role has U.S. policy played in Albania’s transition to democracy?The U.S. played a huge role; it's the most significant foreign power by far in Albania’s transition. After the Cold War, Albanians, in their rejection of communism, swung quickly in the other direction and embraced the United States. The most important thing for an Albanian leader is to visit the White House. It’s the biggest popularity boost you could ever get back home.So the relationship is very strong, but the U.S. role in Albania has been mixed. One of the key criticisms throughout my book is how the U.S. fixated on individual leaders in Albania and not on the institutions.Especially in the first years, U.S. policy supported the new so-called democratic leader, this guy named Sali Berisha. He spoke English, he said the right things in English, he was determined to destroy the legacy of communism, and the Americans supported him 110 percent.But this was a nasty guy who tolerated no criticism, imprisoned journalists, beat up opposition members and kept a fierce control. The U.S. turned a blind eye to all of that in those days, because he was their guy.I interviewed a lot of U.S. officials from that time, and they said, ""What do you expect from a country that is emerging from dictatorship?""I think that was a huge mistake, because U.S. leverage in Albania was very strong and they could have still supported Berisha, but drawn lines to constrain his power. The U.S. failed to do that, and Albania is still suffering from that mistake today.What are some of the problems that still plague Albania?Probably the biggest single problem is the lack of institutions -- the pillars of a society that provide services, and check and balance each other.It’s the judiciary, it’s the media, it’s the police and secret police that should all operate based on the law instead of serving a political power. Albania today is also still terribly corrupt, both on a petty level and also on a larger level. The connections between business and politics are still very high, and that’s the big challenge for [the country] to move forward and join the EU.Is there anything that you wish people knew about Albania in general? The main thing would be how difficult the history of this country has been. The communist period is the most recent black mark, but prior to that, there was terrible suffering and a legacy of occupation. These are people who have had a rough go of it, and are trying to emerge from all of that tumultuous history.They were in the icebox of history for five decades, and it's still thawing. The interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.More from The WorldPost's Weekly Interview Series:- Is Al Qaeda In Decline?- Anguish In Argentina After Prosecutor's Mysterious Death- Could The New Syriza Government Be Good For Greece's Economy?- Other Countries Change Their Gun Laws After Mass Shootings.

Being gay is illegal in Kenya.Asked about the status of LGBT Kenyans on Saturday, Obama did not hesitate to speak out in favor of equality.""I believe in the principle of treating people equally under the law, and that they are deserving of equal protection under the law and that the state should not discriminate against people based on their sexual orientation,"" Obama said.""I'm unequivocal on this,"" he continued. ""If somebody is a law-abiding citizen who is going about their business and working in a job and obeying the traffic signs and doing all the other things that all citizens are supposed to do, and not harming anybody, the idea that they are gonna be treated differently or abused because of who they love is wrong, full stop.""Obama also warned that when one group is denied equal rights by a government, others can be affected as well.""When a government gets in the habit of treating people differently, those habits can spread. And as an African-American in the United States, I am painfully aware of what happens when people are treated differently under the law,"" Obama said. ""All sorts of rationalizations that were provided by the power structure for decades in the United States for segregation and Jim Crow and slavery and they were wrong.""Kenyatta seemed unmoved by Obama's comments, saying that LGBT equality was not a priority for most Kenyans right now and that it was not a value shared with the United States.""There are some things that we must admit we don't share.

""This is why I repeatedly say that for Kenyans today, the issue of gay rights is really a non-issue.

CALL FOR CLEAR SOLUTIONOne of Tsipras' closest aides said that the understanding with the opposition parties could not last long and a clear solution was needed, underlining widespread expectations that new elections may come as soon as September or October.""The country cannot go on with a minority government for long. We need clear, strong solutions,"" State Minister Nikos Pappas told the weekly Ependysi in an interview published on Saturday.Apart from the terms of a new loan, Greece and its lenders are also expected to discuss the sustainability of its debt, which is around 170 percent of GDP. Greece has repeatedly asked for a debt relief and the IMF has said this is needed for the Greek accord to be viable.European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis told Italy's La Stampa daily in an interview that a recent analysis on the issue ""justified some concerns."" He added a Greek exit from the euro was ""certainly out of the question now.""Tsipras, who is by far the most popular politician in Greece according to opinion polls, has said his priority is to secure the bailout package before dealing with the political fallout from the Syriza party rebellion.According to a poll by Metron Analysis for Parapolitika newspaper on Saturday, 61 percent of Greeks had a positive view of Tsipras against 36 percent who disapproved. An overwhelming majority - 78 percent - still wanted Greece to stay in the euro zone against 19 percent in favor of going back to the drachma.Tsipras insists there is no viable alternative to the bailout but has been wary of striking out against his party opponents in a bid to keep it together, at least while talks proceed.Flabouraris called on Syriza rebels to drop their opposition.""They are still my comrades and I urge them to get back to their senses even at the last moment,"" he told Skai television. ""They should realize that the Left movement is now in power. It's not an opposition party. Now we have to discuss the new landscape.""

Needless to say, his unsolicited advice to a religion of 1.6 billion people didn't sit well with many.""Change must come from within our global Muslim society,"" British philanthropist Yasmin Choudry responded on Twitter.Others challenged Dawkins for what they saw as his patronizing tone. Muslim women have ""been through this before,"" Hind Makki, a well-known Muslim blogger, told The Huffington Post.""When Europe began colonizing Muslim lands at the turn of the 20th century, we were told by white European men that their dismantling of our religious, economic, cultural, and political systems were for our own good -- that we Muslim women needed saving from Muslim men, by Christian European men.""Makki's response to such outreach? ""No thanks,"" she said.Muslim activist Linda Sarsour said she was ""tired of non-Muslims commenting on what Islam is or isn't."" She added: ""As a Muslim woman, I have the agency to tell you that Islam is a feminist religion and informs my role and positions on women's rights issues. I am a feminist because I am Muslim."" Dawkins stood by his earlier tweet, writing:Though the sentiment Dawkins expressed on Twitter Thursday may come from a good place, his argument ignores the fact that many Muslim women choose to wear the hijab and other forms of coverings -- and feel empowered doing so. And as Sarsour mentioned, countless Muslim women and men are already working for women's rights and challenging stereotypes that are too-often perpetuated in the media.Dawkins pointed to child marriage, female genital mutilation and other atrocities in some countries as evidence of Islam's inherent bias against women.He may want to revisit Reza Aslan's explanation of why it's problematic to make generalizations about ""the Muslim world"":Women's rights is an issue that governments, religious institutions, and communities the world over must address, and there is certainly a long way to go. But by pointing the finger at one religion, Dawkins seems to suggest that the rest of the world has figured out women's equality -- which it very much has not.

Noble idea. Flawed logic.We can't and we won't, despite the fact that there are claims Australia ""in some ways shares the United States' frontier mentality and history"" since it was also ruled by Great Britain. But what happened there after a decade of gun violence left 100 people dead couldn't possibly happen here, even though it's resulted in a decline in suicides and a possible decline in murders (analysts dispute the results). Australia's reform was radical: ""The law banned semi-automatic and automatic rifles and shotguns. It also instituted a mandatory buy-back program for newly banned weapons."" Does anyone see a U.S. buyback of millions of guns ever happening?Serious gun control efforts in the U.S. are doomed and always have been -- and not just because of the power of the NRA or because of the Second Amendment. Guns are so enmeshed in American history, so much a part of our cultural DNA, that there will never be truly meaningful gun control in the U.S. Advocates of gun control don't seem to understand that and don't seem to appreciate the continuing, cross-generational impact of our founding national story.One main reason we rebelled against the British was their attempt to take away our guns. In 1774, the British only had 2,000 troops in heavily-armed and seething Boston, and the British response was to take control of the powder house, which meant that Bostonians wouldn't be able to use their guns. The British also started searching for guns and ammunition without warrants. And to suppress a rebellion against their rule, the British effectively began embargoing exportation of guns and ammunition to the Colonies.The very first battles at Lexington and Concord between Americans and the British took place because British troops were coming to seize an American arms cache. So there you see guns galvanizing us before we had a flag, a Declaration of Independence, a government, a national anthem, before we had anything that truly united us. Guns, and holding on to our guns.Every time there's a mass shooting like the one in the Louisiana movie theater, we see news conferences and petitions and TV panels and pinion pieces engaged in soul-searching -- but repeated efforts at gun control have failed miserably for decades and they'll keep failing no matter how much anguish we suffer. Citing gun control in other countries like Australia is pointless, because no other country has our unique history with guns and what they inescapably mean to us. Tragedies like the one this past week in Louisiana will keep happening, and so will the laments about the need for change -- but our history can't be re-written.Lev Raphael is the author of 25 books in many genres which you can find on Amazon and B&N."
