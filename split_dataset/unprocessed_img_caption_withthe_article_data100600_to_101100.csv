A Swedish mosque was “lovebombed” this week, after residents learned that it had become a target for Islamaphobes.The front door of a mosque in Uppsala in eastern Sweden was covered in colorful paper hearts Friday as Swedes across the country rallied to show solidarity with their Muslim brothers and sisters.On Thursday, that same Uppsala mosque was hit by a Molotov cocktail. A racist message was also scrawled on its walls. No one was injured, according to The Local. Police are still searching for suspects.The incident marked the third time such an attack against a mosque took place between Christmas and New Year’s. The Christmas Day attack in Eskilstuna left five people injured.Omar Mustafa, chairman of the Islamic Association in Sweden, told the Swedish news agency TT that Uppsala’s mosque isn’t the only one to get ""lovebombed"" in the wake of the attacks. ""Each time there has been an attack, the same mosque has then received a kind of 'love bomb' where people have shown their support and sympathy,” Mustafa said in a translation provided by Radio Sweden. “A large part of the population is strongly against this type of attacks and tomorrow we will gather these good forces.”Thousands of Swedes took part in solidarity marches in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö on Friday to protest the desecration of the sacred spaces, according to Al Jazeera.They joined together under the slogan “Don’t Touch My Mosque.”Ardalan Shekarabi, Sweden's minister for public administration, said that the country needed this kind of outreach.“We’re seeing a wave of Islamophobic propaganda. It’s obvious that we have to take a stand against Islamophobia and for the equal value of every person. All people, no matter what their faith, should feel safe in Sweden,” the politician told Radio Sweden."

Pending this, we are surprised and perplexed as to why there should be any controversy about the respective leadership roles of Dr. Marin Luther King, Jr. and President Lyndon B. Johnson concerning the events in Selma, Alabama, January though March of 1965. Then again, we remember the charges and countercharges between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama during the South Carolina Democratic primary presidential campaigns of 2008.""Dr. King's dream began to be realized when President Johnson passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964,"" Senator Hillary Clinton said. ""It took a president to get it done. That dream became a reality. The power of that dream became real in people's lives because we had a president who said, 'We are going to do it,' and actually got it accomplished.""This statement by candidate Hillary Clinton was in interpreted by several leadership persons in the African-American community as demeaning and diminishing the leadership role of Dr. King in the successful passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Bill.Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan is credited with originating the saying ""Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts.""Aside from the actual audio tapes, photos, etc., from the Presidential Library of President Lyndon Johnson, the seminal book on Selma and the respective roles of Dr. King and President Johnson preceding and during the events presumably depicted in the movie is Judgement Days: Lyndon Baines Johnson, Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Laws That Changed America by Nick Kotz.Joseph A. Califano was a former White House special assistant to President Johnson. In a Washington Post Op-Ed, he claims that the film ""falsely portrays President Lyndon B. Johnson as being at odds with Martin Luther King Jr. and even using the FBI to discredit him, as only reluctantly behind the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and as opposed to the Selma march itself.""According to Mashable:Califano says LBJ in fact came up with the idea behind the Selma march, which was to find the worst area of voting suppression and make a stand there; that the President considered the Voting Rights Act to be his administration's greatest achievement; and never used the FBI to disparage the civil rights leader.We have had and continue to have great respect for the contributions of Mr. Califano to our country. Historical facts, however, require us to state categorically that LBJ did not in fact come up ""with the idea behind the Selma march."" The initiation of the March arose from the leadership role of Dr. King and the African-American leaders in Selma, Alabama, in January 1965 for voter registration in Selma and other parts of Alabama. This initiative in the community of Selma was captioned ""The Alabama Project.""According to Judgement Days by Nick Kotz: Dr. King had launched the Alabama Project with a powerful sermon at the Brown Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Selma on January 2, two weeks before his conversation with the President (on Jan 15, 1965, the date cited by Mr. Califano as the date 'LBJ in fact came of with the Idea behind the Selma march'). Speaking to an enthusiastic audience of 700 black citizens who jammed the church, King called Selma 'a symbol of bitter-end resistance to the civil rights movement of the Deep South.'As we said, we have not yet seen the film. But, we do not have to see the film to know what the historical facts were. We knew them from our role as a former political advisor and lawyer for Dr. King, before, during and after the 1965 events in Selma and the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.The march from Selma to Montgomery and the plan to initiate a voting registration drive in Selma did not because ""LBJ in fact came up with the idea behind the Selma march, which was to find the worst area of voting suppression and make a stand there."" The Selma march was a result of the political evolution and development of a movement by the African-Americans of Selma, and civil rights allies to insist once and for all, that the African-American citizens living in Selma have the unimpeded opportunity to register and vote.From ""30,000 feet"" it appears that both the producers of the film and Joseph A. Califano misunderstand or simply do not know that the success of the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965 was a result of the joint leadership and cooperation between Dr. King and President Johnson.The director of Selma, Ava DuVernay, has been reported as citing, as ""evidence,"" that President Johnson ""opposed"" or ""did not support"" Dr. King's efforts in Selma because President Johnson did not prevent J. Egar Hoover from conducting a concurrent campaign to disparage and destroy Dr. King's character by the FBI's dissemination of wiretaps of Dr. King with women other than his wife.The events in Selma Alabama in 1965 and the passage of the Voting Rights Act transformed and expanded opportunities for hundreds of thousands of previously unregistered African-American voters in our country. They are unique and enduring testaments to the special historical roles played by both President Johnson and Dr. King. Joseph Califano and others (like us) should be grateful that a film has been made depicting those persons and events that played such important real life roles in the movie's tribute to Selma, Alabama's, legacy of the struggle for political empowerment during the 20th century."

Women, the head of the U.N. representation in Nigeria, and with officials of the U.N. Office for West Africa last month. The group has also appealed to UNICEF, campaign spokeswoman Bukola Shonibare said.U.N. officials were not immediately available for comment.""If the government cannot take action, we are asking for the UN to come in and help and if they reject, we just don't know what to do,"" Reverend Enoch Mark, leader of the parents, told Reuters. Two of his daughters were kidnapped.It is not clear what any U.N. agency could do without Nigerian government approval.More than eight months since the abduction of the girls from Chibok, in remote northeastern Borno state, parents say they are still in the dark about what the government is doing.A presidential spokesman said efforts to free them continue but that details of the missions are too sensitive to publish.On April 14, Boko Haram militants raided the school while the girls were taking exams. They loaded 270 of them onto trucks. Around 50 escaped shortly afterwards.Boko Haram, which is fighting for an Islamic state and whose name means ""Western education is sinful,"" had been kidnapping children for more than a year, but the scale of this attack shocked the world and sparked a #BringBackOurGirls Twitter campaign that drew in celebrities including Michelle Obama.The five year old insurgency has killed thousands of people, displaced more than a million and raised fears voting in presidential elections on February 14 will be impossible across stretches of the northeast.""The Chibok community is pained, we cannot take this anymore,"" Dauda Iliya, spokesman for the Chibok community in Abuja, said at a New Year's Day rally of parents, adding that they had written to the United Nations to ""protest this neglect and nonchalance by the government.""President Goodluck Jonathan says the government is trying to free the girls but a botched rescue mission would endanger them.Dozens, possibly hundreds, have been kidnapped since the Chibok attack. Two weeks ago, gunmen abducted 172 women and children from Gumsuri, 24 km from Chibok. (Additional reporting by Felix Onuah; Editing by Tim Cocks and Ralph Boulton)"

Assad has made a rare visit to the frontline spending New Yearâs Eve with his troops in a tense eastern Damascus neighborhood.

It showed Assad talking to troops, embracing them and sharing a meal outside, in what was presented as a morale boost for soldiers on the frontline of the country's civil war.The conflict killed 76,021 people in 2014, just under half of them civilians, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Thursday.The United Nations says around 200,000 people have been killed since 2011. No group enjoys significant momentum going into 2015, and Assad said last month he expected the conflict to be long and difficult.Assad, who is commander in chief, is not frequently pictured in public, though he has visited troops in the past, according to state media. The presidential website said the latest visit was to Jobar, northeast of Damascus.""If there was an area of joy which remained in Syria, it is thanks to the victories that you achieved in the face of terrorism,"" Assad told troops, according to the Twitter account.State news agency SANA said he ""wished a speedy recovery to the wounded"" and praised their sacrifices.Lebanese channel al-Mayadeen also showed footage of the trip. Several bangs could be heard in the distance but it was not clear what caused them.Syrian forces have been trying to dislodge insurgents from Jobar, which was captured by anti-Assad fighters in 2013. While government forces control central Damascus, they have continued to face battles on the outskirts of the capital.According to the human rights observatory, Jobar was the target of at least 10 raids by the Syrian air force on Wednesday, as well as strikes by ground missiles.Neither the presidency account nor SANA said whether Syrian troops had gained control over all or just parts of the area.The Observatory, which gathers information from sources on the ground, said pro-government forces in Jobar had clashed with fighters from rebel and Islamic battalions and al Qaeda's Syria wing, Nusra Front.In an update on Thursday, the Observatory said government forces had fired machine guns on areas of Jobar overnight and that three rockets landed in the area in the morning. It added that at least 25 pro-government fighters were killed and dozens wounded in the previous day's fighting. Syrian state media did not mention any casualties.The conflict, which started with pro-democracy protests in 2011, has descended into a war pitting pro-government forces against numerous insurgent groups including Western-backed fighters, the Nusra Front and its ultra-hardline offshoot Islamic State, who have also fought against each other.U.S-led forces have been conducting airstrikes against Islamist militants in Syria since September.

13,WORLDPOST,Poll: One In 8 Germans Would Join Anti-Muslim Marches,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/germany-anti-muslim-marches_n_6403532.html,,2015-01-01,"Thousands of participants of a rally called 'Patriotic Europeans against the Islamization of the West' (PEGIDA) gather in Dresden, eastern Germany, Monday, Dec. 15, 2014. The words at the banner read: 'Nonviolent and united against faith wars in Germany - Pegida'. Pegida, a nascent anti-foreigner campaign group, is growing in stature week by week and sparking concern among German officials. For the past nine weeks, activists protesting Germanyâs immigration policy and the spread of Islam in the West have been marching each Monday. (AP Photo/Jens Meyer)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc1431b2400005400e480d7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BERLIN, Jan 1 (Reuters) - One German in eight would join an anti-Muslim march if a rapidly-growing protest movement organized one in their home towns, according to an opinion poll published on Thursday.The survey highlighted growing support in Germany, as in other European Union countries including Britain and Sweden, for parties and movements tapping into voter fears that mainstream politicians are too soft on immigration.Some members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative bloc worry that they risk losing support to the euro-skeptic Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has shifted its focus to immigration and includes many who also back the PEGIDA protest movement -- Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West.PEGIDA is holding weekly rallies in the eastern city of Dresden, and attracted more than 17,000 people to a Dec. 22 rally. A few small marches have taken place in other towns, and it plans to stage further rallies in other German cities.In her New Year address, Merkel urged Germans to turn their backs on PEGIDA's leaders, calling them racists full of hatred, and said Europe's biggest economy must welcome people fleeing conflict and war.A poll of 1,006 people by Forsa for Germany's Stern magazine found 13 percent would attend an anti-Muslim march nearby. It also found 29 percent of people believed that Islam was having such an influence on life in Germany that the marches were justified.While two thirds of those polled believed the idea of an 'Islamisation' of Germany was exaggerated, many Germans are concerned about the numbers of asylum seekers fleeing countries such as Syria.Partly in response to its Nazi past, German asylum rules are among the most liberal in the world. The number of asylum-seekers arriving in Germany surged to about 200,000 in 2014, four times the numbers in 2012. Net immigration has hit a two-decade high.AfD leader Bernd Lucke criticized Merkel's New Year address in comments due to appear in Friday's edition of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) paper, accusing her of disrespecting citizens. A New Year address should unite rather than divide people, he said, accusing Merkel of branding all those who joined PEGIDA marches as anti-immigrant without listening to their views.He said he saw no place for anti-immigrant sentiment in Germany, but that problems should be discussed properly to stop such views taking hold.

Tsarnaev is scheduled to be in federal court in Boston Thursday, Dec. 18, 2014, for the final hearing before his trial begins in January. He could face the death penalty if convicted. (AP Photo/Federal Bureau of Investigation, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ba2bc0a1f00005100226cc5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BOSTON (AP) — Lawyers for Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev asked a federal appeals court Wednesday to overturn a judge's decision to not move his upcoming trial out of state.The appeal was filed with the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals hours after U.S. District Court Judge George O'Toole denied the change-of-venue request and a motion seeking a nine-month delay in the start of the trial. The defense is now asking O'Toole to postpone jury selection, scheduled to begin Monday, pending the outcome of the appeal.Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to federal charges connected to the April 2013 explosions at the marathon finish line, which killed three people and injured more than 260. He could face the death penalty if convicted.The defense lawyers, in their appeal to the higher court, again argued Tsarnaev couldn't receive a fair trial in the Boston federal courthouse a couple of miles from where the bombing occurred. Prosecutors, they said, were likely to depict the crimes as having affected not only those killed and injured but nearly the entire greater Boston community.""Thus, every member of the jury pool is, in effect, an actual victim of the charged offenses,"" the defense attorneys wrote.As an alternative to ordering the trial moved, the lawyers suggested the appeals court order O'Toole to hold a hearing on ""disputed issues of fact"" and reconsider the previous change-of-venue motions.O'Toole said in his ruling earlier Wednesday he would provide a detailed explanation for it later.In rejecting Tsarnaev's first request in September to move the trial, O'Toole said defense lawyers had failed to show that extensive pretrial media coverage of the bombings had prejudiced the jury pool to the point an impartial jury couldn't be chosen in Boston.The defense has compared the coverage to that in the case of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, whose trial was moved to Denver. McVeigh was convicted and put to death for the bombing, which killed 168 people.In Wednesday's appeals court filing, Tsarnaev's lawyers noted The Associated Press recently named the aftermath of the marathon bombing the top Massachusetts news story of 2014 and Gov.-elect Charlie Baker, in response to a question posed by The Boston Globe in October, said Tsarnaev was the living person he despised the most.Prosecutors say Tsarnaev, 21, and his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, planted and detonated two pressure cooker bombs. Tamerlan died following a firefight with police several days after the bombings. Dzhokhar was captured later that day, wounded and hiding in a boat parked in a backyard in suburban Watertown.Also Wednesday, O'Toole issued a decorum order, prohibiting courtroom spectators from wearing clothing, buttons or other items ""that carry any message or symbol addressing the issues related to this case that may be or become visible to the jury."" The ban includes law enforcement uniforms and badges, except for those worn by on-duty U.S. marshals or court security officers.Defense lawyers said in motions seeking a trial delay the prosecution has not handed over everything they have requested, including information they believe may show Tsarnaev was under his brother's influence.The defense also wanted more time to review information regarding Stephen Silva, who recently pleaded guilty to having possessed the gun prosecutors said the bombing suspects used to kill a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer.In a court filing opposing the request for a delay, prosecutors rejected complaints by Tsarnaev's lawyers about their ability to digest the volume of material provided by the government. Prosecutors said much of that information was demanded by the defense and voluntarily turned over by the government ""in the spirit of openness."""

He was well-read, interesting, and just plain fun to be around. He had deep respect and love for the craft of acting and led by example. You wanted to be better prepared, or just plain better, because he always was.
