We spoke with several NASA officials and an astronaut about their plans to take humans to Mars. They all shared with us the significant challenges ahead in order to accomplish that goal. However, it is a goal they take seriously and are determined to achieve. The Martian poster with astronaut Gus Grissom's space suit on display in the background at NASA's Johnson Space Center.

He is hurt during a storm that requires the crew to return to their orbiting spacecraft, and he's left on the surface, presumed dead.He actually isn't dead and wakes up stranded on Mars. He doesn't have the supplies to live long enough to survive on the planet for the length of time it will take for his friends at NASA to come back and get him, so, in his words, ""I'm left with only one option, I'm gonna have to science the shit out of this.""In an interview in the auditorium at Space Center Houston, The Martian producer Aditya Sood told us the experience of working on the movie with NASA employees was amazing. He said he enjoyed ""interacting with folks who literally science the shit out of things every day.""The Martian producer Aditya Sood at NASA's Johnson Space Center, December 3, 2015. Credit: Alejandro Rojas.I got an idea of what Sood was talking about when we interviewed some of the scientists responsible for getting humans to Mars. They really are going to have to science the shit out of it in order to accomplish their ambitious goal of making that happen in the 2030s.Planetary Science Division Director Jim Green told us in a Q and A that getting humans on the surface of Mars in 2035 is probably too ambitious. They are actually looking to get a ""human presence in the neighborhood"" by the 2030s, meaning in Mars' orbit. Their goal for getting boots on the ground on Mars is the 2040s or 50s.

Credit: Alejandro Rojas.The spacecraft that will take humans to Mars will be the Orion. It is not quite as futuristic-looking as the spaceship in The Martian. In fact, The Orion looks more like the spacecraft that took us to the moon.However, according to their website, ""NASA's Orion spacecraft is built to take humans farther than they've ever gone before.""

Credit: Alejandro Rojas.When asked if they will really be ready to go to Mars in the 2030s, Stu McClung, the manager of Mechanical, Pyrotechnic, Landing and Recover Systems, who has worked at Johnson Space Center in the Orion Crew/Service Module Office since 2006, told us with confidence and pride, ""My capsule will be ready!""Although, he did make that statement with a bit of a wry smile. That is because he admits they still have a lot to figure out. Some of the challenges they face include, how to communicate with crew members in deep space, developing lighter radiation shielding, and where to store all of the food the astronauts will need.

Credit: Alejandro Rojas.When it comes to food, where to store it is not the only thing they need to figure out, according to Vickie Kloeris, manager of the International Space Station (ISS) Food System. Currently, the ISS holds about six months of food storage. And, especially with the quick turnaround of some of the commercial space resupply missions, astronauts are able to enjoy fresh foods, such as fruits and vegetables.This will not be the case when it comes to long duration flights. A trip to Mars would have a round trip time anywhere from 245 to 450 days. According to Kloeris, the food has a long shelf life, and would be safe to eat, but we are not sure what the effects of radiation or microgravity would be on the state of the food. It might be rendered unpalatable. Manager, International Space Station Food System Vickie Kloeris addresses the press at Johnson Space Center, December 3, 2015. Credit: Alejandro Rojas.There is also a possibility, Kloeris suggests, that spaceflight has an effect on flavor receptors. There is currently anecdotal information that this. However, according to Kloeris, they have not been able to prove this in testing, nor have they been able to determine what might be the cause. For instance, Kloeris adds, the effect on flavor could be due to aroma. Perhaps on the ISS the heat from the food does not cause the aroma to float up to the astronauts' nose as it does here on Earth. Or perhaps the other aromas in the ISS affect the astronauts' ability to taste.On the Q and A website Quora, Astronaut Clayton Anderson wrote about the smell on the ISS. He says the ISS air purification systems work very well, and gives them a ""significantly 'odor-free' environment.""However, according to Anderson, there is a smell to space. He writes: ""Ever distinct -- I would know it instantly if I smelled it -- it has been likened to smells associated with welding or burning of ozone (now, who the heck really knows what that smells like?!). Most noticeable following a spacewalk, when crews and their equipment returned to the inside of the ISS, I remember being able to smell traces of this unique scent for several days following an excursion into the unforgiving vacuum of space.""Even with all of the challenges outlined above, as in The Martian movie, NASA scientists are busting their humps to accomplish their lofty Martian goals. NASA Astronaut Dr. Drew Feustel at Johnson Space Center, December 3, 2015. Credit: Alejandro Rojas.Astronaut Drew Feustel told me that, although he might be able to fly on an Orion mission, he is probably too old to be one of the astronauts to go to Mars. However, he believes the mission to Mars is vital for the survival of the human species.With a background in earth sciences, Feustel says life is fragile. We have only existed a short time on this planet, and we know other species, such as the dinosaurs, did not survive due to planetary changes. He joked that the dinosaurs didn't have a space program, but we do. That makes the study of other planets, and the ability to travel to them, crucial to the future of human existence.The Martian will be released on Digital HD on December 22, and on Blu-ray, 3D Blu-ray and DVD on January 12, 2016."

COP21 President Laurent Fabius unveiled the final draft text of a global climate agreement of negotiations in Paris. (Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb17fec2600003600819378.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We will just be the audience in the stands. We don't have to be there. That's what I kept telling myself as I debated attending the United Nations Climate talks in Paris, otherwise known as COP21. My 15-year-old daughter, a self-made climate activist, had been selected as a delegate to listen in on the state of the planet, and the future of her world. But I was feeling vulnerable.Three weeks earlier Paris had been brutally attacked, and the day before, sleepy San Bernardino, an hour south of us, had been similarly ravaged by religious extremists.LAX was spookily quiet. But we went. Our mayor, Eric Garcetti, was already there, making our city's climate commitments. We joined him to pay tribute to fellow Angeleno, Nohemi Gonzalez, who had been shot those three weeks before at a restaurant called La Belle Equipe, which means The Good Team. Together, we added flowers to the candles and condolence letters posted on this unassuming corner. Then, French guards arrived with machine guns and flak jackets. Vulnerable was what I felt passing through scanners at my daughter's first conference session. Veteran climate activist Robert Redford led a panel with representatives from the front lines of climate change. Kathy Jetnil-Kejinar, a young poet from the Marshall Islands, explained that her ancestral home is about to disappear beneath the warming ocean waters precisely because of the very comforts we first-world inhabitants hold as absolutes: Our hot showers, our cozy car rides to and from school, our plastic bags filled with short-lived satisfaction from disposable materialism. The idea that this may happen even before my teenage daughter graduates from college crystallized Mina's vulnerability.Indonesia's Mina Setra took the microphone next. She was another of the spokespeople who'd come from threatened regions, invited to have a seat at the table with the world's worst carbon emitters, and argue the urgency of their issues. She is a formidable speaker, but here, words failed her. She, and every other representative of the indigenous cause, had been shut out of the central talks without warning. She wanted to describe her rage, but words failed her. There was silence. As she stifled her own, tears fell quietly throughout the dark room. After all those recent deaths in Paris, in San Bernardino, in Beirut, in Sharm el-Sheikh, all those refugees risking their lives to reach Lesbos, all the drought in the Middle East fueling the explosion of extremist religions, Mina's fear rose among us.And yet, the next day, there was also a tide of hope. The sun shone brightly through the grand two story windows of Paris' Petit Palais, built in another century to celebrate innovation and modernity. ""I see a very different effort here,"" said the United Nations' chief, Ban Ki-moon. Never before, he said, had the entire world seemed to focus on the issue of climate change as they were now. With a small smile on his face, he said, ""It feels like a Tsunami.""There was hope when the head of outdoor gear company, Patagonia, suggested we mend our torn jackets rather than replace them. There was hope when Darian Rodriguez Heyman, a head of the UN's Impact Investing Global Summit, said a new, green economy was already starting to grow.At the ""Celebrate the Arctic"" Party, there were toasts for the defeat of the Keystone Pipeline, but Inupiaq Eskimo AKU-MATU's seemingly celebratory rap performance still pulsed with the sadness of a familial Alaskan habitat on the brink of destruction.At the end of her song, 20 of us with the National Resources Defense Council delegation were invited to a private room for a summation of the week's progress with members of President Obama's administration, a rare treat for which we'd push through jet-lag and the hunger my daughter and I had been neglecting in favor of information gathering all day.The doors closed. Negotiations are a dance, Christy Goldfuss told us. The days ahead would be critical. As we wished her luck, thanking her for her time, a woman we didn't know burst into the exclusive suite. She was shaking. We fell silent. This was the one event we attended that did not require a weapons check.Her presence felt radical, yet frighteningly familiar, though none of us had been at the massacre at La Belle Equipe or the San Bernardino Inland Regional Center. Wild-eyed, the woman berated us for our wine and cheese parties while those who were truly vulnerable were shut out. She said she was from New Orleans and her family members were dying of cancer caused by the BP oil spill, and that everything in her world would again be in jeopardy when the next hurricane slams the Gulf Coast. She demanded immediate action.Then, as quickly as she came, she left. NRDC President Rhea Suh, tears in her eyes, said, ""This is why we are here.""Sam Kass, former food guru for Michelle Obama and now NBC News, likened COP21 to a wedding. There is exhaustive planning and excitement to reach the day when friends and family finally gather. But it is after, he said, when the couple's real work begins. I would argue that the work is not just for the newlyweds, but for the attendees, who leave with the life-long mission to hold the couple to their vows, to be their support team.Ban Ki-moon described our planet this week as sick with a fever we have to treat. It is not just Kathy, Mina, AKU-MATU, and the frightened, angry woman from New Orleans who are suffering because of it. The climate connects every one of us.We mere ""audience in the stands"" came there to bear witness, and left with a mission to hold our leaders accountable, to honor La Belle Equipe by being La Belle Equipe, by truly becoming The Good Team.This post is part of a series produced by The Huffington Post, in conjunction with the U.N.'s 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) in Paris (Nov. 30-Dec. 11), aka the climate-change conference.

2,BUSINESS,9 Idiotic Office Rules That Drive Everyone Insane,"Dr. Travis Bradberry, ContributorAuthor of #1 bestselling book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0, and...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/9-idiotic-office-rules-th_b_8775576.html,"Companies need to have rules--that's a given--but they don't have to be shortsighted and lazy attempts at creating order. If companies can rethink their policies and remove or alter those that are unnecessary or demoralizing, we'll all have a more enjoyable and productive time at work.",2015-12-12,2015-12-10-1449780375-803120-9IdioticOfficeRulesThatDriveEveryoneInsaneHP.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-12-10-1449780375-803120-9IdioticOfficeRulesThatDriveEveryoneInsaneHP-thumb.jpg,"Companies need to have rules--that's a given--but they don't have to be shortsighted and lazy attempts at creating order.I understand the temptation. As my company has grown, so has our difficulty maintaining standards. There have been many instances where someone crossed a line, and we were tempted to respond with a new rule that applied to everyone.But that's where most companies blow it.In just about every instance, upon closer inspection, we realized that establishing a new rule would be a passive and morale-killing way to address the problem. The vast majority of the time, the problem needs to be handled one-on-one by the employee's manager.When companies create ridiculous and demoralizing rules to halt the outlandish behavior of a few individuals, it's a management problem. There's no sense in alienating your entire workforce because you don't know how to manage performance. It makes a bad situation that much worse.Here are nine of the worst rules that companies create when they fall into this trap.1. Restricting Internet UseThere are certain sites that no one should be visiting at work, and I'm not talking about Facebook. But once you block pornography and the other obvious stuff, it's a difficult and arbitrary process deciding where to draw the line.Most companies draw it in the wrong place.People should be able to kill time on the Internet during breaks. When companies unnecessarily restrict people's Internet activity, it does more than demoralize those that can't check Facebook; it limits people's ability to do their jobs. Many companies restrict Internet activity so heavily that it makes it difficult for people to do online research. The most obvious example? Checking the Facebook profile of someone you just interviewed.2. Ridiculous Requirements for Attendance, Leave, and Time OffPeople are salaried for the work they do, not the specific hours they sit at their desks. When you ding salaried employees for showing up five minutes late even though they routinely stay late and put in time on the weekend, you send the message that policies take precedence over performance. It reeks of distrust, and you should never put someone on salary that you don't trust.When companies are unnecessarily strict in requiring documentation for bereavement and medical leave, it leaves a sour taste in the mouths of employees who deserve better. After all, if you have employees who will fake a death to miss a day's work, what does that say about your company?  3. Draconian E-mail PoliciesThis is a newer one that's already moving down a slippery slope. Some companies are getting so restrictive with e-mail use that employees must select from a list of pre-approved topics before the e-mail software will allow them to send a message.Again, it's about trust. If you don't trust your people to use e-mail properly, why did you hire them in the first place? In trying to rein in the bad guys, you make everyone miserable every time they send an e-mail. And guess what? The bad guys are the ones who will find ways to get around any system you put in place.4. Limiting Bathroom BreaksIf you're going to limit people's trips to the bathroom, you might as well come out and tell them that you wish they were a bunch of robots. When you limit basic personal freedoms by counting people's trips to the bathroom, they start counting their days at the company. The day you have to bring in a doctor's note to prove that you warrant additional trips to the bathroom is the day you need to find another job.5. Stealing Employees' Frequent-flyer MilesIf there's one thing that road-weary traveling employees earn, it's their frequent flier miles. When employers don't let people keep their miles for personal use, it's a greedy move that fuels resentment with every flight. Work travel is a major sacrifice of time, energy, and sanity. Taking employees' miles sends the message that you don't appreciate their sacrifice and that you'll hold on to every last dollar at their expense.  6. Pathetic Attempts at Political CorrectnessMaintaining high standards for how people treat each other is a wonderful thing as we live in a world that's rife with animosity and discrimination. Still employers have to know where to draw the line. Going on a witch-hunt because someone says ""Bless you"" to another employee that sneezed (real example) creates an environment of paranoia and stifled self-expression, without improving how people treat each other.7. Bell Curves and Forced Rankings of PerformanceSome individual talents follow a natural bell-shaped curve, but job performance does not. When you force employees to fit into a pre-determined ranking system, you do three things: 1) incorrectly evaluate people's performance, 2) make everyone feel like a number, and 3) create insecurity and dissatisfaction when performing employees fear that they'll be fired due to the forced system. This is yet another example of a lazy policy that avoids the hard and necessary work of evaluating each individual objectively, based on his or her merits.8. Banning Mobile PhonesIf I ban mobile phones in the office, no one will waste time texting and talking to family and friends, right? Ya, right. Organizations need to do the difficult work of hiring people who are trustworthy and who won't take advantage of things. They also need to train managers to deal effectively with employees who underperform and/or violate expectations (such as spending too much time on their phones). This is also hard work, but it's worth it. The easy, knee-jerk alternative (banning phones) demoralizes good employees who need to check their phones periodically due to pressing family or health issues or as an appropriate break from work.9. Shutting Down Self-Expression (Personal Items and Dress Code)Many organizations control what people can have at their desks. A life-size poster of a shirtless Fabio? I get it; that's a problem. But employers dictate how many photographs people can display, whether or not they can use a water bottle, and how many items they're allowed to place on their desks. Once again, it's the ol' ""If I could just hire robots I wouldn't have this problem"" approach.Same goes for dress codes. They work well in private high schools, but they're unnecessary at work. Hire professionals and they'll dress professionally. When someone crosses the line, their manager needs to have the skill to address the issue directly. Otherwise, you're making everyone wish they worked somewhere else because management is too inept to handle touchy subjects effectively.Bringing It All TogetherIf companies can rethink their policies and remove or alter those that are unnecessary or demoralizing, we'll all have a more enjoyable and productive time at work.  What other policies drive you bananas? Please share your thoughts in the comments section below as I learn just as much from you as you do from me."
3,POLITICS,Friday Talking Points -- Not Funny Anymore,"Chris Weigant, ContributorPolitical writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/friday-talking-points_b_8790226.html,"It's not funny anymore -- it's getting closer and closer to becoming reality. Donald Trump, leader of the Republican Party. Deal with it, everyone.",2015-12-12,"FILE - In this Nov. 23, 2015, file photo, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks in Columbus, Ohio. While the White House condemns Donald Trump's call for a ban on Muslim immigrants, President Barack Obama may only have himself to blame if a President Trump ever tries to put his plan into action. (AP Photo/Paul Vernon, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb927ea1f00002501258c62.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hillary Clinton is right. Last night, on Seth Meyers's late-night show, Clinton had this to say about Donald Trump's candidacy: ""I no longer think he is funny."" Earlier in the week, the Huffington Post announced that it was un-banishing Trump from the ""Entertainment"" section and would now properly cover him under ""Politics."" Arianna and Hillary are correct -- what started out as a hilarious joke is no longer even the slightest bit funny anymore.Donald Trump has the best chance of becoming the Republican nominee for the highest office in the land. Actual voting begins in two months. So far, nothing he's said -- no matter how outlandish or outrageous -- has had any negative impact on his support. His poll numbers defy political gravity. So far, no attacks against him have worked, and the GOP candidates attacking him have actually gone down in the polls as a result.Still, many within the confines of the Beltway cling desperately to the ""magic implosion"" theory, which might be summed up as: ""Somehow Trump must implode. He has to, dammit!"" Such magical thinking was on display this week from Chris Cillizza of the Washington Post, who wrote an entire article stating (based on not much more than one Iowa poll, and moonbeams) that Ted Cruz is ""in the catbird seat"" and the best-positioned to win the Republican nomination. This entire article almost completely ignores Donald Trump and his polling lead. It's a stunning display of head-in-the-sand thinking. It essentially starts with the premise ""of course Trump won't win,"" and then takes off for the wild blue yonder from there.Trump, in pretty much every recent poll, has over twice the support of his nearest competitor. Twice! This is slowly sinking in to the Republican establishment, but they still can't seem to come to grips with the most probable conclusion. They are worried that Trump will break off and mount a third-party campaign -- blithely assuming that he'll lose the Republican nomination (if he wins, he won't need a third party). At worst, the party elders are worried that Trump will force a brokered convention by winning a lot of delegates, but not enough to give him the nomination. That's their worst-case scenario, even though the obvious questions should now be: ""Will the Republican Party itself split after Donald Trump secures the nomination? Will Bush/Cruz/Rubio/whomever launch their own third-party bid, and carry the Republican Party establishment with them? Will they stalk out of their own convention in Dixiecrat fashion?""None of this is much fun for Republicans, one assumes, but they've truly brought this on themselves. Trump isn't so much making radically new suggestions, what he is actually doing is taking conservative Republican dogma to its obvious conclusion. Trump disdains the standard ""dog-whistle"" language, but his proposals are pretty close to what the party as a whole believes. This didn't happen overnight, and it was aided and abetted by the same people who are now wringing their hands over Trump.It's not funny anymore -- it's getting closer and closer to becoming reality. Donald Trump, leader of the Republican Party. Deal with it, everyone.Here's a quick measure of the truth of that claim: the week's political news is now divided -- and pretty equally -- into Trump news and non-Trump news. The big Trump news this week was, obviously, his brilliant plan to stop everyone at the border who is entering America, ask them: ""Are you a Muslim?"" and then not let in anyone who answers: ""Yes."" No, seriously, that is indeed how Trump would implement his new ""temporary hold"" on Muslims entering America. Jeb! Bush, in an earlier bit of idiocy, had suggested that only Christians from the Middle East be allowed entry -- and, when pressed on how this would be implemented had only this to say: ""You can tell when someone's a Christian."" It's like Trump and Bush think it'd be a good idea for people to have to wear their religious symbols on their clothing, because we all know how well that worked out the last time around, right?Most of the political news is similar -- other politicians reacting to what Trump has said. This, to us, still qualifies as ""Trump news,"" we should mention. Ben Carson (remember him?) is desperately watching his poll numbers sink like a stone, so he tried to get on board the Trump train by threatening that if Trump leaves the Republicans for a third-party run, Carson might also bolt the party. Now wouldn't that be fun? Ben Carson on the Christian Soldiers Party ticket, Trump on the Make America Great Party ticket, and a Republican (to be named later) -- all facing off against the Democratic nominee. That would certainly be an election for the ages, to put it mildly.Of course, watching Republicans twist in the wind trying to come up with a way to denounce Trump without offending his followers is pure schadenfreude for Democrats. Even the Republicans who spoke out against Trump's ""bar the Muslims at the door"" concept couldn't quite bring themselves to say they wouldn't eventually support him if he became the party's nominee. So what you get is: ""Trump is wrong, he's un-American, he should be denounced by all... and if he wins enough primary states, I will support him 100 percent!"" We've only heard of one national-level Republican (House member Reid Ribble from Wisconsin) clearly state an anti-Trump position: ""My first oath is to the Constitution of the United States. Donald Trump has taken positions contrary to that document, so I could not support him and uphold my oath."" Bravo, Representative Ribble! Must be lonely out there, eh?Next week we'll get another round of debates from both parties, and the Republican one may be the last chance any candidate has of doing serious damage to Trump's poll numbers. So the sparks may fly! While the field of plausible Republican candidates is really down to four (as I argued earlier this week), some are still including Bush in with the frontrunners Trump, Cruz, Carson, and Marco Rubio. Even just those five would make for a more-focused evening, but it's looking like three other candidates will somehow also be included in primetime: Carly Fiorina, Chris Christie, and John Kasich. Mike Huckabee and Rand Paul likely won't make the cut. Personally, we think it's time to tighten the rules even more, and just have the top five candidates on the stage, but then we're not in charge of the rules.In non-election news, there's a battle going on in Iraq to retake Ramadi from the Islamic State. The Iraqi government forces (together with some militias) are steadily taking ground within the city itself, and America is even reportedly considering offering helicopter ground support to help flush the Islamic State fighters out of the rest of the city. This is a big deal, as if successful it will be the biggest defeat the Islamic State has yet suffered on the ground.This is one of the few magical seasons of the year when Congress actually does the work they were supposed to be doing for all those many, many, many weeks they took off on vacation on the taxpayer's dime. A budget bill was supposed to be passed by today, but has been punted into the middle of next week. This is Speaker Paul Ryan's first big test, and so far it looks like he's shepherding the process along the way things used to work -- both sides offer up their ideas, then draw lines in the sand over certain items from the other's agenda. A whole lot of horsetrading will take place before next Wednesday, so keep an eye on what will be in the final bill, early next week. In the midst of all this, Nancy Pelosi managed to force a vote on restricting those on the terrorist watch list from buying guns, for political purposes (she lost the vote, of course). Watch for Democratic ads to feature this vote in next year's congressional races.Up north, it is looking more and more like Canada is going to just go ahead and legalize recreational marijuana for all its adult citizens next year, fulfilling a campaign pledge from the new prime minister. Maybe weed flowing into America from our northern neighbor will prompt Donald Trump to build another ""big, beautiful wall"" across the Canadian border? One can only imagine.President Barack Obama, in the primetime Oval Office speech he gave last weekend, called on Congress to do their job and pass a war bill for Syria and Iraq. Congress has been eager to criticize the president's war plans, but very reluctant to actually weigh in themselves on the issue of how America should be conducting this war. This is shameful. It is an abdication of duty by Congress. If they won't get their own act together, then how can any member of Congress criticize what Obama is doing?This issue cuts across party lines. Democrats don't want to vote on an Islamic State war bill (technically an ""Authorization for the Use of Military Force"" or AUMF) because many of them were burned badly on their previous vote on the Iraq War (see: Clinton, Hillary). Republicans don't want to vote on a bill because they don't want to authorize anything President Obama does (good, bad, or indifferent). This is pathetic, on both sides.We have two Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week awards to hand out this week, one to Representative Peter Welch and one to Senator Tim Kaine, both from Virginia. They, together with Republican counterparts Scott Rigell and Jeff Flake, have introduced an AUMF bill in both houses of Congress. For all the tough talk about what to do about the Islamic State threat, this is what Congress is constitutionally supposed to be doing. A fact more journalists should be aware of, we might add.These bills have bipartisan sponsors. They are identical, which means that if the bill passes both houses it will arrive on President Obama's desk. Unfortunately, the bills are likely to go nowhere, because as the article points out: ""Congressional leaders are still ignoring calls for a war authorization vote.""Still, for attempting to goad Congress into doing its most important national security job, as is its duty, Welch and Kaine should be applauded. Which is why both of them are getting the last MIDOTW award of 2015. More power to them. No matter what each congressman thinks of the current war effort, Congress should spell out specific instructions for how they'd like to see the war prosecuted. Anything short is dereliction of duty.[Congratulate Representative Peter Welch on his House contact page, and Senator Tim Kaine on his Senate contact page, to let them know you appreciate their efforts.]President Obama's Oval Office speech seemed to disappoint many, but we thought it did exactly what it was intended to do -- calm the public's fears down to realistic levels. Of course, the Obama speech was soon pushed aside after Trump unveiled his ""ban the Muslims"" idea, but we just can't say we were disappointed by Obama's speech, personally.Instead, our Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week this week is a man who hasn't graced these pages in over 100 issues (he got his fifth MDDOTW way back in FTP [222]).Rahm Emanuel, now the mayor of Chicago, seems politically doomed, one way or another. His administration was responsible for trying to bury -- going so far as to fight the public release of it in court -- the damning video of a cop shooting an African-American who was in no way threatening the cop. Rahm got away with this coverup for over a year -- and during that period, he successfully won re-election. It goes without saying that if the video had been released in a timely manner Rahm might not have gotten as many votes.Now, we're not aware of any proof that Rahm himself was directing this coverup attempt or anything. Still, he is the mayor and what with the court case he must have at least been aware of what was going on. He has since fired the head of the Chicago police force, and gave a very emotional speech this week (choking up about the Utopia he'd like to see Chicago become), but none of that appears to be enough, at this point.A recent poll put Rahm's job approval rating among city residents at a dismal 18 percent. A majority -- 51 percent -- now think Rahm Emanuel should resign. With numbers like that, Rahm's exit is almost certain. He may try to hang on and fight his way back, but at this point the more likely scenario is that he reluctantly steps down -- the only real question left is how long it'll be before he realizes it's his only remaining viable option.We have to admit we're no fans of Rahm Emanuel, because we vividly remember his scathing disdain for the progressive media and the progressive base of his own party, while he was serving as President Obama's most-powerful aide. So we're not exactly shedding tears over Rahm's political fate or his political legacy. In fact, our feelings towards the mayor might best be expressed as: ""Don't let the door hit you on the way out, Rahm."" And, meanwhile, here's another MDDOTW award, as you get ready to leave.[Contact Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel via the city's official webpage, to let him know what you think of his actions.]Volume 372 (12/11/15)Some program notes are in order before we begin. This will be the final FTP column of the year, as we enter our winter hiatus until January 8th. Instead, next week we'll present part one of our yearly awards column, with the bestest and the worstest of everything from 2015. So there's that to look forward to! Seeing as how Christmas (and New Year's Day) falls on a Friday, and seeing as how we tried writing Friday holiday columns once and then swore never to do it again, there will be no column at all for the last two Fridays of the year. Happy holidays, everyone, and allow us to mention once again that it is also our holiday pledge drive season! Because of the Friday holidays, part two of our year-end awards column will run the Wednesday before Christmas, December 23rd. Got all that? Next week, awards part one. Following Wednesday, awards part two. Christmas and New Year's Day, no column. See you back here January 8th!OK, enough of that, let's get on with the show. Today's theme is, of course: ""Donald Trump's candidacy is not funny anymore."" Or maybe: ""We're through the looking glass now."" Or a Wizard Of Oz theme, perhaps? ""Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.""However you put it, we're in for a whirlwind of a campaign, that's for sure. Things are almost guaranteed to get even crazier, at this point. A radicalized Christian terroristBefore we get to all the Trump news, we first have to point out one glaring double-standard in the media.""When are members of the media going to call the Colorado Planned Parenthood shooter what he truly is? After his outbursts in his first court appearance, there is simply no further doubt that he is nothing more than a Christian terrorist. He used murderous violence because his religious sensibilities were offended. That is religious terrorism, which needs to be pointed out in no uncertain terms. In fact, I would go farther, and ask why the media is not feverishly investigating where he was radicalized and what organizations radicalized him to commit his act of terror. To call this anything less is an insult to the victims."" White supremacists for Trump!OK, on with the Donald-bashing.""I see that white supremacist groups are enjoying a bonanza of attention as a result of Donald Trump's campaign. One of the major online white supremacist sites even had to upgrade their servers because the traffic was spiking so high every time Trump came out with another xenophobic policy proposal. At this point, it looks like Trump has locked in the white supremacist vote, folks!"" Please turn out the lightsAn oldie but a goodie... guaranteed to strike fear into the hearts of any sane Republicans!""I hear that not only is the Republican Party worried that Donald Trump might just bolt and launch a third-party bid, but that Ben Carson is now saying he might just leave as well. Two third-party runs from the right would be extraordinary. One wonders whether this idea will catch on among all the Republicans running for their party's nomination. If everyone bolts and forms their own party, perhaps they'll need a sign at the exit door: 'Will the last Republican to leave please turn out the lights.' I'd bet the last one in the room would be Lindsey Graham, what do you think?"" Condemning Trump condemnationAn excellent example of why Republicans are quaking in their boots over having to react to Donald Trump these days.""The state Republican Party chair in New Hampshire shows why more Republicans aren't standing up to Donald Trump when he goes too far. She put out a forceful statement condemning Trump this week, stating: 'There are some issues that transcend politics. While my position (as party chairwoman) is certainly political, I am an American first. There should never be a day in the United States of America when people are excluded based solely on their race or religion. It is un-Republican. It is unconstitutional. And it is un-American.' Immediately after she took this strong stand, other Republicans called for her resignation. One in particular spoke approvingly of 'the situation in World War II, when we put the Japanese in camps,' and went on to say his party's state leader 'should resign as chairman of the Republican Party and run for chairman of the Democratic Party.' This backlash is precisely why so many Republican officeholders are so terrified of going on the record saying anything bad about Trump."" Can't buy me loveBush's campaign woes are mounting fast.""You know, there's a saying in the advertising world about how if the dogs won't eat the dogfood it doesn't matter how well you advertise it -- the product will fail. This seems to be the perfect metaphor for the Jeb Bush campaign, doesn't it? His super PAC has now spent a whopping 50 million dollars on ads, and in the latest national poll Bush was only pulling a laughable three percent. His polling average isn't much better these days, at 3.6 percent. And with all that money spent, if you type in JebBush.com to your browser, you will be automatically redirected to Donald Trump's campaign site -- because the Bush team forgot to spend 10 bucks registering the name. If I was a Bush donor, I'd be pretty upset about the return on investment Bush has so far managed."" Bush's lawyers can still deliver the snarkSomewhere in Bush's campaign there is a bright spark, it seems.""Jeb Bush and Donald Trump are having a battle of lawyers' letters, it seems. Trump's lawyer sent a threatening note warning about slandering The Donald, and Bush's lawyers shot back by filing a complaint that the Trump lawyer was illegally working for the Trump campaign. Some of this letter was pretty amusing, such as: 'Just as your client is attempting to quickly learn the basics of foreign policy, we wish you personally the best in your attempts to learn election law.' The funniest line was probably: 'Should your client actually be elected Commander-in-Chief, will you be the one writing the cease and desist letters to Vladimir Putin, or will that be handled by outside counsel?' Obviously there's somebody working for Bush with a snarky sense of humor -- one wonders why the author of this letter wouldn't be more effective at helping the super PAC guys write some better ads, in fact."" He-who-must-not-be-namedAnd, finally, the best putdown of the week.""Donald Trump isn't too popular in Great Britain these days, it seems. Not only is there a petition (with hundreds of thousands of signatures on it) for Parliament to ban him from the country as a hatemonger, he is also being widely compared to Voldemort. Which brought the following response from J. K. Rowling: 'How horrible. Voldemort was nowhere near as bad.' It didn't stop the jokes about Trump's hair being one of his horcruxes, though.""Chris Weigant blogs at: Follow Chris on Twitter: @ChrisWeigantFull archives of FTP columns: FridayTalkingPoints.comAll-time award winners leaderboard, by rank"

I was in my middle year in seminary at the Morehouse School of Religion of the Interdenominational Theological Center and I, and many others from Clark Atlanta University, Morris Brown College, Spellman College and Morehouse College were compelled to express our disbelief that those who publically beat Rodney King would not be prosecuted for their deeds. Spike Lee's film ""Malcolm X"" had premiered that year, so as we looked back to the fifties and sixties we were ready to take our turn at the wheel of social justice. We were reading poets and social scientists like Langston Hughes, who said; Out of the rack and ruin of our gangster death, the rape and rot of graft, and stealth, and lies, we, the people, must redeem the land, the mines, the plants, the rivers. The mountains and the endless plain-- All, all the stretch of these great green states-- And make America again! O, yes, I say it plain, America never was America to me, and yet I swear this oath-- America will be!On that day in 1992, hundreds of students tried to march to the Georgia State Capital but city officials, along with our elders from the civil rights movement thwarted our efforts to get off of campus that day. We marched in every direction only to be met by law enforcement. Confusion and frustration became the order of the day and private property was destroyed. We only wanted to be heard to be in solidarity with others around the country, to do our small part to make America, America to again! For communities of color in Northern California we are feeling eerily the same as those students. We see no climate or environmental justice in our streets. The Bay Area, although a global leader in the fight for our climate, still lags behind environmentally for communities of color like West and East Oakland, and Richmond. Trains, ships, cars and trucks moving people and commerce through six counties all converge in areas lived in by the working poor. Respiratory diseases like asthma, croup and cancer have grown rapidly in our area and we feel cornered in by yet another assault on the sustainability of life. Our conditions in the bay area are mimicked in too many communities of color throughout the US and indeed the world. That is why we join our voice with those from all over the globe who are in Paris right now fighting for bold and significant climate action at the COP 21 negotiations. The global south and its allies are leading the way in Paris, despite the fact that many of the most vulnerable countries like low lying nations Kiribati and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, have done little or nothing to cause the catastrophe at hand. In the United States we see this reality play out in our Black and Brown communities as well. According to the NAACP, 78% of Black citizens live within 30 miles of a coal-fired power plant. This means that Black children are seven times more likely to have asthma and other respiratory illnesses than their White counterparts. While the world pushes its leaders to action, Black and Brown communities in West Oakland are battling corporations working to bring coal through the port of Oakland. The same corporations paying to influence our governments globally are pushing to expand the fossil fuel industry locally. We know there is a better way, and we must continue to push for innovation and inclusion of all people in a clean energy economy. By accelerating a transition to a clean energy economy and away from dirty fossil fuels, we can not only reduce climate (and health) disrupting pollution, but also create millions of jobs in the coming years. We must set bold and attainable goals like transitioning to 50% clean energy by 2030, so that our country is powered by 100% clean energy by 2050. The West Oakland community demands it, our brothers and sisters in the Pacific and throughout the global south demand it, and the world demands it. As the talks in Paris draw to a close, we send our prayers and say that there will be no justice if we don't take action now. We stand ready to shoulder our responsibility to push climate justice here and around the globe.

5,RELIGION,Awakening the Golem,"Beth Benedix, ContributorAssociate Professor of Religious Studies, World Literature and...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/awakening-the-golem_b_8790268.html,"The first Golem story was told in medieval times. The most famous story, which I chose to retell, relates the adventures of the Golem of Prague, brought to life in the 1500s.",2015-12-12,2015-12-12-1449883748-8656198-Golem_by_Philippe_Semeria.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-12-12-1449883748-8656198-Golem_by_Philippe_Semeria-thumb.jpg,"R.L. Stine is big in our house right now, especially with the recent release of Goosebumps, the movie. Our last trip to the library, consequently, yielded Beware! (HarperCollins, 2002), a collection of stories--chosen and introduced by Stine--that scared and inspired him most as a child and a writer. Among them, Stine includes ""The Terrifying Adventures of the Golem."" Here's how he introduces the story:The Golem is a character from Jewish folklore that has always fascinated me. I've always considered the Golem to be the first Frankenstein monster--and the first superhero. He was a giant figure made of clay and earth and water brought to life to battle the enemies of the Jewish people.It's his use of the phrase ""first superhero"" that I latch onto, as I read this story to my boys, and his choice to name the golem's adventures ""terrifying"" in the story's title. It's the dual capacities of protection and destruction that strikes me in the creature Stine goes on to write about, this creature so familiar to the Jewish imagination, a creature brought to life by the legendary Rabbi Loew ""for one purpose--to help the Jews"" (158). Over the course of the story, the golem rights numerous wrongs done to the Jews of Prague at the emperor's bidding, his heroism culminating in his exposing a Czech peddler as a baby-murderer, a murder committed with the intention of perpetuating the blood libel. The exposure of the peddler results in the emperor's ""sending out a decree to his people... to leave the Jews alone."" Order restored, Rabbi Loew declares, ""The golem has served us well. Now it is time to put him to rest"" (165). While the golem sleeps, Rabbi Loew erases the aleph from the word ""emet"" (truth) inscribed on his forehead, effecting ""met"" (death).In his introduction, Stine alludes to the fact that the legend of the golem has a long and complicated history, with numerous iterations.  In the popular imagination, the Prague golem has become something like a stand-in for all of them, folding together the various strands of the story and conflating them into a cautionary tale of unleashed power that is also the ultimate underdog narrative. In his telling, Stine emphasizes the protective nature of the golem over the destructive acts he commits. Though Stine's narrator demonstrates a brief wave of anxiety when the golem is brought to life--he wonders, ""can such a giant truly be controlled?... has [the rabbi] made a horrifying mistake tonight?"" (158)--the anxiety morphs into fascination and admiration for this creature that he has come to think of as a man, and he is overcome by a ""wave of sadness"" (166) when Rabbi Loew lays him to rest. In contrast to other iterations of the legend, where the golem wreaks havoc and has to be chased down by Rabbi Loew, in this version, the golem's end is peaceful. His power is controlled, checked and contained. No unleashed fury here; this golem behaves to the end like the dutiful servant he is conjured up to be.    (https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Golem_by_Philippe_Semeria.jpg)With all due respect to Stine, master of all things terror, I have to confess that I'm wrestling with what makes this particular incarnation of the golem so terrifying. A superhero, to be sure, but... terrifying? Maybe I'm reading it wrong; after all, terrifying modifies ""adventures"" in Stine's title, not golem. Ah. Now it makes sense. Now it's the larger context surrounding the golem that's terrifying, his reason for being, the world that necessitates his creation. Like Stine, I'm fascinated by this story, by its contours and implications. For me, it's the magical element of this story that compels, the echoes of Genesis in the creation of the golem from breath and dust, the speaking into being a creature that is both protector and destroyer. But mainly, I'm fascinated by the way the legend forces us to think about the easy slippage between truth and death, just a silent letter to distinguish between them. What are we to make of the erasure of that aleph? Is it a causal relation we're being asked to see, that the loss of truth leads to death? Or are we being prompted to think of death as the ultimate truth, the truth spoken through that silent letter, the truth we fail to speak though it is written indelibly upon us? To me, the terror comes in contemplating this legend in the midst of so much gratuitous death, the truth staring us full in the face with each mass shooting, each terrorist attack, each despotic regime, each instance of police brutality, each sweeping insult cast against whole populations, each literal and metaphorical murder. It comes in the fatalism and resignation, the acceptance, with which we greet so much violence. Maybe, in the end, what's most terrifying about Stine's version of the story is that he depicts a world in desperate need of a golem, a world I find all-too-reminiscent of the one we're living in. With so much golem-worthy history to learn from, it seems to me we should have evolved well beyond the need for a golem by now. Instead, each day's news brings more and more examples of savagery, physical, verbal and emotional. The cumulative effect numbs and hardens us. Like Stine's narrator, we look on, captivated as the carnage spills out before us, coming to accept it as a given, as inevitable, as truth. And maybe this is the most terrifying thing about Stine's version of the story: the ease with which truth slides into death, in sleepy oblivion, without putting up a fight."

After applying for a waiver for flexibility from the Bush-era No Child Left Behind law, Vermont has changed its mind and pulled the application, saying the waivers aren't as flexible as the state thought. (AP Photo/Toby Talbot, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb927eb3c000032000e1071.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This has been a hard year for poor children and children of color in a gridlocked and cantankerous Congress. The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) replacing the No Child Left Behind Act was enacted after gutting a strong federal role in education policy designed to protect these children and jeopardizing their opportunity for a fair and adequate education to prepare them for work in our globalizing economy. Over the past 50 years, under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, too many states violated their responsibility to serve their poor and non-White children equitably, did not comply with the law and misused huge amounts of the funds intended for poor children for other purposes. With the loss of federal accountability in the new Act, I hope we will not see the mistakes of the past repeated and poor children fall further behind.In 1969 the Children’s Defense Fund’s parent body, the Washington Research Project and the Legal Defense Fund, conducted a thorough study of how funds from Title I of the landmark Elementary and Secondary Education Act were being spent through on-the-ground monitoring and examination of federal audit reports from states. In our report, Title I ESEA: Is It Helping Poor Children?, we answered a resounding “no” as states widely used federal money as general state aid for all their children without targeting it to eligible children most in need, sometimes to maintain still segregated and unequal schools, and squandered money intended to lift achievement levels of poor children on things like swimming pools in suburban White schools.Massive and continuing state and local violations of accountability and poor achievement levels for the neediest children resulted in passage during the George W. Bush Administration of the No Child Left Behind Act with bipartisan support including Senator Ted Kennedy and Congressman George Miller — which attempted to build in a much needed stronger federal accountability role. The new Every Student Succeeds Act begins a new era but without needed federal accountability and relying on hopes that all states will fulfill their crucial responsibility to educate all their children fairly and prepare them for work and life. To ensure we do not repeat the mistakes of the past, all of us — every parent, child and community advocate who cares about our nation’s future — will have to work very very hard.It is a national threat when we look at how our children in public schools are performing in the fourth and eighth grades in 2015 and see more than 75 percent of lower income children, more than 80 percent of Black children and more than 73 percent of Latino children cannot read or compute at grade level. What is a child going to do in a competitive globalizing world if he cannot read and compute at very basic levels, is unable to graduate from high school, or is shunted into a Cradle to Prison Pipeline™ accelerated by unjust zero tolerance school discipline and misdirected special education policies?There is some good news in the new Act. Thanks to the leadership of Senator Patty Murray and Representative Bobby Scott, working with Senator Lamar Alexander and Representative John Kline, some of the most harmful proposals were excluded including one that would have diverted Title I funds from high poverty to low poverty schools — the portability provision. The new law requires states to continue to track the performance of all children and subgroups of children by race, ethnicity, disability, and English language learners, with data breakdowns by gender. While states will set their own goals and timelines for academic progress, their plans will require federal approval. States will be required to help fix schools where student test scores are in the lowest five percent, where achievement gaps are greatest, and in all high schools where fewer than 67 percent of students graduate on time using evidence-based programs approved by the U.S. Department of Education.The Act takes significant positive steps to help students in foster care who have not had targeted attention before by state and local education agencies. Although public child welfare agencies have had obligations for ensuring educational stability for these children for a number of years, the new law helps ensure their school stability and educational success. This should help prevent students from needlessly changing schools — falling further and further behind with each move. It ensures they can remain in their same school when they enter foster care and change placements unless it is not in their best interest. It also requires these children be immediately enrolled in a new school without the typically required records when a school change is necessary to eliminate gaps in their education, and encourages the prompt transfer of records when a child in foster care enters a new school. Both school districts and child welfare agencies must have reciprocal points of contact for students in foster care, and both systems must have a point of contact for them at the state level. Local education and child welfare agencies also must collaborate to develop and implement a plan for transportation for those students who will need it to remain in their school of origin. New data on high school graduation rates for students in foster care will help track their progress.There are important improvements in the Act for more than 1.3 million children and youth experiencing homelessness also focusing on school stability and success. State and local education agencies must ensure their Title I plans promote identification, enrollment, attendance and school stability of these children. Local education agencies must reserve a portion of their education funding to support homeless children. State report cards must include disaggregated information on graduation rates and other achievement measures for these children. The new Act increases by more than 20 percent the authorized funding level for the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Program which offers critical protections for homeless children.As hard as it has been for poor and other vulnerable children to move ahead and to make adequate progress even with federal accountability, it will be even harder without it. Parents, community leaders, public officials and child advocates must hold state, district and school leaders accountable for establishing and meeting performance targets for children. They must join with state and local education agencies to insist on increased resources to address the needs of the most vulnerable children. Child advocates and parents must ask for and review state and local school plans and notify the U.S. Department of Education and local media if they think school districts are neglecting some children or violating the new law. At stake are millions of children’s hopes, lives and futures. Those unable to read and compute and graduate from high school are being sentenced to social and economic death. They deserve better in the world’s biggest economy."

Becker, Contributor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-world-has-spoken-in-p_b_8794376.html,"The future that this generation hands to the next ultimately depends not on our dignitaries and diplomats, but rather on the concrete actions of states and localities, businesses, investors, entrepreneurs, philanthropists, educators, scientists, ecological engineers, utility regulators, legislators, city councils and individual energy consumers.",2015-12-12,2015-12-12-1449950348-4635176-ScreenShot20151212at8.55.58PM.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-12-12-1449950348-4635176-ScreenShot20151212at8.55.58PM-thumb.png,"PARIS - The world made history at approximately 7:25 p.m. Paris time on Saturday when 195 nations did something that had never been done before. They all agreed on something.The ""something"" is really something: a global commitment to confront global climate change after 21 years of diplomatic wrangling. In the plenary hall at a former airport in Paris, there were tears among the hundreds of delegates and support staff who worked for years toward this achievement, climaxing in more than two weeks of around the clock effort to reach that moment on Saturday. Among them were a tired Secretary of State John Kerry and an obviously delighted Al Gore, who has dedicated years of his life and has taken enormous abuse for his efforts to persuade the world that climate action threatens our survival. The talking heads around the world will talk for weeks to come about whether the agreement is strong or weak, aggressive or reticent, the pinnacle of diplomacy or another lost opportunity, a reason for hope or for disappointment. However, some of the agreement's importance already is evident. For the first time, all nations - rich, poor and in between -- have agreed on a universal plan to reduce the emissions that cause global warming. In the past, it was only advanced economies like the United States and Europe that were expected to cut their carbon pollution. Less developed countries now have joined the effort with specific commitments to control their emissions even though they need energy in abundance to give their people such basics as modern sanitation, clean water and electricity. Second, the Paris deal sends an unmistakable message from the world's leaders that the era of fossil fuels is over. To one degree or another, the fossil energy sector is a group of dead industries walking. That message is not only evident between the lines of the Paris agreement; it is also the practical implication of agreement's goal to keep atmospheric warming to as low as 1.5C above preindustrial levels and to put the world's carbon cycle back into balance during the second half of the century.Third, it is clear that the goals and commitments in the Paris agreement are not nearly adequate to achieve the 1.5C goal, or even the now obsolete goal of 2C. The agreement is a starting point rather than an end point. Whether its aspirations are realized depends on many undecided things, including whether richer countries will provide poorer countries with enough financial assistance to help them build low-carbon energy systems and adapt where possible to climate changes already underway. That is not an issue of too little money; international action to end fossil energy subsidies would do most of the job, but that commitment is not in the current agreement. Nevertheless, as several environmental leaders put it after the final text was written, it ""signals that governments are committed to finally getting in line with climate science"", it ""puts the fossil energy industries on the wrong side of history"" and while it does not ""dig us out of the hole we're in, it makes the sides much less steep"".   In the United States, the impressive unanimity behind this agreement further marginalizes the denial camp, including the members of Congress who busied themselves during the Paris conference by passing meaningless resolutions to persuade other nations that they cannot count on America's promises. In stark contrast to the morality displayed in Paris, the denial caucus in Congress shamelessly exhibited the rot that big money has brought to America's political system. * * *While the climate agreement makes history, the reality is that the situation coming out of Paris is much the same as it was going in: The future that this generation hands to the next ultimately depends not on our dignitaries and diplomats, but rather on the concrete actions of states and localities, businesses, investors, entrepreneurs, philanthropists, educators, scientists, ecological engineers, utility regulators, legislators, city councils and individual energy consumers. That is why ""sending a signal"" to the world outside Paris was a frequent theme at the climate conference. The principal practical significance of the agreement is to put an effective end to any reasonable doubt that the problem is real, that it already is upon us, and that the world must shift as rapidly as possible to a global carbon-free energy economy. The importance of civil society and ""subnational"" governments, as state and local governments are called in these events, is evident in the world's three biggest carbon polluters. In China, the world's No. 1 source of greenhouse gas pollution, the transition to clean energy depends on unrelenting pressure from the people in the streets who are threatened with early death by the air they are forced to breathe. That pressure appears to be one of the reasons China agreed for the first time to concrete carbon-cutting goals.In the European Union, ranked No. 3 on the carbon polluter list, leaders have set a target for using clean energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but they have left the details to each of the EU's 28 Member States. In the United States, the world's No. 2 source of carbon pollution, states and cities have most of the legal authorities to create a clean energy economy. Building codes, utility regulations, transportation investments, urban planning and zoning, state and local tax incentives, PACE and utility financing for energy efficiency and renewable energy investments in homes and businesses, urban forestry to reduce heat-related deaths - the list goes on - are the most powerful tools in our toolbox for building a cleaner, more secure, more moral, more biologically rich, more prosperous, more responsible and more life-embracing future.The Paris agreement codifies a universal goal but as always, the future is in the hands of the people. The votes of the American people in next year's presidential, congressional and statehouse elections will determine whether we build upon or backslide from the climate and energy policies the Obama Administration has created. In other words, it is up to us whether the United States will live up to and continue improving upon the promises in Paris. The jury is out, as they say. While polls show that most Americans now accept that climate change is real, most still don't grasp the immediacy of its impacts on their lives. Yet climate change already is wasting billions of taxpayer dollars -- $160 billion for disaster recovery alone in the last three years to be precise. It is creating more government regulations; increasing insurance rates; causing asthma and other respiratory problems in more kids; pushing up food prices because of drought; and destroying homes, lives and livelihoods with record fires, floods, landslides, and monster storms.

Reid Ribble (R-Wis.) is willing to both bash Donald Trump and rule out supporting him if he becomes the party's nominee.""My first oath is to the Constitution of the United States. Donald Trump has taken positions contrary to that document, so I could not support him and uphold my oath,"" Ribble told ""So That Happened,"" the HuffPost Politics podcast. Top Republicans share Ribble's disdain for Trump's call to ban Muslims from traveling to the U.S., but have stopped short of saying they wouldn't support him should he become the party's presidential nominee.Maybe it's easier for Ribble because he's had a running start. In September, he called Trump ""a 3-year-old."" The idea for a Muslim travel ban is Trump's worst tantrum yet. ""Words like that violate the moral conscience of a nation,"" Ribble said. ""The idea that we would create a religious litmus test in this country is astoundingly offensive to me."" Though just about everyone agrees Trump's suggested Muslim ban crosses a line, other Republican presidential candidates have made similar suggestions. Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush, for instance, have said they don't want the U.S. to accept Muslim refugees from Syria, but that they would take Christians. Ribble said he didn't love the idea of preferred treatment for Christian refugees, but the fact that Syrian Christians are persecuted for their faith made it an excusable thing to propose.""We have, throughout our history, stood up for various people groups and religious groups that have come under attack, and we have allowed refugees to come into our country as a response to those attacks,"" Ribble said. ""I think you can make a bit of a distinction because of the nature and how heinous the crimes have been committed against Christians, particularly in Syria and in Libya.""This podcast was produced, edited and engineered by Adriana Usero and Peter James Callahan, with assistance from Christine Conetta.To listen to this podcast later, download our show on iTunes.

9,POLITICS,Most Americans Reject Trump's Muslim Ban,Janie Velencia,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-muslim-ban-poll_us_5669f83de4b009377b24719f,"Republicans like Trump's plan more than Democrats do, a new poll shows.",2015-12-11,Nearly six in 10 Americans oppose Donald Trump's plan to ban Muslims from entering the U.S.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5669f9c41600002c00eb88ca.jpeg?cache=r2BTvdSOvl&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A solid majority of Americans opposes Donald Trump's plan to ban Muslims from entering the U.S., but Republicans are divided on the proposal, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released Thursday. Fifty-seven percent of Americans said they were against the “proposal to bar Muslims from entering the U.S.” and 25 percent supported it. Three in four Democrats opposed Trump's plan, but Republicans were split. Thirty-eight percent of GOP primary voters favored the proposal, and 39 percent opposed it. A Bloomberg/Purple Strategies poll released Wednesday also found a majority opposed to Trump’s “temporary ban on all Muslims who are citizens of foreign countries from entering the United States.” But that poll showed a stark divide among Republicans and Democrats. Sixty-five percent of likely Republican primary voters were in favor of the plan, while 22 percent were opposed. Among likely Democratic primary voters, 75 percent opposed the plan and 18 percent favored it. This difference in the two polls is likely due in part to the wording of questions. The WSJ/NBC poll question included more details of Trump's plan than did the Bloomberg/Purple Strategies poll.The WSJ/NBC poll also showed that a majority of Americans find Trump’s rhetoric offensive. Republicans, however, were far less put off.Only 16 percent of Republicans said Trump's comments are offensive, while 65 percent of Democrats said his remarks were ""insulting and wrong."" Thirty-seven percent of Republicans were bothered by his language, but said they think he is ""raising important issues."" Four of 10 Republicans said they think Trump is ""telling it like it is and has the right approach on many issues."" The political divide may reflect partisan opinions of Muslims. Half of Republican primary voters told pollsters they have a negative view of Muslims, while nearly four in five Democratic primary voters had a positive view of Muslims. Despite the overall disapproval of Trump's call for a ban on Muslim immigration, the poll showed it's unlikely to affect his standing. Fifty-one percent of Republican primary voters gave Trump a positive rating, while 26 percent gave him a negative one. Those numbers were unchanged from a WSJ/NBC poll conducted in October. WSJ/NBC surveyed 1,000 Americans, and a subgroup of 495 adults were asked specifically about Donald Trump and Muslims. The interviews were conducted by a live caller on landlines and cellphones Dec. 8 thru Dec. 9. Bloomberg/Purple Strategies surveyed 605 likely general election voters online through an opt-in panel representative of the population on Dec. 8.Also on HuffPost:"

The order, contingent on federal authorities sharing the lists with Malloy, is primarily intended to ""make us safer,"" he told ""CBS This Morning.""Malloy fired back at gun activists like the National Rifle Association, who criticized his decision for going beyond what is accepted by the constitution.""The governor knows full well that law-abiding Americans who pose no threat to national security are mistakenly on the terror watch list,"" Jennifer Baker, the NRA's director of Public Affairs, told the Hartford Courant.Although Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, the attackers who killed 14 people in San Bernardino, did not appear on any watch lists, the massacre renewed the push to curb gun sales nationwide.Malloy's concern stems from the fact that people on terrorism watch lists have been able to purchase guns 2,043 times, he said, citing a Government Accountability Office study. ""It doesn't make any sense,"" he added. ""And it's time to do something about it. It's time for right-thinking people to stand up.""Federal legislation is still necessary, Malloy said. ""There should be no gun sales without a background check. Of course that's part of the debate and I'm more than happy to move it further along.""""When the NRA can prevent Congress from passing common sense legislation, we're in trouble as a democracy. Overwhelmingly, people want to see some level of background checks,"" he insisted. ""Let's make America safer.""Malloy said his office is in the process of sharing their information with other states. They are also working with federal authorities in order to make terrorism watch lists, including the no-fly list, available for ""background check purposes only.""

Martin O'Malley knocked his rivals Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders for their immigration policies on Thursday. Unlike them, he said, ""I do not speak out of both sides of my mouth on this issue."" The former governor's remarks in Arizona were among his toughest against Clinton, a former secretary of state, and Sanders, a Vermont senator. O'Malley has touted his own immigration bona fides since the beginning of his campaign, but he's been largely overshadowed by the two front-runners, who have also adopted major immigration reform goals like a pathway to citizenship, deportation relief and an end to immigrant detention.Speaking outside of the Maricopa County Jail in Arizona -- run by Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who is famous for his stance against unauthorized immigrants -- O'Malley said Clinton and Sanders both lacked ""a formula for creating a new consensus"" on immigration reform.  ""We need new leadership that can speak to the goodness in America's heart,"" he said. ""Not the sort of worn-out politics of the past that triangulates in those polls and talks about immigration reform as if it's some sort of constituent trick that we do to placate this constituency. Tell people what they want to hear depending on what group they're in and election time.""""To hell with that,"" he continued. ""That does not serve our country's future."" He noted that Clinton and Sanders supported an amendment to a 2007 comprehensive immigration reform bill that was favored by labor groups but contributed to the legislation's failure. (President Barack Obama voted for the amendment as well.) Clinton voted for the final bill. Sanders voted against it, but supported a 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill. O'Malley also pointed out that Sanders voted in 2006 for a measure to protect Minutemen, volunteer militias that patrol the border. ""Senator Sanders, Secretary Clinton, say different things to different groups,"" he said.O'Malley's major positions on immigration are now largely similar to those of Clinton and Sanders. All three candidates say undocumented immigrants should be allowed to gain citizenship and have pledged to expand deportation relief.All of them have also criticized mass immigrant detention, which was the goal of O'Malley's trip to Arizona. He said he would limit detention to only the most extreme cases and offer alternatives, like releasing individuals on bond, to the majority of people awaiting deportation rulings. He had harsh words for Republicans as well, especially GOP candidate Donald Trump, who recently said Muslims should be barred from entering the country and has previously called for mass deportation. ""In sharp contrast to the sort of fascist demagoguery that Donald Trump is practicing and spewing out in this presidential year, I came here to say that we are a great people,"" O'Malley said. ""And because we are a generous, and compassionate, and brave people ... we need to bring an end to the shameful and growing practice of immigrant detention centers.""Also on HuffPost:"
12,SCIENCE,Why Pulling All-Nighters For The U.N. Climate Agreement Is A Bad Idea,Carolyn Gregoire,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/climate-agreement-sleep-deprivation_us_566ae669e4b009377b24a441,Science shows that sleep deprivation can ruin your decision-making.,2015-12-11,French Foreign Affairs minister Laurent Fabius works in his office during the COP 21 United Nations Conference on climate change.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/566ae7651900002400789a39.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What are the U.N. Climate Chief's biggest concerns gearing up to the creation of the historic climate agreement on Friday? Aside from the challenge of coming up with ambitious yet realistic legally binding guidelines for carbon reductions, and the significant financial concerns associated, she's seriously concerned about sleep deprivation. U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change Chief Christiana Figueres said that her big concern is that the negotiators getting enough rest and staying focused, according to Energy Guardian. She's got a very good point.Like college kids cramming for a final exam, the Paris negotiators are reportedly pulling all-nighters to finalize the climate agreement. The stakes are high, as the talks have been described as the last chance to avert runaway climate change before it's too late. While the delegates have spend two weeks crafting a broad skeleton of the deal, a lot of the nitty-gritty details have been left until the eleventh hour -- as is usually the case.""United Nations negotiators are notorious for leaving everything to the last minute,"" Coral Davenport wrote for The New York Times last month. ""Once the climate talks go into overtime, they do not stop. The diplomats keep negotiating through the night, the morning, the next day, the next night, the next morning until they finish or concede failure.""This is a little disconcerting. No matter how capable the negotiators are or how high their stamina, they're still human beings who require sleep in order to function. As science unequivocally shows, sleep deprivation can seriously mess with our ability to stay focused, make decisions, think clearly and remain emotionally even-keeled. ""Looking at sleep deprivation, we know that it can cause deficits in cognition as well as frustration,"" Dr. Michael Breus, clinical psychologist and diplomate of the American Board of Sleep Medicine, told The Huffington Post in an email. ""In fact there is data to suggest that ethical decision-making is directly affected by sleep deprivation.""A 2011 study from Duke University found that sleep deprivation affects the brain in such a way that we become less sensitive to losses. Brain regions that assess positive outcomes become more active, while parts of the brain that analyze negative outcomes become less active, which can lead to riskier decision-making. Another study found that sleep deprivation impairs our ability to integrate emotion and logic to guide our decision-making. When the Challenger space shuttle exploded seconds after its launch in 1986, it was later revealed that key managers involved in the launch had slept just two hours before getting to work at 1 a.m. that day. And prior to the devastating 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, the ship's crew had pulled a 22-hour shift loading the oil onto the ship. A third mate fell asleep at the helm and didn't wake up until it was too late to avert disaster. If there's one lesson from these catastrophes that we can apply to the Paris talks, it's that it's probably best to have your mental faculties fully intact when you're trying to draft legislation that could save the world.

13,POLITICS,Pelosi Throws Cold Water On Tax Extenders Bill As Talks Run Down To The Wire,Laura Barrón-López,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nancy-pelosi-tax-extenders_us_566b0239e4b0f290e522eecd,"Pelosi said House Democrats ""will not be accomplices"" in voting for the tax package.",2015-12-11,"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) criticized the tax extenders bill for including ""hundreds of billions of dollars in permanent tax breaks for special interests and big corporations while neglecting hard-working families.”",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) came out swinging Friday against a massive tax extenders package Congress is hoping to pass before departing for holiday break.In the last week, Republicans and Democrats have gone back and forth over the tax package and a 1 trillion dollar omnibus spending bill. The spending bill needs to reach the president’s desk by the middle of next week to avoid a government shutdown. Lawmakers previously staved off a shutdown on Friday by passing a five-day continuing resolution, giving them more time to come to an agreement.Negotiations surrounding the two pieces of legislation have become intertwined, and Republicans leaders have indicated that the omnibus and tax extenders bills will come to the floor together in one large vehicle. That won't fly with Pelosi, who fiercely opposes the tax package in its current state. “I don’t see very much support on the Democratic side for the tax extender bill,” she continued. “It includes hundreds of billions of dollars in permanent tax breaks for special interests and big corporations while neglecting hard-working families.”If the tax bill gets tethered with the omnibus spending bill, Pelosi added she “wouldn’t vote for it” and would recommend her caucus doesn’t as well. Making the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit permanent has been a priority for Democrats in negotiations. While the Child Tax Credit is in the extenders package, Pelosi wants it to be indexed, meaning its benefits will rise with inflation -- something Republicans haven’t been responsive on.Another sticking point is the sheer size of the tax extenders package, which could cost upwards of $700 billion over the next decade. Republicans are also pushing hard to include a measure that would lift a 40-year-old ban on crude oil exports to the tax deal. “Lifting the ban on oil and all the money that that means for the oil industry, while they can’t index for children, it’s just, it’s too big,” Pelosi said. “It’s unfair, and it does not have the support of House Democrats.”While the White House doesn't want Congress touching crude oil exports, it is involved in negotiations to ensure anti-environmental riders are stripped and that other priorities for Democrats are met in exchange. The administration hasn't threatened a veto of the extenders bill if oil exports are attached. Republicans in the House have enough votes to attach it to the extenders bill even without Democratic support. The president would likely sign the bill despite House Democrats' opposition. “I made it clear, don’t count on our votes for that,” Pelosi said. “We will not be accomplices.”Still, Pelosi indicated she wouldn't stand in the way of the tax deal as long as Republicans bring it to the floor separately from the omnibus bill, adding she didn't want to have anything to do with the tax bill.

But after GOP candidate Donald Trump called this week for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, Flake said he wanted to show the community he doesn't feel the same way. So he and his family, who are Mormons, visited the Islamic Center of North East Valley in Scottsdale, Arizona, where Flake said the people were ""extremely welcoming."" Flake told HuffPost that after a sermon and prayers, the mosque's imam allowed him to share a ""message of solidarity."" ""We don't all feel the way a few politicians are talking,"" Flake said he told worshippers. He added, ""Muslim-Americans have made huge contributions to this country, they've fought alongside people of other faiths in every one of the wars they've fought, they are responders.""Flake said he encountered ""a few who said they were surprised that it was a Republican who reached out, but they were just very gracious about the whole thing."" Trump, the GOP presidential front-runner, has long said disparaging things about Muslims and a number of other groups. But he ramped up his rhetoric in the days after two shooters in San Bernardino, California, both Muslim, killed 14 people in what the FBI said it is investigating as an act of terrorism. Many Muslims immediately decried the shooting, and groups and families around the country raised $100,000 for families of the victims. Flake said some of the people at the mosque talked to him about the San Bernardino attack and how much it upset them. ""You have to feel for the Muslim-American community, with the suspicion that is cast after a violent event like happened in San Bernardino,"" Flake said. ""They said over and over again, the ones that talked to me there, they are aghast and dismayed and very upset with what happened there."" Flake said he invited the imam to visit his own church services, and the imam promised he would. Flake said earlier this week that Trump's comments on barring Muslims from entering the country were ""positively awful,"" but wouldn't say whether he would support Trump if he wins the GOP nomination. ""He's not going to be the nominee,"" Flake told reporters at the Capitol on Tuesday.Democratic presidential candidate and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley also visited a mosque and community center on Friday -- the All Dulles Area Muslim Society in Sterling, Virginia. By making his first trip to a U.S. mosque, Flake is ahead of another politician. President Barack Obama, according to Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), has never visited a U.S. mosque during his time as president.Also on HuffPost:"

""Only thing I could see was my life flash before my eyes, and the gun in the holster on his right side.""After she reported the assault to the police, an investigation was launched -- uncovering 12 other black women who said they too were victimized by Holtzclaw while he was on duty.On Wednesday night, after four days of deliberation, an all-white jury found Holtzclaw guilty of 18 out of 36 counts of sexual assault. He was ultimately convicted of counts associated with eight of the women, including four first-degree rape charges. He audibly sobbed as the verdict was read. It was his 29th birthday. Another victim, Sharday Hill, who was sexually assaulted while handcuffed to a hospital bed, said she was speechless and scared during the attack. ""I felt like I was in survival mode so I had to do what he was making me do,"" she said. Prosecutors argued that Holtzclaw purposely preyed on poor black women, many of whom had criminal records or drug addictions, because he knew they would be unlikely to report the assaults. ""It wasn't coincidence who he chose to violate, it was methodical and it was deliberate,"" said Benjamin Crump, a national civil rights attorney who stood side by side with victims and their families as they spoke to the press. ""Some might not consider them model citizens, but they were citizens. They were Americans, and their lives mattered.""

The cop reached out and “put his hand on my throat,” Muniz said. “That’s when I start freaking out. He tells me to stand up. And that’s when his grip on my throat got a little stronger and when I started really panicking.”Alarmed, Muniz pushed at the officer to get him “just a little bit off me,” he said. They tumbled to the ground and the officer “showered” the student with pepper spray, Muniz alleges in a civil lawsuit that’s still pending. The cop handcuffed him, he said, dragged him into a nearby security office by the cuffs and planted a knee in between his shoulder blades while delivering “multiple blows” as Muniz lay face down on a carpet.After it was over, the officer read the 17-year-old junior his rights and placed Muniz under arrest — for alleged misdemeanor assault on an officer.“He told me that I had ‘f’d up,’ ” Muniz said. “But I never wanted to fight.”In an initial substantive response in court, the school district claims that Muniz was “careless, reckless, and negligent,” and is the one to blame for any alleged injuries he suffered during the altercation.Muniz’s arrest in November 2012 sounds extreme, but it was hardly isolated.In fact, he was one of tens of thousands of juveniles arrested by school police in San Bernardino County over the last decade. The arrests were so numerous in this high-desert region known as the Inland Empire that they surpassed arrests of juveniles by municipal police in some of California’s biggest cities.The San Bernardino City Unified School District, where Muniz was a student, has its own police department, with 28 sworn officers, eight support staff and more than 50 campus security officers trained in handcuffing and baton use.The department made more than 30,000 arrests of minors between 2005 and 2014. The area has a reputation for youth-gang crime, but only about 9 percent of those arrests were for alleged felonies. Instead, the vast majority of arrests were for minors violating a variety of city ordinances — such as graffiti violations or daytime curfews — and for nearly 9,900 allegations of disturbing the peace. That’s a frequently-used catchall that raises questions among critics about whether most of these arrests were necessary for public safety.The bulk of the minors arrested or referred to school police represent some of the most academically vulnerable demographics in the state: low-income Latino and black kids, as well as kids with disabilities, in disproportionate numbers, according to California arrest statistics and national education data examined by the Center for Public Integrity.Based on 2011-2012 data collected from U.S. schools by the U.S. Department of Education, the latest available, Muniz’s Arroyo Valley High referred students to law enforcement at a rate of 65 for every 1,000 students. That was more than 10 times the national and California state rate of 6 per 1,000.Those kinds of statistics raise red flags for critics who charge that school officers in some districts, especially those with substantial minority and special-needs populations, are turning what should be minor disciplinary indiscretions into criminal justice matters that put kids on a road to bigger problems — the so-called ‘school-to-prison pipeline.” In San Bernardino, cops, school officials, parents and community groups have started wrestling with how to balance demands for order — and security — without criminalizing kids.There’s no state rule to define the role of school police, but some California districts have already taken steps to do that by imposing formal limits on police powers in school, and detailing what situations should require police involvement and what should be handled exclusively by educators.The roots of a trendThe ranks of school cops have grown nationally since the 1999 massacre of students and faculty at Columbine High School outside Denver. Some inner-city school districts have developed significant police agencies of their own and deployed them on campuses. The fear of terrorism and mass shootings like the rampage in San Bernardino this month all but guarantee that schools will continue to seek out ways to put police officers on campuses.But teens and officers don’t always understand each other, and kids can pay a price when cops’ own conduct gets aggressive.In October, students in South Carolina precipitated a federal civil-rights investigation with videos they surreptitiously shot of a school cop violently arresting a high school girl who’d been using her cell phone, tipping over her desk and dragging her across the floor.Last April, in the San Bernardino city district, an 8th grader was allegedly ordered to remove clothing and unhook her bra and shake her breasts to see if she was hiding marijuana, according to her mother, Anita Wilson-Pringle.A female vice principal led the search, Wilson-Pringle said, which the district defended as a routine “pat down.” But Wilson-Pringle alleges that a male campus security officer who works for district police allegedly stood nearby. The district police chief denied that but was unwilling to release an internal review the chief said had been done — not even to Wilson-Pringle. “I wonder how many other kids have been violated,” Wilson-Pringle said. State law prohibits strip searches by school employees.Muniz’s lawsuit alleges that the San Bernardino city school district failed to properly train and supervise the officer who confronted him, Mark Clark. Clark coaches wrestling in the district and this past summer was promoted to sergeant.In their defense, the district and Clark allege in court documents that Muniz “obstructed” a police officer, and that Muniz resisted arrest, causing Clark “to use only such force as was reasonably necessary … to overcome plaintiff’s resistance.”Dennis Popka, lawyer for Clark and the district, declined to comment on the case while it’s pending.Muniz, now 20, recalled his Mexican immigrant mother arriving at his school to find out how and why he’d been arrested and attempt to figure out what would happen next. Clark decided to write up his citation and release the boy to his mother pending his court date rather than put him in juvenile detention.Muniz’s mother signed papers in English she didn’t fully understand and burst into tears when she was allowed to see her son, and noticed his abrasions and swollen eyes. “I explained to her that I was hugging my girlfriend,” Muniz said. “It didn’t make sense to her. How could a situation have escalated so quickly?”Similar complaints of excessive school police intervention in other parts of the Golden State have pushed some prominent school districts to more narrowly define the role of school police on campuses and institute more oversight.The Los Angeles and San Francisco school districts now have agreements forged in 2013 and 2014, respectively, defining discipline as the responsibility of educators, not police, and instituting limits on officer interrogations, arrests and tickets.“Technically, a young person may commit a crime” by making threats, or getting into a physical fight, said Donna Groman, supervising judge of the delinquency division of Los Angeles County Juvenile Court. “It could be viewed as criminal conduct, but it might not be the type of conduct that really benefits a young person to be arrested and injected to the juvenile justice system.”Police arrests should be selective — reserved for the most serious incidents — because any exposure to the juvenile justice system is harmful to minors, Groman said.Groman arrived at her view from her experience as a judge. She also points to research finding that an arrest, a court appearance, and even brief detention, especially for minor infractions, actually increase a minor’s risk of dropping out and getting into more serious crime.“Whether it stops with just an arrest or a citation,” she said, “that doesn’t matter. The harm has already been done and it’s difficult to undo that harm. It’s the beginning of a young person becoming disengaged from school, which is one thing you’re trying to avoid.”Alarming statsIn San Bernardino County overall, where political support for law enforcement traditionally runs strong, data show that 37 percent of minors funneled into the criminal justice system for misdemeanors were put there by just two school police departments — San Bernardino’s and the Fontana Unified School District police. San Bernardino is the largest county in the nation, encompassing over 20,000 square miles and containing more than 20 distinct cities, vast swaths of unincorporated areas and 2.1 million people.Over the last 10 years, municipal cops in the city of San Bernardino have arrested just 6,923 minors in all, compared to the 30,000-plus arrests by school district police in the city. School cops do engage in enforcement off campus. But their primary turf is a district of about 54,000 students. City cops patrol a city of 215,000 residents.The state data also detail how few arrests by school police were for felonies.More than 27,000 of the 30,000-plus arrests of minors by San Bernardino school cops were for misdemeanor charges. About 36 percent of those were for disturbing the peace — a charge that can range from disruptive, loud behavior to physical fights.The data show that the department’s arrests did decline, from 4,043 in 2005 to 1,078 last year.But last year, based on state records, San Bernardino school cops still arrested more kids than municipal cops in Sacramento, Oakland or San Francisco. They even arrested more kids than police who patrol the nation’s second largest school district — Los Angeles Unified — which has a student body that’s more than 10 times larger than San Bernardino’s.“That level of arrests is an alarm,” said attorney Ruth Cusick of Public Counsel, an L.A.-based pro bono law group that has collaborated with Groman on school police reforms. Those who think it’s natural for police in schools to arrest more kids than regular cops, she said, are denying the harm it does to kids and to relationships with police.A steady stream of arrests, she said, “basically communicate[s] to students, ‘You’re not part of the community.’ ”Changing the MOSan Bernardino school police Chief Joe Paulino agreed to meet at Arroyo Valley High, where Josue Muniz was arrested in 2012, to discuss the historically high volume of arrests — and reforms he agrees are needed and that he says are underway.“I believe we’re emerging from that history,” Paulino said, “to this new place where we no longer believe that we have to attack these things [minor infractions] to be able to keep our youth safe. And we’re looking at it from not a zero tolerance to more of a tolerance to these behaviors.” The district in November started talks to identify circumstances that don’t merit police intervention, Paulino said. Officers are already mindful to follow a new “matrix” calling for students to get an opportunity to correct misbehavior — like a first-time fight — before they face arrest.Paulino also said officers are now handing out “positive tickets” and prizes to students identified as having done good deeds. The practice is part of a “different mindset,” he said, that police are developing.There’s still a maxim posted on the department’s website that says the purpose of citations — the real ones that put kids into the justice system for alleged crimes — “is not to punish them but to help them change bad behavior patterns.”“I don’t believe that anybody should be handcuffed because they’re kissing,” he said. “However, it if turns into where I request that you go to class and it becomes violent, then again, we as police officers have the right to be able to defend ourselves as well as others we believe may be injured by another’s action.”Trouble in FontanaElsewhere in San Bernardino County, there are other signs of problematic school policing.Offices with the 40,000-student Fontana Unified School District, not far from the city of San Bernardino, arrested 10,741 juveniles over the last decade, a volume that also surpassed the 7,474 arrests of minors by Fontana city police.Fontana school cops run the Fontana Leadership Intervention Program, a counseling and boot-camp program for students identified at school or in court as “at-risk.” In 2012, an officer who coordinated the FLIP program, which took kids on trips to colleges and prisons, was fired because he had allegedly boasted of having sex with mothers of kids in the program, according to documents in lawsuits filed by school staff. In the community of Chino, the case of a student with Down syndrome who was arrested at his high school exemplifies concerns at the legal-defense group Disability Rights California that special-needs kids are getting criminalized at school.Krystine Roldan, the guardian and sister of the student with Down syndrome, was shocked when she received word that her brother Christian had been arrested in 2013 at Ayala High School in the Chino Valley Unified School District. He was charged with resisting a peace officer. Roldan said she found her 16-year-old brother “crumpled up” and hogtied, inside the back of a sheriff’s vehicle.“His hands are behind his back and his feet are tied together with handcuffs and they’re connected and he’s sweating. He’s crying,” Roldan recalled. “I kept saying you guys have to let him go. He has breathing issues.” The deputies said Christian had made threats. Roldan pointed out that Christian can only respond to questions with one- or two-word answers.Ayala’s school resource office — a county sheriff’s deputy on contract — wrote up a report about an incident that led to Christian’s arrest.Christian left class to go to the bathroom, unsupervised, and was later found sitting in an outside area on two airsoft guns, replica firearms that shoot plastic pellets. Roldan said she doesn’t know where he got the airsoft guns. The school officer doesn’t speculate in her report. A teacher picked up the prohibited replica guns, and Christian walked with him to the police office.The officer was told he had Down syndrome. She began questioning the teen about the guns. She wrote that he appeared agitated, “had his hands clenched in fists” and “would not cooperate with my commands.” She wanted to search him for any other weapons. He “mouthed” a profanity. She called for more deputies, and they “escorted him to the floor to gain control of his arms and body.”Christian was restrained, searched and taken to a patrol vehicle. “No additional contraband was found on his person,” the resource officer wrote. Yet he was arrested.After sitting in a jail cell with his sister, Christian was released to his sister that day, but out of school for months. Therapists said it was too traumatic for him to return to the school, but the district said it couldn’t find another suitable placement for him, until after Roldan contacted Disability Rights for help, she said. She also had to take Christian to juvenile court two times to answer to his criminal charge before a judge was satisfied he had Downs Syndrome and dismissed the case.“I thought they were there to protect him,” Roldan said of educators and police. He’s still terrified of police, she said, and she’s worried he won’t ask for help when he needs it.National data show that the Chino Valley district referred students to law enforcement at rate of 21 for every 1,000 pupils during the 2011-2012 year — more than three times the national rate of 6 per 1,000. Disabled students were referred at a rate of 61 students per 1,000 kids, compared to a national rate of 14 per 1,000.Chino Valley schools’ risk and safety manager Dan Mellon spoke for the district.Confidentiality laws, he said, bar him from addressing Christian’s arrest. But he explained that the district contracts with local police agencies for school resource officers and those officers decide if a student should be arrested in connection with incident.“We’re not going to interfere with a sworn officer’s duties,” he said. And if the school didn’t file a charge, administrators have no influence to get it dropped, he said.In the San Bernardino district, Ray Culberson, director of the Youth Services program, is trying to ensure that changes occur in both disciplinary procedures and decisions to arrest kids. He grew up in tough circumstances here and feels that kids got more breaks back then than they do now.Culberson is pushing for school leaders, campus by campus, to institute “restorative justice” circles, where students and staff air grievances about incidents and amends can be made.With the backing of the district attorney’s office in San Bernardino County, he also recently started an informal district “youth court” that he’s urging both principals and police to make use of; they can send kids to this mock court rather than expelling them or sending them into real court. Juries of peers will try kids — if they admit to misconduct — and impose consequences such as an essay of apology, a visit to a hospital or a ride with police on patrol. If they fail, then they face the official system.In October, a homeless boy, 13, facing possible expulsion, was tried for bringing a lighter to school and smoking cigarettes. He was told to write an essay, among other amends.Culberson said he knows not everyone in the district is sold on reforms that include having to train in new ways to resolve conflict, like restorative justice, which take time that teachers often say they don’t have. Adults habitually say they want to do “what’s in the best interest of kids,” he said. “Do we do that? We don’t do that with 100 percent fidelity.”At a downtown San Bernardino County office, juvenile probation officers, some of whom are also posted right on campuses, said they approve of a lot of the new ideas. They also said they think schools have already been working hard to get students plenty of support before they end up arrested.Kids arrested on first-time misdemeanors in this county can go to court if they want to contest a charge. But if they admit to a charge, they can get a “diversion” to probation officers, a less formal procedure, and receive referrals for counseling — as well as consequences for what they did, such as mandatory community service.Officer Maria Barton said school cops care, and frequently consult with her before making an arrest. But there are times, she said, when cops have to “deal with the instant moment,” and may have to subdue and arrest kids — and ask questions later.But does she think a school cop should intervene if kids are hugging, as Officer Clark allegedly did when he saw Muniz and his girlfriend? At most, that’s a violation of school rules.“Absolutely,” Barton said. “Any adult who works on a school campus is entitled to anything that deals with those kids. If it’s a custodian, an administrator, a teacher, a clerk, a probation officer, a police officer, when we see something inappropriate it should be addressed.”There’s quite a bit of inappropriate hugging on campuses, Barton said, and parents want to know that officers are keeping their kids safe.But did the officer go too far?Kimberly Epps, another probation officer, said it’s difficult to judge without knowing the details. All adults on campus have to watch out for sexual harassment, she said. And she advises juveniles that when a cop gives you orders the best course of action is “to cooperate in the situation and do what’s being asked of you — and it doesn’t go, perhaps, where it doesn’t need to go.”Ironically, Muniz said, the day he was arrested he was trying to stay safe. He was sitting in the vicinity of Officer Clark’s office because some “gangster” kids had been picking on him and his mother wanted him to stay close to security while out on the quad.He’d never been in trouble with police, he said, and he was startled at how angry Clark allegedly appeared to be when he came over after the second hug.“It was actually a pretty big event in my life,” Muniz said of the arrest. “I think if it weren’t for that, a lot of things would be different right now.”Because of the seriousness of the charge, Muniz said, a vice principal he got along well with had no choice but to recommend he be expelled. But at the school-based hearing, Muniz said, “his face was showing regret more than anything else.” Officer Clark spoke out against Muniz at the hearing, identifying him as the aggressor, and to Muniz appeared “the only one determined to win” the recommendation to expel him.Ultimately, Muniz prevailed, and the school expulsion panel decided not to eject him from the district. It helped, he said, that his girlfriend had quickly used Google while he was in custody at school, and found him a lawyer. When he went to court later, he said, the fact that he was spared from expulsion seemed to help. Prosecutors decided not to pursue the case and the charge was dropped.By that time, though, he felt he’d been stigmatized.He’d missed a lot of class time. He’d been forced to transfer to a special campus for troubled kids that he didn’t like. He and the girlfriend drifted apart. He ended up dropping out, his confidence shaken. He regrets it now, but at the time it seemed like nobody cared. He wants to pursue a GED diploma, but time is limited, as he needs to work and is constantly scrambling to get temporary jobs at warehouses here that are big employers.But Muniz also said he lost something else with his arrest. Not long before, he was at church with his mother and conversed with a police officer about his career. He began dreaming of becoming a cop. But he says now that he couldn’t stand by and “keep my mouth shut” if he saw a fellow cop abusing people.He decided to pursue his lawsuit, which is slowly moving along with pre-trial motions, because he felt that Officer Clark thought he was “basically, nobody.” The legal challenge, he said, has helped him feel that’s not true.“It’s like the only way” he said, “that I feel like I have some sort of power.”This story is part of Criminalizing kids.

19,POLITICS,"The Economy Is Improving, So Washington Has Decided It's Time To Screw You",Shahien Nasiripour,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/economy-improving-screw-you_us_566b06a8e4b009377b24c556,Congress and the Obama administration seem to believe U.S. households don't need further protection from the financial industry.,2015-12-11,"President Barack Obama, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) appear to have decided that financially distressed Americans don't need any more help.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/566b42bf1600002b00eb8a7b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Congress appears to think the U.S. economy has improved so much that it’s time to turn the screws on American households.Convinced that consumers and household borrowers needed more protection from the financial industry in the aftermath of the financial crisis, Congress and the Obama administration restricted the use of so-called “gotcha” credit card fees and created a new federal agency devoted to protecting consumers from unscrupulous financial companies.But with the U.S. economic expansion in its seventh year and the unemployment rate poised to drop below 5 percent, Washington policymakers are discontinuing aid to household borrowers and paring back key protections -- much to the delight of creditors.Consider three recent examples:On Nov. 2, President Barack Obama signed into law a bill that allows Department of Education loan contractors to bombard federal student loan borrowers’ cell phones with texts, pre-recorded messages and autodialed calls without borrowers’ consent, gutting a key consumer protection. Harassing borrowers in this manner won't save the government much money: The White House estimates the proposal will generate just $12 million annually in additional revenue. The Congressional Budget Office projects the federal government will collect even less -- below $500,000 annually, or a bit more than 1/100,000th of 1 percent of the government’s fiscal year 2015 revenue.“We’re still climbing out of a recession and Congress is attacking the very pillars we put in place to help us climb out of the recession,” said Ed Mierzwinski, who leads consumer advocacy efforts for U.S. PIRG, the Federation of State Public Interest Research Groups. “They’ve turned their back on American consumers and borrowers.”Justin Stark, a 35-year-old Ohio man struggling to pay back his private student loans, is one of many financially distressed Americans whose plight is being ignored by federal lawmakers.Beginning in 2001, Stark took out about $60,000 in loans from Sallie Mae to pay for classes at the University of Akron. The first in his family to attend college, Stark said he and his parents were duped into taking out Sallie Mae loans in lieu of more generous loans from the federal government.After years of attending school both full- and part-time, along with a few years off from school after earning a promotion at a local Target store, Stark graduated in 2012 with a degree in business and public relations.Stark now owes more than $90,000 and has to make payments of about $717 per month, which he said is close to 35 percent of his take-home pay. The Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University says that spending 30 percent of one's income on rent constitutes a financial burden.Stark's wife isn’t working because she recently gave birth to their second child. The lack of additional income has helped cause Stark to fall behind by about three months on his student loans, which are serviced by Navient Corporation, a former Sallie Mae unit that ranks as the nation’s largest student loan specialist.Navient has ignored Stark's pleas for help. One time, however, the company offered to temporarily reduce his required payment in exchange for direct access to his checking account and lengthening his repayment period by an extra 10 years -- to 2037. Stark declined the company’s offer.Navient employees have told him to borrow from friends and family in order to make his full payment, he said. One Navient employee told Stark to pay the company before paying his utility bills, on the grounds that he had student loans before he had an electricity bill. Stark said he sometimes has trouble sleeping due to his student debt.Patricia Christel, a Navient spokeswoman, didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment.Stark said Navient robocalls his cell phone on a daily basis to remind him of his obligations, interrupting his business meetings. His parents, who co-signed some of his loans, get up to 10 calls a day, even on weekends, he said.But nearly every time he picks up the phone, hoping to talk to a Navient employee who will reduce his required monthly payment, Stark said he's greeted with a pre-recorded message instructing him to call the company’s collections division.“The fact that they can set up a dialer to call you for collections and not even have staff on the other end to discuss things with you -- in my mind, that is the worst possible abuse,” Stark said.The robocalling provision Obama signed into law on Nov. 2 would allow Navient and other Education Department loan contractors to flood 41.6 million more Americans -- who collectively owe $1.2 trillion on their federal student loans -- with similar calls.Stark said he pays Navient when he can, but the size of the payment relative to his income, combined with the fact that his wife is not working, have caused him to fall behind. “I’m forced to make partial payments to Navient rather than scrounging together 50 bucks to pay for groceries or pay my electric bill,” he said.Thanks to a 2005 law that severely restricted borrowers’ ability to discharge their private student loans in bankruptcy, Stark has few options. He believes there’s a chance Navient will eventually attempt to garnish his wages.One federal lawmaker who represents Stark, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), has introduced legislation that would enable borrowers with private student loans to refinance their debt into federal loans. Government-backed student loans offer struggling borrowers the option to make payments based on their monthly income.Brown’s bill went nowhere. Consumer advocates worry that Congress and the Obama administration will do little to enact new legislation authorizing additional aid for Americans like Stark, especially since the economy is slowly improving.Still, Congress had no reservations helping Navient, one of the nation’s biggest debt collectors -- despite being well aware of its problems. In February, the Education Department announced it would wind down its contract with Pioneer Credit Recovery, a Navient subsidiary, and stop sending it new accounts after a government audit revealed that Pioneer had misled borrowers at “unacceptably high rates.”Yet in December, after Obama signed a bill passed by Congress into law to allow the IRS to outsource some tax collection to private debt collectors, analysts at Barclays and Compass Point Research & Trading LLC forecast that Navient will likely be a beneficiary of the resulting government contracts.“We’re talking about industries where we have documented so many abuses of consumers, yet somehow we have these new policies that essentially amount to corporate handouts,” said Christine Hines, legislative director for the National Association of Consumer Advocates. “Instead of reining them in, they’re getting more freedom to harass consumers.”Also on HuffPost:"

Minnesota was violating the state constitution by allowing groups of students to inhabit separate and inherently unequal schools, according to the lawsuit. A judge ruled in favor of Shulman and the plaintiffs he represented. In November, Shulman and his son filed a similar lawsuit in another attempt to desegregate Minnesota's highly divided schools. Since 1995, the problem has only continued, Shulman says. The lawsuit demands that the state take action to remedy this inequality. This time, Shulman -- who is representing seven families and a community organization -- is hoping for lasting change. In 1995, after Shulman settled his previous case, Minneapolis public schools created a program that allowed 2,000 low-income kindergarten students to start school in a more affluent, suburban district. But the program did not prompt widespread change.""We had hoped that that program would be a first step to achieving meaningful desegregation and integration,"" said Shulman. ""Instead, the state didn’t take the second step, the third step or fourth step, they started working backward. Today we have segregation even worse than it was when we brought the first case.""The lawsuit seeks class action status for children in Minneapolis public schools and St. Paul public schools, and names the state of Minnesota and public officials like the governor and education commissioner as defendants. While Shulman specifically avoided taking the case to a federal court because of ""changes in law and the character of bench,"" its specifics could be applicable to many other areas of the country.Minneapolis and Saint Paul public schools are made up mostly of students of color. On average, students in these districts have lower test scores and graduation rates than students in more affluent, white surrounding districts. ""Schools within Minnesota concentrate students by poverty and race,"" says the lawsuit. And while the state ""has known for some time of these patterns of segregation and resulting educational outcomes [and] has the capacity and duty to discharge its constitutional obligation to provide plaintiffs with an adequate and equitable education, [it] has failed to do so."" Representatives for the Minnesota Department of Education and Commissioner of Education Brenda Casellius said they aren't allowed to comment on the suit as named parties. Still, ""the Minnesota Department of Education is committed to helping every student achieve academic success,"" said a representative from the Minnesota Department of Education. Schools around the country have become increasingly racially segregated in the past two decades. After a wave of progress in the '70s and '80s, a series of court decisions carved away at this momentum. At the same time, research shows that integrated schools help close the achievement gap.Alejandro Cruz-Guzman is one of the plaintiffs in the case. He has five kids, three of whom are still in St. Paul schools (the other two are in college). He wants to see his kids attend integrated schools.""If our kids go to school with majority of Latino kids, they're living in that same community and have never been exposed to their other communities,"" said Cruz. ""When they get older with jobs and careers, they will have to integrate with those other communities. Why wait for that time?""""In America, we live in this country, and there's a lot of communities -- not only one community,"" said Cruz. The suit seeks a metro-wide integration plan and says that specific school attendance boundaries have intentionally segregated schools by race and socioeconomic status. ""Segregation is so pernicious, and so pervasive, to do this to children is the worst thing you could do,"" said Shulman. ""We're talking about a society we all want to have, and it's not the society that’s segregated.""Rebecca Klein covers the challenges faced in school discipline, school segregation, and the achievement gap in K-12 education.

Pinterest has a very active mental illness-focused community. But according to a new study from the University of Georgia, those who pin about mental health don't have enough access to the coping tools they need. Researchers analyzed nearly 800 pins on the site relating to depression, surfacing them using search terms like ""clinical depression."" They found that depression-themed pins elicit a significant amount of engagement, including repins, likes and comments. Some of the pins were explicit in their references to depression, mentioning suicidal thoughts or portraying an image of self-harm. (In fact, about 10 percent of these pins referred to thoughts of suicide.) Others were more subtle, including dark poetry or sad messages. The pins were more often linked with ineffective coping strategies rather than those that are proactive or professionally vetted, the researchers discovered. ""We found that when depression is being communicated or portrayed on Pinterest via images or text, there is a lack of more proactive coping approaches also being portrayed on Pinterest,"" study co-author Yan Jin, an associate director of UGA's Center for Health and Risk Communication, said in a statement. Social media can be helpful for people working to cope with mental illness: Users may sometimes experience feelings of safety and support online when they feel a sense of community and decreased stigma. Pinterest can be an important avenue for expressing themselves and venting, which is a form of coping with stress and depression, according to the researchers. At the same time, seeking counsel online can be detrimental, especially when an advice-giver isn't a professional or is experiencing mental problems of their own, and the platform lacks perspective from medical experts.""There is a lack of representation from other health or medical organizations, and few have been engaged in this kind of dialogue or conversation on Pinterest with individuals who are suffering from or talking about depression,"" said study co-author Jeanine Guidry, a doctoral student at Virginia Commonwealth University. ""The good news is that this lack of available expertise can change: Pinterest lends itself to finding effective ways to help people with mental illnesses. ""This is a great opportunity for health professionals and health public relations professionals to engage in and put in more effective messages out there on this platform, involving such things as health tips on how to deal with depression or providing the right coping mechanism to facilitate more positive discussions in this community,"" Jin added. While it sounds simple, looking at happy images really does have mood-boosting effects.

22,WOMEN,28 Pieces From 2015 That Should Be Required Reading For Women,Emma Gray,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/required-reading-for-women-2015_us_566597d5e4b08e945feff6f5,"Add these to your list, stat.",2015-12-11,Viola Davis Became The First Black Woman To Win An Emmy For Outstanding Lead Actress In A Drama Series,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/566838bd1600002900e5565e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"If eyes are a window into the soul, writing is a window into an author's mind. And very often, that mind is dizzyingly interesting and contains insights about our world that we didn't quite know how to articulate on our own. In a media landscape filled with tweets and ""hot takes,"" it's easy to forget how many beautiful, impactful words are published on the Internet each and every year. So, for the fourth time, we've curated a list of pieces that stood out to us over the last calendar year. To make the list, an article had to be (1) published in 2015, (2) written by a woman and (3) be available online.This list is by no means exhaustive, but each piece included hits at something special, and, in our opinions, important. In a world where women are still derided for writing about their personal experiences and taking selfies, where we are still fighting for basic reproductive rights and we still haven't had a female president, elevating women's voices has never felt more crucial. Below are 28 pieces that every woman (and man) should read:""I'm A Hot Mess For Hillary"" Rebecca Traister, ElleFor many progressive women, Hillary Clinton is both a deeply important and deeply fraught political figure. No one has managed to capture this reality quite like Traister. Her gorgeous piece in Elle outlines the the emotional turmoil Clinton's (second) presidential run brings up and the burden of representation that often falls onto ""firsts"" in any field. As she writes: ""[Hillary Clinton] is the screen upon which all of America's very long-standing, very complicated, fairly unattractive feelings about women will be projected for the next 13 months."" Oof. * * *""I'm 15 Years Old And This Is What Love Feels Like""Anna Koppelman, MTV NewsThere is a tendency in our society to both fetishize youth and mock it. But what's most heartbreakingly lost when adults argue about ""kids these days"" is the voices of those actual kids. Koppelman's stirring essay on first love reminds anyone reading just how real and valid and affecting formative relationships can be. We should all be so lucky to feel like we're ""throwing up glitter"" over the course of our lives.* * *""How To Make Friends With Your Country's Enemies""Mallika Rao, HuffPost Arts & CultureRao, the daughter of Indian parents, went to Pakistan on a mission to see, touch and love. Just as the personal is political, diplomacy is oh-so-personal. * * *""Famous Quotes, The Way A Woman Would Have To Say Them During A Meeting""Alexandra Petri, The Washington PostWomen spend our lives negotiating how we move about and communicate in the world to come off in a way that doesn't upset or threaten the people (read: men) around us. This is especially potent in the workplace. As Petri puts it, ""You start with your thought, then you figure out how to say it as though you were offering a groveling apology for an unspecified error."" And thus, that is how “I will be heard""  becomes “Sorry to interrupt. No, go on, Dave. Finish what you had to say.”* * *""Against Chill""Alana Massey, MatterMassey decided to wage a verbal war on the pressure to appear ""chill"" -- ""a garbage virtue that will destroy the species"" -- specifically in the context of dating and sex. As she writes, ""Chill asks us to remove the language of courtship and desire lest we appear invested somehow in other human beings."" ""Chill"" is essentially complete and utter bullshit, and we are eternally grateful to Massey for calling that out. * * *""Why Do I Make Less Than My Male Co-Stars?""Jennifer Lawrence, LennyJennifer Lawrence is one of the most privileged people on the planet. She is fabulously famous and wealthy and publicly adored -- yet the bullshit sexism she has to contend with is familiar to women in any profession. Her essay about being paid less than her male co-stars -- and avoiding being seen as too ""aggressive"" during negotiations -- is affecting, funny and newsworthy. We can all look forward to a day when we don't need an Oscar winner to speak up to get people to pay attention to workplace sexism.* * *""Men Who Kill""Josie Duffy, GawkerIn a year where mass, public gun violence dominated headlines, Duffy's piece gets to an issue that's at the very core of much of it: masculinity. ""Forget terrorism or video games or gangs. Its the bruised ego that’s responsible for a lot of the violence we see,"" she wrote. We need gun control -- and now. But we also need to examine the ways in which we raise men who see guns as their only way out of hurt and rejection.* * *""The Art Of Being Underestimated""Jessica Roy, New York Magazine""Maybe the secret to breaking the glass ceiling is to shatter it with our vocal fry and leave the shards glittering like diamonds in our blowouts,"" writes Roy. This piece is one giant, refreshing f-you to the people who would write women off for their conventional femininity. * * *""Why You Should Never Ask A Pregnant Woman If She’s Going Back To Work""Lori Fradkin, CosmopolitanIt's one of those questions that nearly every expectant mother gets, but few expectant fathers ever do. Fradkin gets to the heart of why the double standard is so problematic: ""After all, what's the point of encouraging little girls to work hard in school, get good grades, apply for college, and secure a job after graduation if we then turn around and say to them, essentially, 'So, are you still planning to use all that?'""* * *""The Prosperity Gospel Of Rihanna""Doreen St. Felix, PitchforkSt. Felix argues that Rihanna's overt embrace of cash is far more subversive than many give her credit for. ""Black girls with money are financially independent and visually, confrontationally untethered to men or to goods,"" St. Felix writes. Rihanna's ""Bitch Better Have My Money"" video is the apex of this ""material liberation."" Rihanna is a musical genius. And as St. Felix writes: ""To be a black woman and genius, is to be perpetually owed.""* * * ""Justice Ginsburg's Cautious Radicalism""Irin Carmon, New York TimesWondering why Ruth Bader Ginsburg has become the Notorious R.B.G., why ""young women have tattooed themselves and painted their nails with the justice’s face""? Carmon's profile of the 82-year-old Supreme Court justice paints a picture of a woman who is both pragmatic and radical. Women looking to get shit done should look to RBG.* * *""The Bride In Her Head""Lena Dunham, The New Yorker""My desire for a wedding predated my ability to imagine any other kind of positive attention for myself, any other moment of triumph in my life,"" writes Dunham, reflecting on how marriage equality made her think more pointedly about the institution as a whole. ""What I was waiting for was not the chance to marry but the chance to think about marriage on an even playing field, in a world where its relevance is a little harder to question and its essence a little harder to reject.""* * *""'I'm No Longer Afraid': 35 Women Tell Their Stories About Being Assaulted By Bill Cosby, And The Culture That Wouldn't Listen""Noreen Malone & Amanda Demme, New York MagazineIn the most comprehensive profile of Cosby's accusers to date, 35 women of different ages and backgrounds agreed to share the traumatic stories they'd kept silent about for years. The piece also includes a moving portrait series of all of the women and an empty chair for victims of sexual assault who have yet to speak up. It is tragic that it took decades and 50+ women coming forward for us to start listening to them, but thank goodness we are hearing their accounts now.* * *""I Was Told My Lesbian Mother Is A 'Deviant.' Today Is For Both Of Us.""Margaret Wheeler Johnson, BustleWheeler Johnson's reaction to SCOTUS' marriage equality ruling is the best we've seen, both deeply personal and wholly universal. We dare you not to get chills while reading this paragraph: ""It turns out that I am a deviant, too. I am such a deviant that we have a baby girl. And today, as the Supreme Court rules that every American is entitled to marry whomever she or he chooses, the streets will fill with deviants celebrating not only their right to participate in the most conventional of institutions but their right to live beyond stigma and shame.""* * *""The Charleston Shooter Killed Mostly Black Women. This Wasn’t About 'Rape.'""Rebecca Carroll, The Guardian""The idea that white women’s bodies represent that which is inviolable while black women’s are disposable hasn’t changed enough since it was first articulated by white men,"" writes Carroll. The danger of this underlying societal belief has never been clearer than in the wake of death and destruction wrought by Charleston shooter Dylann Roof. Read Carroll's essay. Take in its message. Remember to #SayHerName. * * *""The Unexpected, Exhilarating Freedom Of Being Single At 41""Glynnis MacNicol, New York MagazineIt's 2015 and there are still very few narratives out there about single women past the age of 30 who are totally god damn happy with their lives. MacNicol offers one and it's insanely refreshing. She reminds us that being single and 41 can be exhilarating and fun and challenging and lonely and sexy and all the other emotions that make up a human life. ""No matter how often we imagine marriage as the solution to women's problems,"" writes MacNicol, ""it is simply another way of living.""* * *""My Wedding Was Perfect -- And I Was Fat As Hell The Whole Time""Lindy West, The GuardianWomen are constantly told to be smaller, to take up less space, to compress themselves and their desires in order achieve ""true"" happiness. Well... Fuck. That. ""I have never in my life been fatter than I was on my wedding day, I have never shown my body in such an uncompromising way, and I have never felt more at home in that body,"" writes West. ""I was fully myself, and I was happy. We are happy. This life is yours, fat girls. Eat it up."" Amen. * * *""On Pandering""Claire Vaye Watkins, Tin HouseThanks to Watkins must-read essay on patriarchy in the writing world (and beyond), we've found our new mantra: ""Let us burn this motherfucking system to the ground and build something better."" * * *""Everything Is Yours, Everything Is Not Yours""Clemantine Wamariya and Elizabeth Weil, Matter""Look, you have this one life,"" says Wamariya, describing what she tells people when they ask her for her advice on easing human suffering. ""If you keep being selfish and unkind, it’s going to come back to you. Ask yourself why you’re scared, why you hate."" At a time when panic about Syrian refugees has reached an all-time high in this country, Wamariya's stunning, terrifying account of fleeing the Rwandan genocide feels all the more potent, a reminder to embrace compassion and love in the face of fear and hatred.* * *""Breaking Uniform""Roxane Gay, GOODMost women can relate to that moment when you look at yourself in the mirror and are absolutely convinced that you have nothing to wear that could make you look -- and feel -- good. ""Sometimes, I decide on an outfit and leave my bedroom,"" writes Gay. ""In a matter of moments, it begins to feel like these unfamiliar clothes are strangling me... Sleeves become tourniquets. Slacks become shackles. I start to panic and before I know it, I am back in my closet. I am tearing the bright, beautiful clothes off because I don’t deserve to wear them."" As with nearly any subject, Gay has the uncanny ability to write about the beauty and struggle of getting dressed each morning in a way that underscores the deep significance of a seemingly mundane ritual. * * *""I Love Pizza, Which Is Adorable Because I'm Hot""Margaret Spencer, ReductressIf you've ever been annoyed at the way beautiful women eating pizza has become a weird fetishized meme, read this hilarious parody piece right now and laugh. A lot. * * *""White Debt""Eula Bliss, New York TimesWe've included this piece in a list of required reading for women, but it really should be required reading for any white person. ""When we buy into whiteness, we entertain the delusion that we’re business partners with power, not its minions,"" Bliss writes. ""And we forget our debt to ourselves."" White people in this country need to get their shit together -- and it starts by interrogating their own whiteness.* * *""Instruments Of Oppression""Laura Bassett, HuffPost Highline Bassett's deep dive into the U.S. policy that drives rape victims abroad to seek out unsafe, illegal abortions is as harrowing a read as it is important. ""Obama could change this with a single executive action,"" writes Bassett. ""Why hasn't he?""* * *""Selfie""Rachel Syme, MatterSyme's seven-part essay will not only dissect any selfie panic you have, but also make you want to turn your iPhone onto yourself and take about 100 of them. As Syme eloquently points out: ""What selfie-haters fear, deep down, is a growing army of faces they cannot monitor, an army who does not need their approval to march ahead."" * * *""Why I Didn't Write Back""Diana Spechler, The Toast""Your fanny pack. Your dick pic. Your soul patch. My heart."" This piece will hit home (and hard) for anyone who has ever online dated.* * *""Monica Lewinsky Is Back, But This Time It's On Her Terms""Jessica Bennett, New York TimesMonica Lewinsky became famous (or perhaps infamous is the better word) in her early 20s under less-than-ideal circumstances. Now, in her early 40s, Lewinsky is taking back her narrative. Bennett's writing helps capture the current sensibilities of a woman who was once known only as the object of scorn and scandal. * * *""Far Away From Me""Jenny Zhang, RookieZhang's beautiful reflection on what it means to grapple with the concepts of adolescent love and attractiveness when you're an Asian girl in a sea of whiteness shows just how far-reaching white supremacy is. ""For girls of color, internalizing the message that we are inherently inferior and ugly and freakish can happen explicitly and it can happen insidiously and it can happen just by repeated exclusion,"" writes Zhang.* * *""(Not) All Men""Nona Willis Aronowitz, MatterOne of the most disturbing things about witnessing sexual assault allegations come out about public figures is when those public figures are supposed to be some of the ""good guys,"" like ""boy-next-door"" porn star James Deen was. Aronowitz pushes us all to stop distancing ourselves and the men we know and love from misogyny. Because, sometimes -- maybe even often? -- ""Our Guys"" are as complicit in these systems as ""Those Guys."" To see last year's required reading list, head here.Also on HuffPost:"
23,SPORTS,Charles Barkley Rips Donald Trump For Lumping All Muslims Together,Juliet Spies-Gans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/charles-barkley-donald-trump-cnn_us_566ae033e4b0f290e522cd43,"""To try to divide and conquer, which is what the Republicans always do -- it's just sad.”",2015-12-11,"Trump speaks to guests gathered for a campaign event at Mississippi Valley Fairgrounds on Dec. 5, 2015, in Davenport, Iowa.

This is the United States of America. This is the greatest place in the world. Do we have issues? Of course we have issues. But to try to divide and conquer, which is what the Republicans always do -- it's just sad.”Barkley went on to say just how “sad” it is that much of Trump’s success on the campaign trail has come from his divisive, racist remarks, as the businessman has played the blame game for months now, accusing entire groups of people -- Hispanics and Muslims, for the most part -- of being at the root of the nation’s current problems. “Then you have these losers who love that, because they are afraid to look in the mirror and say why their li[ves] suck,” he continued. “So they have to blame other people. Your life sucks for a reason, because of you, not because of Hispanics … It’s been sad to watch every time he insults people, his poll numbers go up.”Barkley was asked to speak on politics -- a subject that is not his forte whatsoever -- to promote next week’s Republican debate, which will be broadcast on CNN, a network that also falls under the umbrella of Barkley’s parent company, Turner Broadcasting. But it’s safe to say that Turner had no idea that Barkley would reprove the station on national TV.“CNN has done an awful job this election, an awful job,” he said. “They have followed ratings and sound bites this entire cycle. I mean, think about it, and I love CNN because they’re part of our company, but they’ve been kissing butt, chasing ratings, they have become like Fox News … It’s been sad and frustrating that our company has sold their soul for ratings.” While Barkley claimed that he currently has “no idea” who he’ll end up voting for, it’s clear who he won’t be endorsing -- the former reality TV star whose strategic deployment of racism has, in Barkley’s mind, unfortunately propelled him to the top of the polls.Also on HuffPost:"

Soon, it could face similar scrutiny on the big screen.Former college football stars, including Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, Heisman Trophy winner Desmond Howard and ex-Baltimore Raven Ray Lewis, have signed on to support ""Work Horses,"" a feature film about the lack of compensation and benefits for major college athletes.The movie is the brainchild of former LSU wide receiver Abram Booty, who is now a high school football coach in Newport Beach, California. While in college, Booty told The Huffington Post, he and his teammates often talked about feeling as if they didn't properly share in the massive revenues they helped generate. He says he spent his college career vowing to ""do something about it"" once he left Baton Rouge.""We know this isn't fair, this isn't right, this isn't just,"" he said. ""I don't think college kids should be driving around in big fancy cars, but they ought to be able to go out and get something to eat on the weekend when they're hungry.""His inspiration for ""Work Horses"" came years after his career ended, as he watched his younger brother, John David, guide the University of Southern California to victory in the 2007 Rose Bowl. John David's favorite target that night was the Trojans' star wide receiver, Dwayne Jarrett, who caught 11 passes for 205 yards and two touchdowns to earn MVP honors.After the game, Booty said he noticed Jarrett walking down a dark street away from the stadium.
