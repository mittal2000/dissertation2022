On Monday, the company announced that the handsets broke previous sales records. Imagine that.“Sales for iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus have been phenomenal, blowing past any previous first weekend sales results in Apple’s history,” CEO Tim Cook said in a prepared statement.All told, Apple says it's sold more than 13 million units in the three days since launch. That's 3 million more than Apple reportedly sold last year when it also set a record with the original iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.The main difference here is that the iPhone 6S family was immediately available in China. Last year, Chinese consumers had to wait an entire month before they could get their hands on shiny new iPhone 6 and 6 Pluses.So, keep your eyes peeled when the iPhone 7 inevitably launches next year: 13 million is the new number to beat.MORE ON HUFFPOST:Apple Broke A New Record With iOS 9 Apple Could Trap You Forever With Its New ""Upgrade Program""Apple's New iPhones Start At 16GB Of Storage.

It's been a troubled few months for the Austin, Texas-based company. In June, Whole Foods was found to have been chronically overcharging customers in New York City since at least 2010. At the time, co-CEOs John Mackey and Walter Robb apologized to their customers for the ""pricing issues"" and said the company would take steps to ensure such problems -- which also arose in California last year -- would not happen again.Also in June, the chain announced a new effort to get away from its beleaguering ""Whole Paycheck"" nickname with a line of more moderately priced stores opening in 2016. The new brand, called 365 by Whole Foods Market, will open its first five stores in California, Oregon, Texas and Washington, with plans to double that number within a year.The newly announced round of layoffs will affect 1.6 percent of the chain's employees. Whole Foods said it expects that many of those who lose their jobs will be able to find others somewhere within the company, as more than 9,000 positions have been added in the past year, and nearly 2,000 are currently open. In a statement, Whole Foods said the layoffs will allow the company to ""invest in technology upgrades"" and keep its prices in check.The company did not specify what kinds of positions it will eliminate or what kinds of jobs are currently available there. A request for comment was not immediately answered.“This is a very difficult decision, and we are committed to treating affected Team Members in a caring and respectful manner,"" Robb said in a statement.

Kind of.Appearing on Boston sports radio station WEEI on Monday, Brady backtracked from his pseudo-endorsement of Trump, claiming that his words were twisted and that he had no intention of getting stuck in the convoluted web that is the 2016 presidential primaries.“Even an off-handed comment like that … people may run with [it],” Brady said. “And I understand why people do run with it, because you get the clicks and that type of stuff.

Equivocating to the last, Brady, instead, essentially endorsed Trump as a good barbeque buddy, calling him a “fun guy.”""I mean, look, I’ve known him for a long time,"" Brady explained. ""He’s been a fun guy that I’ve had a lot of time around.”""One way or another, it’s so far away from when the election will be,” Brady concluded. “Whatever I vote is going to be my own personal choice based on how I feel.

She was allegedly arrested for assaulting an officer after refusing to heed directions given by the police.A video of Grimes’ arrest,  viewable above, went viral shortly after the incident. The video opens with Grimes on the ground, arms pinned behind her back, yelling, “Are you f*****g serious?” She is rolled over onto her back before the video shuts off.According to the Sun Sentinel, Grimes drew law enforcement’s attention by trying to enter the stadium via a restricted gate. Grimes apparently ignored the officers’ repeated instructions to take another route.  When one cop took hold of her, she wrested her arm away, verbally berating the officers around her.The officers proceeded to place Grimes “in a bear-hug,” while Grimes, now lying prostrate, “flailed her arms and kicked,” per the Sun Sentinel’s copy of the police report.It wasn’t until the radio host had been threatened with a Taser that she stopped struggling -- and this was only after she had both been handcuffed and had head-butted one of the officers.The Taser was not used, and, moments later, Grimes began to contest the arrest once more. Grimes was charged with disorderly conduct and with resisting arrest “with violence and battery on a law enforcement officer."" She has already been released on bond. Grimes has been a controversial figure in the Miami limelight for some time now, particularly because she has been highly critical of the NFL -- both on the issue of domestic violence and on her husband's Pro Bowl MVP snub.Brent Grimes was not available for comment after his team’s 41-14 loss to Buffalo on Sunday night.Also on HuffPost:"
4,HEALTHY LIVING,This Mobile Chlamydia Test Could Change How We Test For STIs,Erin Schumaker,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mobile-chlamydia-test-smartphone-mobilab_us_56041b35e4b08820d91be564,Genius.,2015-09-28,Passing notes has gotten a little easier... but gone is the thrill of covert note delivery,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/559f24b21b0000ba0427f83a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"A new smartphone-based test for chlamydia that delivers results in just 30 minutes could change the way we test for sexually transmitted diseases. The prototype, called mobiLab, has yet to undergo clinical trials. Developed by researchers at Johns Hopkins University, the all-in-one handheld device features a 6-inch DNA analysis unit that tests disposable genital swab cartridges. Test results are then delivered to a smartphone app hooked up to the device, allowing a diagnosis to be confirmed at the point of care rather than a separate lab. Aside from speed and convenience, the mobiLab could significantly lower the cost of chlamydia testing if it approved. Current testing options cost between $50 and $200 without insurance, the Baltimore Sun reported. In contrast, researchers estimate that the mobiLab test, which is $200 to make, will cost practitioners approximately $2 per cartridge.Chlamydia is the most commonly diagnosed sexually transmitted infection in the United States, affecting more than 1.4 million Americans every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The disease, which can cause infertility in women if left untreated, is known as a ""silent infection"" because most people who are infected don't have visible symptoms. ""People don't go in to get tested for it,"" Patrick Chaulk, assistant commissioner of Baltimore Health Department's Bureau of HIV/STD Services, told the Sun. ""People have the opportunity to spread it to others without knowing it, and that's why a device like this would be quite helpful.""The researchers hope the device could eventually be used at home, similar to a pregnancy test, which would follow a new trend in healthcare. In April, a British company launched an at-home HIV test, and in June, Planned Parenthood announced that it was rolling out a pilot program for at-home STI testing. For the latter, patients order testing kits on their smartphones and send urine samples back through the mail for results. The mobiLab test is currently female-focused and only works for vaginal swabs, but researchers plan on expanding the test to men and other sexually transmitted diseases in the future.

In a column for a local paper last week, the mayor of Maine's second-largest city proposed an online registry of welfare recipients. He said he would submit legislation to the Maine State Legislature ""asking that a website be created containing the names, addresses, length of time on assistance and the benefits being collected by every individual on the dole."" In addition to likely running afoul of federal rules, Macdonald's idea doesn't seem to be getting much local support. Macdonald had sent copies of his legislation to state Sens. Eric Brakey (R) and Nate Libby (D) in hopes they'd introduce it before a Friday deadline, but both offices told The Huffington Post they had passed on the idea.""I don't think there's that much appetite for this sort of thing in the Maine Senate,"" Mario Moretto, spokesman for Maine Senate Democrats, said in an interview.And a spokesman for Maine Gov. Paul LePage (R), who has made cracking down on welfare recipients his signature issue, told the Bangor Daily News the governor's office has no plans to support Macdonald's welfare registry proposal. In the past year LePage has tightened Maine's rules for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, and his administration even supported an ill-fated bill to stop food stamps from being used to buy candy or soda. Macdonald, who didn't respond to a request for comment for this story, said in his column that ""our liberal, progressive legislators and their social-service allies have made them [welfare recipients] a victimized, protected class. It’s none of your business how much of your money they get and spend. Who are you to question it? Just shut up and pay!"" It's not clear if Macdonald is talking about locally administered general assistance, TANF -- the federal program most often called ""welfare"" -- or also other programs like food stamps and housing subsidies. Macdonald strangely opened his column with a call for a broader overhaul of laws dealing with confidentiality because of ""the fear they strike into the average law-abiding citizen."" Macdonald has served as mayor since 2012 and is facing five challengers to his reelection this fall. "
6,POLITICS,What Pope Francis Means When He Talks About The Ethics Of Care,Chloe Angyal and Ryan Grim,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pope-francis-ethics-of-care_us_56086189e4b0768126fdf774,The pontiff spoke about creating a culture of care during his U.S. visit.,2015-09-28,Pope Francis talked about ethics of care during his recent trip to the U.S.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"During Pope Francis' historic U.S. visit last week, he spoke repeatedly about the need -- in making policy, in strengthening the Roman Catholic Church, in everyday interactions -- to create a culture of care. ""A political society endures when it seeks, as a vocation, to satisfy common needs by stimulating the growth of all its members, especially those in situations of greater vulnerability or risk,"" he said before a joint meeting of Congress. Legislative activity, he continued, ""is always based on care for the people.""At the United Nations, the pope argued that just financial practices and robust oversight of finance are necessary to ""care for the sustainable development of countries and should ensure that they are not subjected to oppressive lending systems which, far from promoting progress, subject people to mechanisms which generate greater poverty, exclusion and dependence.""""It is painful when we see prison systems which are not concerned to care for wounds, to soothe pain, to offer new possibilities,"" he said at the Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility in Philadelphia. In his remarks to Congress, Francis repeatedly invoked The Golden Rule, saying that the practice of treating others as we would want to be treated ought to inform US policy on immigration -- particularly policies on the admission of refugees -- and capital punishment.The heavy emphasis on care and on The Golden Rule appeared to be allusions to care ethics, a school of philosophical thought that is rooted in feminism, and draws inspiration from nuns throughout history who have devoted their lives to caregiving. Care ethics also questions the traditionally dominant ethical frameworks that emphasize the individual over the collective, and value the experiences and voices of traditionally vulnerable and low-status members of society.To learn more about care ethics and about how they might have informed the case the pope made this week, we spoke with Brown University Visiting Assistant Professor of Religious Studies Anna Bialek, Ph.D. Her work focuses on the philosophy and ethics of love and vulnerability in Christianity. This is an edited version of our conversation:Was it your sense that the pope is familiar with care ethics, or draws inspiration from it? The ethics of care now has many branches, but it began as an effort to consider the work of women in traditional caregiving roles in social and philosophical discussions that have often ignored them. Early ethicists of care suggested that women’s experiences as mothers, wives, nurses, teachers, nuns, and in other caregiving roles could offer a “different voice” to discussions dominated by traditionally male experiences and pursuits of independence, individual autonomy and self-fulfillment. Care might then serve as a model for everyone, the movement suggests, complementing individualist pursuits, correcting the misperceptions and denigrations of people serving in caregiving roles, and illuminating the support that caregivers themselves need and deserve.When Pope Francis talks about care, as in the Laudato Si’ encyclical released last spring, subtitled “On Care for Our Common Home,” he usually seems to be drawing on a different tradition of thinking about care that begins from Jesus’ teachings on love and has developed in Christian discussions of the theological virtue of caritas, often translated as “love” or “charity” in English. Caritas refers to a love that is given regardless of whether or not it's merited -- love that is not a response to someone’s beauty or greatness, but is freely given, often in excess of any deserving qualities, as a parent loves a child or God is believed to love His creation, in the Christian tradition. According to Christ’s teachings, Christians must love in this way: loving not only the great and the good but also the wicked, the less fortunate and all others who may seem “undeserving” of love by other standards.Pope Francis’ references to care during his visit U.S. have shown the capaciousness of the concepts of care, love, and charity in Christian thought. He has referred to the responsibility to care for the environment -- our “common home” -- for immigrants, the poor, the sick, the disabled, children and the abused. For our own souls and spiritual health amidst a culture of consumption, and more. His elevation of “care” as a key term in these speeches suggests the influence of his namesake, Saint Francis of Assisi, who often preached of love in everyday life, of the environment and the poor and the less fortunate. “Care” has a similar connotation of everyday, humble work.What should people know about the ethics of the care school of thought?The ethics of care began as a movement of feminist thought that emphasized differences between men and women, or at least differences between the traditional experiences of men and women. While men’s voices and experiences had dominated philosophical and social discussions, women’s experiences in caregiving roles could not be well described, understood, or valued by the vocabulary and norms developed through a “male” perspective. Early ethicists of care sought to recover women’s voices to learn from their engagement with caregiving in particular.Care, they argued, provides a significant alternative to ethics that emphasize individual development and independence. In individualist ethics, my interactions with others often appear only to threaten my own progress and well-being. In an ethic of care, by contrast, my development and well-being is oriented toward others, in that I become a better person insofar as I learn to care well, participating productively in relationships toward the flourishing of all. From the perspective of care ethics, in other words, my interactions with others appear as opportunities for ethical development and the enhancement of my life and others’, instead of appearing primarily as threats to what I pursue for myself.The ethics of care began as a movement of feminist thought, but is now engaged for a range of concerns including the roles and treatment of the disabled, elderly and sick, the environment, race relations and many forms of economic and social inequality. In the thirty years since the movement began, care has become a widely accepted and utilized term in philosophy. Many of the lessons of care ethics have played important roles in public policy as well, such as in the development of the ADA [Americans With Disability Act] and the Violence Against Women Act.How does it relate to the Golden Rule?Care ethics is generally compatible with the Golden Rule, but it reminds us of an important reality in its pursuit: that while we try to do unto others what we wish done unto us, there are often asymmetries in our circumstances that should affect the meaning of that pursuit. It means something very different for a child to follow the Golden Rule in his or her relations with a parent than for the parent to follow it in relations with his or her child. The parent behaves not only as he or she might want someone to behave to him or her now, as an adult, but how he or she would want someone to behave, or have behaved, toward him or her as a child. While the reflexivity of the Golden Rule -- “behave unto others as one wishes them to behave unto you” -- might seem to suggest that we can relinquish responsibilities to others where we do not take ourselves to need such support, caregiving reminds us that at different moments in life, we require different kinds of aid, and we must understand the Golden Rule to refer not just to what I wish from others right now but throughout my life, and even beyond my own experience. Although I may never experience the inability to hear or see, for example, I should treat the deaf and blind as I would want to be treated were I deaf and blind, not as I am now, a person with relatively healthy hearing and sight. Care theory encourages us to think of the conditions and needs of others as a guide to our actions, instead of focusing only on our own experience, interests and desires. This approach is important in carrying out the Golden Rule, which could otherwise serve to justify the abandonment of others in need so long as one doesn’t see oneself as similarly needy -- far from the spirit in which it is usually offered.Pope Francis’ words and actions have illustrated this dimension of the Christian interpretation of the Golden Rule well, often in a direct critique of modern ethical and political systems that take the ideally independent, physically and mentally able, and economically privileged adult as the “normal” subject of any maxim like the Golden Rule. If we must only do unto others as we wish them to do unto us as independent, healthy, and economically privileged adults, it is hard to understand why we should offer assistance to the poor, sick, disabled, and less fortunate. Shouldn’t they pull themselves up by their own bootstraps, as we often hear? If I don’t need government assistance, the argument goes, so why should I pay for the government to assist them? The Golden Rule, understood through the lens of care ethics, reminds us to consider how we would want to be treated if we were in similar conditions, not just how we would want to be treated in our current condition. This interpretation seems to be Francis' as well.Lots of people have argued that the pope's progressivism has left women behind. How would someone trained in a feminist ethics of care approach that question?A big part of the criticism of the pope’s positions on women has referred to his emphasis on women’s ""different gifts"" -- of care, nurturing, and so on -- as the justification for their ""different"" positions in the church. Critics have often pointed out that the ""different""positions of women in the church are not only different, but lesser, than the positions of men. It has also been noted that there is an incoherence in the pope’s naming of these “feminine gifts” as the reason for women’s different and lesser roles in the church, while simultaneously calling for the male clergy to practice care and compassion in their work. If women already have the ""gifts"" of care and compassion, critics argue, why not make them priests? And why relegate such “feminine genius,” as he and others in the church have called it, to lesser ecclesial roles, when the pope himself has emphatically practiced such virtues throughout his time in the highest position of the ecclesial hierarchy? These criticisms align well with the feminist ethics of care, which argues that women’s caregiving should not be used to justify their subordination to men, but should be adopted as ethical models for both men and women.Pope Francis has also been criticized for his emphasis on the differences between men and women altogether. By naming a “feminine genius” and using it to justify the unequal treatment of men and women in the church, such critics argue, the pope has suggested that women are naturally more capable in some areas than others, a difference that should not be fought but observed by maintaining different roles for men and women in society and the church. Though he honors the gifts of women, in other words he reinforces women’s separation and subordination by honoring them as different in this way.The feminist ethics of care emerged from a strand of feminist thought called difference feminism that also emphasizes the differences between men and women, and argues for the elevation of women in society without assimilation to or mimicry of traditionally male experiences and attributes. The ethics of care has been frequently criticized for this heritage and its remnants in the movement on similar grounds as I described in relation to the pope: that emphasizing difference can justify unequal treatment by suggesting that women should play certain roles and not others, based on supposedly natural, feminine virtues and inclinations. However, many authors in the ethics of care have emphatically denounced these sorts of claims, and have suggested that the “difference feminism” in which they are interested refers to the fact that men and women have traditionally held different roles, such that we have learned to associate care and nurturing, for example, with femininity, while we associate independence and autonomy with masculinity. By recovering women’s experiences in caregiving roles, caregiving might be recovered from its understanding as a “feminine gift” to be available for women and men alike. In this way, the feminist ethics of care might again participate in the critique of Pope Francis' statements about women, though some critics of the ethics of care might see both Francis and care ethics as participating in a dangerous emphasis on difference.However popular he might be among some progressives, the pope is still the head of an explicitly patriarchal institution. Does that conflict, or is it in keeping, with the ethics of care?The feminist ethics of care has developed largely in opposition to patriarchal institutions and systems of thought, and so the patriarchy of the church would not be in keeping with that element of the ethics of care. However, there are strands of thinking in the ethics of care that advocate a form of equality between men and women that is not explicitly opposed to the kind of patriarchy found in the church, insofar as men and women can play different, but potentially equal, roles. Some ethicists of care, for example, might agree with Pope Francis that the caregiving roles of women could be sufficiently privileged and recognized within the church that its explicit patriarchy would be less objectionable. Pope Francis’ emphatic support for women religious leaders would bolster such a claim. More generally, however, the feminist ethics of care would promote a recognition of caregiving by both men and women that would align with Francis’ advocacy for these virtues and actions, but would reject his maintenance of the male priesthood and a lack of female participation in major leadership roles -- and the accompanying inequalities of pay, job security, recognition, and much else.What are some instances of organized religion, particularly Christianity, practicing a feminist ethics of care?The ethics of care has often been put into practice best by religious organizations, which have sought to care for the vulnerable and dependent where society and government has left them behind. Church organizations that offer assistance to the disabled, the sick, the economically disadvantaged, children and the elderly could all be described as examples of a practice of care. They see themselves as responsible for helping others even where there is no promise of getting anything in return, whether some form of repayment, reciprocity or mutual advantage. In this way, they follow the example both of caritas and the caregiving traditionally practiced by women as mothers, sisters, and wives: They offer love and aid not in response to whether the recipients deserve it, but in response to their need, and without regard for what the lover/caregiver will receive for having loved and cared in these ways.From soup kitchens to women’s shelters to economic assistance, religious organizations are deeply engaged in works of care that have deep resonances with the feminist ethics of care. As a strong supporter of these works of the church, Pope Francis might then be seen as a strong supporter of the ethics of care, if not its feminist message and aims.The pope has argued that we need to be aware of the impact of global challenges -- most notably climate change and environmental damage -- on the most vulnerable and marginalized populations. Where do vulnerability and marginalization come into an ethics of care?Vulnerability and marginalization are key categories in the ethics of care, as they designate some of the populations to which caregivers are most responsible. The ethics of care proposes that those who can help should, in recognition of the fact that we all depend on others during at least some parts of our lives, and many of us depend on others for all of our lives. The especially vulnerable and marginalized -- “the least of these,” as the pope has said -- should be a priority of our attention and work, since they require the most care.Ethicists of care such as Eva Feder Kittay have argued that we should build our society and government by taking their cases as paradigmatic: by starting from the radically vulnerable, dependent subject instead of the ideally independent, autonomous subject. A society and government oriented toward the radically dependent can then account for the less dependent by simply doing less for them, while societies and governments that begin from the independent individual have more difficulty responding to the needs of the dependent, vulnerable and marginalized. They have difficulty accounting for the work of caregiving, as well as justifying the allocation of resources to the dependent.Both ethicists of care and the pope have argued strongly for a reorientation of our perspective and policies toward the most dependent and in need of care. For the pope, this is a demand of Christian love, a pursuit encouraged by Jesus and exemplified by God’s love for His creation. For the feminist ethics of care, it is a response to the reality of dependence in the human condition: To the inadequacy of an ethics and politics that assumes an independent subject, when we are all, at least as infants and often at other times as well, dependent on others for our survival and development. Though very differently motivated, however, both the pope’s teaching and the feminist ethics of care urge all of us to consider what we can do for the vulnerable and dependent, remembering that we too are vulnerable and dependent, and that we must serve others as we would want to be served in their condition, not in our own.Also on HuffPost:"

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) -- Announced March 23, 2015",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55b7e4ec1d00003000143032.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- To understand what drove John Boehner out of office, and the government to the brink of another shutdown, look no further than the campaign trail, and the increasingly inflammatory rhetoric coming out of the mouths of candidates.The race to capture the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 has left candidates jockeying to be the ultimate outsider, playing to the hearts of voters fed up with politics as usual. And one of the most battered targets of those candidates is Boehner.Why isn’t the government securing the border? Boehner. Why isn’t Obamacare or Planned Parenthood defunded? Boehner. The outright disgust at those in the old guard, or those who have served entire careers in elected office, is a wave that candidates like Donald Trump, Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson are riding eagerly, proclaiming their outsider status with angry taunts at immigrants, Muslims, and establishment Republicans.That anti-Washington fervor lit a fresh fire within the ranks of conservative hard-liners already in Congress. After Boehner’s resignation announcement, lawmakers who were a part of the movement to oust him were eager to make a ready connection to all that dark energy on the campaign trail. Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.) charged that if people in Washington had any doubt whether there was a sizable group within the Republican Party that carried heavy anger and disappointment, that evaporated Friday morning.“This anger and frustration about the way our party is being run is real, and now it’s very, very tangible,” said Mulvaney. “By the way, that is a direct reflection of what the people are feeling back home, not only in my district, but all across [the state]. I think it’s the same group of people who are voting for Donald Trump, Carly Fiorina and Carson.”Mulvaney added that those three candidates, “plus [Sens.] Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas),” would have support from about 65 percent of the voters in South Carolina. And it stands to reason then, he said, that those candidates were “the folks who spoke in the last 24 hours about their frustrations” with Congress as Boehner appeared ready to pass a clean government funding measure, instead of placating conservatives with an amendment that would defund Planned Parenthood and ultimately cause a shutdown.Asked if the rhetoric, and accusations coming from the campaign trail about Boehner and other old guard leaders, gave them the momentum and ammunition they needed, Mulvaney said “yes.”“What it gave us is another example of how perhaps folks in the establishment wing of the party were disconnected with what’s happening back home,” he said.Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.), a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, argued that the shift in focus on the campaign trail from candidates like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush -- who shares the name of two of the last four presidents -- to a TV entertainer, former Hewlett-Packard CEO, and former neurosurgeon, is a sign of where the party needs to head.""If you look at the Republican primary -- and the Democrat primary -- if you're tied to Washington, you're not doing well,” Huelskamp said. ""I think this is a great opportunity to set us up, not just in the House, not just dealing with President Obama, but how do we want to race in 2016.”Huelskamp suggested picking Boehner's replacement is the starting point. Get a speaker “who actually has lived and can articulate conservative principles of the Republican Party” and “that's going to be the pathway to victory in 2016.”The importance of the conservative electorate arguably goes back to 2013, when Cruz, then a little-known junior Texas senator, raised his national profile dramatically by playing a key role in sparking a government shutdown. Since, he’s been praised by the far right of the party for standing up to Senate leadership. And he has fed that fervor by going so far as to call Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) a “liar” on the Senate floor. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), one of the targets of such outsiders a few months ago, and known for tiffs with Cruz, didn’t outright say he thinks 2016 politics is the reason conservatives are vying for another shutdown fight. But he offered an ear-to-ear grin and laugh that spoke clearly.“That has nothing to do with what goes on of the floor of the Senate,” McCain chuckled, when asked if the language coming from the Republican presidential candidates played a role.“I think they’re completely divorced from each other,"" McCain added. ""I think the senators who are running for president -- it wouldn’t cross their mind to use the floor of the Senate as a vehicle to enhance their chances.” He was barely able to finish the sentence without laughing.Pressed on recent comments by Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor and GOP presidential candidate, that the Senate should go nuclear and break procedural rules to pass a more conservative agenda, McCain threw up his hands, saying he’s not sure what conservatives think they’d accomplish.“Tell me what you do when the president vetoes, after we go to 51 votes, and become just like the House of Representatives. What are we going to do?” McCain said. “Assassinate the president? No. No, I retract that. Or maybe, pass a constitutional amendment that changes the Constitution so that the president’s veto can be overridden with 51 votes?” That disagreement over how to accomplish shared goals among Republicans was on full display Friday after Boehner announced his resignation. Conservative members called it “victory.” The establishment exited the room where Boehner broke the news looking teary-eyed and upset.Democrats -- many of whom praised Boehner for at least trying to make Congress work -- saw his departure as evidence that frightened, apocalyptic rhetoric of the campaign trail was already winning in Washington.""I think that it is absolutely connected. It's an indication of the deep, deep, deep divisions in the Republican Party and a faction, which obviously is a large faction within their party, that is not as interested in governing as they are in dividing the country, dividing their party and taking some of the most strident position on issues that drive the country apart,"" said House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.).“We see this in the presidential primary, and debates,"" Hoyer said. ""They're much more comfortable in attacking than they are in constructively engaging.”Across town, another presidential candidate, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, offered fresh fodder for critics like Hoyer.“You have some people who are just focused on making the trains run and getting things done as opposed to standing up for the that things we need to fight for,” Santorum said. “And look beyond running the organization and look at what the greater purpose is and why you’re there.”Trump, too, told reporters at the Values Voter Summit that Boehner didn’t fight enough for conservative principles. “I think it’s time. I think it’s a good thing and I think it’s time,” Trump said. ""Somebody else will come in and maybe they’ll have a little bit tougher attitude.”Boehner's departure may ironically defuse the right wing's current attempt to use a government shutdown to defund Planned Parenthood, since the outgoing speaker will be free to act as he sees fit, without fear of repercussions.But that only lasts until Oct. 30.

Bright Beginnings, which provides childcare and educational services for around 162 kids each day, made an announcement about the donation on its Facebook page Friday.“Support from individuals like Mr. Wall, gives Bright Beginnings the encouragement to continue to provide comprehensive services for homeless children in the District of Columbia,” Betty Jo Gaines, the organization's executive director, said in the statement. “It is evident that John Wall is sensitive and concerned about the plight of homeless children in D.C. and he wants these children to succeed.”The center, which focuses on kids preschool-age and younger, hopes to open a second child development center that would serve an additional 100 children, according to the Washington City Paper. The donation, which Wall made via the John Wall Family Foundation, will help the center achieve that goal.In addition to the generous donation, the point guard also a hosted two half-day-long youth basketball camps in Potamac, Maryland, this past weekend. Last year, SB Nation praised the player’s philanthropic work, noting that he donated $1 million to D.C. charities in 2013 and has partnered with the Boys & Girls clubs of Greater Washington to promote education for young people.Contact the author of this article at Hilary.Hanson@huffingonpost.com.Also on HuffPost:"

Carson also pulled nearly even with Trump in a New York Times/CBS poll released earlier this month.The latest poll, which was conducted from Sept. 20-24, also showed Sen.

Their 1-year-old son E’len was with her, and she kept a watchful eye as he wandered around the prison's waiting room. Her boyfriend has been in for a year and is supposed to be coming home next month.Elise, who said her son’s dad is the only person she knows who has been behind bars, said the biggest effect of his situation is he isn't able to help raise their son. ""He's not here,"" she said.Elise knew Pope Francis was visiting Philadelphia this weekend. With much of the city completely shut down to traffic and public transit was limited, that news was hard to miss. But she didn't know until Thursday that the pope would actually be stopping by the place where her boyfriend is incarcerated. She doesn't think Pope Francis' visit to the prison and the attention it draws to incarceration will have much of an impact on her family's life or change how the facility operates, but she figures it can't hurt.Seated a few feet away in the waiting room was Sheena, who was at the prison to visit her fiance, Kareem, who is awaiting trial on a firearms charge. The 30-year-old from the Strawberry Mansion neighborhood in North Philadelphia, was with her 28-year-old Kareem when he was arrested. They met in the neighborhood in 2011 and have been together ever since. Sheena is going to school to become a nurse; Kareem wants to become an electrician. Kareem had been working in construction, but with a bail set at $150,000, he couldn't get out. “Too much money,” Sheena said. She said it is ""frustrating"" that she only got to spend a half-hour with Jones on her visits.“It’s not comfortable,” Sheena said of her fiance being behind bars. “It’s very uncomfortable to deal with this every day, hearing his voice, being in this place.”Sheena said it will be more difficult for Kareem to get a job once he gets out.“It’s so hard because of their records,” Sheena said. “I think it’s not fair to not give nobody a chance. People want to better themselves when they come out of here, and it’s so hard to get that. People get back in here because they do things that they were trying to do when they get out just to take care of their families and their loved ones or themselves.”Before Pope Francis says mass in downtown Philadelphia, the first Jesuit pontiff will draw attention to the plight of prisoners and their families. As he wraps up his trip to the United States -- which has the largest number of individuals behind bars as well as the highest rate of incarceration in the world -- Pope Francis will be visiting the overcrowded prison facility in northeast Philadelphia. Philadelphia is the birthplace of modern-day prison practices in the United States, including the use of solitary confinement. In the late 18th century, Benjamin Franklin and a group of prison reformers argued that isolating prisoners would lead them to repent, an idea that inspired the creation of solitary cells at Walnut Street Jail.English writer Charles Dickens was not impressed with the Philly system. After visiting Eastern Penitentiary, he wrote, ""I am persuaded that those who devised this system of prison discipline, and those benevolent gentleman who carry it into execution, do not know what it is that they are doing.""The Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility is a place where nearly 80 percent of inmates have not yet gone to trial for the crime they were charged with, and are detained only for being unable to make bail. The jail has come under fire in the past for overcrowding and guard abuse. Cells are designed to hold two inmates, but three are routinely placed together, requiring the extra inmate to sleep with his head next to the toilet, said David Rudovsky, a civil rights lawyer who is currently challenging the practice in a class action lawsuit filed in federal court.""I am so close to the toilet, I can smell it,"" one inmate wrote in a complaint filed in 2010. ""[There] are mice running around and roaches that bite."" (That case was settled under undisclosed terms.) Overcrowding can increase violence between inmates, as well as between inmates and correctional officers, who must control the oversized population. In May, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported that a correctional officer was arrested for attacking an inmate and charged with “possessing an instrument of crime, obstruction, and official oppression."" A district attorney told the paper the officer attacked the inmate after he asked if he could wait outside while his cellmate used the toilet. A number of correctional officers at Curran-Fromhold have been accused of excessive force. Surveillance video captured in January of last year clearly shows an officer at the jail decking an inmate in the face and a second officer joining in on the beating. But the inmate was the one charged with assault, according to the Philadelphia City Paper.""There is a cultural thing and that's very hard to change,"" Rudovsky said, speaking of recent videos that have surfaced showing officer wrongdoing. He added, ""Whether the pope will be able to do anything about it, you know, I'm glad he's visiting … but that's not going to solve the problem.""Around 100 inmates from the facility will be meeting with Pope Francis on Sunday morning, hours before he says mass before thousands of people by the Philadelphia Art Museum. The inmates Francis will meet have been charged with a wide variety of offenses and come from a number of different religious traditions.Dino, 29, is from South Philadelphia and has been behind bars for 14 months. He hasn't been convicted of anything, but his bail is set at $250,000, so he's stuck behind bars until his trial. He told The Huffington Post that he's seen stabbings and other inmates getting jumped, often ""over something stupid"" like a basketball game, time on the phone, or what is playing on the television. The father of six -- the youngest of whom was born while he was incarcerated -- said Pope Francis “makes us realize that someone hasn’t forgotten” about inmates.Financially, he said, his family has ""basically been losing everything,"" and he's anxious to get out so he can help his wife provide for his children. He said he knows it is going to be hard to ""start all over,"" but said he's hoping to live a positive life and go back to school.“It’s hard because coming into this environment you’re basically stripped of everything that you once had before,"" Dino said. ""Since the first day that you get locked up to 14 months, I’ve been thinking about the day I got locked up. It replays and replays.” Albert Tillson, 41, is part of the smaller population of prisoners who actually has been convicted of a crime, and the practicing Muslim will be getting out of the facility just days after he meets Pope Francis. “When the pope leaves, I leave,” said Tillson, who has served 23 months on a probation violation. He said his family members called it a “blessing in disguise"" that he ended up staying in prison for as long as he did to have the opportunity to meet the pope.Louis Serrano has been behind bars for 19 months and will be leaving in January. He said the thing that needs to be fixed about the system is how bail is used.“Bails are outrageous,” Serrano said. “People lose their jobs because they give a dirty urine. You give a dirty urine, they make you do 23 months instead of just trying to work with you. At the end of the day you just need help.”Steven is a 47-year-old man and a military veteran who was originally from San Diego. He has lived in the Philadelphia region for about 20 years. He said he’s had relatively minor run-ins with the law before for “little stupid things” -- writing a bad check, public intoxication -- but this is the first time he’s been incarcerated.It's considered rude to ask somewhat what they're in for, and like many prisoners, Steven declined to discuss what he had been charged with, other than to say he was in ""for being dumb, not paying attention, being around the wrong people."" But Steven's charges are obviously serious: He said his bail is set at $500,000, that he could be sentenced to 60 to 120 years in prison, and he said he could be targeted by other prisoners because of the allegations against him. A check of court records showed that he is facing a litany of charges -- including forcible rape, unlawful sexual contact with a minor, false imprisonment and assault of a child -- stemming from an incident that took place in May 2014.Steven claims he's ""100 percent"" innocent, says he took a lie detector test, and referred to a woman he knew as ""the reason why I’m here."" Until he was arrested, he hadn't heard from the detectives investigating his case for several months, and believed the issue was behind him.He said the experience has shook up his notion of how the criminal justice system works. Steven, who worked as a chef on the outside, can't afford to hire a lawyer -- ""I don't have that kind of money,"" he said -- so he was assigned a public defender. He has met with his public defender ""once, for 37 minutes."" He declined the plea deal the district attorney had on the table, which he said would have put him behind bars for 10 to 20 years. His trial is in November.""I don’t feel that we are innocent until proven guilty, I feel that we’re guilty from Jump Street,"" Steven said, talking about what he described as a ""messed up"" system.

He hasn't seen his young son -- ""I don't want him to see me in here,"" he said -- but he writes and talks to him on the phone every week.

Their 1-year-old son E’len was with her, and she kept a watchful eye as he wandered around the prison's waiting room. Her boyfriend has been in for a year and is supposed to be coming home next month.Elise, who said her son’s dad is the only person she knows who has been behind bars, said the biggest effect of his situation is he isn't able to help raise their son. ""He's not here,"" she said.Elise knew Pope Francis was visiting Philadelphia this weekend. With much of the city completely shut down to traffic and public transit was limited, that news was hard to miss. But she didn't know until Thursday that the pope would actually be stopping by the place where her boyfriend is incarcerated. She doesn't think Pope Francis' visit to the prison and the attention it draws to incarceration will have much of an impact on her family's life or change how the facility operates, but she figures it can't hurt.Seated a few feet away in the waiting room was Sheena, who was at the prison to visit her fiance, Kareem, who is awaiting trial on a firearms charge. The 30-year-old from the Strawberry Mansion neighborhood in North Philadelphia, was with her 28-year-old Kareem when he was arrested. They met in the neighborhood in 2011 and have been together ever since. Sheena is going to school to become a nurse; Kareem wants to become an electrician. Kareem had been working in construction, but with a bail set at $150,000, he couldn't get out. “Too much money,” Sheena said. She said it is ""frustrating"" that she only got to spend a half-hour with Jones on her visits.“It’s not comfortable,” Sheena said of her fiance being behind bars. “It’s very uncomfortable to deal with this every day, hearing his voice, being in this place.”Sheena said it will be more difficult for Kareem to get a job once he gets out.“It’s so hard because of their records,” Sheena said. “I think it’s not fair to not give nobody a chance. People want to better themselves when they come out of here, and it’s so hard to get that. People get back in here because they do things that they were trying to do when they get out just to take care of their families and their loved ones or themselves.”Before Pope Francis says mass in downtown Philadelphia, the first Jesuit pontiff will draw attention to the plight of prisoners and their families. As he wraps up his trip to the United States -- which has the largest number of individuals behind bars as well as the highest rate of incarceration in the world -- Pope Francis will be visiting the overcrowded prison facility in northeast Philadelphia. Philadelphia is the birthplace of modern-day prison practices in the United States, including the use of solitary confinement. In the late 18th century, Benjamin Franklin and a group of prison reformers argued that isolating prisoners would lead them to repent, an idea that inspired the creation of solitary cells at Walnut Street Jail.English writer Charles Dickens was not impressed with the Philly system. After visiting Eastern Penitentiary, he wrote, ""I am persuaded that those who devised this system of prison discipline, and those benevolent gentleman who carry it into execution, do not know what it is that they are doing.""The Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility is a place where nearly 80 percent of inmates have not yet gone to trial for the crime they were charged with, and are detained only for being unable to make bail. The jail has come under fire in the past for overcrowding and guard abuse. Cells are designed to hold two inmates, but three are routinely placed together, requiring the extra inmate to sleep with his head next to the toilet, said David Rudovsky, a civil rights lawyer who is currently challenging the practice in a class action lawsuit filed in federal court.""I am so close to the toilet, I can smell it,"" one inmate wrote in a complaint filed in 2010. ""[There] are mice running around and roaches that bite."" (That case was settled under undisclosed terms.) Overcrowding can increase violence between inmates, as well as between inmates and correctional officers, who must control the oversized population. In May, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported that a correctional officer was arrested for attacking an inmate and charged with “possessing an instrument of crime, obstruction, and official oppression."" A district attorney told the paper the officer attacked the inmate after he asked if he could wait outside while his cellmate used the toilet. A number of correctional officers at Curran-Fromhold have been accused of excessive force. Surveillance video captured in January of last year clearly shows an officer at the jail decking an inmate in the face and a second officer joining in on the beating. But the inmate was the one charged with assault, according to the Philadelphia City Paper.""There is a cultural thing and that's very hard to change,"" Rudovsky said, speaking of recent videos that have surfaced showing officer wrongdoing. He added, ""Whether the pope will be able to do anything about it, you know, I'm glad he's visiting … but that's not going to solve the problem.""Around 100 inmates from the facility will be meeting with Pope Francis on Sunday morning, hours before he says mass before thousands of people by the Philadelphia Art Museum. The inmates Francis will meet have been charged with a wide variety of offenses and come from a number of different religious traditions.Dino, 29, is from South Philadelphia and has been behind bars for 14 months. He hasn't been convicted of anything, but his bail is set at $250,000, so he's stuck behind bars until his trial. He told The Huffington Post that he's seen stabbings and other inmates getting jumped, often ""over something stupid"" like a basketball game, time on the phone, or what is playing on the television. The father of six -- the youngest of whom was born while he was incarcerated -- said Pope Francis “makes us realize that someone hasn’t forgotten” about inmates.Financially, he said, his family has ""basically been losing everything,"" and he's anxious to get out so he can help his wife provide for his children. He said he knows it is going to be hard to ""start all over,"" but said he's hoping to live a positive life and go back to school.“It’s hard because coming into this environment you’re basically stripped of everything that you once had before,"" Dino said. ""Since the first day that you get locked up to 14 months, I’ve been thinking about the day I got locked up. It replays and replays.” Albert Tillson, 41, is part of the smaller population of prisoners who actually has been convicted of a crime, and the practicing Muslim will be getting out of the facility just days after he meets Pope Francis. “When the pope leaves, I leave,” said Tillson, who has served 23 months on a probation violation. He said his family members called it a “blessing in disguise"" that he ended up staying in prison for as long as he did to have the opportunity to meet the pope.Louis Serrano has been behind bars for 19 months and will be leaving in January. He said the thing that needs to be fixed about the system is how bail is used.“Bails are outrageous,” Serrano said. “People lose their jobs because they give a dirty urine. You give a dirty urine, they make you do 23 months instead of just trying to work with you. At the end of the day you just need help.”Steven is a 47-year-old man and a military veteran who was originally from San Diego. He has lived in the Philadelphia region for about 20 years. He said he’s had relatively minor run-ins with the law before for “little stupid things” -- writing a bad check, public intoxication -- but this is the first time he’s been incarcerated.It's considered rude to ask somewhat what they're in for, and like many prisoners, Steven declined to discuss what he had been charged with, other than to say he was in ""for being dumb, not paying attention, being around the wrong people."" But Steven's charges are obviously serious: He said his bail is set at $500,000, that he could be sentenced to 60 to 120 years in prison, and he said he could be targeted by other prisoners because of the allegations against him. A check of court records showed that he is facing a litany of charges -- including forcible rape, unlawful sexual contact with a minor, false imprisonment and assault of a child -- stemming from an incident that took place in May 2014.Steven claims he's ""100 percent"" innocent, says he took a lie detector test, and referred to a woman he knew as ""the reason why I’m here."" Until he was arrested, he hadn't heard from the detectives investigating his case for several months, and believed the issue was behind him.He said the experience has shook up his notion of how the criminal justice system works. Steven, who worked as a chef on the outside, can't afford to hire a lawyer -- ""I don't have that kind of money,"" he said -- so he was assigned a public defender. He has met with his public defender ""once, for 37 minutes."" He declined the plea deal the district attorney had on the table, which he said would have put him behind bars for 10 to 20 years. His trial is in November.""I don’t feel that we are innocent until proven guilty, I feel that we’re guilty from Jump Street,"" Steven said, talking about what he described as a ""messed up"" system. ""I don’t have one stitch of legal paperwork in my cell. I’ve given everything to God.""Steven said he's “lost pretty much everything,” as his eyes welled up. He hasn't seen his young son -- ""I don't want him to see me in here,"" he said -- but he writes and talks to him on the phone every week. New Jersey is just across the Delaware River, but it is considered an out-of-state call, meaning Steven can't use his 10 free minutes of phone time to chat with his son. His phone bills eat up nearly half of what he makes from his job in a month.Steven found out only last week that he had been selected to meet with Pope Francis. He's become very religious behind bars, and even said he wants to go to the seminary when he gets out. He believes Pope Francis is visiting the prison ""to let us know that this isn’t the end"" for the inmates. ""Jeremiah 29:11 says that [God] already knows what our future is and he has something special for each and every one of us, and I don’t believe this is it for me,"" Steven said. This could all be part of a higher plan, Steven said.“I had to come to prison to meet the pope,"" he said. ""I mean that’s … that’s breathtaking.""Ryan J. Reilly reported from Philadelphia.
