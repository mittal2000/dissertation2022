Obama has the upper hand in the fierce struggle over immigration now taking shape, with a veto pen ready to kill any Republican move to reverse his executive order, Democrats united behind him and GOP congressional leaders desperate to squelch talk of a government shutdown or even impeachment. With the public favoring changes in the current immigration system, the Republicansâ best short-term response appears to be purely rhetorical: that the president is granting amnesty to millions, and exceeding his constitutional authority in the process. Beyond that, their hopes of reversing his policies appear to be either a years-long lawsuit or the 2016 presidential election.

The internal debates following the 2014 midterm elections highlight the ideological schizophrenia that continues to plague the Democratic Party. Is the Democratic Party the party of labor unions or the party of trade deals that outsource American jobs? Is it the party of the environment or a water carrier for fossil fuel corporations? Is it the party of public education or the party of busting teachers' unions and privatizing schools? Does it favor a single-payer health care system or the predations of the for-profit model? Is it the party of peace or for endless wars? Is it the party of civil liberties or for government surveillance? Is it the party for economic justice or for catering to the rich? Over the course of the next 18 months, these types of questions are going to have to be answered (and answered acceptably for the grassroots stakeholders involved) or the 2016 elections are going to look a lot like 2014. Even in the best of times the Democratic establishment in Washington treats its base like a pariah. With the historic losses of 2014, the Democratic leadership appears to be slipping back to its familiar ""scared of its own shadow"" stance. Right now we are facing one of the worst configurations of unchecked corporate power, militarism, market fundamentalism, and environmental crisis than at any time in our history, and the messaging coming from congressional Democrats right now appears to be that becoming Republican-Lite is the smart path forward.Facing Republican control of both chambers of Congress, Washington Democrats (even in the lame duck session) are already vying for the coveted spot as the corporate oligarchy's second choice. Senate Democrats like Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, and Joe Manchin of West Virginia couldn't wait until the new Congress is sworn in this January to begin capitulating. The lame duck vote on the Keystone XL pipeline witnessed the spectacle of a bloc of Democratic Senators tripping over themselves to renounce environmentalism.It might be a preview of coming attractions. Come January, you can bet that every single ""bipartisan"" bill that makes it to the president's desk will be in servitude of the interests of the giant corporations, big banks, and the wealthiest 1 percent. President Obama's recent executive orders on immigration promise to make life a little more bearable for nearly five million people was a smart move politically -- except for the fact that he didn't do it in October when it might have had an impact on the midterms.The Republican-controlled 114th Congress will attempt to privatize everything from the U.S. Postal Service to Social Security. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his associates will try to gut every social program that benefits working people from Food Stamps to Medicaid. They'll snuff out sustainable energy investments and plow ahead with expanding fossil fuels. They'll figure out new ways to sell old wars. They'll push austerity for anyone who can't afford to attend a $30,000-a-plate fundraiser. They'll push ""free trade"" deals that outsource jobs while leaving American workers holding the bag. They'll slash unemployment insurance and other ""entitlements."" And they'll ensure that our economy continues to work for the benefit of the richest 1 percent.The mainstream corporate media -- from MSNBC to Fox News, CNN to NPR -- will serve as enablers for the whole shitty process pretending to be journalists but asking all the wrong questions and offering all of the wrong political advice. And don't forget this fact: Everything -- and I mean EVERYTHING -- the Republicans do in Congress over the next two years will be done in the service of positioning the party to take the White House in 2016. Unlike the Republicans, Democratic politicians seem to always neglect the care and feeding of their own base. They're quick to turn against any organized movement from the Left -- be it Occupy Wall Street, the World Climate Movement, teachers' unions, students' organizations, environmentalists, or the protesters acting in solidarity with the African-American community in Ferguson, Missouri -- yet all the while they expect to win their votes. In the early-1970s, ""Democrats for Nixon"" succeeded in splitting off a significant wing of conserva-Dems for the GOP. In the 1980s, Washington Democrats gave Ronald Reagan just about everything he wanted from sweeping reductions to social welfare spending to tax cuts for the rich. In the 1990s, the Democrats capitulated to Reaganomics when President Bill Clinton ""triangulated"" against the base to push through NAFTA and the WTO even when the labor unions were howling against them. Under Clinton the Democrats embraced ""welfare reform"" as if it were their idea, gutting New Deal programs like Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). They deregulated the world's biggest banks and promoted neo-liberal economic policies across the board, beating up liberals and the working-class. In the 2000s, the Democrats in Congress rolled over for George W. Bush giving him everything he wanted, voting for his disastrous war in Iraq, and going along with his domestic agenda all the way up to the brink of agreeing to partially privatizing Social Security, (which was on the table at the time Hurricane Katrina tanked Bush's approval rating). The Obama years saw many capitulations like cutting deals with Big Pharma in shaping the Affordable Care Act (while excluding single-payer advocates), bashing public school teachers and their unions, escalating the drone wars, jailing whistleblowers, institutionalizing the Bush era NSA abuses, pushing for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and so on.   And today, if the lame duck vote on the Keystone XL Pipeline is any indicator, Washington Democrats are poised to interpret the meaning of the 2014 midterms as a ""mandate"" that the American people want them to renounce everything for which their party supposedly stands.If history can be a guide, the Democratic establishment will be tempted to do the ""Democratic Leadership Council"" thing all over again, and with the same disastrous results for working people as the last time around. Unless Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders jumps into the Democratic primaries and caucuses and give the party's base something to vote for, the Democratic constituencies will limp into 2016 just as uninspired as they were 2014. The Republicans' cynical structural advantages they've institutionalized in recent years -- infinite access to dark money, gerrymandered districts, voter suppression of minorities and young people - will stand rewarded and putting the brakes on the incessant move toward corporate oligarchy in this country will be even harder to fight back against. Now is not the time for the Democratic Party to ""move to the center,"" but to fight for its heart and soul. Every time the Democratic leadership in Washington fucks its base it has moved one step closer to irrelevancy. Unfortunately, the organized Left in this country, like it or not, needs the Democratic Party."

4,BUSINESS,Banks Behaving Badly: Are You Funding Cluster Bombs?,"Amy Little, ContributorExecutive Lead, Global Alzheimer's & Dementia Action",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/banks-behaving-badly-are_b_6229174.html,"This week campaigners against cluster munitions are pressing for answers on why any financial institution or bank would choose to be associated with the production of this banned weapon. PAX, a member of the international Cluster Munition Coalition, has released a report revealing the financial institutions backing companies involved in production of cluster munitions.",2014-11-27,2014-11-27-Photo9PhongsavathManithongHandicapInternationalLaos.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-27-Photo9PhongsavathManithongHandicapInternationalLaos-thumb.jpg,"The bomb fell over there. If you like, I can show you the crater. It exploded and shattered the window. [My wife] was standing next to the window. The fragments shattered the window and cut her carotid artery. I wanted to run in the opposite direction, but I heard people screaming, ""Uncle Vanya! Uncle Vanya! Aunt Raya was killed!""In October 2014, in eastern Ukraine, Ivan described his wife's death to Human Rights Watch in terms that were in some ways quite clinical yet also very desperate. One wonders what Ivan is doing now, what support he is getting to cope with the loss of his wife, and whether those who launched the cluster munitions that killed Raya are aware that the weapon is internationally banned by the majority of the world, and that it should never, under any circumstance, be used in modern warfare. One also has to ask who gave the orders for this weapon to be used. Governments and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights are pressing for answers on this recent use of cluster munitions in Ukraine.This week campaigners against the weapon are also pressing for answers on why any financial institution or bank would choose to be associated with the production of this banned weapon. PAX, a member of the international Cluster Munition Coalition, has released a report revealing the financial institutions backing companies involved in production of cluster munitions.Sadly, loss of life and limb from cluster munitions is not unusual. Fifty years since they were used in Laos, people still suffer from the daily threat of cluster munition remnants. Some have said that the U.S. bombing of Laos was the equivalent of one planeload of cluster bombs every eight minutes, 24 hours a day, for nine years. At least 270 million cluster bomblets were dropped as part of the campaign, and approximately 80 million failed to detonate. It's because of the devastating failure rate as well as the impact on civilians at the time of use that cluster munitions are banned under the 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions. Cluster Munition Monitor records that civilians account for 94 percent of cluster munition casualties. What is increasingly unusual is countries still using the weapon. Since the international ban was agreed upon, use has been limited to a small number of states remaining outside the global ban on cluster munitions, states such as Syria, which has shown little regard for international humanitarian law across the board. Each incident of use has been followed by strong international condemnation and usually denial by the states in question, showing a clear desire to disassociate themselves from this discredited weapon. While production of cluster munitions also has been drastically reduced (18 countries including the UK, Australia, France, Germany, Japan and South Africa have ceased production), it continues to be tolerated in some countries remaining outside the global ban. Seven producers have been researched in the PAX report, from China, Singapore, South Korea and the United States. Financial investments in these seven producers, between June 2011 and September 2014, amount to US $27billion -- that's more than double the GDP of Laos, the country with more cluster munition casualties than any other. Alarmingly, some of the financial institutions investing in cluster munition producers are based in countries that have already joined the Convention on Cluster Munitions. This raises ethical and legal concerns in countries that should abide by the treaty's prohibitions (including Article 1.1.c, which prohibits assisting ""in any activity prohibited to a State Party under this Convention"" -- which includes production). Tolerating investment in cluster munition producers goes against a strong international stigma, and against the norms of international humanitarian law established by the global ban. It's time the UK, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Spain and other countries that have joined the global ban on cluster munitions regulate the practice of these bad banks to ensure they are not supporting the overseas production of weapons they have already outlawed. For every cluster munition produced, for every cluster munition used, for every cluster munition that fails to detonate, a civilian, like Ivan's wife Raya, is at too great a risk from death or injury. It's time we ask our banks to put lives before profits, and it's time for governments to put an end to this practice by introducing legislation to stop explosive investments.Phongsavath Manithong, cluster munition survivor and Handicap International Ban Advocate, Laos (© Handicap International Laos)"

6,BLACK VOICES,Volunteers In Ferguson Help Ward Off Looters,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ferguson-volunteers-ward-_n_6231632.html,,2014-11-27,"A local business is boarded up in anticipation of another night of unrest in Ferguson, Missouri on November 25, 2014. Protesters set buildings ablaze and looted stores in the US town of Ferguson on November 24 after a grand jury chose not to press charges against a white officer who shot dead a black teen. US President Barack Obama and the family of late 18-year-old Michael Brown appealed in vain for calm after a prosecutor said a grand jury had found the policeman acted in self-defense. AFP PHOTO/Michael B. Thomas (Photo credit should read Michael B. Thomas/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e69d41f2300002d1ade4032.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"FERGUSON, MO., Nov 26 (Reuters) - Since looting first erupted following the August police shooting of black teenager Michael Brown, nearly all the businesses in a 2 square mile area of this St Louis suburb have had to board up. All except one - a Conoco gas station and convenience store.At least a dozen stores have been set ablaze and others looted in Ferguson in racially charged riots since a grand jury on Monday cleared white policeman Darren Wilson in the shooting, which has torn apart this predominantly black Missouri city.The unrest surrounding Brown's death has underscored the often-tense nature of U.S. race relations. But the gas station has stood out as a beacon, literally and figuratively, as nightfall has descended and chaos has reigned around it.On Tuesday night, as police and soldiers took up positions in the parking lots of virtually every strip mall and big box store around it, the forecourt of the brightly lit gas station was busy with customers.One, a six feet, eight-inch tall man named Derrick Jordan - ""Stretch,"" as friends call him - whisked an AR-15 assault rifle out from a pickup truck parked near the entrance.Jordan, 37, was one of four black Ferguson residents who spent Tuesday night planted in front of the store, pistols tucked into their waistbands, waiting to ward off looters or catch shoplifters.Jordan and the others guarding the gas station are all black. The station's owner is white.Ferguson has seen a stark demographic shift in recent decades, going from all white to mostly black. About two-thirds of the town's 21,000-strong population are black. By some accounts, the Brown shooting has heightened racial tensions in the city. But not at the gas station.""We would have been burned to the ground many times over if it weren't for them,"" said gas station owner Doug Merello, whose father first bought it in 1984.Merello said he feels deep ties to Ferguson, and if the loyalty of some of his regular customers is any indication, the feeling is mutual.REPAYING A DEBTAt times, Jordan and his friends were joined on Tuesday night by other men from the neighborhood, also armed. None of the men was getting paid to be there. They said they felt they owed it to Merello, who has employed many of them over the years and treats them with respect.""He's a nice dude, he's helped us a lot,"" said a 29 year old who identified himself as R.J. He said he, like the other volunteers, had lived a short distance away from the store for most of his life.He carried a Taurus 9mm pistol in his sweatpants and drew it out to show another customer, an older man at a pump who was brandishing a MAC-10 machine pistol.Missouri allows the open carrying of firearms. State lawmakers recently passed a law overriding any local ordinance that banned the open carry of firearms by people who have concealed weapons permits.R.J. said on Monday they chased away several groups of teenagers rampaging through the area.But they have also had a close brush with soldiers from the Missouri National Guard, who mistook them for looters, he said. The guardsmen, rifles raised, had handcuffed one man before Merello came outside the store to explain that the residents were trying to help, not hurt.While the volunteer guards talked, a white SUV pulled up and a thin young man sauntered into the store. A few moments later, there was a commotion. Merello frogmarched the man out the store.One of the armed residents, Sean Turner, showed the .40 caliber pistol in his jacket and told the man, ""This is what happens if you try to steal from this place.""

The two men had purchased pipe bombs during an undercover FBI operation, a source told CBS News.Baldwin and Davis, both members of the New Black Panther Party, are in police custody and have waived their right to make a case for bail on the gun charges. They pleaded not guilty on Tuesday. The men's plans included placing a bomb at the top of the arch's famous observation deck and killing Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson and St. Louis Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch, sources told the Post-Dispatch. Additional charges reflecting the plot were expected to be filed, the newspaper reported.Ferguson has been rocked by protests since Monday night, when McCulloch announced in a bumbling press conference that a grand jury had decided not to indict Wilson for fatally shooting unarmed teenager Michael Brown in August. Similar demonstrations followed Brown's killing.Thousands of protesters across the country, from New York City to Los Angeles, have taken to the streets this week in solidarity with Brown's family. While some of the demonstrations have been marred by violence and looting, most have been peaceful.Wilson defended his actions, saying he ""just did what I was paid to do,"" in a widely publicized interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos Tuesday.The New Black Panther Party, a controversial organization that has been accused of encouraging violence against white people, Jews and law enforcement, has taken an active role in the Ferguson protests since August, and Davis denounced Wilson's actions at a rally in a Ferguson church last month. ""This is not the first Mike Brown, and it won't be the last, if we do not unite,"" he said at the time. ""Divided, we lose brothers and sisters. If you do not unite, put aside your differences and unite, you can expect no changes in the future.""For more on Davis and Baldwin's thwarted plot, visit the St. Louis Post-Dispatch."

Shum and Leung received similar bail terms.The student leaders both accused police of using excessive force, while Shum said he believed the bail conditions were unreasonable as his office was near the banned area.""The area I am banned from is way larger than the injunction area,"" said Shum. ""I will discuss with my lawyer whether we appeal or not.""The Mong Kok clearance was the second time in as many weeks that police, court bailiffs and workers have moved to enforce court-ordered injunctions to clear the streets.The protesters are demanding open nominations for the Chinese-controlled city's next chief executive nomination in 2017. Beijing said in August it would allow a vote, but only among pre-screened candidates.Lined with banks, noodle shops and gritty tenements, the streets of Mong Kok have been a key battleground for protesters and mobs intent on disbanding them, and was viewed as the protest site most likely to resist clearance.While the protesters regrouped and tried to storm back onto the roads, they ultimately failed to penetrate the mass of police armed with pepper spray and batons deployed to defend the major traffic intersections. Some protesters were hospitalized with head injuries from police batons.The main protest site in Admiralty next to the city's chief executive office and barracks for China's People's Liberation Army remains largely intact, with no suggestion of police moving in there yet. There is also a small protest site in the Causeway Bay shopping district.As the students regroup, they may target government buildings, another student leader told local broadcaster RTHK.""Further actions include a possibility of some escalations pointed at government-related buildings,"" Hong Kong Federation of Students member Yvonne Leung said.Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to Chinese Communist Party rule in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" formula that gave it some autonomy from the mainland and an undated promise of universal suffrage.
