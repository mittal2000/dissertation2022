We'll unpack what went down, in case you happened to get sidetracked by the hoopla of the Met Gala's red carpet.A Look Back at the 2014 Online Art Market  Good news abounds in the latest Hiscox Online Art Trade Report.Global online art sales took a big leap forward last year as the market reached $2.6 billion, up from $1.6 billion in 2013. At this pace, the online art market will reach $6.3 billion in 2019. Not a small number, considering how many people balked at the notion of buying fine art sight unseen a mere few years ago. Figures indicate that online art buying accounts for 4.8 percent of the estimated $55 billion global art market.Online art platforms, such as UGallery.com and Artsy, have changed the game. For the first time ever, less than half of buyers, 48 percent, prefer to purchase art in a brick-and-mortar gallery. With 84 percent of online art sales happening under the $15,000 price point, there is lots of activity taking place outside of the Sotheby's auction headlines. Quick! Upgrade Your Diebenkorns for Rothkos Tax-Free While You Still Can  As more and more collectors view art as an investment, it is only natural that it is being used -- and exploited -- as one. At least for now. In his 2016 budget, Obama proposes to eliminate a popular tax break that allows wealthy art collectors to avoid capital gains taxes on profitable art sales, according to the New York Times. The law was originally introduced in the 1920s to ease the tax burden of farmers who wanted to swap property. Now known as a like-kind exchange, the Times writes that ""the tactic has become vogue for a new niche of investors: buyers of high-end art who want to put off -- and sometimes completely avoid -- federal taxes when upgrading their Diebenkorns for Rothkos.""The Obama administration estimates that eliminating the exemption could bring in as much as $19.5 billion in deferred or avoided taxes over the coming decade. Can art museums be intimidating or unwelcoming to racial minorities?   In the wake of racial tension and turmoil that has prompted protests throughout the country, this question became a hot topic during Michelle Obama's dedication ceremony at the extravagant new Whitney museum in New York. Here is what FLOTUS had to say:You see, there are so many kids in this country who look at places like museums and concert halls and other cultural centers and they think to themselves, well, that's not a place for me, for someone who looks like me, for someone who comes from my neighborhood,"" she said. ""In fact, I guarantee you that right now, there are kids living less than a mile from here who would never in a million years dream that they would be welcome in this museum. And growing up on the South Side of Chicago, I was one of those kids myself.There is a large socio-economic gap in the United States, especially in urban environments where museums are most common. Sociologists say there is a phenomenon of ""threshold fear"" taking place, whereby price or comfort barriers are preventing people from going inside. Here is one fix museums could install to help make the experience more welcoming: free admission. In Europe, for example, most museums are free, attracting a completely diverse audience: locals, travelers, penniless students, professors and the average bloke taking a long lunch break. *Insider Tip: In New York City, museums such as the Natural History Museum, the MET and Brooklyn Museum are all technically free as they ask for a suggested donation.

""Just the way he dropped that coat, like dropping dirty laundry in a hamper, told me everything I needed to know about that man."" She told me a longer story, this one happier. Since we didn't have much money when I was growing up, my mother always shopped at thrift stores in the San Diego area where we lived.On one of her trips to Value Village, just a few days before Christmas, she saw an elderly woman approach the manager. My mother recognized the woman; like Mom, she was a regular customer. From her cloth bag, the woman produced a tin can covered with aluminum foil and said, ""I shop here all the time, so I'd like to give something back. I don't have much, but I do have this can of bacon fat I've saved. It's good for cooking."" The store manager looked down at the woman and gently took the can. He waited a few moments before responding; my mother guessed he was thinking of what to say. Obviously, he couldn't sell the can of bacon fat to customers, she told me. ""Thank you, Ma'am,"" he said. ""That's very nice of you."" The woman got a big smile on her face, turned around, and left the store. ""What wisdom that store manager had!"" said my mother, a big smile on her face, too, as she told me the story. Labors of loveHearing stories from my mother about caring, and lack of caring, got me to open my eyes to caring experiences in my own life.When I was an undergrad at UC San Diego, I rode a white van that took staff and students between University Hospital downtown and the main UCSD campus up in La Jolla. I got to know the driver, William, an African-American who had a steady, pleasant manner. His job required a lot of driving, but also a lot of sitting and waiting in his van. I was the first to step into his van one day and heard a gentle tapping sound that stopped as I entered. I leaned forward and saw that William had a spoon and a coin, of sorts, in his hands. I asked him what he was doing. William showed me the coin, which was a silver quarter -- or had been. The heads and tails of it were clearly visible, yet its edge had been turned into what looked like the outside of a ring. William had ever so gradually tapped the coin into that form with a tablespoon. ""I'm making a ring for my wife,"" he said. ""It's something I learned in the Navy. When I've got it the right size, I'll cut out the center and polish it."" He had been working on it a few months, he said, and still had a few more months to go. Then he let me hold it. The coin, on its way to becoming a ring, was warm from his hands, and the outside was patterned with the smallest of hammer marks. After a few seconds, I handed it back. It felt like he had given me a gift just to be able to hold it for that short time. This, I thought, was a true labor of love, an object transformed, with monumental patience, by his loving hands to adorn the hand of his beloved.   Recalling this reminds me of another story my mother told me. A woman was having breakfast with her husband one February morning. ""Honey, I just realized something,"" she said. ""You remember I told you how I've been struggling to get my car started on these cold mornings? Whatever the problem was, it seems to have gone away. "" She saw his ever-so-slight smile. It was then that she realized what he'd done. ""You've been going out there, haven't you?""Yes, he had.

It was the end of the season and maybe we wouldn't see anything. Ngala doesn't stock it's park. It's entirely within Kruger, without a fence between it's private land and Kruger's public, so the animals have some 7,500 square miles in which to roam. Willa was the only one among us who managed to see nothing on our trip to Alaska last year: no bears, seals, whales or orcas and the only eagle she saw was in a rehabilitation centre. Given her luck, our expectations were not high.We figured if we spotted one giraffe we'd be lucky. Here's what we saw: herds of elephants, impala, water buffalo and antelope; a crash of rhinos; a pride of lions; a dazzle of zebras, a tower of giraffes, a thunder of hippopotami; a cackle of hyenas; a troop of baboons; an implausibility of wildebeast; a sounder of warthogs; and a leap of leopards. Yes. A leap of leopards. That was just in the first 24 hours.    For more animals, go to my second picture postcard from Kruger Park please."
4,POLITICS,Racial Disparities in Health Care Access Magnified As More Gain Coverage,"LeeAnn Hall, ContributorCo-Director of People's Action and People's Action Institute",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/racial-disparities-in-health-care-access-magnified--as-more-gain-coverage_b_7236416.html,"Many people have never had health insurance, or maybe not for years, and have trouble getting clear information about what's included in their coverage, such as preventive care, checkups and routine tests.",2015-05-08,"A picture of a piggy bank, a stethoscope and a wad of bank notes.

He was describing the frustration people in his tiny hometown on the Mississippi Delta experienced trying to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Most families in the town still don't have Internet in their homes; cellphone reception is unreliable, it comes and goes like the clouds blowing across the sky. ""It is so rural, most people can't imagine life there,"" said McKay-West. ""Most people don't have Internet, if they do, it's very slow. It's not the technology most people in bigger cities are used to these days.""I know people who were trying to sign up for health care coverage, but they don't have Internet at home, they don't have email addresses. When they tried to sign up by telephone, the assistants on the other end often told them to just go to the library and use the Internet there to sign up and check their email.""In the neighborhood where I grew up, the library is 15 miles away,"" said McKay-West.His story illustrates just one of the many challenges we have in bringing health insurance -- and then quality health care -- to all people and all communities across the country. As more people gain health insurance, unless we take concerted action to tackle glaring racial disparities in access to health care, those disparities will only be magnified.In a new report ""Breaking Barriers: Improving health insurance enrollment and access to health care,"" author and researcher Gary Delgado provides plentiful evidence that the doors to quality health care are still closed to many people of color, families in rural communities, the poor, and those with language and cultural barriers.Delgado, a visiting scholar at the University of California, Berkeley's Institute of Social Change and a longtime civil and human rights leader, led a team that surveyed 1,200 low-income people in 10 states in Spanish, Cantonese and English. The report was released by the Alliance for a Just Society.""Obamacare didn't cause the widespread racial disparities we found, but neither did it solve them,"" said Delgado. ""We have a lot more work to do.""There is progress. In late April, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock signed legislation accepting federal funding for Medicaid expansion that will extend health insurance coverage to as many as 70,000 more people. However, there are still 21 other states where legislators continue to turn their backs on people - about 3.8 million people - who fall into the Medicaid coverage gap, denying them access to affordable health insurance. These are people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, but not enough to qualify for ACA marketplace subsidies or afford premiums and deductibles on their own.It's even more insulting when you plot these 21 states on a map. More than half are states in the Deep South, the states of the Old Confederacy, where a disproportionate share of uninsured people are people of color, especially African American and Latino. There is no other way to describe it than health care racism. Expanding Medicaid is just the first step toward ending it.The struggle to access quality care continues even after people of color have health insurance, including the high costs of premiums and deductibles. Many people have never had health insurance, or maybe not for years, and have trouble getting clear information about what's included in their coverage, such as preventive care, checkups and routine tests.Insurance companies must also be held to their obligation for reducing racial health disparities, and increase transparency in their reporting of results.In some communities, just finding a personal doctor within a reasonable distance of your home is difficult. Going to the doctor should be no more than a 30-minute trip. Even after enrollment, technology continues to be a barrier when insurance companies expect payments online or send important notices by email.As the ""Breaking Barriers"" report recommends, innovative options like school-based health care and community clinics and have to be supported and encouraged, particularly in rural areas. Medical-legal partnerships should be developed to address environmental factors that impact health, especially in low-income communities where issues like mold in housing and industrial toxins create serious health risks.Delgado describes the Affordable Care Act as a new house built on an old foundation, using the old bricks. He's right, we need a stronger foundation and more bricks. We also need to welcome everyone inside to enjoy the basic human right of quality, affordable health care."

""There's not one piece of hardware or software from back then that exists today,"" he explained. While information technology has had a profound impact on virtually every industry in the years between, many teachers continue to resist its presence in their classrooms. Whitby, through his Connected Educator blog, book The Relevant Educator (which he co-authored with Stephen W. Anderson), and active presence on Twitter (he is a co-founder of #EdChat) constantly challenges teachers to embrace the new (even when it is confusing and uncomfortable.) It's no longer enough, believes Whitby, for an educator to be a specialist in a given subject, topic or content area. This is because social media is enabling teachers to share ideas, resources and lesson plans with anyone else interested in tapping into them. Like it or not, teachers today must be comfortable with incorporating all of these inputs and points of view into their instruction. It's more about teaching students how to learn than what to learn. ""If any teacher could take the content in their head and put that into the heads of their students, their students would still be limited,"" Whitby said. ""What's required is a different mindset.""Practicing what you preach It's a regrettable irony, notes Whitby, that schools try to instill a love in lifelong learning in their students but don't really set the same bar for their teachers. ""Using the term 'technology' scares the hell out of them,"" he said. ""Information in the 19th and 20th century didn't move that quickly. As a result, (the practice) of education became quite conservative. Technology requires teachers to get out of their comfort zones."" The growing number of teachers who have made it to the other side -- or started their careers with blended learning tools already in place -- actively seek each other out on Twitter and other social networks. When Whitby founded #EdChat with Anderson and Shelly Sanchez Terrell six years ago, they discovered there were already thousands of connected educators waiting to join the conversation. For the uninitiated, #edchat is a weekly facilitated Twitter conversation that takes place on Tuesdays at noon and 7p.m. EST. The noon start time was added to benefit those in Europe who Whitby said ""were staying up late"" to chime in and read what what their peers were saying. Whitby and others moderate conversations based on topics voted on by the community. The topics typically revolve around trends in education, technology integration, and new models for instructional delivery. The hour-long sessions attract comments and input from hundreds of educators.Learning from other educators  When Whitby isn't writing, Tweeting and podcasting on Edchat Radio, he is reading, video chatting and learning from other teachers. Those of us at appoLearning share his point of view that the best way to learn about innovations in education is from other educators using new digital tools in their own instruction. This is why we built a search engine for educational apps (iOS and Android), videos and websites that are all vetted and evaluated by other teachers. So if teachers are looking for free iPad apps that teach reading, videos that inspire high school students to learn physics, or the best resources to teach a particular Common Core State Standard, they can find them by typing in keywords or browsing our directory. Equally as important is that can see and learn more about the educator who is evaluating them. Identifying teacher-vetted digital learning tools, and sharing ideas with peers via Twitter, Facebook, Google Hangouts and other channels is the best way for connected educators to understand the promise of new technology while also advancing their careers. ""It's all about establishing a professional learning network,"" Whitby said. ""Everybody's professional learning network looks different.""While no two professional learning networks are like, there is one common thread in all of them.""Ultimately it's about figuring out what the teacher is trying to teach, and then seeing if you can use that technology to enhance a particular lesson."""

Many readers thought these lies sounded familiar, and several people shared others they have heard.I like this one and think it often is told.""In this economy you're lucky to have a job."" This [lie] can go on for years... no matter how well the company is doing. People believe it and settle for less than they are worth.Blaming the economy has been a very popular excuse of late. As the CEO and a founder of Aha! (which is product roadmap software), this trend troubles me. One reader shared another thought that can be especially painful to any employee's ears.The main lie is ""you don't deserve it.""This idea completely negates an employee's hard work and cuts right to their self-worth. I shared my own experience, a time when I met all of my objectives and still did not get the raise I deserved. One reader took me to task for this.Expecting a raise for on-par performance is rather silly. You're supposed to meet your objectives; that's your job and that's what you're being paid for in the first place. If you want more money, out-perform yourself, and make sure it gets noticed!It's true: Not all employers are stingy, and sometimes they are surprisingly generous when an employee does great work. But that's not always the case, and sometimes the ""lousy"" seem to do well too. I am sure you know a colleague who got the big raise or promotion -- which left you shaking your head. Where is the wisdom in that?Smart leaders recognize that there is much more to management than simply sorting employees in two tight boxes: stars and losers. Successful managers have the maturity to recognize that good employees may do things that look bad to others, but they may do them for important reasons. Here is why a manager might decide to give a raise to a ""bad"" employee:They consider the whole.Smart managers see the whole employee. When deciding who should receive a raise, they take a step back and examine the entire body of work. What were the hits and misses? They also consider factors beyond the employee's control, as well as her overall progress toward her goals. One missed objective should not cancel out the rest of an employee's good contributions.Maybe the boss asked the employee to be ""bad.""A co-worker may not know the complete story. In fact, the manager may be the one who made the employee look bad in the first place. For example, he asked the employee to go break some glass in the organization to get a hard job done, and she did it. For that reason, he might reward her for completing a tough but necessary task.They see the potential.Every employee has room to improve -- when you are getting going, there is only one way to go but up. Giving a raise to an employee who is growing affirms that her manager believes in her. A boost in pay may be just another motivational tool to remind her that she matters and her best is still to come.A good manager knows many things, especially how to recognize a valuable employee when they see one.Smart leaders realize that each employee brings her own set of unique motivations and skills to their role in the company. They also know that giving a raise sends a clear message to employees of their worth -- a valuable management tool if there ever was one. So, be weary of what you think you see and be slow to jump to judgement.Have you seen a co-worker receive a raise that you thought she did not deserve?"

Heyburn II, one of America's most distinguished federal judges, died after a long battle with cancer. He was 66.Judge Heyburn, whose official obituary follows this personal tribute, was a beloved friend of our family. He and my wife were fourth cousins, but their friendship was much closer. He and I shared a love for our city, our country, our history and our Constitution.The following tribute appears in the Courier-Journal (Louisville, Ky.) where I was an editorial writer, then editorial page editor from 1977-2012. What follows is the full obituary from the newspaper, which you could find on the newspaper's website.He will be honored with a funeral and burial. But most of all, he is honored in the hearts of those who remember him -- his smile, his integrity, his love for his nation and his devotion to serving the public good.'He made you feel lucky to know him'By Keith L. RunyonLOUISVILLE -- One October morning in 2012, my cell phone rang. It was John Heyburn. In his genial, straightforward manner, he asked, ""Can you meet me for lunch in ten minutes at Austin's?"" Ten minutes later, we were seated in a both, our ice tea served.John got right to the point, one of his many gifts. A dear mutual friend (and my wife's cousin) had recently died of pancreatic cancer; her death was early and tragic. John, diagnosed with advanced cancer some months before, was forthright: ""I want to be intentional about our friendship. Let's try to have lunch every month."" Then he gave his big-as-all-outdoors-smile: ""I think we have a lot to share."" It was the first time a friend had said anything like this to me. There were many good times that followed. Although we frequently talked about current events, politics and history, more often we caught up with the news of our families -- our wives, our children. We talked about his mother, who had presided with his late father over a rollicking, intellectual household in St. Matthews where John and his three siblings grew up. He never referred to it as rollicking but his family and my wife's have been friends for generations and rollicking is her description. His beloved wife, Martha, a leading ophthalmologist, and his sons, Will and Jack, were star athletes and academically inclined, like their father. He was so proud of them.John's complete disinterest in gossip or criticism of other people was always so appealing -- and admirable. If he didn't want to venture an opinion about someone, or something, he might say, ""Well, that's interesting."" (That was one of his favorite words, and he pronounced it precisely, ""in-ter-rest-ing."") For someone who is known as ""Judge,"" it was an admirable quality; he was true to the biblical admonition about never judging others. John was very candid about his cancer treatments but always optimistic that they would produce results. There was never a complaint. He lived three-and-a-half more years and issued during that time what may someday be recalled as one of the nation's most important civil rights rulings. This is the one that said Kentucky's amendment banning gay marriage denied due process of law under the U.S. Constitution. On April 28, just one day before his death, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the appeal of several states' gay marriage cases. John's ruling was among them.  In the immediate aftermath of his untimely death, the headlines and commentary focused on that case, giving what I believe to be short shrift to his long and productive career and other legacies. In his tenure on the bench and in civic life, there were so many other things that he achieved that made our world better. In time, I hope, these will be more widely saluted.John frequently said that he and I had the two best jobs in town. He got to study, write and make legal decisions as a federal judge. And I got to read, study and write opinions about just about anything as editorial pages editor. He was right.In 1998, he wrote a column for The Courier-Journal's Forum page saying that he thought judges ought to be ""activist enough to correct manifest injustices . . . yet restrained enough to allow democracy to work in the fullness of time.""  John's behavior and demeanor on the bench reflected the man he was in private. He looked at things objectively, and with tremendous perspective. More often than not, he had a smile on his face. He had a great sense of humor. John innately revered history and especially the law although it seems clear that he knew some past legal decisions were flawed.One of these examples is when John articulated the importance of school diversity through his decisions. He knew racial disparities, learned in part when he tutored reading at the Park DuValle Neighborhood Health Center in west Louisville. After lengthy federal court hearings he required, in 2004, he ruled that the Jefferson County School District must consider race as a key factor in its student assignments, so as to retain integration and diversity. At that time he wrote, ""Integrated schools, better academic performance, appreciation for our diverse heritage and stronger, more competitive public schools are consistent with central values and themes of American culture.""In 2007, the Roberts Court narrowly overturned his 2004 opinion. He never criticized that decision. Such was his reverence for the American Constitution and the rule of law, even if he disagreed.  U. S. Senator, Mitch McConnell, now the Majority Leader, whose record in public office is far from complete, can certainly feel confident that one of the best things he has done was recommend John Heyburn for the federal bench.  Last October, at the unveiling of John's official portrait at the federal Courthouse in Louisville, published with this tribute, Mitch offered a moving and heartfelt tribute to his old friend."" John did more than inspire confidence and respect, he said. Rather he impressed ""with his intellect and erudition. ... His impact [as a jurist] has been enormous."" And, the Senator added: ""He made ""you feel lucky to know him.""He certainly did.Keith L. Runyon retired in 2012 after 43 years with The Courier-Journal, where he was opinion pages and book editor, among other things. He is now a commentator on public radio and for the Huffington Post.Obituary from The Courier-Journal, Louisville, Kentucky:The Honorable John G. Heyburn II, 66, United States District Judge, whose passion for the rule of law, wisdom, joy and kindness enabled him to rise to national leadership in the governance of the Third Branch of the U.S. Government, passed away peacefully on Wednesday afternoon, April 29, in his beloved home surrounded by his family and God's Heavenly Country. He was born on Nov. 12, 1948, in Boston, MA, to Henry Reuter and Frances Starks Heyburn. Judge Heyburn graduated from Milton Academy (1966), where his track records remained unbroken until they were retired upon the building of a new track; Harvard University (1970), where he earned varsity letters all four years as a member of the decorated and undefeated Harvard track team led by the legendary Coach Bill McCurdy, as well as the Cross Country team; and the University of Kentucky College of Law (1976). In law school he was a member of the National Moot Court Team, a runner-up in the Sixth Circuit Moot Court Competition and a member of the Order of Barristers, an Appellate Advocate Honorary Society. He later served his alma mater as President of the Law Alumni Association and established the Henry R. Heyburn Alumni and Public Service Award there. In June, he is to be inducted into the College of Law's Hall of Fame, the highest award given by the law school presented to alumni who have distinguished themselves by contributions in their own field of work or in the betterment of humanity. He served in the U.S. Army Reserve from 1970-1976; he retired as a First Lieutenant with an Honorable Discharge. He began his legal career as an associate and later partner at the firm then known as Brown Todd and Heyburn, where he specialized in litigation. His love of politics was manifest in his early work for the 1971 gubernatorial campaign of Tom Emberton, where he made lifelong friends, including Sen. Mitch McConnell, in whose earliest campaigns for Jefferson County Judge/Executive he worked and for whom he consulted during Sen. McConnell's tenure as County Judge. He also ran two campaigns for public office himself, for Jefferson County Attorney in 1981 and for Jefferson County Judge/Executive in 1989. Like his father and grandfather before him, Judge Heyburn was a leader in civic life. From 1983-1986 he served as chairman of the Louisville- Jefferson County Crime Commission. He served as a director of the Louisville Bar Foundation (1986-1988, 1994-1999), and director of Kentucky Citizens for Judicial Improvement (1975-1976). He served on a wide variety of boards including Cave Hill Cemetery, Inc., Louisville Committee on Foreign Relations, Louisville Free Public Library and Cedar Lake Lodge. He enjoyed memberships in a wide variety of professional, personal and sports related clubs , including The Royal Dornoch Golf Club in Dornoch, Scotland, the U.S. Seniors Golf Association, and Salamagundi, a Louisville speaking club over 100 years in continuous existence.In 1992, Sen. McConnell recommended him to President George H.W. Bush for appointment to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky. In an unusual show of bipartisan support, Sen. Wendell Ford also endorsed Judge Heyburn's nomination. Twenty-three years later, he has demonstrated clearly to all his unbiased commitment to accuracy in the application and interpretation of the law. He is remembered as a master of the courtroom, a delightful colleague and an artful chief judge of the Western District, who was known for his depth of preparedness, wisdom, humor and kindness. The late Chief Justice William Rehnquist appointed Judge Heyburn to the Budget Committee of the U.S. Judicial Conference in 1994. He rose to chair this committee and hence was in charge of the budget for the Federal Judiciary for eight years beginning in 1997. As chairman, he was called to interface and collaborate with House and Senate leaders, testify before various subcommittees and consult with foreign governments regarding judicial reform -- tasks all well suited to his interest and knowledge of political and governance interests as well as the structure and needs of the Judiciary. In 2007, Chief Justice John G. Roberts appointed him to chair the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, which works to identify complex cases in Federal courts across the country and centralize them for efficiency and consistency. In 2014, his final year as chairman, the cases that came before the panel accounted for 38% of the civil cases filed in the Federal system. In his characteristic fashion of always seeking to improve, he thoroughly modernized the panel's rules and procedures, resulting in streamlined procedures, increased accessibility and accountability, transparency of the process and amplified training for new and sitting judges presiding over such complex cases. His vision of judicial service was not merely to decide cases, but to help hold together and, wherever possible, to improve a legal system already the envy of the entire world. His vision was always for improvement, transparency and efficiency on both sides of the process. He treated the arguments of each lawyer and each party with respect and taught his clerks to do so as well.This kind, dedicated and respectful manner guided him in all he did. He took a special interest in sharing the joys and concerns of his family and others such as law clerks, colleagues considering life changes or young people furthering a passion such as a sport, college or graduate school or careers. More than anything, the quality that most defined and informed him and his actions personally and professionally was that he loved life and the individuals he encountered. He had an ability to cut through a concern to its essential quality often not identified in the question brought before him. He saw promise and ability in others where some felt uncertainty and confusion in themselves. He inspired confidence with his insights and observations. His was a loving, observant, joyful and patient spirit who left us all better for having known him. How unique for such a wise and masterful judge to have lived in and out of the courtroom without making a judgmental or critical comment about another person. Well done, good and faithful servant. He was preceded in death by his father, Henry R. Heyburn, a prominent attorney, who was a founder of Brown Todd and Heyburn law firm (now Frost Brown Todd); politician, state senator, civic leader and World War II veteran, who earned both a Silver Star and a Bronze Star. He is survived by the love of his life, anchor, partner and wings in the joys and relationships of life as well as the challenges, Dr. Martha Keeney Heyburn; two sons, William Arthur Heyburn of New York City, and John Hail Heyburn of Washington, D.C.; his mother, Frances Starks Heyburn; two brothers, Franklin Heyburn of Vermont and Henry (Alicia) Heyburn Jr. of Maine; a sister, Frannie Pistell, of Long Island; their children, his nieces and nephews, as well as his brothers-in-law and their sons, who are like brothers to his sons; and he is survived by all those he loved and mentored, and the institutions he served and worked to leave better than when he accepted the challenge of their leadership, which may be his living legacy. A Celebration of His Life will be held at St. Francis in the Fields Episcopal Church, 6710 Wolf Pen Branch Road (at the corner of U.S. 42, near the Gene Snyder Freeway) at 10 a.m. Friday, May 8, with burial to follow at Cave Hill Cemetery. A visitation will be offered at the church on Thursday, May 7, from 1 to 4 p.m. and 5 to 8 p.m.In lieu of flowers, the family suggests contributions to Norton Cancer Institute, where gifts will be used to improve the care and outcomes of other Kentuckians battling cancer now and in the future, in care of Lynnie Meyer, Director of the Norton Healthcare Foundation, 234 E Gray St. #450, Louisville, KY 40202; (502) 629-8060."

Some commentators saw Benedict XVI's election as a triumph for elements of John Paul II's legacy: the end of a ""social Catholicism"" and the beginning of a solidly doctrinal Catholicism. However, it became clear that a purely theological interpretation of the role of the pope was not sufficient for a Catholic Church whose theology relied on interpretation, rather than dictates of the faith.The surprising retirement of Pope Benedict XVI in February 2013 marked the end of a papacy reluctant to take on the full array of duties of the Bishop of Rome: pastoral, ecumenical, interreligious or diplomatic. By the time Pope Francis was elected on March 13, 2013, the church was more shocked and distraught than it wanted to admit. The polarization within the church is the central issue that will be raised over the next decade: it is not just a political and ideological polarization (as in the United States), but also a polarization between local churches and the Vatican (a rising issue in Germany); between the bishops and new ecclesiastical movements (as in Japan); and between a church focused on missionaries and an institutional church committed to maintaining the status quo (a conflict visible in Italy and throughout the world). Pope Francis is well aware of these internal polarizations, and that awareness has made the papacy more relevant today than it has been in the past. After two papacies that were widely regarded as not particularly effective in uniting the church, Francis's papacy has been a symbol of unity for worldwide Catholicism. For the great majority of Catholics who are not intimately familiar with internal Vatican politics, questions regarding the structure of the church seem much less urgent than other issues. But the next decade will prove decisive in showing whether the church has the capacity to reform itself. The main governing body of the church, the Roman Curia, still closely resembles the one that was first created in 1588; the reforms of the 20th century has largely left its pre-modern infrastructure unchanged. Meanwhile, the role of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (the former Sant'Uffizio) is still primarily one of censorship, even after Pope Francis's decision to radically restructure the influence of the Congregation during his papacy. Yet church initiatives over the past decades reveal that internal structural change is still an open question. Pope Paul VI attempted to reform the Curia; John Paul II entrusted Sant'Uffizio with governance; Benedict XVI (who served as prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith from 1981-2005), never viewed the governing of the church as one of his main duties. This is not just a formal question concerning the joint governance, decentralization and democratization of the decision-making process, but an essential question for the church. Those who are familiar with the results of centralization during the years leading up to Pope Francis's papacy (for example: the new English translation of the mass), understand the disastrous problems caused by the ""Romanization"" -- reorientation towards Rome and the Vatican -- that the Vatican imposed upon a church that has become ever more global.Upon examination, it becomes obvious that during the last decade, leading up to the election of Pope Francis, this ""Romanization"" coincided -- particularly during the papacy of Pope Benedict -- with serious threats to the unity of the church, specifically regarding church teachings about sexuality and the role of women. It is no coincidence that this was also the era when many (not, however, Pope Francis), attempted to relegate the ideas and doctrines of the Second Vatican Council that were not well adapted to modern shifts in attitudes to the archives of history. Pope Francis has assumed the agenda of Vatican II, and has even brought issues of sexuality and the role of women in the church into discussion, although they were not directly addressed in the council. After a decade of traditionalism encouraged by the Vatican, Pope Francis finally has before him the task of presenting a church that is aware of what can be changed while still maintaining centuries of tradition. Over next decade, a church that is more global than ever will debate a long list of issues ranging from sexuality and homosexuality, women, marriage and family to social justice and the environment -- a list of causes that have differing degrees of urgency for the different branches of Catholicism. For this reason, the Synod of Bishops at the Vatican, which was convened twice by Pope Francis (both in October 2014 and October 2015 -- an occurrence without precedent), represents a new initiative for a church that will, over the next decade, discover whether the democratic nature of this papacy will endure as one of the defining characteristic of Catholicism in the 21st century (finally acknowledging the dictates of Vatican II), or whether the church is instead destined to remain an imperial system. This empire is, however, a fragile one, and much different from the one found in previous centuries, including the 20th. The most urgent and important issues to be addressed concern the administration of a church consisting of more than a million adherents with an ever-shrinking body of clerics and members of religious orders, and the persecution of Christians in many countries in Africa and Asia. In a sense, these two challenges are returning the church to its ancient origins. 2025 will be the anniversary of the first council of the universal church, which was celebrated in Nicea in 325; it could also be an occasion for a new ecumenical council between Catholics and other Christian churches. What Pope Francis has dubbed the ""ecumenism of blood"" could lead Catholicism onto new, unforeseen paths.This post is part of a series commemorating The Huffington Post's 10 Year Anniversary through expert opinions looking forward to the next decade in their respective fields.

""He gave what President Lincoln called the last full measure of devotion to that cause.""Moore, who followed his father and uncle into the NYPD, was shot over the weekend in the New York City borough of Queens after a man fired into his unmarked car. The officer was a member of an elite plainclothes anti-crime unit.Two other New York City officers, Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos, were shot dead while in a patrol car in Brooklyn last December. The accused gunman, Ismaaiyl Brinsley, who later killed himself, had posted social media messages suggesting he wanted to kill police in revenge for deaths of black men by police.There were no indications that the suspect in Moore's shooting was similarly motivated.Police Commissioner William Bratton, who promoted Moore posthumously to the rank of detective 1st grade, referenced the politically charged climate in which police in the United States are working following the deaths of several black men during encounters with law enforcement officers.""Police officers across the country, they're increasingly bearing the brunt of loud criticism,"" the commissioner said. ""We cannot be defined by that criticism.""Absent from Moore's funeral was any open sign of disdain for de Blasio, in contrast to services in December and January for the other two officers, when many police turned their backs on the mayor they accused of failing to support them.When the solemn service ended, Moore's casket was carried by an honor guard past officers who stood at attention, as buglers played taps and nine helicopters flew overhead in a maneuver known as a ""missing man"" formation. Moore's weeping mother Irene and his father Raymond led mourners from the church.The man suspected of killing Moore, 35-year-old Demetrius Blackwell, was arrested soon after the shooting and is in custody. POLICE DEPARTMENTS CRITICIZEDPolice departments around the country are facing harsh criticism for the use of deadly force, specifically against black men.A series of incidents with law enforcement that led to the deaths of black men have caused public uproar, demonstrations around the country, and calls for reviews of police tactics and officers to wear body cameras on duty.Last week, six Baltimore officers were charged in the death of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man who died after injuries sustained while in police custody.On Friday, the U.S. Justice Department announced a federal civil rights investigation into the legality of the Baltimore police department's use of force and whether there are patterns of discriminatory policing. The Justice Department is already investigating Gray's death.Other incidents that have triggered intense public outrage included the deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in the New York City borough of Staten Island.

Most people also believe that a business shouldn't have the right to discriminate against customers for their religious and political beliefs. But what if you were faced with a situation where you had to choose?Right now in Dearborn, Mich. a local business owner is facing this very question. A group called ""Restrain The Judges"" placed a number of advertisements claiming ""Homosexuality is a behavior, not a civil right."" This ad just so happens to be a mile north of my home on a busy street. I'm not particularly happy about it. In the meantime, tens of thousands of people and their children are being forced to view it every day.However, when some local advocates got mad, rather than directing their ire at the group which placed the ad, many are directing their anger towards the owner of the ad space and, strangely, at the local chamber of commerce. So it's worth asking the question: does a business owner have the right to discriminate in regard to what ads they place?I talked to Tom Giesken, the owner of the Giesken Outdoor Advertising, the company who signed the advertising contract with Restrain The Judges. I was lucky to get a hold of him because he had to disconnect his land-line after getting so many angry phone calls. He was very forthright about his beliefs.""As a business person, I don't have the luxury of taking a political position. This is not that forum for me,"" said Giesken, regarding his own advertising space. ""This forum is about the first amendment and for everybody to have free speech... I believe that is what our founding fathers set up, so that we could work out our differences.""Unfortunately, the issue at question doesn't have a lot of middle ground. Not to mention, the advertisement goes against the overwhelming body of scientific research and evidence. Still, Giesken doesn't feel like he has the right to pick and choose.""I have a deep care for every single human being, that's at the core of who I am. If somebody put up something that was very hateful and directly attacking people, I wouldn't put it up,"" Giesken said. ""But if it's coming from a religious standpoint, where it's just their opinion, I feel like I don't have the right to say no to that.""A lot of advertisers are going to have to tackle these questions, now and into the future. Even though science has reached a consensus on matters of whether or not being a gay is a choice, the fact is that in many communities the public hasn't.That's why, in response to the controversy, the Dearborn Area Chamber of Commerce president Jackie Lovejoy said she's setting up a panel discussion with professors and advertising experts to explore the ethical issues at hand. ""Our job at the Dearborn Chamber of Commerce is to educate and inform,"" said Lovejoy. ""I have a lot of gay friends and this really breaks my heart that people see us as a part of this. I'm not the person with all the answers. However, I think the best thing we can do in the chamber is to foster discussion on the issue as to what is legal and ethical for advertising companies to do.""In the meantime, a local man named Ferman Smith has set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for an ad that counters the messages sent out by this group.   The silver lining in all of this? Giesken happily offered to host that ad, too. ""I'm happy to foster debate on both sides of the issue,"" he said. ""That's what freedom of speech is for."""

In his 2005 article in Quarterly Review of Biology, Mart R. Gross reports the following fascinating parental figures across a few animal classes:Mammals: 90% female-only; 10% biparental; 0% male-onlyBirds: 8% female-only; 90% biparental; 2% male-only Fish: 30% female-only; 20% biparental; 50% male-only (note that these figures apply to species that offer parental care, as most species do not)There are several evolutionary principles that explain innate sex differences across species. I shall briefly discuss two such theories of relevant to the unique nature of human motherhood. 1. Parental investment theory The brilliant evolutionary biologist Robert Trivers proposed back in 1972 that many sex differences across species could be explained as follows: in any given species, the sex that provides the greater minimal obligatory parental investment will be more careful in its mate choices, will be smaller, less aggressive, and will be the source of greater intra-sexual competition between the less investing sex. In the human context (as is true of many animals), women are the more investing sex. On average, women have 400 ova from menarche (onset of the menses) until menopause. A man's ejaculation on the other hand has on average 250,000,000 spermatozoa. Ova are scarce and hence must be carefully ""offered"" while spermatozoa are abundant and cheap. Additionally, while men's parental investment could be as minimal as a one-time sexual dalliance, women must endure the physiological costs of gestation (roughly 80,000 additional calories are needed) and lactation, the risks of childbearing mortality, and the increased dangers inherent to lesser mobility during the gestational period (a very real threat in our evolutionary history). The minimal obligatory parental investment is so titled toward women that it is not surprising that motherhood holds a very privileged position within the human experience.2. Paternity uncertainty Many sex differences are rooted in the asymmetry between maternal certainty (there is no such thing as maternal uncertainty) and paternal uncertainty (men did not evolve with DNA paternity tests at their disposal). On this point, see my earlier Psychology Today article titled Who's Your Daddy? Global Nonpaternity Rates). Countless sex differences are rooted in this very simple reality including sex differences in how men and women respond to various types of infidelity, sex differences in attitudes toward hospital paternity testing of newborns, the larger monetary gifts offered at weddings from the maternal side of brides and grooms, as well as ascriptions of resemblance of fetuses to their dads (see also my YouTube clip Do Fetuses Resemble Their Dads?).Hence, the unique role that mothers hold in people's lives is not rooted in arbitrary gender roles, as some social constructivists would have you believe. Rather, the mother-child relationship is sacrosanct because of these very real evolutionary principles. This in no way demystifies the mother-child bond rather it offers a scientific understanding of its distinct and privileged quality (albeit all is not always rosy when it comes to motherhood as per my earlier Psychology Today article Mothers Who Harm Their Kids to Garner Attention). Incidentally, readers might be interested to know that mothers are much more likely than fathers to correctly identify their infants' cries.Happy Mother's Day!Note: This article was also published on my Psychology Today blog on May 8, 2015."

The games are part entertainment, part brutal retribution. No young fan of the books or movies would miss the uncanny parallels between the treatment of Balitmore's poor (or of Inkster, Michigan) and the brutal jovial wanton violence against Panem's poor.In Baltimore because of new technology we everyone can finally see video of police officers brutally beating Freddie Gray, then the images go blank while they transport him to the station. We learn that the officers allegedly gave him a ""rough ride"" a slang terms that understates the ongoing tradition of police misconduct in which suspects, seated or lying face down and in handcuffs in the back of a police wagon are hurt and this case killed by an intentionally rough, bumpy and painful ride that can do as much damage as a police baton or pistol without an officer having to shoot or deal a blow. (Of course we also learn the officers made an unreported and clandestine stop on the way to the precinct -- we are yet to hear what they did to Gray during that time...).In Inkster another ""district"", the police officers can be seen apparently brutally beating Floyd Dent giving him a closed head injury, broken ribs, and a fractured orbital. And the video shows that while Dent bleeds profusely at the police station, police officers reportedly do not allow him to see a doctor for his injuries. Instead the officers pantomime in front of the bleeding man their beat down on him, congratulate each other for this beat down, fist bump each other, and laugh and carryon in apparent hilarity.These are the ""game"" traditions that are ongoing in American cities. We should hold the individual officers accountable -- and go much further to take on the police departments themselves that honor, harbor, and hail these traditions of officer thuggery. Like Panem, what we are seeing in these video are not just one off and isolated behavior by individual officers. We see a tradition of police thuggery in real time and life - not some imagine dystopian future. Our Panem districts are numerous, including Baltimore, Cleveland, Staten Island, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Ferguson, Vallejo, Inkster, North Charleston, Apple Valley, California and Madison Alabama.However, we have new ways to level the bench -- technological advancement means we have citizens with mobile phones videotaping police brutality -- and we have JusticeInvestor which crowd funds financing for victims so that can hire the best lawyers and pay costs to zealously prosecute against the police. Victims can resist being bullied to settled and plea bargain and don't have to rely on contingency lawyers for help- - they can now afford the best legal help that money can buy, supported by the online community who take a stake in the outcome. This is new philanthropy, impact investing and social enterprise. Police departments and police unions can no longer expect to outspend, outlast and outclass meritorious claims.We can choose -- work towards the utopia that our founding fathers imagined and level the bench as the newly formed JusticeInvestor.com is doing to help victims or continue the dystopia all around us by allowing the police unions and other apologists for police violence to continue their unequal power and never ending claim that ""police did nothing wrong"".

She introduces herself and puts an arm around a woman in a red sari.""This is my mother,"" Gali says and then looks at the bystanders. ""And my father, brother and sister.""I reach out my hand to introduce myself but she stops me. She's not talking about them; she's only looking for their permission to talk to a foreigner.

They're dead.""Bhaktapur, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and center of worship for Hindus and Buddhists was left in utter ruins following the quake on April 25 that destroyed religious temples and countless homes. Three hundred people are confirmed dead in the city of 100,000, a number that seems impossibly low considering the extent of the destruction. Crumbled houses with collapsed roofs are everywhere - like a photograph of the blitz in the Second World War. Most residents say they have given up hope on finding family alive and instead are only searching the rubble for precious family heirlooms.Nearby, local Red Cross volunteer Amir Kapal's small home is still standing, but a massive crack cuts the building in half from the ground to the third story roof rendering it uninhabitable. ""I don't know what we'll do,"" says Kapal, 37. ""We've been here for generations and we can't live here anymore. For now I'm just trying to make sure my neighbours have food and water. We're sleeping in a tent near the durbar (town square).""Uniformed rescue workers from China, Switzerland and Japan can be seen searching wreckage and Nepali engineering teams are going from house to house inspecting and recording the damage. Local tourists are also trying to organize themselves, but with mixed results. One group of young Korean backpackers were handing out water and surgical masks to a group of Nepali men.""We don't need them!"" yelled one man, already wearing a mask. ""Go find someone who needs them!""Groups of disaster tourists can also be seen searching the area for the best spot to get that epic selfie.Back on rubble mound, 16-year-old Mako Gali is smiling.

23,WORLDPOST,"From Soccer God To Steely-Eyed Pol, Romario Wins Brazilian Hearts",Talia Lavin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/romario-political-career_n_7216162.html,,2015-05-07,"FILE - In this Dec. 23, 2011 file photo, former soccer star Romario speaks at a news conference in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Brazilian congressman and former football great Romario has launched another attack against FIFA, calling president Sepp Blatter ""a thief"" and secretary general Jerome Valcke ""a blackmailer."" The comments came at a congressional hearing promoted by a tourism and sports commission on Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2013. (AP Photo/Victor R. Caivano, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c9a90f5240000f7054f50e6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of Brazil’s most dynamic political figures first rose to fame on the soccer field. Romário de Souza Faria -- commonly known just by his first name -- led Brazil to victory in the 1994 FIFA World Cup, earning himself both the FIFA World Player of the Year award and a cult following in the soccer-crazed country. But over the past few years, he has channeled his legendary status in his home country into a dynamic presence in the political arena. In 2014, he was elected senator for the State of Rio de Janeiro by a landslide, winning over 60 percent of the votes. The former footballer has succeeded in bringing Brazilians closer to the debates taking place in the halls of Congress, democratizing a political process that can seem arcane or complex to the masses.A father of six, Romário was inspired to become a politician by his youngest daughter, Ivy, who was born with Down syndrome. The former football hero was motivated to fight for the rights of people with rare diseases and disabilities. He was elected a federal congressman for the Socialist Party in 2010, and within his first months in office won passage for a legislative article that created special subsidies for the disabled. Throughout his terms in office, Romário has regularly campaigned for disability access. In 2013, he became the leading critical voice in the country, protesting Brazil’s choice to host the 2014 World Cup. He spoke out openly against the relationship between the government and FIFA, and argued that the money poured into preparation for the event was starving social programs of critical funds. Romário has leveraged social media to build and maintain a loyal political following. An active Facebook user, he regularly garners thousands of likes for his posts -- which focus on topics as diverse as the need for more widespread Brazilian sign language education to thoughts on his favorite movies. Romário, former football star, continues to charm his fans with his rough-edged, sincere and candid political persona.What is the greatest personal achievement you expect to have in the next 10 years?I have eight years in office ahead, and I am sure many challenges will arise during this period. As a public figure who holds a popular representation mandate, I cannot speak of personal challenges. I believe that each bill voted on in Congress is a challenge. Because the real intentions of a legislative text are not always clear. A vote can decide on reducing the age at which someone is considered an adult criminal in this country, for example. It sounds simple, but with every decision we make, we are changing the lives of millions of people.So the main challenge is to always make the right choices in the slippery and misty world of politics. Ten years from now, I want to look back and be sure that I did well for my country. Now, there are some specific issues that I consider to be personal achievements, but they are public issues. For example, achieving full integration of disabled people in society, and helping to improve health care for people with rare, chronic and serious illnesses in the public system.What was the greatest challenge you had to face last year?Certainly, the election for the Federal Senate.Who has been your inspiration, your role model, in adult life?My father and mother have always been the people who inspired me the most. My father died 10 years ago; my mother is still alive and well. They gave me the best examples of integrity and values. Ivy, my daughter who has Down syndrome, is a great inspiration, too. It was because of her that I got into politics.What do you think deserves better coverage in the press?I think political news coverage is very poor. They focus too much on gossip. Often, the legislative agenda of important projects for the country is set aside. Few journalists know how to cover the legislative work. I see some media vehicles giving a lot of space to controversial figures with absurd ideas, whereas good parliamentarians and good ideas have no place in newspapers.Which (living) person do you most admire?My mother. Pope Francisco, a very serious person, and a good human being who is above religion, a light person. Former Secretary General Kofi Annan, who, in my opinion, did a great job when he was head of the UN. It didn’t come as a surprise that he won a Nobel Peace Prize. The former president of Uruguay, [José ""Pepe""] Mujica, has given a good example of humbleness and honesty for all politicians.What advice would you give to a young man who is trying to decide what to do with his life?There are no limits to dreams.What are you most grateful for?For many things. For the health that Our Father in Heaven gave me. For sports, which have given me the opportunity to change my life and the lives of many people around me. And for the recognition of people for what I did and what I do.What is the problem or issue you are most interested in seeing resolved in the next 10 years?I think we're going through very bad economic times in our country, and hopefully we can get through it without going back on social, labor and social security rights. In the world as a whole, I hope extreme social inequality is eradicated and that we may have peacetime, without conflicts. I hope to see the problem of drug addiction solved, and the cure of various diseases that plague humanity. Finally, the climate...What's the first thing you do when you wake up in the morning?I open my eyes... (Laughs.) Lately, I've been saying thanks to God and asking Him for a good day.What do you do to unwind, relax, recharge your batteries?I play footvolley, football, I date, I hang out with my friends.What trends of today do you think we will think of with disbelief in 10 years’ time?Corruption.How many hours do you sleep per night? How important has sleeping been in your life?From 18 to 35, I slept very little. Now I sleep a lot, and very well. During the week, maybe about eight hours. But on weekends I get to sleep for 10 hours.What do you value the most?Friendship, gratitude and loyalty.This piece was originally published on HuffPost Brazil.

If we are to truly deal with racism in America impacting Latinos, we need to understand what is happening right now with Black America.",2015-05-07,2015-05-07-1430959920-820362-stepupforblacklives.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-07-1430959920-820362-stepupforblacklives-thumb.jpg,"Top photo: My son and I enjoying a day at King Park in South Los AngelesHow much unrest will our country experience before we substantively address the injustices acutely impacting Black people?For months, across the nation, tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets to demand police accountability, transparency and justice for the families that have fallen victims to state violence.I am Latino and I stand in support members of the Black community seeking justice for their children and families. It's time that we, as Latinos, boldly speak out in support of justice. If we are to truly deal with racism in America impacting Latinos, we need to understand what is happening right now with Black America.I know that as Latinos we have it in our hearts and minds to stand up for Black lives. We cringe when we see the nightly news demonize and treat Latino immigrants as sub-human, so I know we have the visceral reflex to reject the current narrative about Black people. And in fact, there are many Afro-Latinos in our community that experience both narratives first-hand.I write this as the National Guard occupies Baltimore, and during a moment when so many people feel anger, pain and desperation. So many want to feel a sense of justice for just one minute, and to be able to take a breath from the injustice they feel everyday.As a community leader in South Los Angeles, the anger and frustration that people are feeling comes as no surprise to me. While we have seen tremendous progress in South Los Angeles, I believe we are always just a few injustices away from reaching another boiling point like the Civil Unrest of 1992.Because of my deep connection to and love for South Los Angeles I feel a sense of responsibility to urge Latinos to show support for Black lives. In South Los Angeles we live next to each other. We send our kids to the same schools, eat at the same restaurants, and share the same buses. We share many of the same injustices.Our fate, and the future of our community, is inextricably linked. While we may come from different places and through different circumstances, our futures will color the very soul of our nation.This is also deeply personal. I worry about my son's future, as he is the son of a Latino father and Black mother. I fear for his future as we face the stark reality that the odds are stacked against him. Of Black men born in 2001, 1 in 3 have a chance of being incarcerated during their lifetime. The police are shooting and killing Black people in alarming numbers.There are too many lives being taken from our communities. Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Rekia Boyd, Ezell Ford, Tamir Rice, and Freddie Gray -- the names go on and on. How many more lives must be lost?Our nation was jolted by the images we saw when the people of Ferguson lost patience and their anger erupted into flames. After the slaying of Eric Garner tens of thousands of New Yorkers burst into protest.This week, thousands of people took to the streets of Baltimore to protest the killing of the unarmed Freddie Gray -- and a police department with a well-documented history of cruelty and unfairness toward Black people. Decades of injustice led to more civil unrest.At this moment, I urge all Latinos to explore why state violence and poverty starkly impact the Black community. The unique characteristics of violence towards Black people in Baltimore, Ferguson, New York and other places across the nation are tied to a long history of oppression targeting them going back to slavery, lynchings and to today's police shootings. Image via Latino RebelsIn the midst of uncertainty for what the future holds, I feel hopeful because real change happens in moments like these. I am hopeful because of the movement for justice that has been ignited, and the pathway being laid before us. So much of it is not making the nightly news, but thanks to the advent of social media we know it is growing.My experience in South Los Angeles gives me hope as it has shown me that Blacks and Latinos will stand by each other in the face of adversity, and create lasting change. It gives me hope for my son because I know that Blacks and Latinos will protect and support him to grow up and fulfill his limitless potential.Many of us in the Latino community are watching, but I urge us to step forward and help to forge a new path for America. Stand up for my son, who is your son as well. Stand up for justice for all, and not just our own.I challenge Latinos to broaden our vision of citizenship not only for immigrants, but also for the 40 million Black people who reside in the United States that have long been denied the promises of the American Dream.If we step up for Black lives, we step up for our own lives."

It seems everyone is preoccupied with the challenges of succeeding, and no one is paying attention to the needs and challenges of those who've successfully sold their business.Of the 500,000 startups launched annually, less than half make it past their first year, and only about 5% or 25,000 exit successfully. These are challenging odds and you might assume that anyone who has beat them would be elated; but the assumption is only partially correct, at least according to the network of founders I know and work with. In addition to the up-side, there's a down-side in which these extraordinary individuals also report feelings of loss, bewilderment and even confusion when it comes to what's next in their lives.One might think, ""Have they lost their minds?""  There's no doubt they've lost something, but it's not their mind. What many founders face after selling their business is a loss of identity, meaning and purpose, three very important factors associated with owning and operating a successful enterprise. When a founder exits their business they also exit all the relationships, experiences, engagements and challenges connected with it. All these things are essential contributors to one's identity and sense of personal value. I call this condition the ""Founder's Dilemma"" and it was Abraham Maslow who first addressed it in his 1943 paper, ""The Theory of Human Motivation,"" or what is better known as ""Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.""Organized like a pyramid, Maslow depicted our human needs in five hierarchical states. Each of the five plays an important role in our happiness and sense of well-being, and without all five being fulfilled, Maslow asserted that we simply will not be happy, regardless of what we achieve or how much we accomplish in our lives.At the base of Maslow's pyramid are our Physiological needs, our basic survival instincts and vital necessities such as air, water, food and shelter. The next state is our Safety needs which include personal and financial security, physical health and well-being and protection against adverse impacts. Third is Belonging, our experience of love, inclusion, friendship, intimacy and family. The fourth state is our Esteem needs of being accepted by others, feeling respected and respecting ourselves. And fifth, at the top of the pyramid is the state of Self-Actualization, our need to attain our full potential and be the very best and most we can be in our lives. Maslow believed that in order to graduate up through the five states to Self-Actualization, we must not only achieve all the previous states in the pyramid, we must actually master them. This distinction between achievement and mastery must not be overlooked as it may well be the source of why successfully exited founders tend to experience loss and bewilderment along with elation and accomplishment. This mastery, or ""self-mastery"" as I call it has to do with two things. First, it includes the realization that what we achieve or acquire in our lives is not the sole source of our fulfillment, but that there is another crucial factor having to do with challenging ourselves to grow, making a contribution to others and positively influencing the world. Another way of understanding this point is that it is only when we've gotten enough of what we don't really want that we realize our happiness does not depend on what we have, but on the degree of authentic conviction we invest in the process.The second aspect of self-mastery has to do with a Sixth need which Maslow, in his later years acknowledged was missing from his model. He called it Self-Transcendence and it pertains to surrendering over the significance of our personal identity to a greater self or higher power; a spiritual presence that isn't dependent upon our ego self, but rather is based on a greatness of character dwelling within us. This greatness of character is about recognizing that who we are exists beyond the confines of our personal identity and that the ""I"" we know actually exists as an interconnected sharing with others, with the whole of humanity, and with the majesty of Nature and Life itself.So what's the bottom-line of this top-heavy conversation? I believe the Founder's Dilemma has to do with graduating to a high state of material accomplishment without attaining a comparable high state of self-mastery accomplishment. So why is this practice of self-mastery so important? Because if a founder misidentifies who they are with what they have, when they sell what they have, they also sell who they are. The upshot of this unfortunate symbiotic transaction is that we end up with a surplus of cash and a deficit of self.  Those who find validity in the Founder's Dilemma as well as see the relevance of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs are optimally positioned to engage in the work of self-mastery. But where does one begin? Right at the apex of the pyramid with Self-Transcendence. By being willing to redefine ourselves, seek out our deeper greatness of character and share the journey of what's next in our lives with other like-minded professionals, we actually move from Exiting to Entering, and along with this entrance comes all the relationships, experiences, meaning and purpose one aspires to most, but with one important difference. Rather than our identity hinging upon what we have, it is solidly based on the greatness of who we are.

And that difference my founding friends is something to be genuinely elated about. ~ Val Jon Farris is a senior mentor for Richard Branson's XTC competitors and CEO of Diamius Multinational, a Fortune 100 consulting firm specializing in working with successful business leaders and founders."

Many of these folks are diligent about what they eat when they are home on their own turf, but find it hard to navigate the endless buffets and open bars at various events. Are you in the same boat? Do you struggle with what to eat at these events? Do you find it hard to make healthy choices? I'm here to help! Below are 10 things you can do to help ensure that your next social engagement does not leave you with a huge hangover or a food coma. Hope they help! 1. The first tip is to make sure that you don't go to these functions starving. It's OK to be hungry because you know that you are going to eat something when you arrive, but you don't want to be so ravenous that you just start eating everything in sight. When we are hungry we tend to make poor food choices (it's the same reason why I tell people not to go to the grocery store hungry). Eat a snack before you go. An apple is a great snack because it's portable and has lots of fiber to help fill you up.2. Take a loop around the food before you grab anything. You want to know all the options available before you start to fill your plate. As you look over the offerings, take note of everything that's available and start to decide what you'll eat and how much. The worst spot to be in is the one where you see something you really want, only to look down and realize that your plate is already full.3. Stick to ""special"" foods that you wouldn't normally eat if you were home. Don't waste calories on fattening dips, potato chips, french fries or pigs in a blanket that you can get anytime. Spend your calories on the good stuff like scallops wrapped in bacon or special crepes.4. Promise yourself you'll eat at least one or two vegetables. If your spread includes crudités, make sure you have some of those. Get your fill of carrots and celery, etc., and if you can, try to have a small plate of these items before you eat anything else.5. Be strategic about alcohol. Try to avoid anything that is mixed with soda (lots of empty calories) and be mindful of how much you are drinking. Stick to wine or spritzers and if you have a cocktail, go for one that is mixed with club soda or tonic water. If you have a juice-based drink, ask the bartender to put a spritz of seltzer in with it. 6. Drink a glass of water before you go to the event, upon arrival, and in between each alcoholic beverage. This will help keep you hydrated.7. Try to focus on the event and not the food. Spend time networking, talking to people, enjoying the music, the company, the ambiance, etc. 8. Position yourself away from the food. Standing next to the food or the bar makes it easy to graze throughout the event and/or keep getting yourself a drink. 9. Try to opt for a fruit-based dessert when possible. If the event has small desserts, promise yourself to only have one to three pieces. Make your pick, enjoy every bite, and then don't go back for seconds. If you still feel like you want something else, have a cup of coffee or tea and ""nurse"" it for the rest of the evening. And again, pick your dessert and move away from the dessert table. 10. Eat enough food at the event to satisfy your hunger so you won't go home and eat more food. If the event is in the evening, you'll want to eat enough so that you won't be hungry when you get home. While you don't want to go crazy at the event, you also don't want to go home hungry and eat dinner at 9 or 10 o'clock at night. There you have it; 10 tips to help you navigate those social events. While you certainly want to enjoy the food and drink, you don't want to derail all your healthy eating at one event. And, if you're someone that goes to a lot of these types of functions, you don't want to start creating bad habits for yourself. So at your next function, indulge (a little) and enjoy (a lot)."
29,POLITICS,How Barack Obama Led Us Into The Selfie Century,Howard Fineman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-social-media_n_7215298.html,,2015-05-07,"President Barack Obama greets people in the audience after speaking during a Cinco de Mayo reception in the East Room of the White House in Washington, Tuesday, May 5, 2015. Obama says that when it comes to achieving a comprehensive overhaul of immigration laws progress is 'not always a straight line.' He says that despite his executive actions on immigration, Congress still needs to pass legislation to make more permanent changes. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f5aa220000bb01dd8524.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- A new era in American politics was only faintly visible when The Huffington Post debuted on May 9, 2005. The changing time manifested itself in two ways. One was the incandescent smile of a freshman senator from Illinois named Barack Obama. The other was an emerging wave of social media -- Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and, yes, HuffPost.Ten years later we're living in the Selfie Century, in which individuals and tribes (some ancient, others assembled virally overnight) contend with traditional institutions (such as nation states, governments, political parties and corporations) for control of public life. The next 10 years will be suffused with that tension.Other conflicts will also shape the decade ahead: the ever-growing gulf between the richest and the rest; the costly chaos of climate change; the possibilities and pain of creating a truly multiracial, multiethnic society; the threats of belligerent nationalism (China and Russia) and bloodthirsty theocracy (the militant mullahs in Iran, a “state” that falsely claims the banner of Islam). But winning these other battles will require social and digital media to educate and empower people of good will in the United States and around the globe. How do we reach so many individuals without losing the privacy that makes free thinking possible? How do we push governments and corporations to focus on people, not merely the amassing of money and metadata? How do we disrupt unresponsive leadership and yet still govern ourselves?Obama did not necessarily set out to start this conversation. In 2004, Howard Dean had been the first presidential candidate to really use the Internet as a medium-is-message organizing tool. But Obama took it from there. I interviewed Obama several times back then and since. The power of his personality, intellect, energy, biography (biracial, reared by a single mom, international experience) and ease with people he doesn’t know -- all were impressive, marketable and instantly, if somewhat distantly, charming. Anyone who saw the young senator in the corridors of the Capitol in the spring of 2005 knew -- and knew that he knew -- he was going places.It wasn’t clear when. The Republicans were large and in charge, or so it seemed. President George W. Bush had just won a second term, though barely. The GOP controlled both houses of Congress and was rising in the states. Bush’s war in Iraq (which Obama had utterly opposed) was grinding on, and yet an exuberant economy (irrationally exuberant, in former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan's words) allowed Bush to cut taxes and support some generous new programs, such as added drug benefits for seniors.But that same year saw the Bush unraveling. The reason was Hurricane Katrina. It produced pictures of an unconnected and seemingly callous president gazing down at a devastated New Orleans from an aircraft. That, plus his lack of granular knowledge of his aides’ actions, crippled him politically. America wanted a connected president.So it’s no accident that Obama and social media rose together. They were made for each other. However cool he could be in private -- and the air around him can get frigid -- he and his presidential campaign amassed 20 million “friends” on Facebook. He was the sunny side of a new day to his supporters, while his intimate omnipresence provoked deep fear among foes, who saw him as some kind of Orwellian force. He dug even deeper digitally in 2012, mining mega data to target a get-out-the-vote drive with far greater pinpoint accuracy than ever before.The conventional wisdom about the Obama decade is that he was a better candidate than he has been a president. But that may be wrong. Though income inequality has grown on his watch, the United States (and the world) avoided economic catastrophe in 2008 and 2009, and the U.S. economy overall is reasonably strong again. The president had a lot to do with that.He pushed through an expansion of health care, taking the risk despite an utterly rejectionist GOP. The launch of Obamacare was an unholy administrative mess. But it has become more useful and popular, and Republican candidates won't have much of a target in 2016 -- if they even try to shoot at it.Obama promised to end the war in Iraq and did so, even if Islamic State militants have filled the void in some parts of that country. He wound down the war in Afghanistan, too -- a war he said was necessary to fight. While the results in that region are mixed at best, U.S. political strife over the conflicts has died down. GOP presidential candidates decry Obama’s alleged foreign policy weakness, yet there is little talk in Republican ranks of pouring troops back in.There have been glaring failures in the Obama years. His robust use of drones abroad and digital surveillance at home has been unnerving to supporters, who thought his background as a constitutional lawyer would make him more cautious. Only recently, and well after being safely re-elected, has he highlighted the ruinous poverty and neglect of African-American communities in beleaguered cities, where local cops and citizens struggle to find peace.Once he promised the nation renewed civility, bipartisanship and unity. But he could never overcome or outmaneuver GOP petulance. Their stance shocked and annoyed him, and after a while, he stopped bothering to try. The result: a further decline in trust of leaders and government.Ironically, the dangerous toxicity in public debate that Obama hoped to calm thrives on the same social media that boosted him. Social media can enable tribalism or worse. Even as it shines a light on public and private misconduct, it can aid those who would respond violently or give tyrants the power to suffocate dissent through constant surveillance.If social media is to live up to its promise, we have to figure out how to use it to do more than win an election or stage a protest or make a point or sell a product or promote ourselves. We have to use it to help heal the country, find answers to pressing problems and nurture a global community that is suddenly aware of its own existence.In other words, the next decade is about using social media for the benefit of society. Let’s hope it works."

But it is high time for Europe to grow up, and as everybody knows, there's no better way to force someone to grow than to inflict a little suffering on them.",2015-05-07,"US and EU flags are pictured on November 11,2013 at the EU Headquarters. Europeans and Americans restart their discussions today to establish a comprehensive free trade agreement, a process that was interrupted by the financial crisis in the United States but also undermined by the scandal of U.S. spying. AFP PHOTO GEORGES GOBET (Photo credit should read GEORGES GOBET/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14bc7240000500024fce0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale," Dear HuffPosters, Ten years from now will we still be siblings, cousins, part of a family that is separated, but still stands solidly together on both sides of the Atlantic? Or will the great globalization blender have chewed up the shape the West has held for the past three centuries? In other words, will we Europeans and you Americans still be as close in 10 years as we are today? Robert Kagan asked this question a few years back in his book Of Paradise and Power: America and Europe in the New World Order, in which he lent a deeply romantic spin to geopolitics -- describing the USA as ""from Mars"" and Europe as ""from Venus."" Kagan claimed that the perspectives of the two continents are growing further apart. Taking stock of the world today, it seems clear that Kagan's perspective has some merit. The two sides of the Atlantic have grown further apart, but this divergence is not necessarily a bad thing. Today, we're separated by the same two elements that brought us together during the postwar period: technology and the cycle of great economic crises. For a long time, the European continent appeared to lag behind the US in Internet use, in terms of the percentage of the population with Internet access and familiarity with the Internet. But today it has become clear that Europe also lags behind the US in the evolution of its production system. During the decisive years of Internet development in America, industrial innovation continued to advance apace in Europe, although at different speeds in different European countries. The gap between the two sides of the ocean has yet to be bridged today. Only now are people realizing that the distance isn't so much about use, but about the ownership of these technologies: today the Internet and its most important companies are still entirely American -- and thus the new horizons for the future of the Internet, and their profits, are entirely American as well. Europe has let things develop, trusting the US -- as it has since the end of the last century -- to invent and populate new frontiers. Today Europe is waking up to take stock of the results of this approach, and finally seeing that things don't add up. The European continent has discovered it's neither well-equipped nor independent to be a full part of a world driven and shaped by digital innovation. Ironically, the first reaction -- provided by the government in Brussels -- has been to ""tax"" the Web's biggest companies, imposing stricter regulations and tariffs against Internet giants like Google. Overall, the reaction to the ""American invasion"" of the Internet is ironically reminiscent to a 21st-century Boston Tea Party: apparently taxation is still at the center of the cultural divide between Europe and the US. There's a paradox at play here: the United States's reckless financial sector was the driving force behind the global financial crisis, and over the past years the U.S. has been embroiled in a series of complex conflicts abroad -- yet the American government has been able to mitigate the impact of these decisions. Meanwhile, a reluctant and indecisive Europe has found itself stuck on the front lines, deep in the heart of the grand turmoil that has characterized these years: terrorism and Middle Eastern refugees; migrants from Africa dying on the Mediterranean; the remnants of simmering Cold War conflict within a still-troubled Eastern Europe. The continent also has to grapple with the effects of global economic instability, financial speculation, the relentless expansion of the Chinese economy as well as those of the major foreign funds. The cumulative effect of these fiscal stresses has driven Europe's currency to the verge of collapse, and left its managerial class increasingly unable to meet modern challenges. So what is Europe to do? Save Greece? Welcome wave after wave of refugees? Send soldiers to fight terrorism? Work towards a solution in Libya? Fight Putin? Devalue the Euro? Combat the brain drain of the Euroskeptic? European governments -- including strong ones like Germany's -- appear surprised, unprepared to face what's required of them. Rather than compensating for a lack of preparation within the governments of its member states, the European central government, in the moment of its greatest formal unity, has withdrawn into a bureaucratic management style that its citizens openly detest. And yet... Precisely within this risk of major collapse lie signs of a new path. For many years, Europe has delegated its involvement in the world to the United States, preferring to play the role of a supporter that maintains fundamental values.This division of roles has worked up until today, but in recent years the US has evinced other priorities, just as Europe is returning to the front lines, and can no longer sit wars out. For all of us over here in Europe, this seems like our weakest, loneliest moment. But it is high time for Europe to grow up, and as everybody knows, there's no better way to force someone to grow than to inflict a little suffering on them. I imagine that in 10 years, you over there in HuffPost in the US and we over here in HuffPost in Europe will seem a little less alike than we do today. But we're counting on the fact that opposites attract.This post was originally published on HuffPost Italy and was translated into English.This post is part of a series commemorating The Huffington Post's 10 Year Anniversary through expert opinions looking forward to the next decade in their respective fields.

I did not miss my old life, or my old stuff. You may find it difficult to imagine downsizing as I did. But there are many positives to downsizing. Perhaps topping the list are savings in money and time. Imagine no longer owning a car: No monthly payments. No insurance, gasoline, oil changes, routine maintenance, new tires, or washes and waxes. No sitting for hours at the dealership after receiving a recall notice. Today I let the taxi or bus driver deal with the traffic while I read, chat, doze, or simply let my mind wander. I never hunt for a place to park, or worry if my car will be safe where I left it. Parking and speeding tickets are a distant memory. I no longer own a home. No mortgage, insurance, homeowner's association dues, or property taxes. I will never cut another lawn, trim another hedge, or clean another gutter (except when I visit my mother). I don't worry about storms, floods, or hurricanes anymore. Instead, each month I pay my rent, which includes the utilities. Done. And if I decide to relocate for any reason (which from time to time I do), it's a simple matter to pack up the suitcases and go. Can you even imagine such a life? No? Then try this exercise... considering just your vehicles and your home, jot down how much money you spend on them. Don't forget to add the periodic expenses. Now do the same for the time you devote to each. You'll find the lists lengthen as you keep thinking of additional items. Imagine that instead you had one, smaller payment each month for rent, and a budgeted amount for buses and taxis. Now ask yourself: What would you do with the additional money, and the additional time? If you are like me, and most expats I know, you'd devote a greater percentage of your budget to yourself. You'd devote more time to socializing and pursuing hobbies. You could learn the local language, dive into the local music scene, rediscover the joys of slow food, play volleyball or practice yoga... Likely you'd find more of your day spent in simple conversation. Just sharing a table and a beer with expats from other backgrounds can be enjoyable--and educational. There are a lot of interesting folks scattered about. Other benefits of downsizing ensue. With fewer obligations, you may find greater peace of mind. With time to exercise, to eat slowly and well, and simply to relax, you may see your physical and mental health improve.

Freeing yourself from material possessions can also free you from the responsibility -- financial or other -- inherent in them, sparing more time and money to be spent on you and you alone.

He is also senior investigator at the National Library of Medicine and National Institutes of Health.Koonin specializes in comparative genetics. Among his research interests are the origin and evolution of viruses, horizontal gene transfer, and the general principles of evolution. He is the author of The Logic of Chance: The Nature and Origin of Biological Evolution (FT Press); and author or co-author of 600 scientific papers. Highlights of our recent conversation about evolution paradigm shift and his above interests follow.Suzan Mazur: What are the dangers to human health and life on the planet if the power structure continues to refuse to recognize that an evolution paradigm shift has been happening or has happened?Eugene Koonin: I would speak more about regrettably missed opportunities and investments in not so fruitful directions rather than danger... [S]erious medicine, mainstream medicine these days indeed, I think, over-appreciates the directness of the link between the genome and phenotypes and under-appreciates the emergent properties of the phenotype. Suzan Mazur: Do you view origin of life as a separate event from evolution?Eugene Koonin: [I]f we assume that the origin of life depended on the emergence of the replication of information, that's some sort of beginning. Suzan Mazur: You've said you think faint signals remain in tracing early ancestry. Carl Woese told me that these things are simply being inferred, that there's no way to know...Eugene Koonin: Indeed, if you want to be rigorous in a way, there is nothing we can know about the past. Everything we're saying about the past is inference -- yet, inference is not a derogatory term. We are very confident about much of this inference. Suzan Mazur: I'd like to touch on lateral transfer of information in microbial evolution and the growing interest in the influence of microbial evolution in human and animal evolution...Eugene Koonin: Yes, of course, microbiota is found not only in humans but in all multicellular organisms, which only exist as symbiotic communities with the microbiota, their respective microbiomes. By the way, the microbiomes themselves to some extent are transmitted vertically, but only to some extent...Suzan Mazur: Do you see viruses as alive? For instance, the way they insert themselves into animal cells. This sounds like an active process. That they're trying to sustain themselves by entering the cell.Eugene Koonin: By every account, viruses are organisms. They are active agents. They have their own evolution.Suzan Mazur: But all of these things we've been discussing have been pretty much left out of the Modern Synthesis.Eugene Koonin: This is a good point to make. The entire evolution of the microbial world and the virus world, and the interaction between microbes and viruses and other life forms have been left out of the Modern Synthesis...  So indeed, the new understanding of evolution needs to integrate what we now know about viruses and virus-host interactions which, from my own perspective, has been absolutely one of the key factors of all evolution since the emergence of cells -- well, actually even before the emergence of cells.

I was born in northern Uganda to the Acholi tribe on December 8, 1969, the third child in a family that included one father, three wives and twenty siblings. When I was 16, en route to school, a rebel army abducted me and, to make a dark story short, forced me to do terrible things against my will, and very much against my nature. I was lucky to escape with my life.With northern Uganda in chaos, my family was not to be found. I made my way to the capital city Kampala, where an uncle I had never met was said to live. I found him living with two wives and four children in a two-room house in the slum known as Nguru. They found room for me, and offered a mat on the floor and I began to earn money to resume my education.Culture is an important part of human development. Our values are embedded in our culture. So it's no wonder I found solace and healing through art. I practiced and studied the arts in high school, then college, ultimately earning a degree in performing arts. This started a career that has allowed me to see the world. Whenever I feel a darkness creep into my soul, I sing, dance and play music on the adungu, a traditional hand-held harp of northern Uganda. It always works, the darkness recedes. Art is my detox.Ten years after my own bitter experience, just as my career started to take off, my younger brother Godfrey, a special person to me, was abducted and killed by Joseph Kony's infamous Lord's Resistance Army. He lived for some time in that evil army, the one known worldwide from ""Kony 2012."" My first response to Godfrey's abduction was to start Hope North, a safe haven and school for young victims of Uganda's civil war--a place where they can rebuild their lives and heal, as I healed, through education and creativity. This creativity is part of the core curriculum at Hope North, an accredited secondary. Arts education preserves our Acholi culture. Culture is an important part of human development. It is as important as food, water, shelter and academics--it cannot be ignored. Our values are embedded in our culture.Kony and the warlords that preceded him decimated traditional Acholi ways; his stated purpose was to ""cleanse the Acholi people."" For two decades culture was stalled, lost, forgotten. When the Ugandan government responded to the civil war by moving tens of thousands of us into Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps, it was the nail in the coffin. To make one more dark story short, the camps were not a nice place to be. Our culture is very much based in place, each year we celebrate our birthdays at the place where we have buried our umbilical cord. When we were forcibly moved from our homes, this hurt our souls. So, my life's mission as a performing artist has been to rejuvenate our culture, with Hope North, and most recently with my dance company Mizizi Ensemble.As it turns out, I also needed to remember and honor Godfrey in more ways, and thus have created a play with songs, Forged in Fire. (Runs through May 15, in New York.) Theater might be unique form of memory and love, but Godfrey was and is part of me, part of my identity and my existence. To find that I can still communicate through him, and to him in this play, has been important to me. I could have chosen to write a song, or an essay, I suppose. But theatre has a broad reach and endless life. The basic elements of theatre are universal: poetry, motion, emotion, visual arts and music. Anyone can relate to these things, even if you are blind or deaf, you will appreciate theatre. Theatre enhances life; it makes me feel more alive, as a performer and spectator.  Forged in Fire is essentially a modern play, but one rooted in traditional Ugandan and Acholi storytelling and musical traditions. The play shows my culture intersecting with persistent war and violence. Most of the stories referenced above are told in more detail in the play, leavened with music, dance and humor.So I am using that instinct for novelty to share a surprising story. I suppose I am also tweaking our instincts to consume the horrors of the world, to seek out the dark stories. There is a character in the play who is a tour guide, taking gaping tourists way beyond sight-seeing and into the heart of the war zone. To me, that character is asking the audience to step beyond looking, to act when they see something terrible happening, especially to children. Theatre allows others to relate to each other and to stories that are far from their own experience. If others can relate to this story, maybe they will begin to dream about peace on Earth, a planet where no child suffers unnecessarily from a war for greed or a mania for power.

36,POLITICS,Reading Charlie Hebdo in Context,"Mugambi Jouet, ContributorStanford Law School",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/reading-charlie-hebdo-in-_b_7220094.html,"Whether one enjoys Charlie Hebdo's cartoons or finds them offensive, George Orwell's words seem to capture the heart of the matter: ""If liberty means anything at all it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.""",2015-05-07,"Flowers are laid near the headquarters of magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris, Friday Feb. 6, 2015. Brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi killed 12 people in a terror attack at the offices of French satirical publication Charlie Hebdo on Jan. 7. The two gunmen, were killed by French police two days later. (AP Photo/Remy de la Mauviniere)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f5c23c000020010e028d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Charlie Hebdo's members received a controversial standing ovation upon accepting the Freedom of Expression Courage Award at the PEN American Center's gala this week. Jihadists had tragically massacred several cartoonists of the French satirical newspaper earlier this year. A struggling publication with a limited readership, Charlie Hebdo has received extensive attention lately due to its willingness to publish caricatures of the prophet Muhammad that some people find brave and others offensive. As a group of prominent writers mounted a protest against the PEN award, another shooting occurred at a Texas cartoon contest focused on Muhammad that featured a keynote speech by Geert Wilders - a far-right Dutch politician known for his outspoken anti-immigration and anti-Muslim agenda. So far the debate over Charlie Hebdo has mainly focused on the line between lampooning religion and promoting Islamophobia. ""I am Charlie,"" the popular slogan that emerged after the Paris terrorist attacks, is turning into ""I support freedom of speech but..."" The newspaper's critics argue that it capitalizes on bigotry in a French society where discrimination against Muslims is deeply ingrained. Its defenders respond that it has not only blasted Islam but also multiple other targets for decades, including Christianity and racist politicians like Jean-Marie and Marine Le Pen. Indeed, a statistical study indicates that only a small minority of its headlines have focused on Islam. There is nonetheless some truth to both perspectives on Charlie Hebdo. A cartoonist may be an equal opportunity satirist yet a nativist reader may especially enjoy caricatures ridiculing Muslims at a time when far-right movements are growing in Europe and America.However, another aspect of the issue has essentially been overlooked: it is less politically correct to criticize religion in America than in France, whether satirically or constructively. This helps explain why caricatures of Muhammad are arguably more likely to be perceived as discrimination or even ""hate speech"" in America. While organized religion often inspires indifference, skepticism or suspicion in France nowadays, America remains among the most religious countries in the industrialized world. If Americans are less wary of organized religion than the French and the majority of their fellow Europeans, it is partly because the greater separation of church and state since the United States' founding has spared Americans the history of religious oppression that Europeans once endured.In pre-modern Europe, the clergy was frequently considered a corrupt ally of authoritarian monarchs who claimed to be divinely chosen. The union of church and state additionally signified that challenging one's government could imply challenging the authority of intertwined religious institutions.Conversely, the relative absence of coercive state-established religion when the United States were founded meant that Americans who opposed their government did not necessarily become critical of organized religion. Faith was therefore able to thrive in an independent sphere where it was quite shielded from scrutiny, as the French traveler Alexis de Tocqueville observed in his epic journey throughout America in the 1830s. ""In France,"" Tocqueville wrote, ""I had almost always seen the spirit of religion and the spirit of freedom pursuing courses diametrically opposed to each other; but in America I found that they were intimately united, and that they reigned in common over the same country.""Of course, religious conflict has not been entirely absent from American history. Various religious groups have faced hostility in different epochs, as illustrated by nativist riots against Catholic immigrants in the mid-nineteenth century, not to mention lingering animosity towards Jews, Muslims, Hindus, and other groups. Moreover, modern-day liberal and conservative Americans are highly divided by diverging conceptions of faith reflected in polarization over issues like the theory of evolution, abortion, and gay rights. Nevertheless, America as a whole is particularly drawn to organized religion, from progressive churches to fundamentalist ones, compared to other Western countries on the path to a post-religious age.To countless French citizens, Christianity, Islam, and other religions are man-made institutions serving as means of political, social or gender control. Americans are more inclined to regard religions as mere matters of worship or self-help due to a broad range of historical, legal, and cultural reasons. As a result, the average American is more disposed to see religion with a presumption of goodness and equate criticism of religion with intolerance, thereby leading to greater uneasiness towards caricatures satirizing the prophet Muhammad.Freedom of religion is obviously a fundamental human right, although it does not only encompass freedom of worship but also the rights to criticize, analyze, and debate faith. These rights are largely the fruit of Enlightenment ideas that arose in response to theocratic governments that repressed both religious minorities and those who doubted religion. French philosophers like Denis Diderot once faced censure and detention for suggesting that Christianity is irrational, dehumanizing, and repressive.Social circumstances are relevant to understanding why criticizing religious beliefs is more acceptable in some countries than others. In the end, whether one enjoys Charlie Hebdo's cartoons or finds them offensive, George Orwell's words seem to capture the heart of the matter: ""If liberty means anything at all it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.""
