Gen. William C. Mayville Jr. speaks about the Syrian bombing campaign September 23, 2014 in Washington, DC. Mayville talked about the U.S. and Arab air strikes in Syria against the jihadist group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS).

The attacks -- and public support for the use of military force in the Middle East -- represent a remarkable turnaround in U.S. public opinion. And while the threat posed by the Islamic State to U.S. interests has been made all too clear, the shift in public opinion and its influence on the political debate in Washington over the use of military force raises important questions about the America's capacity to effectively wage the ongoing global war on terrorism, conducting foreign policy in a deeply divided political environment, and the inherent challenges of counterterrorism in democratic societies.  Just over a year ago, the Obama administration publicly threatened airstrikes against the Syrian regime after reports of the use of chemical weapons against civilians in rebel-controlled areas. Polling consistently showed that Americans opposed intervention to stop the war by almost two to one, and significant majorities persisted in opposing air or cruise missile strikes even if Assad had been proven to use the weapons or if he didn't follow through on plans to surrender his chemical weapon stockpiles. Despite concerns articulated by regional experts and more interventionist-leaning officials that the ongoing conflict could destabilize the larger region and empower radical jihadist elements, few American supported a more active policy, never mind military intervention. Similarly, as Iraq descended into greater sectarian violence, there was scant public support for U.S. military measures to address the situation. Generally viewing the initial invasion of Iraq in 2003 to remove Saddam Hussein from power as a costly mistake, the American public showed little enthusiasm for potentially repeating it by reentering an ""Iraqi"" conflict. Even after the dramatic fall of Mosul to Islamic State forces, 54 percent of American opposed air strikes against the group. Only after the release of videos capturing the barbaric murders of two American journalists James Foley on August 20 and Steven Sotloff on September 9, did American public opinion shift significantly. A Pew Poll showed a near-reversal of public opinion with 53 percent of American favoring air strikes with only 29 percent opposed. Nearly two-thirds of American view U.S. military action against the Islamic States as ""in American's national interest."" Almost 80 percent of Americans polled were ""very"" or ""somewhat"" concerned about the threat of ISIS to the United States. Perhaps, most interestingly Americans now seems more concerned that the Obama administration will not do ""enough"" to address the ISIS threat through military means, as opposed to doing ""too much.""   It is perhaps unsurprising that the beheading of two American journalists would shift public opinion in the United States so dramatically. But while the gruesome executions of American citizens are indeed attacks on the United States, they were also purposefully designed and orchestrated to achieve an expected collective reaction. It has long been a part of the terrorist's strategy to engage in highly symbolic violence, cynically and callous using the victim to send a message and provoke a response that will further his own agenda. In this case, the killing of two American journalists and a British aid worker seems directed at pulling the United States and England into a larger conflict, perhaps to get Washington and London to overreact and utilize some indiscriminate use of force (a wider bombing campaign that would create civilian casualties in Sunni areas) to galvanize support for the Islamic State among Sunni communities. Perhaps the Islamic State leadership seeks to spark the return of U.S. grounds troops to the region to widen the conflict and increase U.S. casualties. As Osama bin-Laden learned after the September 11 attacks, this can be a dangerous (and ultimately self-defeating) strategy, but clearly the Islamic State leadership is confident that it can survive a resumption of U.S. military action in the region.  The emergence of ISIS as a large, well-organized force that employs particularly brutal tactics and is committed to achieving the same kind of maximalist goals as its predecessor-turned-competitor al Qaeda has effectively reenergized the global war on terror. Considering the numbers of Europeans and Americans that are believed to have entered the Syrian conflict and may now have joined ISIS, the threat of ""home grown"" terrorism should demand greater emphasis. With significant financial resources, manpower, some measure of territorial control, organizational discipline, and strong leadership and direction, ISIS seems to already be a terrorist organization with ""global reach.""  At the same time, ISIS may have real vulnerabilities. Its brutality may soon prove too great for its new subject populations. Its opportunistic liquidation of rivals -- whether fellow radical Islamists or otherwise -- is likely to create a long list of enemies waiting for a chance to strike back. Its consolidation of territory and conventional military successes will necessarily make it more open to conventional attack, and provide potentially rich targets for manned and unmanned U.S. and allied aircraft. There may be a great deal the United States and its allies can do to degrade ISIS on both sides of the Iraq-Syria border.  The larger issue is that U.S. security policy cannot simply be driven by the ebbs and flows of public opinion. National security is simply too important, and given the recent history of U.S. engagement in the Middle East, there should be a vigorous and thoughtful debate about the goals and objective that military force can seek to achieve in this current conflict. This is not to be ""anti-democratic"" or to blame the public for either being war-weary after a decade of conflict with little tangible results or -- conversely -- being enraged by the actions of murderous terrorists. Instead, it is an indictment of our leaders. Rather than seriously consider the longer-term ramifications of military action against ISIS, whether for the Syrian conflict, the future of Iraq or the larger Sunni-Shia rivalry in the Middle East, U.S. leaders have been willing to simply follow the public and avoid the harder questions and difficult and complex issues that should be addressed before re-committing U.S. military forces. This is the time for a fundamental rethinking of U.S. strategy in the greater Middle East. Last week's debate failed miserably to approach these larger issues. The American people, and their men and women in uniform deserve far better."

A U.N. commission on Wednesday accused the extremist Islamic State organization of committing crimes against humanity with attacks on civilians, as pictures emerged of the extremists' bloody takeover of a Syrian military air base that added to the international organizationâs claims. (AP Photo/ Raqqa Media Center of the Islamic State group)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13dc7230000370093dbeb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ISTANBUL -- When the United States asked Turkey to join a coalition to fight the Islamic State, Turkey answered with a resounding no, citing concern over the lives of 49 hostages the hardline group took in June from Turkey’s consulate in northern Iraq. But on Sunday the hostages were mysteriously freed, unharmed, after over three months in captivity -- and Ankara has not changed its stance on joining the U.S.-led coalition, despite their homecoming. As the United States, along with allies that include several Arab countries, strikes parts of Syria for the first time, Turkey is shying away from concrete action against the Islamic State, prompting rumors as well as concern among lawmakers, experts and even relatives of the released hostages. “Here is the test for Turkey,” Steven Cook of the Council on Foreign Relations tweeted on Sunday. “With the hostages freed, will Ankara be an active/overt member of the anti-ISIS coalition?”The release of the hostages, all but three of whom are Turks, was met with relief and joy. The hostages included several young children, the Turkish consul general, and three Iraqis who worked at the consulate. Family members of the hostages were terrified they might meet the same grim fate as other hostages who have been murdered by the Islamic State. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his government have refused to explain how the hostage release was negotiated, and released hostages were instructed not to speak to press. “This is a diplomatic success,” Erdogan said at a press conference on Sunday. “The result of a political bargain.”Rumors now abound about how Turkey secured the hostages’ release and their safe passage home. Some critics have wondered whether the hostage release was related to Turkey's refusal to join the anti-ISIS alliance, or if the hardline group received something in return for the hostages. Hurriyet Daily News reported that a Syrian rebel group coordinating with Turkey released 50 members of the Islamic State back to the group as part of an exchange for the hostages. “Whether there was a swap or not –- of course, everybody will write something about it,” Erdogan said in a speech on Sunday. “What we look at here is: Whether a swap has taken place or not, our 49 citizens returned to Turkey.”Whispers of Turkey working with the Islamic State or other extremist fighters in Syria are nothing new. “We hear that Turkey is supporting ISIS,” a cousin of one of the released Turkish hostages told The WorldPost by phone, requesting anonymity out of concern for their safety. “We cannot accept Turkey not fighting against ISIS. It’s really worrying.” Another relative said the government had not done enough earlier to get the hostages back.With the Syrian war dragging into its fourth year, Turkey faces criticism that its lengthy border with Syria is far too porous and that it turns a blind eye to fighters in its territory on their way to battle the Assad regime, even if they are designated as terrorists. Meanwhile, the country struggles to support more than 1 million Syrian refugees, with more fleeing into Turkey every day. Fighters, both moderate and extremist, can easily cross its border, and Turkey arguably has done too little, too late to clamp down. Many foreigners seeking to join the Islamic State fly into Istanbul then head to the Syrian border, and the Islamic State is known to recruit fighters in Turkey. Fighters, both Syrian and foreign, are easily spotted in shops, cafes and bus station along the border. ""These foreign fighters are crossing often from Turkey,” Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said last week. “Which either because of fear or maybe ideology has declined to participate [in the coalition] to stop that flow of fighters and to counter [the Islamic State].”In an interview on Sunday at the Council on Foreign Relations, Erdogan told CNN’s Fareed Zakaria that the flow of hardline foreign fighters was “under control.” When another reporter asked whether Turkey would do more to help stop the flow of fighters, Erdogan said the question was “an insult” because Turkey was always trying to do more. Aaron Stein, a Turkey analyst and associate fellow at the London-based Royal United Services Institute, said Turkey is critical in the fight against the Islamic State, with its border serving as the main entry point for its foreign fighters into Syria. But, he stresses, it’s too simplistic too lay the issue of smuggling at the feet of the Turks. “Turkey is the last link in the chain,” he explained, saying there are often many steps in a foreign fighter's journey to Syria. He added that Ankara has recently increased its efforts to screen potential fighters, including improving its surveillance, but it’s just not advertising it. “I think it is important to note that things have begun to change,” he added. “This change happened too slowly, but it has come nonetheless.” "

The colorful money, antique tokens, and cartoon old man let us pretend to be important, to feel successful, to realize the American Dream of prosperity. This childhood memory becomes something parents share with their children, growing into a cultural touchstone spanning generations. Perhaps it is the warm memories of playing with siblings that obscures what the game's objectives are, how it is played, and the lessons it imparts. For one, there is the object of the game itself, plainly stated: The winner is the last player left in the game, having driven their opponents into bankruptcy.Just recently, Bank of America agreed to the largest court settlement in history: $16 billion with the Department of Justice in a wide-ranging lawsuit over the bank's collateralized debt schemes. Do you think that the executives at Bank of America that engineered these schemes believed that robbing their customers was okay because it meant they were getting ahead by bankrupting others? You have to wonder what kind of monopoly mindset breeds such betrayal of the client. And you also have to wonder why any of these bankers won't be held accountable, considering this was orchestrated by people who knew better. Yet, corporate personhood means that fingers can be pointed in countless directions, plausible deniability abounds, and the defense of ""I was just following orders"" seems to get everybody off the hook. Corporate personhood is the ultimate get-out-of-jail-free card. Even the very rules of Monopoly violate anti-trust legislation that has been in place for generations. These are the kind of laws that helped America grow and thrive, like preventing corporations from discriminatory pricing in railroad shipping. This is the same Interstate Commerce Act cited in the Supreme Court's ruling over the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) as to whether or not the federal government can be involved in regulating state health insurance programs. Those who were mad that others' healthcare was not taken away are probably the same ones who prefer to own all the railroads and utilities in Monopoly, clucking at others' misfortunes. The recent anniversary of Occupy Wall Street reminds us of the basic inequality that compelled so many to take to the streets spontaneously in protest. While ""We are the 99%"" became the rallying cry for demonstrators, the lop-sided distribution wherein 1 percent of the population owns over 40 percent of the wealth wasn't even the real outrage. More specifically, the target of ire were those among the top one percent that use their money to rig the system in their favor still more, generally through political spending. It's not so much about being against rich people as it is being against rich people buying government. Yet we learned in Monopoly that not only is hoarding wealth the American Dream, but that the banker can take money as needed to keep the game going, much like the executives who gave themselves obscene bonuses from federal bailout money after crashing the American economy. What's more, in Monopoly, there are many unwritten rules known only by experts, like trading properties or bidding on open squares. For most Americans, not being clued in to insider rules is an unfair disadvantage, allowing trusting citizens to invest in worthless derivatives, presume a bank won't try to steal their house, or believe that their elected leaders actually care about their constituents instead of their contributors.Because while corruption has long been born from candidates' need to fill their campaign coffers, the role money plays in politics today has reached crisis levels. The public's contempt for politicians has reached new heights, between their relentless fundraising and the negative ads they buy, with a bipartisan majority believing their representatives don't listen to them. The 2010 Supreme Court decision Citizens United allowed corporations to spend unlimited money in elections without having to disclose its origins, opening up a new era of Dark Money that fuels our elections with unknown motivations -- because if those motivations were known, they probably would not be popular.But there's one motivation for dark money that you could probably guess, and it is reason enough to worry: a return on investment. Just like when you build houses and hotels on your squares in Monopoly to extort jacked-up rents from other players landing on your properties, pouring money into politics through lobbying and campaign donations pays back manifold. From deregulation of industry standards (also known as ""decriminalization""), to tax breaks, to government contracts, to federal giveaways, the return on investment from political spending averages a whopping 22,000 percent, according to a study published in the Journal of Law & Politics. Is it really a capitalist market when the marketplace is rigged by those who paid more to change the rules in their favor? Is it really a democracy when people's votes matter less in elections than corporate spending? No matter how much the Supreme Court may dilute the definition of corruption to a meaningless term, by insisting that no amount of money can corrupt a politician, the larger injustice doesn't seem to matter to these justices: Beyond the right of an individual to spend as much as they want in elections, what about those who cannot afford to max out contributions? What the court has said in Citizens United vs. FEC and again this year in McCutcheon vs. FEC is that might makes right -- that our rules should be curtailed to benefit the very richest, that the biggest spender deserves the biggest latitude, and that the only voices that matter are those that can afford to dominate the discussion.So how do we escape this real-life Monopoly? Well, for starters, it might interest you to know that the game of Monopoly as we know it is itself a corporate lie, an appropriation from the public domain that inverted lessons meant to teach the dangers of real estate monopolies. Realizing that we have grown up with a lie for our favorite childhood board game is symbolic of the larger questions we must ask ourselves about how much we let corporate hegemony control our society.The official story of Monopoly's invention reads like Horatio Alger, a success story of man trying to feed his family during the Great Depression. In 1932, as the story goes, Charles M. Darrow conceived of a finance board game with intricate rules and colorful squares that let the gamers play mogul. After Parker Brothers first turned down the game, they saw that it was catching on in department stores as Darrow made copies himself, so in 1934 they acquired the rights to the game. The game got bigger and bigger, making Darrow and his descendants fabulously wealthy.Since Darrow lived in Philadelphia, it might have seemed curious that the squares in this game were named after Atlantic City streets. While Darrow would maintain in his correspondence with Parker Brothers that he conceived of the game all by himself, Parker Brothers had been hearing that there was already another game from their sellers, and it was just like the Monopoly that Darrow claimed to create. Flashback 30 years. In 1904, a patent was registered for a board game called The Landlord's Game, to a woman named Elizabeth Magie. The game featured squares of property, with different prices, going around a board, with the object being the accumulation of property. Players could buy, trade, and auction off properties as they managed their burgeoning real estate empires. There was a Park corner, a jail that players could be sent to, and cards that kept the game moving. But The Landlord's Game was designed to teach. Lizzie Magie had been a follower of the Quaker economist Henry George, who strove for equitable distribution of wealth in society. Among George's lessons that Lizzie Magie wanted to impart: the idea that increasing the value of property creates a bubble because it offers no new wealth or commerce. The notion of a real estate bubble imploding is not so far-fetched today. The Landlord's Game was so popular, it continued to spread for decades even when the game went out of print. Friends taught each other the game, even making their own board games from wood or oilcloths. The game was particularly popular among Quakers, who modified the rules to make playing more conducive to the Quaker lifestyle. From homes to schools to a Quaker orphanage, the little changes made to the Landlord's Game (also known as ""finance,"" or ""monopoly"" with a lower-case ""m"") became integral to the eventual popularity of the game. So when Charles Darrow was introduced to the game and then passed it off as his own, it would take corporate intervention to monopolize this property. Imagine what would be involved if you tried to claim inventing ""cards"" or ""chess."" This background and the man who uncovered it, Ralph Anspach, appear in my new documentary PAY 2 PLAY, which looks at our modern system of pay-to-play politics like a game of monopoly. I wanted to tell his story in my film because I found that the original folklore had been reinforced so much by the makers or Monopoly that when I told people their childhood game was a corporate lie, no matter how jaded people were at politics and corruption and greed, their reaction was almost always shock: ""Not Monopoly!"" That outrage is the spark to action.Because we need to get past our jadedness doubt that what we say or do has little or no impact. Our stories spread and grow because of the human connection between us. The hundreds of thousands of people who took to the streets of New York for the Climate March are using their voices to make the call to action louder than ever. They obviously weren't there because of the corporate media."

Earlier this year, one of our military leaders told Congress that climate change will be a catalyst for conflict.And we just need to look out the window to see climate change impacts. Last month was the hottest August on record since record-keeping began in 1880.It is time for Congress to wake up to climate change.

More than a quarter of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity's membership has been accused by the school's judicial council of hazing after a former member's public airing of what he says he experienced as a pledge in 2009, including being forced to swim in a kiddie pool of vomit and other bodily fluids. (AP Photo/Jim Cole)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae51432600003600812b50.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Two elite New England universities made major changes to their policies governing fraternities amid scrutiny over student misconduct on both campuses.Wesleyan University in Connecticut, which is frequently listed as one of the top 10 liberal arts schools, told students Monday morning that its three all-male, residential fraternities must go coed or lose the school's official recognition.""With equity and inclusion in mind, we have decided that residential fraternities must become fully co-educational over the next three years,"" wrote board of trustees Chair Joshua Boger and university President Michael Roth in a campus-wide announcement. ""If the organizations are to continue to be recognized as offering housing and social spaces for Wesleyan students, women as well as men must be full members and well-represented in the body and leadership of the organization.""Meanwhile on Sunday night, Dartmouth College students had received word that all fraternities at the Ivy League school in New Hampshire would eliminate the traditional pledge period, which nationwide has been associated with the hazing of new members. Both changes are happening amid an intense national focus on sexual violence in college, continued reports of sometimes deadly hazing, and critics arguing that fraternities exacerbate the problems of binge drinking and disrespect of women on campus. Earlier this month, Wesleyan banned students from attending events or living at the Beta Theta Pi fraternity, a Greek chapter labeled a ""rape factory"" in a 2012 lawsuit. After settlement of that Beta lawsuit, another fraternity at Wesleyan, Psi Upsilon, was hit with a suit alleging that a woman was raped at the frat house while others were present in the room.Dartmouth's change follows years of debate about the role of fraternities on campus and comes just months after a majority on a student council overseeing sororities boycotted the midwinter rush because they believed the Greek system was unsafe for women. Hundreds of faculty members and two former Dartmouth presidents have advocated for a dramatic overhaul or abolition of the Greek system.On Sunday, the Dartmouth Inter-Fraternity Council sent out a brief email to students announcing the latest change:We, the Inter-Fraternity Council of Dartmouth, have unanimously elected to bring a formal end to the fraternity pledge period, commonly known as “pledge term.” All newly selected members of IFC fraternities shall be considered full members upon joining a house. New members will enjoy full rights and privileges of current members. We will continue to work closely with GLOS [the Office of Greek Letter Organizations and Societies] to ensure the continuation of constructive individual and team-building activities.Members of the Inter-Fraternity Council declined to make anyone available for interviews on Monday. But the council's decision likely grew out of college President Phil Hanlon's effort, launched in April, to ""move the college forward"" and tackle social climate problems on campus. Many online responses to that campaign had suggested requiring significant reforms to the Greek system. Official proposals are expected to be presented to Dartmouth trustees this fall.Wesleyan had received similar feedback from students and faculty this year. In April, 68 professors joined dozens of students calling on the university to force the three recognized fraternities on campus to admit women.""This decision was made after the administration spent the summer soliciting and receiving feedback on the issue from many interested parties,"" Wesleyan spokeswoman Kate Carlisle told The Huffington Post in an email. Those interested parties included current fraternity members, student leaders and alumni. Carlisle said fraternity members were given advance notice before the campus-wide announcement Monday.Several of Wesleyan's peer institutions, including Middlebury, Colby and Williams colleges, have already kicked fraternities off campus entirely. Amherst College in Massachusetts decided earlier this year to ban students from joining fraternities at all. The groups were already unrecognized by the college, but the school continued to experience problems with the frat houses.Students at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania, another Wesleyan peer, voted in favor of Greek houses becoming coeducational in 2013. Swarthmore has made no changes in policy regarding Greek organizations since that vote."

Organized by CASA of Maryland, about 120 of the protesters were arrested after refusing to clear the sidewalk on the north side of the White House.

Huerta is one of many immigration reform supporters who say the delay amounts to prudent politics. Major executive changes to immigration policy, the argument goes, could spook voters ahead of midterms elections, potentially costing Democrats their control of the Senate. But that argument obscures a fundamental problem with Obama's decision that should concern both those who support and oppose reform: our president is backing away from a policy he says he will enact anyway, and he's telling voters openly that he's timing it for political reasons. The debate isn't about whether Obama will actually take these actions, but rather when.That move isn't just a strategic calculation. It's a method of stripping away a layer of accountability in a political system moving ever closer to a permanent state of campaigning, in which lawmakers often view the performance of their jobs as a risk rather than a responsibility. Some on the left, like Huerta, have argued that Obama's timing amounts to sound politics, that waiting until after the election will allow Democrats to maintain control of the U.S. Senate, which will ultimately lead to reform. But our democratic system is supposed to be based on accountability and transparency, not jealously guarding control of the U.S. Senate. If voters support executive action on immigration, perhaps they will reward Democrats with more seats. If they oppose it, perhaps they will reward Republicans with more seats. Maybe a majority of Americans will ultimately come to the conclusion that deportation relief, in lieu of action by Congress opposed by House Republicans, makes sense, but the Democrats will still lose the Senate because the people who care the most are concentrated in states like California or Texas, where U.S. Senate races are uncompetitive. None of that really matters. If the president says he'll enact the policy anyway, he owes it to the American public to enact it from the moment he was convinced it made sense for the country, not his party. Conversely, if he's not willing to do it now, he shouldn't do it at all. Voters, not to mention the millions of immigrants residing here who are citizens in all but name, need to know where he really stands. Shifting the ground beneath their feet every few months doesn't help them do that. Obama has justified his position by saying immigration politics changed over the last few months. He's right. The influx of more than 60,000 minors, the vast majority fleeing violence and poverty in Central America and seeking family members in the United States changed the dynamics of the debate. This is unfortunate, because as journalist Julio Ricardo Varela points out, Obama actually positioned himself sensibly in that debate. House Republicans, including many who formerly supported reform, responded to the child migrant crisis by voting to strip deportation relief away from immigrants who have lived here for more than five years that were brought here illegally as children -- a class of people even Fox News pundit Bill O'Reilly says should be given a pathway to citizenship. House Republicans chose this course of action despite the fact that little evidence shows that DACA is behind the crisis. By comparison, Obama responded by coordinating a regional campaign to warn about the dangers of human trafficking and by expediting court proceedings for the unaccompanied minors to provide a disincentive for families and traffickers to send them. Some of these policies put him at odds with immigrant activists, and for good reason. None of it addresses the root causes of poverty, violence and corruption -- much of it caused in large part by the U.S. government -- that drive immigration. Furthermore, an untold number of the unaccompanied minors have a fighting chance to win the right to stay here, either by claiming asylum or protection under U.S. law as victims of trafficking. Even so, many of those kids will face a judge without a lawyer because deportation cases are heard in civil court, so the government isn't required to provide the children with a public attorney. Despite its problems, Obama's strategy showed results. Fewer children are coming. The crisis, for the moment, has been averted. It was never realistic to paint children as a security threat, and there's really no reason why the unaccompanied minors' crisis should continue to derail the immigration debate. And yet the Obama administration has quietly declined to trumpet it's success, with the result that polls show most Americans disapprove of the job he's doing and support for Republicans' handling of immigration is growing. This should disturb those who want to fix our immigration system because since the failure of the comprehensive immigration reform bill passed by the U.S. Senate, even pro-reform Republicans from U.S. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) to Marco Rubio (R-Fl.) have embraced an enforcement-first approach that flies in the face of the fact that the border is now more secure than it has been in a decade. Some on the right have tried to argue that it's unconstitutional to provide deportation relief and work authorization through executive action. Their arguments notwithstanding, the law very clearly allows the executive to set standards for prosecutorial discretion and to offer people employment if their deportations have been deferred. That's why the focus on immigration policy has shifted from Congress, where the vast majority of Republicans and a few Democrats have made it clear they won't allow reform to pass, to the White House. If Obama truly thinks offering deportation relief and work authorization to more undocumented immigrants is the right step, he should enact the policy before elections and let the voters decide. It's not about which party wins the Senate. It's about crafting policy that makes sense and that U.S. voters support."

You know, poor people, black people, Hispanic people, old people, female people, especially people it believes are inclined to vote for Democrats. Republican politicians have hatched a multitude of schemes in states across the country to accomplish this gambit, passing laws demanding specific voter identification at polling places, eliminating early voting days and purging voters from registration rolls.The right-wingers on the U.S. Supreme Court last year gave Republicans a hand in this effort by striking down key protections in the Voting Rights Act. Joining them this month were three Republican judges on the 7 U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.In a rush-job, five-paragraph order issued just hours after the trio heard testimony, the GOP panel overruled a lower court’s 70-page decision and allowed Wisconsin to demand voter ID of 300,000 residents who don’t currently have it for an election that is less than 7 weeks away.When their hands are pressed on a Bible in court, Republican experts admit they’ve got no evidence of the in-person voter fraud that the GOP claims these laws are intended to prevent. What they’re really intended to prevent is voting by people Republicans detest, the derided “47 percent” that GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney spit on. Republicans are robbing citizens of the fundamental right to vote. It’s criminal. It’s fraud that subverts America’s cherished democracy. Since 2010, Republicans have passed voter-suppression laws in 22 states, and nearly half the nation’s population could be affected in November’s balloting. Groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and the NAACP have succeeded in postponing and overturning some. That includes the one in Pennsylvania, where the law’s Republican supporters conceded in court they had absolutely no evidence of in-person voter fraud.In Texas, the expert called to testify by Republicans supporting the law admitted when cross-examined that he was unaware of a single case of in-person voter fraud there. In Wisconsin, Republican officials acknowledged in depositions that they could not produce one example of in-person voter fraud in the entire state history. The Brennan Center for Justice studied the allegations of in-person voter fraud and described it as essentially a myth, an event that almost never occurs. Justin Levitt, a Loyola Law Professor who has tracked allegations of fraud for years, has found 31 incidents since 2000 – out of more than 1 billion ballots cast nationwide. And, he says, some of the 31 have not been investigated and may, in the end, be debunked. Levitt also says voter ID does not prevent the most common types of election cheating.  Voter fraud is unacceptable. But so is disenfranchising hundreds of thousands of citizens. Particularly when disenfranchising them does not prevent voter fraud. Federal Judge Lynn Adelman put it this way in his ruling against the Wisconsin law, “There is no way to determine exactly how many people Act 23 will prevent or deter from voting without considering the individual circumstances of each of the 300,000 plus citizens who lack an ID. But no matter how imprecise my estimate may be, it is absolutely clear that Act 23 will prevent more legitimate votes from being cast than fraudulent votes.”Among the 300,000 are Ruthelle Frank, Shirley Brown and Eddie Lee Holloway Jr., all plaintiffs in the lawsuit against the Wisconsin statute. Though Brown has been a regular at the polls in Wisconsin for decades, the state Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) denied her the ID she would need to vote under the state law because she did not have a birth certificate. Born at home in Louisiana 70-some years ago, Brown never had a birth certificate. The DMV rebuffed a statement from Brown’s elementary school attesting to her birth, even though Medicare had accepted it.The DMV denied Halloway an ID card because his birth certificate read “Eddie Junior Holloway instead of “Eddie Lee Holloway Junior.”The lead plaintiff in the lawsuit is Ruthelle Frank, an 87-year-old woman born in Wisconsin who has voted in every election there since 1948 and who has served on the Brokaw Village Board since 1996. She does not have an acceptable ID under the law because she lacks a certified copy of her birth certificate.Wisconsin Republican state officials told the appeals court earlier this month that they would no longer require residents without birth certificates to produce them. This was done because a state court had suggested requiring residents to purchase certificates was akin to a poll tax. Instead, the DMV will look up the information. That may not help Ruthelle Frank, however, because her maiden name is misspelled on her certificate. To correct a birth certificate could cost $200 and takes time.And she doesn’t have much time. There’s only seven weeks until the election. For hundreds of thousands of citizens like Ruthelle Frank, what Wisconsin is demanding of them to exercise their right to vote is extremely difficult if not impossible. Even if she could pay to get her birth certificate corrected in time, she’d have to find a way to a motor vehicle office to collect an identification card.In 48 of the state’s 72 counties, where a quarter of the state’s adult population lives, motor vehicle offices are open only two weekdays, and never during evenings. People without ID don’t have drivers’ licenses. That’s 300,000 people in Wisconsin who would have to find a way to motor vehicle offices during limited hours – 43,000 a week until Election Day.If the three-Republican judge panel’s ruling is not reversed, hundreds of thousands of Wisconsin citizens could be disenfranchised by Republicans in a state where there has been no documented in-person voter fraud since it joined the union.That’s exactly what Republican politicians and Republican judges want, especially when their GOP governor is running neck-and-neck with his Democratic challenger. That is defrauding voters.***Image by DonkeyHotey on Flickr."

Ward (L) and Filmmaker Ken Burns speak onstage during the PBS Press tour 'Ken Burns's The Roosevelts: An Intimate History' panel at the 2014 Summer TCA Tour - Day 15 at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on July 22, 2014 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5bf9e2100000001c86f26.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ken Burns' seven-part PBS series on the lives of Theodore, Franklin, and Eleanor Roosevelt, The Roosevelts: An Intimate History, is a remarkable achievement. Burns sheds a poignant new light on the personal and public lives of three monumental figures in 20th Century American history. And in doing so, he illustrates the relative rottenness of the hacks, partisans, and plutocrats who make up the political class that rules America today. By exploring the lives and times of TR, FDR, and ER Burns shows that in our not-so-distant past the governing institutions of this country were actually responsive to the needs and desires of working-class Americans. This superb and moving portrait is a perfect fit for our times. The utter failure of our current ""leaders"" is glaring by comparison. Yes, TR was a warmonger, and FDR signed the order that imprisoned innocent Japanese Americans. There are long lists of both presidents' failures. But we shouldn't let those flaws bury the fact that both TR and FDR were not afraid to stand up to big corporations and Wall Street if they viewed their actions as damaging to the country. That alone is probably the biggest difference between those leaders of the early decades of the 20th Century and today. After thirty years of ""supply-side"" economics that has left working people still waiting for better times to ""trickle down""; eight years of George W. Bush's misrule that brought us war and recession; the Far-Right ascendency in 2010 that has all but shuttered the federal government in an attempt to destroy Barack Obama; and a Supreme Court that is proudly subservient to every tenet of plutocracy -- I think it's okay to flip on PBS and feel a bit nostalgic for a time when there existed effective politicians who actually gave a damn about the quality of life of the majority of Americans.Over the past thirty years, Presidents and Congresses have become so subservient to corporations and Wall Street that the two major political parties are all but indistinguishable. One of the reasons why our politics have become so volatile and opinion polls show over and over again that our people have nothing but contempt for the whole political class in Washington is the widespread recognition that the plutocrats, CEOs, and Wall Street bankers have effectively seized our governing institutions. Another subtext for our times of the Burns documentary is the reminder that people who come from the richest .01 percent of Americans don't have to be total assholes. Unlike the Koch Brothers, or the Waltons, or Representative Darrell Issa (the richest man in the House of Representatives) the Roosevelts didn't feel they had a class interest in keeping their boots on the necks of America's working people; they strived to uplift them. And they saw the federal government not as a bazaar of accounts receivable to vacuum up precious tax dollars for the already rich but as a means to improve the lives of the 99 percent. The Roosevelts also illustrates a time when Democrats had dirt under their fingernails. There was no need to remind them that Democratic politicians valued labor unions or sought new protections in the workplace. The leaders and rank-in-file were tied together. Today, when we see Democratic politicians like New York Governor Andrew Cuomo or Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel bludgeoning teachers' unions while supping at the table of big campaign donors from Wall Street we're left with the realization that working people have few reliable advocates for their class interests anymore. Since 1984, Democratic politicians decided the party needed to ""move to the center"" given Ronald Reagan's landslide. But ""moving to the center"" meant moving away from serving the interests of working people and moving toward Wall Street and big corporations. Ironically, in the 1990s, when the Democratic Party grew more diverse based on race and gender, it shifted far closer to the Republicans in terms of class. We've seen one Democratic president (Bill Clinton) push NAFTA and other ""free trade"" deals that decimated labor unions; unravel the social safety net in the name of ""welfare reform""; and deregulate Wall Street. And we've seen another Democratic president (Barack Obama) refuse to send any bankers to jail for the massive fraud they committed in the mortgage markets; choose to beat up teachers' unions with Arne Duncan's ""Race to the Top""; and accommodate the profiteers inside our health care system. All of these policies represent a capitulation to the interests of big corporations and Wall Street on the part of Democratic administrations at the expense of their own constituencies. The Burns documentary leaves one wondering what TR or FDR would do regarding these same policies. We'll never know because history doesn't work that way. But we can use our imaginations a little and recognize that compared to the responsiveness of the federal government during the Square Deal and New Deal eras, our current crop of ""leaders"" from both political parties have failed the majority of Americans and in doing so they've failed the country.Another aspect of the Burns documentary is a revealing look at the kind of patriotism that TR, FDR, and ER exhibited throughout their lives. It was a patriotism that recognized that the country is strongest when all Americans had opportunities and the federal government not only helped to uplift them materially, but also protected them from the rapacious predators of the Wall Street ruling class. We've lost that sense of patriotic duty today. The ""you're on your own"" society has won out in recent decades over the idea that ""everyone does better when everyone does better."" So if you haven't yet seen The Roosevelts, by all means, sit back, put on PBS, and enjoy watching a time in America that predates the death of the liberal class."

The Times, online and in print, covers the day's big news and often looks more broadly at the political landscape. And Times reporters routinely tweet immediate insights and news nuggets. But the Times has lagged behind competitors in having venue for political scooplets that might not immediately merit a full story, quick takes off the news, and coverage of social life around Washington.""We haven't had sort of a running daily political news feed,"" Hulse said in an interview with The Huffington Post. ""We're trying to fill that void now. We may be late to the game, but we're trying to do it in our own distinctive way.""On Monday, the Times is launching First Draft, a morning email newsletter and politics site within NYTimes.com. Hulse said First Draft, which is expected to land in subscribers' inboxes around 7 a.m., will highlight political stories running that morning in the Times and include some aggregation and links to competitors. But Hulse said First Draft will differentiate itself through original content, with Times reporters' scoops, analysis and coverage of parties and events that'll be found there first. Some, but certainly not all, First Draft items could develop later into full Times articles appearing online and in the next day's print edition. The Times' long-running Washington blog, The Caucus, has become largely idle so there hasn't been a go-to platform for such content. The Times plans to update First Draft frequently, with hopes that political news junkies will return throughout the day. First Draft will also feature a more blog-like, conversational tone than is typically found in the Times daily news report. Hulse said the newsletter will cover insider-heavy social events, such as last week's D.C. premiere of ""Madam Secretary,"" but will not include birthdays, a la Politico Playbook. The newsletter is free, but readers who aren't Times subscribers will reach the paper's paywall after clicking through 10 stories. There is no launch sponsor for the First Draft newsletter, but a Times spokeswoman said there will be advertising opportunities down the line. The First Draft team includes Hulse, as managing editor, along with reporter Alan Rappeport, producer Nicholas Corasaniti and editor Paul Volpe. But Hulse said he wants, and needs, reporters throughout the Washington bureau to pitch in.A couple of weeks ago, Hulse brought Heineken mini-kegs into the Washington bureau so colleagues could enjoy a draft during the in-house unveiling of First Draft. Hulse said reporters seemed excited to contribute and noted that ""people around here vacuum up a lot of information and we haven't had a venue to share it all.""Hulse noted that he and his colleagues throw out political observations on Twitter. While Hulse said Times staffers shouldn't be discouraged from tweeting, the newsletter and site can provide a ""more organized way"" to take advantage of reporters' and editors' quick insights. The idea for First Draft has been kicking around for a while. Jill Abramson, then-executive editor of the Times, announced plans for the morning tip sheet in November 2013 and there were expectations for at least a soft launch by late spring. In June, Politico reported the project was being ""reconsidered"" and could potentially be scrapped altogether. Hulse said the Times paused to do market research and run focus groups to better assess what readers wanted from such a product. He also noted that a number of designers and members of the interactive team in New York have been working on the site, which is expected to feature plenty of video and data visualizations. The site will also include features to engage readers, such as a ""Midterms Q&A"" allowing readers to ask questions of Times reporters and editors leading up to the November elections. ""Everyone here knows we need to be engaging in new ways with readers,"" Hulse said. ""And everyone here has stuff in their notebooks and knows things and runs across things that we're really not reporting now."""
