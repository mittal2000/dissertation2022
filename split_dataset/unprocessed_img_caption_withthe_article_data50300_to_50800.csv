She worked as a caregiver for the elderly, as well as at a children’s day care. She sent the money she earned to her six children living in her home country of Jamaica. When in 2008, at 49 years old, Green sought medical assistance herself at Brooklyn’s Kings County hospital, she was asked to wait. After 24 hours in the hospital waiting room, having yet to be seen, Green collapsed. A blood clot in her leg had spread to her lungs. Surveillance footage shows a security guard leaning over Green briefly before walking away. Later, another hospital worker taps her body with her foot. Green died on the waiting room floor. It was still 30 minutes until a nurse finally checked her pulse. “She was disregarded, disrespected and discarded,” Representative Yvette D. Clarke told The New York Times, following Green’s death. In “The Waiting Room,” now on view at the New Museum, artist Simone Leigh pays tribute to Green, whose story is emblematic of the way black women’s pain is historically underestimated and overlooked. “There’s this expectation of black women to be behind or come last,” Leigh said in an interview with Artsy. The joint exhibition and artist residency imagines and realizes an alternative model of healthcare, one organized around principles of disobedience, determination and radical self-care, and founded upon the kinds of knowledge shared between black women, often privately or even subconsciously. It contains, for example, a meditation room, a movement studio, and an apothecary lined with herbs culled from around the world.“I wanted to expand the idea of medicine to include other self-defense and care mechanisms like strategy, or even desire, as alternatives to the stamina and obedience that is expected as normative behavior,” Leigh explained to The Guardian. “Herbalism and dance would fall into the category of knowledge that resists the market and capitalization.”Leigh’s clinic also includes a variety of “Care Sessions” offered for free on a first-come, first-served basis. Such sessions range from herbalism workshops to community acupuncture, “Afrocentering” to a guided meditation for Black Lives Matter. The sessions, all led by women, evoke the words of writer and activist Audre Lorde when she wrote: “Caring for myself is not self-indulgence. It is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare.”Dr. Shanesha Brooks-Tatum echoed Lorde’s sentiment in a piece called “Subversive Self Care,” published on The Feminist Wire. “It’s subversive to take care of ourselves because for centuries black women worldwide have been taking care of others,” she wrote. “When sisters unite in self-care, regularly indulging in what they love such as dancing, painting, laughing — soul and sanity food — we’re engaged in a soulful insurrection that disrupts the very forces that seek to sacrifice our beings. And, quite matter-of-factly, if we don’t take care of ourselves, who will?”Six lectures ― again, all led by women ― round out the program. In a June lesson titled “On Disobedience,” artist Chitra Ganesh explored the aesthetics and performance of protest enacted outside the United States, specifically the way text and image can incite actual change and challenge systemic power. On Aug. 4, artist Lorraine O’Grady will lead a talk titled “Ask Me Anything About Aging,” using intimate conversation and word-of-mouth as a means of spreading valuable knowledge and insight about the aging process. Finally, “The Waiting Room” offers a series of underground partnerships, classes held outside of public view, with no photography or video recording allowed. The confidential classes take inspiration from The United Order of Tents, an underground secret society of black female nurses that dates back to the Underground Railroad. The classes include self-defense, critical thinking and taiko drumming for LGBTQ youth. While the mainstream public healthcare system in our country continues to fail its American citizens, particularly the lower class and people of color, Leigh mines parallel histories to uncover productive modes of healing and survival. She does away with the common hospital etiquette of compliance, patience and stamina, imagining instead a posture of desire and disobedience, stances that, hopefully, will help keep black women living and healthy. Although housed within a museum’s walls, Leigh’s alternative clinic expands beyond the realm of art into the fields of history, activism, feminism, healthcare and civil rights. “The Waiting Room” offers a glimpse into a parallel world, where black women’s pain is acknowledged as unacceptable, and healing is a radical act of warfare. If only Leigh’s ideas could spread beyond the realm of socially conscious artwork and into the real world.“I’m looking forward to the whole project evolving,” Leigh told Artsy. “It’s really a project for me, not an art installation.”“The Waiting Room” is on view until Sept. 18, 2016 at the New Museum in New York.

The two organizations, who have teamed up to host the first-ever joint convention that kicks off on Aug. 3, recognized HuffPost among their list of journalists included in this year’s group of finalists for various awards.Zeba Blay, a HuffPost Voices culture writer whose work is featured heavily in Black Voices, was nominated for best Commentary/Weblog by NABJ for her powerful personal essay published in November titled, “The Psychological Toll Of Racism In The Wake Of Mizzou.” Blay’s essay explored how writing about race as a black journalist affected her as a black woman with a mental illness, especially in the aftermath of the campus racism protests at the University of Missouri. HuffPost Politics reporters Mariah Stewart, Julia Craven and Ryan Reilly were nominated for best Online Project: News by NABJ for their collaborative piece titled, “The Ferguson Protests Worked.” The detailed article, which included original artwork made by the HuffPost multimedia team, discussed how Black Lives Matter protests ― that erupted in Ferguson, Missouri, against the tragic police killing of Michael Brown ― helped to lead the city to much-needed reform. Lastly, Carolina Moreno’s coverage of outstanding and influential Latinos in her project, “Latinos Break The Mold” was recognized by NAHJ as a finalist under the category “Latino Issues – Print/Digital Journalism.” Moreno’s multimedia piece, which included striking imagery assembled by HuffPost photographers Damon Dahlen and Christy Havranek, helped to shatter harmful stereotypes often painted of Latino men and women by celebrating the beautiful diversity among the Latino community. The three nominations are recognized among a list featuring incredible work from outlets like The New York Times, CNN, BuzzFeed and more. Awards will be announced at the NABJ Salute To Excellence Gala and the NAHJ Gala Reception, both of which will take place on Saturday, Aug. 6.Congrats to all those nominated! "

According to a copy of the email shared with The Huffington Post, Campbell told the woman she’d like to have a conversation with her about what happened.The president promised to make time that week or the next for a conversation with the student, or to arrange at time during the summer that worked for the two of them.On June 6, the account sent this tweet:And on Wednesday, July 27, the @RapedAtSpelman account sent an update:”She never made the time and Title IX staff never contacted me,” the student behind the account told HuffPost in a Twitter direct message, adding that no one from the Spelman administration has reached out in the 24 hours since she first posted those tweets.The all-women, four-year liberal arts school is part of the Atlanta University Center academic consortium. The group includes Morehouse College, the Morehouse School of Medicine and Clark Atlanta University.In May, the @RapedAtSpelman account ignited the AUC community when the person behind it stated she was raped by four Morehouse students, and that Spelman took a month to contact her about her case. When they did, a dean and a public safety officer asked her what she was wearing, why she separated from her friends and why she was drinking underage, the woman said on Twitter.The issue forced its way into commencement exercises less than two weeks later.“The class of 2016 stands in solidarity with our sisters who have been victims and survivors of sexual violence,” senior class president Neah Evering said at the Class Day Convocation in mid-May. “We love you; we support you and we will not be silent until every victim and survivor has received justice. ... Thank you.”Campbell sent a campuswide email on May 4 ― one month before she ever contacted the student behind the @RapedAtSpelman account ― pledging to do more to address sexual violence. But this week, the student says the lack of communication from Campbell and her administration suggests they really don’t care.Spelman officials did not return requests for comment from HuffPost by email and phone on Wednesday and Thursday. ______Tyler Kingkade is a national reporter who covers sexual violence.

6,POLITICS,Democratic Donors Gripe That Clinton Foundation Giving Isn't Buying DNC Access,Ryan Grim,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democratic-donors-clinton-foundation-dnc_us_579927d5e4b0d3568f85d91a,First World problems plague the Democratic National Convention.,2016-07-28,"Talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and their daughter Chelsea Clinton speak during a student conference for the Clinton Global Initiative University in March 2014 at Arizona State University.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PHILADELPHIA ― High-dollar Democratic donors are frustrated their gifts to the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation haven’t bought better access at the Democratic National Convention, according to Democratic fundraisers here.The issue isn’t necessarily about access to policymakers for the purpose of pressing a particular regulatory or legislative agenda. Instead, it’s about admittance to exclusive events, where high-rollers can see and be seen hobnobbing with celebrities and other millionaires. Convention events come with a price tag, and can cost more than $50,000 to get into. But that’s just campaign money. Some donors are annoyed their charitable contributions to the Clinton Foundation aren’t being taken into account.“They want it included in their tally, and Dennis is saying no,” said one fundraiser, referring to Dennis Cheng, one of the most powerful if low-profile managers at the convention. Cheng is finance director for Hillary Clinton’s campaign. He also served as Clinton’s New York finance director from 2005 to 2008, raising money for Clinton’s campaigns for both Senate and president. He then became head of protocol at the State Department under Clinton, handling visits of heads of state. From there, he became the top fundraiser for the Clinton Foundation, before going back to the Clinton campaign. “There’s no consideration for, ‘Yeah, well, I shouldn’t let you in, but you did give me $5 million for the foundation,’” said another fundraiser. She said donors are thinking, and saying, “I just gave you 100k, I gave you a million for the foundation ― and you can’t let me into this event?”Donors are also having trouble getting flexibility to include members of their family in convention-related events. “Can I bring my son? No, that’s another $100. Really? My son’s 12,” the fundraiser said, before offering a measure of admiration for Cheng. “He is really being a hard-ass. I kind of give him credit for that.”At political conventions, the quality of the credentials hanging around your neck is a status symbol, as is the ability to dole out tickets to parties and small gatherings. One fundraiser said that Cheng is forced to be a hard-ass because the Clintons have been in politics for so long that they’ve accumulated an enormous number of friends ― long known as Friends of Bill ― who want access for themselves and their friends to exclusive events. It’s impossible for them to turn away many of these longtime allies, so newer friends are now facing stricter rules. “Dennis is not being warm and fuzzy, but he can’t, because that’s how they used to be,” the fundraiser said. “They’ve got so many old friends they have to take care of, there’s not room.”The flow of money into the Clinton Foundation has long been a source of suspicion among progressives, who worry Clinton is too beholden to major donors. Donald Trump and the GOP make the same case, and many Republicans still believe the FBI will come down on Clinton for a quid pro quo setup. FBI Director James Comey, testifying before Congress, was pointedly asked if the bureau was looking into the activities of the foundation, and declined to comment. (A campaign spokesman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.)One fundraiser said that while donors are complaining in Philadelphia, they should be glad they weren’t in Cleveland for the GOP convention. “You couldn’t go to the bathroom in Cleveland for less than a million dollars,” he said."

That’s what happens when we try.”Obama likened Clinton’s grit and determination to Theodore Roosevelt’s. “Hillary Clinton is that woman in the arena. She’s been there for us ― even if we haven’t always noticed.”And then it was time to talk about Trump. Previous speakers ― including Vice President Joe Biden and vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine ― had already worked up the crowd. Obama picked up where they left off ― at first, by adopting the same mocking tone he’d used in 2011 at the White House Correspondents Dinner.“He’s not really a plans guy,” Obama said of the real estate mogul turned Republican nominee. “Not really a facts guy, either. He calls himself a business guy, which is true, but I have to say, I know plenty of businessmen and women who’ve achieved success without leaving a trail of lawsuits and unpaid workers and people feeling like they got cheated.”But Obama quickly turned serious, mentioning Trump’s record in business as proof that he would not protect the economic interests of everyday Americans. “Does anyone really believe,” Obama said, “that a guy who’s spent his 70 years on this earth showing no regard for working people is suddenly going to be your champion? Your voice?”He also questioned Trump’s ability to protect Americans from foreign threats: “He cozies up to Putin, praises Saddam Hussein, and tells the NATO allies that stood by our side after 9/11 that they have to pay up if they want our protection. Well, America’s promises do not come with a price tag. We meet our commitments.”At one point, Obama invoked an iconic figure from Republican Party history to press his case. “Ronald Reagan,” Obama explained, “called America ‘a shining city on a hill.’ Donald Trump calls it ‘a divided crime scene’ that only he can fix. ... He’s just offering slogans, and he’s offering fear. He’s betting that if he scares enough people, he might score just enough votes to win this election.”“That is another bet that Donald Trump will lose,” Obama continued. “Because he’s selling the American people short. We are not a fragile or frightful people. Our power doesn’t come from some self-declared savior promising that he alone can restore order. We don’t look to be ruled.”But the strongest part of his speech came at the end ― when, after painting Trump as somebody who doesn’t believe in America, Obama reasserted his own belief that democracy can work and that, given the chance, they will make the right choices for the country.“That’s America,” Obama said. “Those bonds of affection; that common creed. We don’t fear the future; we shape it, embrace it, as one people, stronger together than we are on our own.”Obama’s speech brought the partisan crowd to its feet ― and the roars grew louder when Clinton made her dramatic, if predictable, entrance onstage to join him. The two exchanged words, embraced and then stood on the stage soaking in the applause as the convention’s third night drew to a close."

We don’t look to be ruled.”But the strongest part of his speech came at the end ― when, after painting Trump as somebody who doesn’t believe in America, Obama reasserted his own belief that democracy can work and that, given the chance, they will make the right choices for the country.“That’s America,” Obama said. “Those bonds of affection; that common creed. We don’t fear the future; we shape it, embrace it, as one people, stronger together than we are on our own.”Obama’s speech brought the partisan crowd to its feet ― and the roars grew louder when Clinton made her dramatic, if predictable, entrance onstage to join him. The two exchanged words, embraced and then stood on the stage soaking in the applause as the convention’s third night drew to a close."

The video cuts off just as Guest’s boat appears in the distance.Watkins said the shark appeared to be as big as his 17-foot-long kayak. He admitted that he was too busy trying to stay away from it to get a better look, however.Once he was safe on dry land, he said he showed his video to people at Emu Point who estimated that the shark was 16 feet long.Guest said he gave Watkins a bit of advice before they went their separate ways: “I told the guy maybe you should get a bigger boat.”"

We never bow, we never bend, we never break, when confronted with crisis. No, we endure! We overcome and we always, always, always move forward,” Biden said amid cries of “U.S.A.!” from the Democratic National Convention crowd Wednesday.Biden enthused about American workers, the economy and the military; blasted Trump’s ignorance of domestic and world affairs; and issued grave warnings about the consequences of the real-estate billionaire’s vision for the world.“This is a complicated and uncertain world we live in. The threats are too great, the times are too uncertain to elect Donald Trump president of the United States,” Biden said. “No major party nominee in the history of the nation has ever known less or been less prepared to deal with our national security.”Biden’s address to the convention was founded on a two-part argument that Democrats are making to persuade voters ― however skeptical they may be of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton ― that Trump’s negative outlook on America is misplaced and that his strongman approach to problems at home and abroad will threaten the foundation of the nation’s strengths.Trump’s strident views about national security, terrorism, America’s relationship with allied nations and other issues would lead to catastrophe if he were in the White House, Biden said.“We cannot elect a man who exploits our fears of ISIS and other terrorists, who has no plan whatsoever to make us safer, a man who embraces the tactics of our enemies, torture, religious intolerance,” Biden said.“It betrays our values. It alienates those who we need in the fight against ISIS. Donald Trump, with all his rhetoric, would literally make us less safe,” Biden said. “We cannot elect a man who belittles our closest allies while embracing dictators like Vladimir Putin ― I mean it ― a man who seeks to sow division in America for his own gain and disorder around the world. A man who confuses bluster with strength.”The vice president also endeavored to use Trump’s reality TV stardom against him.“His cynicism is unbounded. His lack of empathy and compassion can be summed up in the phrase I suspect he is most proud of making famous: ‘You’re fired,’” Biden said. “Think about everything you learned as a child. No matter where you were raised, how can there be pleasure in saying, ‘You’re fired’? He is trying to tell us he cares about the middle class? Give me a break. That’s a bunch of malarkey.”"

Mike Pence, revealed their first joint campaign logo earlier this month, only to be met with jeers from Twitter users.Some thought the T inside the P looked sexually suggestive. Others thought the P looked like a toilet and the T ― well, something that goes in toilets.The Republican team has since introduced a much cleaner image, but that didn’t stop LogoMyWay CEO Joe Daley from challenging his website’s community of graphic designers to do better. Daley founded the online company in 2008 during the recession to provide new business owners and entrepreneurs a cost-effective branding solution. LogoMyWay now has 22,000 clients and facilitated over 4 million logo designs. He ran the in-house Trump-Pence logo contest to allow the website’s 20,000 freelance designers from around the world to showcase their creativity, Daley told The Huffington Post.Contest participants have submitted 265 designs ― some serious, some humorous and some just plain silly. The winner will earn $200 once voting ends.A logo by U.S. designer Greg Scott leads the rankings:“The single most evident thing about Trump to me is his baldness/infamous hairpiece … and then it clicked in: an idea merging America’s symbol the bald eagle with Hoover’s famous ‘chicken in every pot,’” Scott, who has been designing on the site under the username Davebowman for seven years, told HuffPost. He’s happy his artwork is collecting so many votes from his peers, many of whom are his competitors on the site. Scott hopes the entry will be “received with good humor and appreciated for cleverness.” Another U.S. designer, Bigeasydude, is convinced Trump-Pence is actually a three-person team: Why not build upon the toilet paper theme?

County Aims To House 100 Homeless Youth In 100 Days,Sarah Ruiz-Grossman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/los-angeles-100-day-challenge-homeless-youth_us_5799265de4b0d3568f85d826,Youth homelessness is on the rise in Los Angeles.,2016-07-28,"Adria Roman, 18, and her son, Diano Perez, 3, attend a rally to protest budget cuts to shelter beds for homeless young families.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Youth homelessness is on the rise in Los Angeles, and the county is trying a bold new approach to tackle the issue. Los Angeles County will try to house 100 homeless youth in 100 days, according to the Los Angeles Times. The goal is part of a national challenge set by A Way Home America, a group that works to prevent and end homelessness among young people. Announced in June, the challenge called for communities nationwide to propose innovative ways to combat youth homelessness, according to a release. Following a competitive selection process, three communities ― Los Angeles, Cleveland and Austin ― were selected to participate in the challenge.The challenge starts on September 7. “Too many young people face the harsh reality of not having a safe place to lay their heads and sleep for the night,” Rafael López, commissioner for the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, wrote in a blog. There are 3,447 people between the ages of 18 to 24 who are homeless in LA County, which doesn’t include the cities of Glendale, Pasadena and Long Beach. That’s up from 3,089 last year, according to the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA).That demographic faces unique challenges. Once they turn 18, homeless young adults age out of the foster system, but are often too young to feel safe in adult shelters.The three communities have each set their own goals for how to address youth homelessness in the designated amount of time, according to a release. Cleveland is going to provide extra support to homeless youth who have aged out of the foster care system, according to Kate Lodge, project director at nonprofit A Place 4 Me, which is leading the effort in Cleveland. “We want to start with foster youth first because we know homelessness is a risk they face,” Lodge told The Huffington Post. Forty percent of homeless youth in Cleveland have a foster care history and 29 percent have aged out of foster care, according to Lodge.“That’s why we’re targeting that population first,” Lodge added. Austin plans to focus its 100-day push on ensuring homeless services are effectively serving LGBTQ youth, and on working with landlords to increase housing opportunities for homeless youth, according to Ann Howard, executive director of nonprofit ECHO. ECHO works with policy makers and communities to end homelessness and is co-leading the effort with LifeWorks, a group that works with youth and families. Los Angeles County plans to reach its goal of housing 100 youth in 100 days by taking lessons learned from a pilot program launched last November in Hollywood, according to Tom Waldman of the LAHSA. The organization was able to place about 15 youth per month into safe and stable housing. “If you extrapolate that figure to the whole county for the 100-day challenge, we’re confident we’ll be able to place 100 youth in 100 days,” Waldman told The Huffington Post. “And we won’t stop at 100 ― we’re going to keep going after that.”Nonprofit Rapid Results Institute, which works to address critical societal problems, will provide coaching and support to all of the cities to achieve their goal within 100 days. But no additional funds will be provided. “These are 18-year-olds, 20-year-olds, who are living on the streets in many cases,” Waldman said. “Helping homeless youth is an ongoing process.”"

Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) announced the delegate count for Hilary Clinton, Chelsea Lyons Kent, a supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), casually raised her middle finger.The offensive gesture was broadcast on national television.In an interview Wednesday with Honolulu Civil Beat, Kent said she is outraged by the Democratic National Committee’s clear favoritism of Clinton, calling it a “sham of democracy.”As for her behavior Tuesday, Kent stands by it.“I’m sorry about the way it has affected other people, but the DNC has been flipping us the bird since day one and it’s about time that someone flipped them back,” she told Civil Beat.Tim Vandeveer, chair of the Hawaii Democratic Party, revoked Kent’s floor credentials for the remainder of the convention and removed her as a member of the Hawaii delegation only after she refused to apologize, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. “Delegates of both campaigns have expressed their shock and disappointment at the incident and have asked me to stress that this in no way reflects the sentiments of the rest of our delegation, regardless of their candidate affiliation,” Vandeveer reportedly said in a statement.Earlier this week, Sanders’ supporters booed the Vermont senator after he urged them to unite behind Clinton, who was declared the Democratic nominee Tuesday. In a clear effort to ease growing tensions this week, Sanders called on his delegates to take the high road and not protest or demonstrate on the convention floor. Doing so would damage the movement’s credibility, which is “what Donald Trump wants,” he said.As seen in the video below, Kent didn’t get the message."
16,POLITICS,The Democratic National Convention Is A Great Place To Be A Lobbyist,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democratic-convention-lobbyists-corporations_us_579a54d5e4b0693164c05860,"Corporations, influencers and super PACs were out in full force this week.",2016-07-28,"Corporations, lobbyists and super PACs were present inside and all around the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia this week.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579a55c91200008104a5407c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PHILADELPHIA ― After addressing the Democratic National Convention Tuesday night, former President Bill Clinton appeared on another, more private stage at the Reading Terminal Market just before 1 a.m. Clinton thanked the crowd for supporting his wife and the Democratic presidential nominee, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. He said he was glad that everyone could hear him “tell the story of the person that I know best.”Hillary Action Fund, one of two joint fundraising committees raising money for Clinton and the Democratic National Committee, provided the funding for this official Clinton post-convention party. Inside, Clinton campaign officials milled with Democratic Party bigwigs, lawmakers, donors, celebrities and activists.This was by no means the only event this week that linked party insiders with donors, big money or even corporate interests. In fact, corporations, their trade associations and billionaire mega-donors have been omnipresent around the city and especially in the Wells Fargo Center.Comcast, easily the most visible corporate sponsor of the convention, has its logo emblazoned on every lanyard for convention-goers, and has giant welcome signs on the side of the convention arena and inside 30th Street Station. Facebook hosts a bar for select guests inside the hall. There’s even an official Uber drop-off zone, with a cool-off tent featuring free water and Kind bars.Washington lobbyists were also in on the act, with events in Philadelphia throughout the week.Heather Podesta and her ex-husband Tony, both registered lobbyists, threw competing brunches on Monday and Tuesday. The law firm Dentons hosted a happy hour at the Kimmel Center’s rooftop garden on Wednesday. Squire Patton Boggs, another law firm, hosted former Sen. John Breaux (D-La.), now a registered lobbyist, at 30th Street Station. And Akin Gump, the most well-compensated lobbying firm of 2016, held a celebration of the career of longtime Clinton friend Vernon Jordan.After eight years of being banned by the Obama administration and campaigns, lobbyists are finally able to give to the Democratic presidential ticket and the Democratic National Committee. There appeared to be laws in place governing events where registered lobbyists and federal candidates or officials mingled.One clear example was at the Hillary Action Fund celebration, where the food provided by dozens of Reading Market vendors came in single servings ― modest portions constrained by official regulations. You could sample the breaded eggplant with sweet and sour sauce and arugula served on napkins, or the chicken dumplings served in small Chinese takeout containers.Super PACs funded by mega-donors, meanwhile, were even more visible at the convention hall than they were in 2012. NextGen California, a super PAC funded by the billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer, hosted a bar for select VIPs and delegates on the ground floor. On the suite level, House Majority PAC and Senate Majority PAC, the two main Democratic Party super PACs working to elect congressional candidates, provided a curtained-off private space for VIPs to relax, eat, watch the convention and even play video games. Why video games? The private space was sponsored by the Entertainment Software Alliance, the lobbying arm of the gaming industry.Both House Majority PAC and Senate Majority PAC have also joined together with Priorities USA Action, the main pro-Clinton super PAC, to host the final party of the convention week, featuring a performance from Snoop Dogg. Two of the few disclosed donors for the festivities include the lobbying arm of the pharmaceutical industry and Anthem, Inc., a major health insurer.All of this stood in stark contrast to the refrain from inside the convention hall, where calls rang out from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and President Barack Obama to overturn Citizens United and fight back against the influence of lobbyists.There were other outside events throughout the week sponsored by corporations and trade associations. Railroad companies CSX and BNSF, Professional Aviation Specialists and the lobbying firm McGuireWoods Consulting sponsored a transportation industry event. NextGen Climate, Anheuser Busch, Geico and Southwest Airlines sponsored a Latino Leaders Lunch.A long list of corporations sponsored the popular Distilled Spirits Council party. (Who doesn’t like free alcohol?) The majority of the sponsors were not from the alcohol industry. They included the Entertainment Software Association, Ford, McGuireWoods Consulting, Boeing, Quicken Loans and Monsanto. The Wall Street Journal was also a sponsor.This was not the only overlap of the media and corporate influence.Twitter treated reporters to an entire bar of free food, booze, coffee and Wi-Fi for the duration of the convention. (The social media company did the same in Cleveland last week for the Republican National Convention.)Both Politico and The Atlantic hosted roundtable discussions sponsored by the American Petroleum Institute, the main oil industry lobby. Those speaking at some of these discussions explicitly endorsed the policies advocated by the oil industry.At one, former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, a Democrat who has worked for natural gas companies since leaving office, defended fracking by saying that wind energy has its downsides because it kills birds. At another, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (D) compared a ban on fracking to life in the Soviet Union.Even though the Obama team has banned lobbyist contributions at the presidential level for eight years, one government affairs representative for a Fortune 500 company told The Huffington Post he saw no real difference in terms of corporate or lobbyist activity between this week’s event and the last two conventions, which both nominated Obama.The continuity between the Clinton, Obama and corporate worlds was on display at events thrown by Airbnb and Uber. The two Silicon Valley companies released new presidential polling data and hosted an event to celebrate the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party.

North of Moscow, Russia.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579a066a2400002600b3397d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Some U.S. intelligence officials suspect that Russian hackers who broke into Democratic Party computers may have deliberately left digital fingerprints to show Moscow is a “cyberpower” that Washington should respect.Three officials, all speaking on condition of anonymity, said the breaches of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) were less sophisticated than other cyber intrusions that have been traced to Russian intelligence agencies or criminals.For example, said one official, the hackers used some Cyrillic characters, worked during Russian government business hours but not on Russian religious or political holidays.”Either these guys were incredibly sloppy, in which case it’s not clear that they could have gotten as far as they did without being detected, or they wanted us to know they were Russian,” said the official.Private sector cyber security experts agreed that the evidence clearly points to Russian hackers but dismissed the idea that they intentionally left evidence of their identities.These experts - who said they have examined the breach in detail - said the Cyrillic characters were buried in metadata and in an error message. Other giveaways, such as a tainted Internet protocol address, also were difficult to find.Russian hacking campaigns have traditionally been harder to track than China’s but not impossible to decipher, private sector experts said. But the Russians have become more aggressive and easier to detect in the past two years, security experts said, especially when they are trying to move quickly.False flags have grown more common, but the government and private experts do not believe that is involved in the DNC case.The two groups of hackers involved are adept at concealing their intrusions, said Laura Galante, head of global threat intelligence at FireEye, whose Mandiant subsidiary conducted forensic analysis of the attack and corroborated the findings of another cyber company, CrowdStrike.Russian officials have dismissed the allegations of Moscow’s involvement as absurd. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, in his only response to reporters, said: “I don’t want to use four-letter words.”EMBARRASSING EMAILSWhile private cyber experts and the government were aware of the political party’s hacking months ago, embarrassing emails were leaked last weekend by the WikiLeaks anti-secrecy group just as the Democratic Party prepared to anoint Hillary Clinton as its presidential candidate for the Nov. 8 election.DNC chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, resigned after the leaked emails showed party leaders favoring Clinton over her rival in the campaign for the nomination, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The committee is supposed to be neutral.The U.S. intelligence officials conceded that they had based their views on deductive reasoning and not conclusive evidence, but suggested Russia’s aim probably was much broader than simply undermining Clinton’s campaign.They said the hack fit a pattern of Russian President Vladimir Putin pushing back on what he sees as the United States and its European allies trying to weaken Russia.“Call it the cyber equivalent of buzzing NATO ships and planes using fighters with Russian flags on their tails,” said one official.Two sources familiar with Democratic Party investigations into the hacking said the private email accounts of Democratic Party officials were targeted as well as servers.They said that the FBI had advised the DNC that it was looking into the hacking of the individual officials’ private accounts. They also said the FBI also requested additional information identifying the personal email accounts of certain party officials.The DNC hired CrowdStrike to investigate the hack. It spent about six weeks, from late April to about June 11 or 12, monitoring the systems and watching while the hackers - who they believed were Russian - operated inside the systems, one of the sources said.What actions, if any, the Obama administration will take are unclear and could depend on what diplomatic considerations may ultimately be involved, a former White House cyber security official said.In past cases, administration officials have decided to publicly blame North Korea and indict members of China’s military for hacking because the administration decided that the net benefit of public shaming – and increased awareness brought to cyber security – outweighed potential risks, the former official said.But “the Russia calculation is far more difficult and precarious,” the former official said. “Russia is a much more aggressive, capable foreign actor both in the traditional military sense and in the cyber realm” and that made public attribution or covert retaliation much less likely.The former official, and a source familiar with the Democratic Party investigations, said that they also were unaware of any U.S. intelligence clearly demonstrating that WikiLeaks had received the hacked materials directly from Russians or that WikiLeaks’ release of the materials was in any way directed by Russians.(Reporting By John Walcott, Joseph Menn and Mark Hosenball; Additional reporting by Dustin Volz; Editing by David Rohde and Grant McCool)"

He graced the conservative subreddit “The_Donald,” where he is considered something of a hero. People on the forum call him “God Emperor” and “His Nimbleness,” and refer to each other as “centipedes,” apparently a reference to a YouTube video that blends footage of Trump with narration of what sounds like a nature show on insects. Trump appeared very excited for the event — “This is going to be SO HUGE,” he wrote on Facebook — but he showed up late, and appeared to have wi-fi problems. Once he got there, though, it wasn’t the type of wild spectacle people have come to expect from Trump. Unlike his free-wheeling press conference earlier on Wednesday, the AMA was full of canned talking points. (Sample answer: “I am never tired of winning, and as your president I will win for you, the American people. I’m with you!”) It was boring. He, or whoever was running his account, submitted 12 comments. One user asked five questions, but Trump ignored all but the first two. He gave brief answers ― voter fraud is “a serious concern”; NASA “is wonderful” ― and did not discuss WikiLeaks or net neutrality. On a forum renowned for its informal style and lack of political correctness, he answered no personal questions, except one, barely: Which U.S. president do you admire the most? (”There have been many amazing Presidents in American history, including George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan, all of whom I greatly admire.”)When President Barack Obama conducted his AMA in 2012, it was not a groundbreaking event. But Obama is also not the spotlight-hogging Donald. Obama answered 10 questions, about some of the main issues he was talking about in his campaign ― the economy, Obamacare, taxes ― but he also addressed balancing work and family life, his thoughts on the White House beer recipe, and his favorite basketball player (Michael Jordan). Most questions Trump answered came from regular Reddit users who did not have obvious ties to white supremacists, a step up from Trump’s Twitter retweet list. He answered a question from Breitbart’s Milo Yiannopoulos, who was recently permanently suspended from Twitter after he encouraged people to harass Ghostbusters star Leslie Jones. (He denied responsibility.) The moderators attempted to weed out “troublemakers” who might give the AMA bad press by removing comments from trolls, inactive users and new accounts. “We built the wall 10 ft taller, you might say,” a user wrote. (”Quick! Everybody act normal! There are 80 genders and Islam is a race!” said another.) The ad-hoc fan club has reportedly been plagued by recent infighting, with leaders kicking out a moderator, “CisWhiteMaelstrom,” because he allegedly planned to coordinate with white nationalists. The AMA came together, according to NBC News, in part because one of the moderators reached out to Trump’s digital director. Trump now joins a list of AMA guests on the sub-reddit that includes Yiannopoulos, GotNews’ Chuck Johnson and InfoWars’ Alex Jones. Here are all of the revelations from his AMA:Answer 1: He thinks voter fraud is bad and NASA is good.Answer 2: He thinks the media is biased.Answer 3: He thinks Hillary Clinton is bad.Answer 4: He thinks the immigration system is also bad.Answer 5: He wants to get rid of Obamacare.Answer 6: Did we mention he hates Hillary Clinton? Answer 7: He supports police.Answer 8: He likes George Washington and Ronald Reagan. Answer 9: He wants to win Bernie Sanders supporters.  Answer 10: He is not tired of winning. Answer 11: He will improve the economy.Answer 12: He will make America great again.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."
20,POLITICS,Gavin Newsom Explains Why Lawmakers Shouldn't Be Neutral On Marijuana Legalization,Mollie Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gavin-newsom-marijuana-dnc_us_579a280ee4b01180b5320d2c,California's lieutenant governor fully supports legalizing recreational pot.,2016-07-28,"Gavin Newsom, lieutenant governor of California, speaks during the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 27, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579a283b1200008104a53fbf.jpeg?cache=OlVD2iewzU&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PHILADELPHIA ― Gavin Newsom is a little tired of being the only state official in California to fully endorse legalizing recreational marijuana. Speaking with The Huffington Post at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday, the lieutenant governor said it’s time for others to take a stand on the issue, which will appear on California’s ballot this fall. “What we’re doing to criminalize the drug is not working,” he said. “And the drug is ubiquitous. Every young person would say it’s easier to get marijuana than it is alcohol.” He pointed out that while many lawmakers have condemned the so-called War on Drugs as an “abject failure,” far fewer have given full-throated endorsements for legalizing the substance. California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) has said he’s not totally sold on the idea. California Attorney General Kamala Harris (D), who is running for Senate, has declined to take a stance on the state ballot measure, but says she believes legalization is inevitable. Outgoing Sen. Barbara Boxer (D) has said she may support legalization but hasn’t yet, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D) is opposed.“How do you justify the current conditions?” Newsom asked. “For me, you can’t be neutral here. This is a social justice issue. It’s an economic justice issue. It’s a racial justice issue. People need to step up, either come out vehemently against it with a better alternative, explain away the status quo because you’re complicit in it ― society becomes how we behave ― or come on board.” The benefits to legalization, Newsom argued, are manifold: reducing the influence of drug cartels, creating stronger regulations to prevent underage kids from easily buying weed, mitigating the harmful effects of prohibition on communities of color. “The war on drugs cannot persist without the war on marijuana,” he said.He added that “you don’t have to be pro-marijuana to be anti-prohibition,” noting that his wife, filmmaker Jennifer Siebel Newsom, opposes legalization.“I do think there are absolute legitimate concerns about the use and abuse of marijuana and cannabis for young folks, despite some of the medical benefits, and as a parent I’m not here celebrating [drug abuse] or promoting it,” he said.Twenty-five states have legalized medical marijuana — including California — but only four of those states and Washington D.C. also allow recreational pot. California’s legalization measure, which qualified for the ballot in June, would allow people 21 years of age and older to possess, use and transport up to an ounce of pot for recreational use, and grow as many as six cannabis plants for personal use. A poll by the Public Policy Institute of California found 60 percent of voters are in favor of the measure. Earlier this week, Democrats approved a party platform that, for the first time, includes a pathway to legalizing recreational marijuana. While the platform has little, if any, bearing on actual policy, it’s a symbolic victory for legalization advocates. Newsom, who is running for California governor in 2018, said he hopes the platform plank will give other policymakers a nudge. “I want it to influence one other statewide official to have my back here,” he said. “[I’m] still waiting. I say that lovingly.” "

Trump, 70, has proposed deeply controversial measures such as temporarily banning Muslims from entering the country and building a wall on the Mexico border to stop illegal immigrants.“I hope my headline (from the speech) is that the president of the United States is profoundly optimistic about America’s future and is 100 percent convinced that Hillary Clinton can be a great president,” Obama said in an interview with NBC News that aired on Wednesday.His remarks will follow his wife Michelle Obama’s opening night speech to the gathering on Monday, which was a rousing success with delegates. “I’m not going to hit that bar, so let me concede top speech-making already to my wife, but I couldn’t have been prouder of her,” Obama said.Obama “has been candid about why he thinks electing the Republican nominee is a risky path for the United States,” White House spokesman Eric Schultz said on Tuesday.But Obama’s speech will focus more “on how Secretary Clinton has the judgment, the toughness and the intellect to succeed him in the Oval Office,” Schultz said.The Clinton campaign portrays Trump, a former reality TV star whose campaign style has been freewheeling and whose remarks have been peppered with insults, as temperamentally unfit for the White House.The convention aimed to reinforce this message on Wednesday. Events would seek to contrast Clinton’s approach to national security with Trump’s “unsteady, unfit and dangerous approach,” said Clinton campaign chair John Podesta.Trump has accused Obama and Clinton of being far too weak on the threat posed by Islamist militants such as Islamic State.“There is no more urgent priority to (Clinton) than making sure that the threat of radical jihadist terrorism (...) is stopped,” Clinton foreign policy adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters, adding that speakers would seek to highlight Clinton’s foreign policy experience.“Donald Trump has disrespected our military, and I think that will shine through tonight,” Sullivan said.Obama, who beat Clinton in the 2008 campaign for the Democratic nomination, will be speaking 12 years to the day since he gave a keynote address as a U.S. senator to the Democratic convention in 2004, which effectively launched him on the national stage.Clinton waged another hard-fought primary battle this year, beating off an unexpectedly strong challenge from the left by Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont."

I’m sure Sting’s not cool to his kids.”Back when his daughter was a teen, Leary saw his chance to score some “cool points” when he was hosting a Fashion Rocks benefit where Beyoncé would be performing. “I looked at it and went, this is my chance — she was a teenager then — to get big cool points,” he said. “I go, ‘Hey, why don’t you get a bunch of girlfriends from school and bring them to the show? You know, I’m hosting. I’ll get backstage tickets and I’ll introduce you guys to Beyoncé after the show.”When the benefit ended, Leary brought his daughter and her friends to Beyoncé’s dressing room to be introduced, and it all went downhill from there.“Beyoncé comes out of the dressing room, and I go, ‘Beyoncé, you were great tonight,” said Leary. “She goes, ‘So were you, Bryan.’ She thought I was Bryan Adams!”Instead of correcting her, however, Leary just rolled with it.“Meanwhile, I go, ‘Thanks, Beyoncé! See ya later,’” Leary said. “So the girls are like, ‘Dad, she thinks you’re Bryan Adams.’ I’m like, ‘Listen, if she thinks I’m Ellen DeGeneres, I’m Ellen DeGeneres. It’s Beyoncé.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) about how he can assist their candidates in recapturing the Senate in 2016. “We’re working with him to see how he can help, where he can be helpful,” DSCC Political Director Christie Roberts told reporters.Sanders has already jumped into the Wisconsin Senate race on behalf of Russ Feingold, another populist progressive hero. Former DSCC Political Director Martha McKenna said she’d like to see him help not only with fundraising ― since Sanders has been a powerhouse with small-dollar donors during the primary ― but also with getting out a progressive economic message that will help Senate candidates. “Anywhere where we’re going to be talking about standing up for middle-class economic values and sort of fighting back against big money in politics and Republicans who are part of that problem, who take a lot of corporate money ... I think Bernie is really good about bringing those issues to light,” McKenna said. Roberts also said President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden will be a frequent presence on the campaign trail ― a contrast to the 2014 cycle, when Democratic candidates were often trying to show voters how they were different from the administration. This time, however, will be different. Obama’s approval rating has been steadily rising, and during the primaries, Sanders and Hillary Clinton were often trying to show how much they supported the president. “Month after month, his numbers continue to go up,” former DSCC Deputy Executive Director Matt Canter said. “He is just potentially at the most popular point in his presidency, and I think he’s going to be an incredible asset to Democrats in these big battleground races.”Roberts said the map is looking up for Democrats as well ― particularly in Indiana, Wisconsin and Colorado. In Indiana, former Blue Dog Sen. Evan Bayh jumped into the race for his former seat, significantly boosting Democrats’ chances at winning there. In Wisconsin last week, the Koch-backed Freedom Partners Action Fund, which had previously reserved $2.2 million in airtime for Sen. Ron Johnson (R), pulled its ad buy completely. Johnson has been trailing Feingold, his Democratic opponent, throughout the race.And in Colorado, conservative candidate Darryl Glenn ― a grassroots favorite ― defeated the establishment-backed candidate in the primary, worrying Republicans who believed Sen. Michael Bennet (D) could be defeated. The National Republican Senatorial Committee said officials have met with Glenn, but it has not yet indicated whether it will invest resources in the race. NRSC Executive Director Ward Baker recently told reporters he believes Republicans still have “a great opportunity to beat” Bennet. Republicans had their own bit of good news recently, when Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) announced he would be running for re-election ― after previously talking about how much he disliked the Senate and wanted to leave. “Republicans will keep the Senate majority,” NRSC spokeswoman Alleigh Marre said, pointing to polling in Ohio and Pennsylvania showing Democratic candidates struggling. And then, of course, there is the Donald Trump factor. GOP Senate candidates have already had to answer for every controversial utterance that comes out of the mouth of their party’s presidential nominee. Trump has also failed to build a national campaign of the size and scale that most presidential candidates possess, leaving the party to pick up the slack. And Democrats believe that could be a huge advantage for them.“Campaign organization and mechanics matter, especially in an election where there might be lower enthusiasm with Republican voters who don’t want to come out and vote,” Roberts said. “It’s a huge expensive robust undertaking for a Republican Senate candidate to have to set up his own field operation to turn out the vote himself. On the Democratic side ... it will be a true coordinated campaign.”"

And thus Bill Clinton became the first man (and potential First Gentleman) to give a speech at a major party convention pitching his wife as our next president. For 43 minutes, Bill told the story of how he met and has loved and worked alongside Hillary over the last 45 years. “In the spring of 1971, I met a girl,” he began, going on to talk about Hillary’s life as a student, daughter, organizer, attorney, wife, first lady, mother, senator, secretary of state and presidential nominee. And what was so fantastic about it is that he framed these roles as seamless, all significant parts of Hillary’s life story. All significant parts of what make her her.It was by no means a perfect speech. There were parts that dragged or felt a little too primed for some sort of sexualized joke about his past, and Bill went off-teleprompter with a particularly misguided line that seemed to imply that black Americans were responsible for making police officers feel safe. (Say what?) But the parts of the speech that resonated most were the parts that encouraged Americans to confront the sheer breadth of Hillary Clinton’s resume ― and the human woman behind that list of accomplishments.He spoke about a young, politically engaged Hillary who would hardly give him the time of day ― a Hillary that he “found magnetic” from the first moments he met her. And part of that magnetism was her drive to get shit done.Bill touched on Hillary’s internship going into migrant camps for then Sen. Walter Mondale’s subcommittee, how she “started the first legal aid clinic in northwest Arkansas,” her work on reforming the Arkansas education system, her work trying to reform health care, her seminal speech declaring “women’s rights are human rights” in Beijing, her time serving on the Armed Services Committee, the time she spent as secretary of state on negotiations with China and India to get them to officially commit to reduce their emissions... the list goes on.And he effectively communicated that all of these things were done by a human woman, not a Hillarybot. This is a woman who was in the Situation Room with Obama during the mission to take out Osama bin Laden and moved her daughter into a dorm room at Stanford. A woman who “built a new global counterterrorism effort” and “calls you when you’re sick or when your kid’s in trouble.”Women ― especially women in the public eye ― have long been painted with broad strokes. Political wives are expected to stand by their men, look pretty, be unobjectionable and unconditionally supportive, a role Hillary always struggled to fill (likely because it’s kind of a bullshit one). She was criticized for keeping her last name, for saying she didn’t want to “stay home and bake cookies,” for wearing scrunchies, for her husband’s sexual indiscretions and for her changing hairstyles. But last night, it was Hillary’s professional achievements that got to take center stage ― framed as a major part of what makes her appealing, both as a partner and as a future president. Bill’s speech was long ― mostly because Hillary’s done a lot. Regardless of whether you like her or not, there is no denying that she has done a hell of a lot of work for this country. She’s a doer, a “change maker,” someone who opened the 42nd President of the United States’ eyes “to a whole new world of public service by private citizens.”And that’s the pitch Bill made, calling out that Hillary “has done more positive change-making before she was 30 than many public officials do in a lifetime in office.” The beauty of Bill weaving together schmaltzy personal anecdotes with Hillary’s resume bullet points is that one of her weaknesses has been her reticence to speak about herself. (As New York Magazine’s Rebecca Traister put it in a May profile: “The dichotomy between [Hillary’s] public and private presentation has a lot to do with the fact that she has built such a wall between the two.”)Hillary is notoriously cautious about telling her story. She just doesn’t love talking about herself, a trait Donald Trump certainly does not share. But last night, Hillary’s partner in life and politics did the talking about her for her, and did so effectively.“If you believe in making change from the bottom up, if you believe the measure of change is how many people’s lives are better, you know it’s hard, and some people think it’s boring,” said Bill. “Speeches like this are fun. Actually doing the work is hard.”The implication is that as president Hillary is more prepared than anyone to do that hard work. Bill may be charming, and he may know how to give those “fun” speeches, but last night he showed that he’s prepared to use that charm in the role of supporter, to step to the side and let his wife show off her hard-earned chops. For a man who was once a beloved President of the United States, it’s a poignant role reversal. It’s finally, at long last, Hillary’s turn in the spotlight, and #HesWithHer.
