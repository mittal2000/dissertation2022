Chris Christie suggested it was frivolous to talk about daily fantasy sports while there are terrorists in the world.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56324f8b1400002b003c9782.jpeg?ops=crop_55_14_3551_2209%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie earned cheers from the crowd at Wednesday night's Republican presidential debate when he slammed CNBC moderator Carl Quintanilla for a question about daily fantasy sports.Toward the end of the two-hour debate, Quintanilla asked former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush whether he thought the federal government should have a role in regulating the rapidly growing industry that, thanks to an advertising blitz and a scandal that erupted earlier this month, has drawn scrutiny from sports fans, media, members of Congress, and federal and state regulators alike.Bush answered earnestly, saying that ""this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation"" and that daily fantasy sports is currently akin to ""day trading without any regulation at all.""That's when Christie interjected.""We have -- wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt. We have people out of work. We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us. And we're talking about fantasy football? Can we stop?"" Christie said. ""How about this? How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people and support American values and American families. Enough on fantasy football. Let people play, who cares?""Christie wasn't the only one unhappy with that line of questioning. But despite his apparent incredulity, the reality about daily fantasy sports is that unresolved questions about the industry matter to millions of Americans. And those questions could fall squarely under the purview of Congress, federal regulators and potentially the next president.The scandal blew up when an employee of DraftKings, the largest daily fantasy site, inadvertently released proprietary information about daily fantasy contests in early October and then won $350,000 in a paid fantasy contest on a rival site the same weekend. Major concerns were raised about consumer protections, internal data controls, and fraud and negligence within the industry. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman launched an investigation. Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) and other members of Congress intensified previous calls for hearings into daily fantasy sports. Pallone and Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) also urged the Federal Trade Commission to examine the companies' practices.But the most pressing question about daily fantasy sports remains its legality under federal law. In 2006, Congress passed legislation that banned most forms of online gambling, but included a carve-out for fantasy sports in general -- essentially on the grounds that they are ""games of skill.""A former NFL lobbyist who became a White House official in the George W. Bush administration may have played a role in creating that carve-out. It has allowed the industry to grow, largely through partnerships with major sports leagues and media companies like ESPN. The realm of paid fantasy in particular has expanded dramatically -- DraftKings and FanDuel are both worth roughly $1 billion. The legal landscape for paid fantasy, however, is murky. State regulators in Nevada have ruled that the daily fantasy industry constitutes gambling, meaning operators of such sites need a license. A federal grand jury in Florida is investigating the companies to see if they have violated state and federal gambling laws. Attorneys general in other states are looking at the industry’s legal status, too. And two weeks ago, the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI launched an investigation to determine whether daily fantasy operators have violated federal anti-gambling laws.Christie, of all the presidential candidates, is closest to the issue. The question of whether daily fantasy sports is or isn't gambling has placed discussion of the industry within a broader debate over the legality of wagering on sports, and Christie has spent his time as governor on the front lines of that controversy.In 2014, he signed legislation that legalized sports gambling in New Jersey. There was only one problem: Under the federal Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992, sports wagering is illegal in all but four states. New Jersey isn't one of them, but it proceeded anyway -- a move that landed it in a legal battle with all four major sports leagues and the NCAA. (Though the state lost its most recent appeal, the federal circuit court has decided to rehear the case.)The odd legal split between traditional sports gambling and paid fantasy sports is the major reason why Pallone and other New Jersey lawmakers have sought hearings in Congress. They don't want daily fantasy sports banned; they have questions about why it's legal when traditional sports wagering isn't.Meanwhile, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has called for congressional re-evaluation of the 1992 law and wants sports gambling -- a multibillion-dollar industry that exists largely in the shadows -- legalized and regulated. Given their relationships with DraftKings and FanDuel, the major leagues and millions of their fans also have a stake in how states and the federal government decide to proceed on paid fantasy.Christie's call to ""let people play"" isn't necessarily inconsistent with New Jersey's court battle. He wants legal sports gambling in his state; perhaps he also believes that daily fantasy should be legal and governed on a state-by-state basis.But the reality is that federal law has helped create daily fantasy sports, and the federal government may have a future role in regulating that industry and protecting its millions of customers from potential fraud, negligence and abuse. While Christie might not view fantasy sports or gambling as a topic that rises to the level of a presidential debate, the next Oval Office occupant might not be able to simply brush it off.Also on HuffPost:"

Marco Rubio (R-Fla) as the Republicans' Barack Obama: a young senator with a few years of service, an inspiring life story, and an itch for higher office.Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) sees in Rubio echoes of a different Democrat.“He reminds me of John Edwards,” Reid said, referring to the former senator from North Carolina who flamed out in his run for president. “Not because any of the [personal] stuff.""""John Edwards, when he came to the Senate, man, he was good,"" Reid said. ""He had been called by either [Al] Gore or his people that he was going to be the nominee, or at least that's what he thought, OK? And he called me and told me that. When Gore chose [Joseph] Lieberman, [Edwards] was so fixed on becoming a national figure that his Senate service was basically over. That’s what I see in Marco Rubio.”In an interview in his office on Thursday, Reid talked at length about a 2016 Republican primary that is finally being shaped by the current and former lawmakers in the field. He had actual kind words to say about his Senate colleague Ted Cruz (R-Texas), a man who, not even two years ago, he called “a laughing stock to everybody but him.”“People want me to dislike Ted Cruz,” Reid said this time around. “I can't dislike him. I know some people do. I know President Bush said he didn't like him. I kind of like the guy. I don't like what he's done in the Senate but I've never ever underestimated this man.”When the topic turned to Jeb Bush, the candidate who Democrats once thought was the surest bet to emerge from a crowded Republican field, Reid seemed almost sympathetic over his plight. He said he had been flipping channels on Wednesday night, alternating between the second game of the World Series and the Republican presidential debate. Told that Rubio had cleaned Bush’s clock in an exchange over Rubio’s poor Senate attendance record, Reid replied, briskly: “I don't think you've got much of a clock to clean there … having Marco Rubio clean Jeb Bush's clock would be like having Greg Maddux pitch to a bunch of high school kids.”“I don't know much about him,” Reid said of Jeb. “I worked with his dad and with his brother. His dad was not a great speaker. He just was such a nice man -- everybody really cared a lot about his father. George Bush the second was a pretty good debater. He was OK, he had a lot of energy in his debates. I don't know Jeb Bush but boy, he needs a shot of adrenaline or something. I mean, gee whiz.” Of all the candidates whom Reid addressed, though, none seemed to pique his interest and ire quite like Rubio. The Florida Republican is the ascendant candidate in the race, having turned in several strong debate performances and maintained a steady, albeit small, amount of support in the polls. But he has continued to be dogged by his spotty attendance record.Reid said Thursday that Rubio should resign from the Senate if he felt his duties there were insignificant compared to a presidential campaign.“If he thinks his job is such a nothing job, let Florida send somebody here that works with [Sen.] Bill Nelson, who is a substantive senator,” he said. “Bill Nelson finds a lot to do to help Florida. So I don't accept that.”Reid dismissed Rubio's contention that his absenteeism was no worse than that of past senators who have run for president.“I've never heard John McCain say he didn't like the job. How could he compare himself to John McCain? John McCain is one of the certified American heroes of our time,"" Reid said. ""John Kerry, same damn thing. Barack Obama, African-American running for president -- if he thinks he can compare himself to those three, more power to him, cause he can't walk in their shoes. Make sure you got me there. To think he could compare himself to those three men is ludicrous.” Rubio’s campaign and Senate office did not immediately return requests for comment."

Lichtblau, who was most recently covering 2016 campaign finance issues, drew the ire of the Bush administration early on for his reporting, leading to his Justice Department press credentials being temporarily revoked in 2003. Tensions only increased after The Times published Lichtblau and James Risen's 2005 report on NSA surveillance, a story the paper initially held for 13 months under pressure from the White House. Lichtblau told The Huffington Post that the Bush administration aggressively investigated the NSA leak and there were vague threats of subpoena in 2006 and 2007. But it wasn't until Dec. 16, 2008 -- after President Barack Obama won the presidential election but before the Bush administration left off -- that Lichtblau received a letter threatening a subpoena if he didn't provide the source information by Inauguration Day a month later. He did not comply. Still, the threat didn't go away when Obama took office, and in early 2009, Lichtblau and Times editors decided it was best he leave the beat.""We made the decision that it was a weird situation to be covering this department that was actively investigating the NSA leaks and threatening to subpoena us,"" he recalled. Lichtblau, who never was subpoenaed in the end, said he's looking forward to covering the Justice Department and issues such as civil rights, guns and criminal justice reform. He also expects to work on investigative projects with reporters Michael Schmidt and Matt Apuzzo. In a Thursday memo obtained by HuffPost, The Times announced that Apuzzo, who has been covering the Justice Department, will become ""an investigative and enterprise reporter on national security, criminal justice and other issues."" Apuzzo, also a Pulitzer Prize winner, joined The Times in 2013 from The Associated Press, where his reporting prompted three separate leak investigations.And The Times also announced Thursday that Matt Rosenberg, who was notably expelled from Afghanistan last year, will cover the Pentagon full time with Helene Cooper. The Times memo from Washington bureau chief Elisabeth Bumiller and Washington editor Bill Hamilton is below: We're pleased to announce some changes in beats in the Washington Bureau.  Matt Apuzzo, our Justice Department reporter, will do more of what he does best and become an investigative and enterprise reporter on national security, criminal justice and other issues. Matt, who came to The Times in 2014 from the investigative team at the Associated Press, won a Pulitzer in investigative reporting at the AP for exposing the NYPD's surveillance of Muslims. He has also won a Polk, a Goldsmith and a White House Correspondents Association Award, among others.  Eric Lichtblau, who has covered campaign finance for the politics team, will become our Justice Department reporter. Eric has been in the Washington bureau since 2002, covering the Justice Department, national security, lobbying and other issues. He and Jim Risen won the Pulitzer in 2006 for their stories on President Bush’s secret NSA wiretapping program."
5,POLITICS,Eliot Spitzer Says Hillary Clinton's 2008 Camp Urged Him Not To Give Driver's Licenses To Undocumented Immigrants,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/eliot-spitzer-hillary-clinton-drivers-licenses-undocumented_us_56325e1be4b00aa54a4d3864,"But the pressure didn't only come from Clinton, he added.",2015-10-29,Then-Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.) opposed the state's Democratic Gov. Eliot Spitzer on driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants in 2007.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/563260b914000093013c979d.jpeg?cache=KW5YXlOCJC&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- When former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer (D) withdrew his plan to give driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants in 2007, it was partially at the urging of then- (and current) presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, the former governor said in an podcast interview posted Thursday. While Clinton now supports driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants, she flailed on the issue during her 2008 presidential bid. Eventually, the Democrat came down against Spitzer's proposed measure to provide licenses to the undocumented.But Clinton went further than opposing the plan, Spitzer revealed on ""The Axe Files,"" a podcast hosted by David Axelrod, a former adviser to President Barack Obama (who went on to defeat Clinton in 2008). In fact, the campaign asked Spitzer to drop the proposal altogether. Spitzer told Axelrod he yielded to that request, although heavy opposition from elsewhere also played a role.""We heard from folks [on Clinton's campaign] who said they want this issue gone,"" Spitzer said. ""I thought the issue was a metaphor for her vacillation.""Earlier in 2007, Clinton, then a senator from New York, said that Spitzer's plan made ""a lot of sense."" During a Democratic primary debate in October of that year, though, she walked the statement back, saying ""I did not say that it should be done, but I certainly recognize why Gov. Spitzer is trying to do it.""Her debate opponents hammered her for hedging, and Obama said unequivocally that he supported driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants. Spitzer said he was ""pacing around the living room"" watching that debate and that Clinton ""waffled and waffled and waffled.”""Because it was controversial, she hemmed and she hawed,"" he said on the podcast. ""And again, this goes to the core of, where are you on immigrants' rights?"" He ended up dropping the plan the next month, based on opposition from the Clinton camp and elsewhere.""You know, it’s something I’m ashamed of,"" Spitzer told Axelrod. ""We pulled the proposal. Now, I don’t want to suggest we pulled it exclusively because of that. If you were to go back and look at the newspapers at the time, I had virtually no support in New York state. No elected official statewide would stand with me. It was a tough proposal. People were spitting at me in the streets. And I’m embarrassed to say after three weeks of fighting valiantly, I said, I’m not going to sacrifice my entire agenda to this.""Two-thirds of New York voters opposed Spitzer's proposal, and his approval rating fell after he announced it, according to a Siena College survey.After Spitzer withdrew the plan, Clinton clarified her stance, saying the governor had made the right decision. ""As president, I will not support driver's licenses for undocumented people and will press for comprehensive immigration reform that deals with all of the issues around illegal immigration including border security and fixing our broken system,"" she said in a statement in November 2007. Clinton came around earlier this year. In April, a spokesperson for her campaign told The Huffington Post that the candidate ""supports state policies to provide driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants.""A spokeswoman for Clinton told HuffPost on Thursday that ""the immigration landscape of 2015 is far different from the immigration landscape of 2007, so of course the policy responses are different.""""In 2007, we didn't have an executive action that would focus our resources on deporting felons, not families, allowing millions of undocumented immigrants to remain in the United States,"" she added. ""In the last eight years, states have increasingly been moving in this direction with positive results. Hillary supports those state efforts. As she said in 2007, she believes the long-term solution is comprehensive immigration reform, but given Republican obstruction, we can no longer wait for that.""Spitzer said he is supporting former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley for the Democratic nomination. O'Malley expanded access to driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants during his time as governor -- and has pointed out that he arrived at that position before Clinton did.Also on HuffPost:"

""To my knowledge, this is the first study that looks at this pattern across the globe, and over time. We have a new understanding of the role of animals in enhancing and maintaining primary productivity, through movements within and across marine and terrestrial ecosystems.""For the study, an international team of researchers developed math models based on historical data, heat diffusion and current animal populations to quantify the movement of nutrients -- including a key nutrient for plant fertilization called phosphorus -- across various ecosystems.The researchers then used the models to estimate how the nutrient cycle may have changed from prehistory to now. They took a close look at the influence that big animals known as megafauna had on the cycle.""We used the math model to predict the behavior of the extinct megafauna,"" Dr. Chris Doughty, a lecturer in ecosystem ecology at the University of Oxford and lead author of the study, told The Huffington Post. ""We know little about these animals beyond their size, but with size we can predict food consumption and movement patterns. With this model, we can put all the original animals back into our world and see how nutrient cycling changed.""The researchers found that the nutrients released and transported by megafauna on land and in the oceans has dropped to just 6 percent of their levels tens of thousands of years ago, according to The Christian Science Monitor, before mass extinctions and population declines. Examining marine mammals alone, the researchers found that the phosphorus released and transported by whales and others has dropped by 77 percent. In fact, whales -- which feed deep in the sea and come up to breathe at the surface -- once brought an estimated 750 million pounds of phosphorus up from the ocean each year. This number has now plunged to 165 million pounds.And the movement of phosphorus from the sea to land by seabirds and fish has gone down 96 percent, Live Science reported. Just check out the diagram above.""There was once a natural system of recycling phosphorus between the oceans and land that no longer exists,"" Doughty said. ""This means, without these animals more phosphorus is lost more quickly to the bottom of the oceans. Easily accessible, mined phosphorus may run out in as little as 50 years."" A decline in phosphorus could negatively impact the growth of algae, which would disrupt both ocean and land ecosystems.The researchers pointed to hunting, overfishing and habitat loss as the causes of drastic declines in animal populations, which has resulted in a shortage of nutrient-rich poop. For instance, whale populations are estimated to have declined by up to 90 percent over the last three centuries due to whaling, the researchers said.While all animals are ""distribution pumps"" for key nutrients on a global scale, the megafauna are a critical part of the nutrient cycle, the researchers concluded.""I was surprised that large animals were disproportionately important for the transport of nutrients,"" Doughty said. ""Here we have shown that, in the past, animals constituted a global system of recycling phosphorus. By increasing populations of large, free-ranging animals we can partially replace this system of recycling and thus increase phosphorus concentrations on land.""Roman agreed that the study holds clues to how restoring large animal populations could revive an ancient nutrient cycle, which would benefit wild ecosystems and us.""Our study opened up a new vision for the planet,"" he said. ""In a sense, it provides a blueprint for ecological restoration: helping marine mammals recover, returning the natural flow of rivers, reducing overfishing, and giving large areas of land back to wild animals.""Also on HuffPost Science:"

""We know little about these animals beyond their size, but with size we can predict food consumption and movement patterns. With this model, we can put all the original animals back into our world and see how nutrient cycling changed.""The researchers found that the nutrients released and transported by megafauna on land and in the oceans has dropped to just 6 percent of their levels tens of thousands of years ago, according to The Christian Science Monitor, before mass extinctions and population declines. Examining marine mammals alone, the researchers found that the phosphorus released and transported by whales and others has dropped by 77 percent. In fact, whales -- which feed deep in the sea and come up to breathe at the surface -- once brought an estimated 750 million pounds of phosphorus up from the ocean each year. This number has now plunged to 165 million pounds.And the movement of phosphorus from the sea to land by seabirds and fish has gone down 96 percent, Live Science reported. Just check out the diagram above.""There was once a natural system of recycling phosphorus between the oceans and land that no longer exists,"" Doughty said. ""This means, without these animals more phosphorus is lost more quickly to the bottom of the oceans. Easily accessible, mined phosphorus may run out in as little as 50 years."" A decline in phosphorus could negatively impact the growth of algae, which would disrupt both ocean and land ecosystems.The researchers pointed to hunting, overfishing and habitat loss as the causes of drastic declines in animal populations, which has resulted in a shortage of nutrient-rich poop. For instance, whale populations are estimated to have declined by up to 90 percent over the last three centuries due to whaling, the researchers said.While all animals are ""distribution pumps"" for key nutrients on a global scale, the megafauna are a critical part of the nutrient cycle, the researchers concluded.""I was surprised that large animals were disproportionately important for the transport of nutrients,"" Doughty said. ""Here we have shown that, in the past, animals constituted a global system of recycling phosphorus. By increasing populations of large, free-ranging animals we can partially replace this system of recycling and thus increase phosphorus concentrations on land.""Roman agreed that the study holds clues to how restoring large animal populations could revive an ancient nutrient cycle, which would benefit wild ecosystems and us.""Our study opened up a new vision for the planet,"" he said. ""In a sense, it provides a blueprint for ecological restoration: helping marine mammals recover, returning the natural flow of rivers, reducing overfishing, and giving large areas of land back to wild animals.""Also on HuffPost Science:"

Zion AME Church July 1, 2015, in Greeleyville, South Carolina.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56290516140000e800c7a8fc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"In the 10 days following the June massacre of nine people at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, six other predominantly black churches across the South burned. The causes of the fires differed. Electrical wiring is believed to have started one of the blazes. Lightning is thought to have struck the Mt. Zion AME Baptist Church in Greeleyville, South Carolina (which in 1995 was set on fire by two members of the Ku Klux Klan). Arson is to blame for the burning of at least two of the churches. And authorities have labeled another fire as ""suspicious."" All six fires are under federal investigation, but regardless of what those investigations conclude, a burning black church in the U.S. will always carry associations of all-American terror.There was the 1822 burning of the same AME church in Charleston by white residents after a slave revolt. The mob of 300 white people in Cincinnati who burned dozens of black homes, churches and businesses in 1829. The 14-year period, from 1954 to 1968, when almost every week an American black church was bombed. The 39 black churches set on fire by arsonists in 1995 and 1996, and the four black churches in Mississippi and Alabama set aflame on a single day in 2006. In August, Scott Carrier, a Peabody Award-winning former NPR producer and ""This American Life"" alum, made a request of the listeners of his popular podcast ""Home of the Brave."" He'd noticed how quickly the burned churches in the South had fallen out of the news cycle, and he wanted to visit the cities where the fires had happened and interview the residents and congregants there about race and religion -- but he needed the funds to do so. Over $5,000 in donations flooded in from ""all over the English-speaking world,"" Carrier said, so he hopped in his car with his dog Augi -- half border collie, half Bernese mountain dog -- and drove east from his home in Salt Lake City.What Carrier found in the South surprised him. Amid horrible tragedy and the ever-present specter of racial terror, he said, he witnessed awe-inspiring spirituality and resilience.“You can burn the church down, but God still stands,"" one woman in Macon, Georgia, sitting on her front porch, told Carrier in a thick Southern drawl, as heard on a subsequent episode of ""Home of the Brave.""“If you got God in you, you can’t burn down the spirit,"" another woman told him.The Huffington Post spoke with Carrier in late September about his trip. Since our conversation, another five predominantly black churches in the St. Louis area have burned. You can listen to the four-part ""Home of the Brave"" episode ""A Tour of Burned Churches"" here. What inspired you to take this trip? It was something that no one was really covering -- like people were covering it from a distance, but nobody was talking to people in the neighborhoods or in the congregations. The story about the fire in Warrenville [South Carolina] on NPR was three minutes, and less than half was spent talking to people there. I wanted to know what it’s like to live in a neighborhood where the church burns down, and be a member of the church where your building’s burned down. So I went there...The older I get and the more I go cover things -- things that are also covered by the media, the mainstream media, they just often -- it’s really poor coverage, especially when I was doing stories on the Occupy movement. I read and watched the reports. The media is the spokesman for the 1 percent. I just didn’t realize that in the same way. More and more, I think the media tells the story we want to hear. They’re not really concerned with what’s in front of their face, talking to people. The story that’s produced is the story people want to hear, because that’s where the money is.I thought maybe -- I don’t know -- but I thought media wasn’t doing better coverage of these church burnings because they didn’t want to go into these neighborhoods. They didn’t want to take their cameras out. But to me, burning a church, intentionally burning a black church, is terrorism. That’s an act of terrorism. I don’t know what [the] difference is from other things we call terrorism. So it’s serious, a serious thing ... And I didn’t think the media was doing a very good job, so I decided to go there and see for myself. What surprised you the most on your trip? What weren’t you expecting?Well, I didn’t expect that the members of the churches would basically -- that I’d get the same answer over and over, almost like a sermon. The same points, but also delivered with a very emotional... very soulful answer to my questions about nonviolence -- not responding with hate or fear, but fighting with love. And maybe I should have known that, because that’s what the people in the church there [in Charleston] did.It’s this black prophetic tradition that Cornel West wrote about recently, which I didn’t know about, which I should have known about. As more and more people started giving me the same answer over and over -- ""No, I’m not going to be afraid"" -- I started realizing that they’d been living this. It’s different than the Christian tradition of the holy war, where Christian soldiers were like, ""God wants us to go kill these people and defend our land and kill these other people, who are evil."" That’s a Christian tradition. That’s the apocalyptic tradition with the end of the world: The holy war is coming and bad people are gonna be cursed and go to hell and the good people are going to be raptured up. That’s more of a Christian tradition I’m used to.I’d forgotten about the other Christian tradition of nonviolence, of compassion and love in the face of violence. It was like going to school and being taught, being shown it -- not being told it, but actually being shown it, because these people are living it every day, and have been for generations.I tell ya, talking to these guys, it’s a very emotional experience, because they’ve lost so much, and yet they’re able to respond in the best way. I wish that was more part of our culture, the culture of the United States. I think we’d be better off, [in a] better situation now. Especially if you think of how we reacted after 9/11. If we had not struck back militarily, with violence or force, the world would be in such a better situation today. But it never came up, really. People never really thought that at the time. Are you religious yourself, Scott?I’m not religious. In fact I really have a problem with it most of the time [laughs]. I’ve spent my life around the Mormons and I’m kinda known for criticizing the Mormon church, but the last story I did was fairly complimentary to them ... Yeah, I have a problem with religion. I think it’s mostly brainwashing. I would say I’m spiritual. The tradition of nonviolence is a spiritual pursuit if you can pull it off.How do you reconcile not being a religious person, but also being blown away by what you saw, with the black prophetic tradition?Well, religion is just a way to scare people, [to] frighten them into conforming and behaving according to the power structure. But spirituality is deeper. It’s the real thing, and I think I can recognize it when I see it. And these people were very spiritual. People who had their churches burned down that I talked to, most of 'em. It’s not hard to recognize the difference between bullshit and deep spirituality. You talked to one woman, I think it was in Knoxville, where she’s kinda like, “It’s not a race thing” --Except “down there”! Down the hill. Where there are gunshots. And she goes on to say, “I’m glad the cops are here to protect us from them, running all over."" And then you’re like, “From black people?” And she says, “I was gonna say Mexicans too!” Yeah, it’s very real. You never hear that stuff on the radio or TV, but that type of -- in her mind, she was a very nice person who loves black people, she treated [black] kids like her own grandkids. And I don’t have any reason -- she was a nice woman -- but she was in a place with a history of these problems. Yeah, but it’s contradictory. She loves them, but she’s afraid of them, or some of them.And what do you think that means, that there are such contradictions?I think racism and prejudice are just very complex subjects. I think we’re born with a gene that makes us fearful of others. People who are different than ourselves or people who live down the hill or over the hill, or even go to the different high school. Everyone had a way to draw a line, and then hate those people. Seems to be part of our nature. Like I don’t know where you went to high school, but I imagine the high school closest to yours, there was a big rivalry. You knew all kinds of ways that they were screwed up or not good people. But if you stood all of 'em outside [from the two schools], you wouldn’t be able to tell the difference! You maybe could see it -- they hold their hair like this, wear their shirts like this -- but to someone from the outside, it’s just ridiculous, you know what I mean?This goes way back to before apes, and a lot of times, chimps, anyway, spend a lot of time patrolling their territory, seeing if any outsiders were coming and then catch them and rip 'em limb to limb and eat 'em. You know, it’s deeply ingrained in our DNA, this fear of others. It often comes out as skin color, but there’s lots of different ways it surfaces, because it’s so deep and we’re such fearful animals. It surfaces in a lot of ways and it gets denied in a lot of ways.In some places, it sounded like some people were a little scared to talk to you. Is that true? Yeah, but I don’t think it had anything to do with the church fires. In Knoxville it didn’t. I was a white guy walking around asking questions. I’m 58. I have gray hair. I look like maybe a government person or a police investigator or something. So they don’t want to talk to me, or if they did want to talk, they didn’t want to do it on microphone.So um, yeah, that’s normal. Not necessarily a racial thing, but when you go into a neighborhood where you don’t belong, people know it. You’re not from around here -- it’s that same thing. Probably for good reason. In Macon -- in the Unionville [neighborhood] -- this guy told me, ""The only white people that come around here are policemen.” And that’s certainly what it looked like.I wouldn’t necessarily want to talk to a reporter, either. They usually get the thing wrong. They usually misquote you and mess it up. So who would want to talk to a journalist? But people do anyway, surprisingly, and I’m really happy about that. It kind of struck me, listening to your interviews, that what people were saying they may not have necessarily said in front of a camera, but they would say it into a microphone.Yeah, I think that’s true a lot of times. At first, the microphone -- my mic is [a] foot long, kinda big, they don’t want to shove it in their faces. But it makes them think about what they want to say, and they organize their thoughts, and then they forget about it. Whereas a lens, you can never forget about it. It’s always there. Is there anything else you wanted to say? I sense that people don’t quite -- aren’t quite comfortable with this type of story, where I just go and talk to people, like in Nepal. I think people don’t quite know what to make of it. I think it’s something that podcasting is good for. I can do whatever I want because I don’t have an editor. I don’t have a censor. It’s very unusual. It’s a new thing ... If I want to get in my car and drive to the South or fly to Nepal, I can do it. I think I can get better stories. I think I can cover the situation in some ways better than conventional media, and I wish more people would do it.Podcasting’s a new thing. It’s in its infancy stage and I’m really happy and excited about it, because I think it has a bright future and so many things are possible, you know, that I can’t do. I only have only my certain talents and abilities. There are so many possibilities about what can be done.  This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. "

10,BUSINESS,This Video Game Could Change Business School Forever -- And It's Actually Fun,Shane Ferro,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/one-day-video-game-business-school_us_562e899de4b0c66bae590416,We got to test out a new game that's supposed to be better at teaching strategy than a professor is. Here's what we found.,2015-10-29,"In the airport terminal featured in ""One Day,"" the business strategy game, players can interact with any of the highlighted passengers or employees, read the magazines in the corner or go into the airline’s lounge.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/563140f61c00007700570dd0.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Imagine you are a new employee at a large airline. You walk into an airport one day and receive an email from your boss. He says the company needs a new strategy, and he wants you to come up with some options. You panic and scramble to find as much information as possible among passengers and employees at the airport before you board your flight.This is the premise for a new video game called ""One Day,"" developed for Hult International Business School to teach strategy to MBA students. The game is still in development and probably won't be ready for the classroom until next year, but early tests show promise. Not to mention, it's actually fun to play.While it is now fairly common for video games to teach elementary concepts -- spelling, basic math, typing -- higher education has more or less resisted encroaching technology up to this point. Until recently, higher-level concepts have been harder to program because there may be more than one right answer. ""One Day,"" which its creators say is the first game of its kind, poses some fairly new questions about learning in the digital age and the role of the professor in a modern classroom.""I’ve been a business school professor for 30 years,"" said John Beck, whose educational consulting company, North Star Leadership Group, developed ""One Day."" He lamented that most MBA programs rely on teaching methods honed decades before the personal computing revolution. ""For 30 years I’ve been thinking the system is so broken. The case studies model dates from the 1920s, and the lecture model from the 1850s.""In the new model Hult is evaluating -- teaching by video game simulation -- students actually interact with the material, rather than sitting in long lecture sessions or working through historical cases in class.Hult recently conducted an experiment in London to see just how well the prototype game teaches. Students were given a test of their knowledge of strategy, then half were taught by a professor and the other half played the game, then they were tested again. The results showed ""One Day"" taught the students just as well, if not slightly better than the lecture professor did.When North Star let me play the game for myself recently, I enjoyed it. The production quality and entertainment factor don't compare to, say, ""Halo,"" but it's certainly more engaging than your average lecture. The graphics are fairly flat and almost look like they were drawn in MS Paint, but in a kind of pleasing way. It wouldn't be my go-to game on the weekend, but it was fun to spend a day exploring it.The current version of ""One Day,"" which, again, is just a prototype and only a fraction of what the full course-replacing game will look like, takes a couple of hours to complete. The player gets a task: figure out a new strategy for the fictional airline company by talking to customers and employees, who change every time the game is restarted. Players must also read through available information about the airline industry and company's performance. The player takes notes, and at the end makes a decision about the future of the company.That said, it's hard. The game requires you to absorb new concepts while also sorting through which information is important and which is not. You don't really get any answers until you play it all the way through, so it's difficult to get right on the first try.According to Adam Carstens, another of the game's developers, my experience was fairly typical. He told me people often don't do very well their first time playing, but do much better the second time through. The obvious question here is whether games are coming to automate professors' jobs. For now, it seems unlikely. This is an exciting new frontier in higher education, but Beck says he doesn't think this is the kind of automation that is going to put people out of work.

(AP Photo/Claude Paris, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Victoria BryanDUBLIN (Reuters) - Seven months after a pilot apparently crashed an airliner into a mountainside, killing himself and 149 other people, experts said better support for pilots with mental health disorders would do more to reduce the risk of pilot suicide than requiring that two people be in the cockpit at all timesInvestigators believe co-pilot Andreas Lubitz deliberately crashed Germanwings A320 in France on March 24, killing all 150 people onboard. Prosecutors found evidence that Lubitz suffered from depression, researched suicide methods and concealed illness from his employer.A few days after the incident, European aviation safety authorities mandated that two people should be in the cockpit at all times, a rule that it will review after a year.But experts at an aviation security conference said on Tuesday the rule would not necessarily help and had been introduced too quickly, without considering additional training for cabin crew.""For an industry that is supposed to be high-tech and develop strategies based on common sense, it was a remarkable lack of judgment,"" said Philip Baum, managing director at Green Light Ltd, a security training and consulting firm.In previous crashes where pilot suicide was suspected, a second pilot had not been able to wrestle the controls back from the other, said Robert Bor, a consultant psychologist at the Royal Free Hospital in London,A European task force in July made other recommendations, among them improved psychological screening for new pilots, a European database with details of medical visits and better support networks to reduce the risks of a similar tragedy.Bor said more mental screening should be done during regular medical checks, and the industry needed a more open culture of reporting. Less stigma should be attached to mental health issues, he said, including common psychological disorders such as anxiety, relationship, financial or sleep problems.He recommended that pilots get training on basic mental health awareness for themselves and others. Support networks should be set up in-house, rather than farmed out to a third-party provider, he said.""Pilots are not naive to their own mental stresses,"" Bor said. ""They need to be part of the effort to make the skies safer.""Nico Voorbach, a 777 pilot and former head of the European pilots' association ECA, said the job of a pilot was getting more stressful. Pilots should be aware of colleagues who weren't reacting as they had been trained to, and talking to them directly could be effective way of identifying those who needed more help dealing with stress. Pilots have long called for more support programs and anonymous reporting channels for crew to either report their own problems or those of colleagues.""It's one of the only ways we think we (can) tackle this issue in a proactive and holistic way,"" said Agustin Guzman Rodriguez, chairman of the security committee at the international pilots' association IFALPA.He said that having such systems in place also made it easier for employees to get back to work, thus bringing financial benefit for both employee and employer.(Editing by Larry King)Need help?

Early focus groups and instant polls may not shed much light on which candidate ""wins"" the debate.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56312bb7190000b100b95247.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you’re looking forward to finding out who ""won"" the GOP debate just minutes or hours after it ends on Wednesday night, you'd probably be better off waiting a few days instead.It's not that there won't be plenty of immediate data to look at, from focus groups and instant polls to social media and web traffic. But as the past few months have shown, none of those are especially reliable guides.A focus group led by GOP pollster Frank Luntz after the first Republican debate in August suggested that voters had soured on Donald Trump -- a prediction not borne out in the business mogul's poll numbers, which continued to rise sharply.Initial reactions to the first Democratic debate also proved to be dissimilar from the results of later polling on the race. Another Luntz focus group named Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) the clear winner, and suggested many of Clinton's supporters had deserted her. Other focus groups and instant online polls told a similar story, as did a surge of web searches and Facebook follows for Sanders. Days later, though, scientific surveys showed a more quotidian outcome: While both candidates made a good impression, the debate, if anything, strengthened Clinton's lead.It’s possible for both of those reactions to be true, to some extent: Media coverage, which was largely favorable to Clinton, is at least as important as the candidate's actual performance in guiding opinion. Respondents’ opinions on later polls are likely influenced by the media’s dominant narrative, especially if the poll includes people who didn’t watch the entire debate. But there are plenty of other reasons to be skeptical of most of the attempts to instantly gauge reaction after a debate. Online ""instant polls,"" which don't attempt to weight their responses and may allow people to vote multiple times, often end up rewarding enthusiasm over numbers, reflecting the views of a small group of supporters rather than the nation's debate-watchers as a whole. ""The results rely on a self-selecting group of respondents with no regard to political affiliation, age, country, or even whether the person doing the responding actually watched the debate,"" Slate's Josh Voorhees wrote, explaining why a reader poll posted to the site's homepage had shown Sanders dominating. ""They also tend to favor those candidates with active and impassioned fans -- something that Bernie’s fundraising numbers and campaign crowds suggest he clearly has in spades."" Focus groups, a similarly imperfect snapshot of the American electorate, are also often dominated by the loudest voices. ""While these discussions make for far more compelling television than dry survey statistics, they have important limitations,"" HuffPost's Mark Blumenthal wrote in a 2008 column. ""Every group is a small, non-random sample, and it is hard to know the degree to which the views of participants may be influenced by the atmospherics of the telecast, the probes of the moderator or the opinions expressed by others in the group.""And even if a focus group or online poll accurately takes the measure of public opinion, there's another, more fundamental challenge with trying to figure out who ""won."" Unlike a sports game or an election, debates don't necessarily produce clear-cut winners or an objective way of naming them. Supporters of a politician are likely to think their preferred candidate won, regardless of the outcome, and even a strong performance can have relatively little impact on the polls.""[C]andidate debates, at least as commonly practiced in the United States, do not contain measures for determining an actual winner,"" political scientist Seth Masket wrote earlier this month in the Pacific Standard. ""The audience that tuned in to watch invariably saw their candidate doing well. It re-affirmed the things they liked about their preferred candidate and reminded them of what they didn't like about the other one.""Mark Blumenthal contributed reporting."

Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/eric-holder-black-lives-matter-ferguson-effect_us_56312137e4b00aa54a4c6681,"The former attorney general dismissed the notion that there's a ""Ferguson effect"" causing a rise in crime.",2015-10-28,"Former Attorney General Eric Holder weighed in on the ""Ferguson effect"" on Wednesday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Former Attorney General Eric Holder on Wednesday drew parallels between Black Lives Matter protests and the civil rights movement, dismissed the notion floated by the FBI director that the so-called ""Ferguson effect"" may be resulting in increases in crime, and said the country is still too afraid to talk about race.Holder also said that it may make sense for the federal government to only distribute grants to police departments that meet certain standards, which could help rein in abusive behavior by law enforcement. He suggested that the Justice Department, and perhaps the federal government more broadly, could tie grants to ""some sort of conduct assessment"" to ensure the money only goes to departments that ""conduct themselves in appropriate ways."" He added that such a proposal would likely require congressional approval.Holder, who made civil rights and criminal justice reform signature issues in his Justice Department, stepped down as the nation's top law enforcement official in April upon the confirmation of Attorney General Loretta Lynch.He spoke with a handful of reporters on Wednesday, along with Taylor Branch, a Pulitzer Prize winning author who chronicled the civil rights movement and the life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Taylor will receive the 2015 Records of Achievement Award from the National Archives Foundation on Wednesday evening, and Holder will interview him at the event.Branch and Holder spoke about the differences between the civil rights movement a half a century ago and the current struggle for racial equality.""I think many of the issues are in some ways the same,"" Holder said. ""It's a question of people wanting to be treated in appropriate ways, having their government respect them and accord them the rights to which they're entitled as American citizens. Different issues, but I think it's at some level, the same basic concerns, the same basic desires.""Holder said there is no ""unquestioned leader"" who is a modern analogue to King, but added that such a figure might not be necessary.""Do we have here a moment, or do we have a movement? That, I think, is still up in the air,"" Holder said. ""From my perspective, I'm not so certain."" Holder, who traveled to Ferguson, Missouri, following the death of Michael Brown in August 2014, also disputed FBI Director James Comey's speculation that police officers' fear of being caught in viral videos is leading to an increase in crime. Holder has praised Comey's speech about the history of tension between law enforcement and communities of color, and did so again on Wednesday, calling his comments ""gutsy."" But said he believes the comments on the ""Ferguson effect"" aren't based in fact.""I don't agree with the comments that he's made about, or the connection he's drawn, between the so-called 'Ferguson effect' and this rise in crime,"" Holder said, adding that Comey seemed to be relying on anecdotes rather than data.""You can't base policy on anecdotal evidence,"" Holder said. ""It's hard for us to understand why crime dropped to historic lows over the last 40 years. I think it's probably equally difficult -- or even more difficult -- to explain why crime has gone up in some places, violent crime has gone up in some places, over the past 12 months. But I don't think it's connected to the so-called Ferguson effect.""Holder's comments echoed those of President Barack Obama, who told police chiefs at a speech in Chicago on Tuesday that it was important to ""stick with the facts"" and not ""cherrypick data or use anecdotal evidence"" when talking about criminal justice. Many chiefs there said they don't believe officers are somehow backing down over fear of going viral.""I frankly don't think police officers are laying down on the job,"" Holder said. ""I don't think they're taking a knee, as I saw somebody put it. I don't think police officers are taking a knee, they're out there doing what they went to their job to do.""Asked about a 2009 speech during which he said America was ""a nation of cowards"" on the issue of race, landing himself in hot water, Holder said his remarks held up. ""What I said then, I think is still pretty accurate,"" Holder said. ""Talking about racial things, especially given this nation's history when it comes to racial matters, is a very, very difficult thing to do from both sides. We've become quite adept at finding ways not to deal with racial issues, and I think that is to the detriment of our country and our ability to make progress."" "

Ryan Rhodes, Carson’s Iowa state director, said the campaign’s organizational ground game has aided in Carson’s major fundraising haul.“It’s just a testament to how many small donors and people are getting involved,” Rhodes explained.Iowans have contributed $153,000 to Carson’s campaign through Sept. 30, according to the most recent Federal Elections Commission report. He has now out-fundraised Clinton’s campaign, which has received $111,600 in contributions from Iowa voters.“When you get hundreds of volunteers out to do things and when you continue to build that, you start getting an organization that is tough to compete with,” Rhodes said.A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics Iowa Poll out this week shows Carson is in first place in the early primary state with a nine-point lead over business-mogul-turned-presidential-candidate, Donald Trump.While Carson's campaign only has six paid staffers in Iowa, Rhodes acknowledges the volunteers have really made an impact.“While we run very lean here, we have a lot of people involved and so many hands make light the load,” he said.Rhodes attributes the campaign’s success to a unique strategy: traveling to parts of the state that other candidates haven’t visited on the campaign trail.“We’re going and doing things like at the pumpkin patch,” Rhodes said. “We have made more of an effort to get to other places where other people aren’t necessarily going to be, because if you’re walking into an area where there’s five candidates or a bunch of people you have to compete for that. We are able to go to places and kind of be the lone competition.”Carson’s wife, Candy Carson, has also been taking a more active role in the campaign in Iowa. She has hosted several events, including one at an apple orchard, and has been part of Carson’s recent book tour.“It’s nice to have her here because people get to see the candidate, see his wife, and it’s all together something that Iowans love,"" Rhodes said.Also on HuffPost:"

But the apparent improvement in the Fed's outlook came despite its acknowledgment that the ""pace of job gains slowed and the unemployment rate held steady.""Wednesday's decision was widely anticipated. As the University of Oregon economist Tim Duy put it in Bloomberg on Tuesday, it was “essentially a foregone conclusion.”But workers and consumers still should pay attention.Even if the Fed is giving the economy more breathing room, it is doing so because of dimmer growth forecasts. That means that already stagnant paychecks will not be growing much anytime soon.The FOMC will next meet on Dec. 15 and 16 to decide whether to raise rates. And in a less expected development, the Fed's Wednesday announcement clearly left the door open to an interest rate hike in December. In contrast with its September statement, when the FOMC said it would ""assess progress"" in achieving its objectives of full employment and price stability, on Wednesday the committee said it would revisit rates ""next meeting.""But no matter what decision comes in December, the news will not be great. Even if the bank maintains current interest rates -- a move that employment advocates might have welcomed a few months ago as a decision to err on the side of jobs and wage growth -- it would now be considered a sign that the economy is worse off than even those advocates had warned.Here is why: If Fed officials -- who, partly by virtue of their role, are far less sensitive to concerns about inadequate job growth than many full employment advocates -- think the economy is too sluggish to raise rates, then the economy is really in trouble.Back in early August, Fed officials indicated they were going full speed ahead toward an interest rate hike in September.Many, mostly left-leaning, economists and full employment advocates said at the time that sluggish wage growth, high underemployment and low workforce participation meant it was too early for a rate increase. Wait for wage growth to begin taking off, they said, which will likely not be until at least 2016.As the progressive Economic Policy Institute's Elise Gould noted, the prime-age employment-to-population ratio -- a measure that includes people who have stopped looking for work and filters out elderly retirees -- was still lower in August than during the low points of the last two business cycles:Since then, the economy has suffered a series of shocks that caused the Federal Reserve to reconsider its plans.A slowdown in China and economies that export commodities to China hit the U.S. stock market hard in August. The U.S. dollar also increased in value relative to other currencies, making U.S. exports less competitive.A Sept. 11 Goldman Sachs report found that the combination of those changes had already led to a tightening of credit in the economy equivalent to a three-quarter-point increase in the Fed’s main interest rate. That's three times what the central bank was even considering.In other words: The markets had effectively already raised rates, so the Fed did not have to. As a result, when the Federal Reserve announced it was not going to raise its benchmark interest rate in mid-September, even some conservative financial analysts hailed it as a no-brainer.Still, the FOMC made clear in its statement following the September decision that Fed officials’ main concern was that inflation was not rising fast enough -- not, as many advocates argued, that unemployment was still too high. Although Goldman Sachs estimates that some or all of that credit tightening has wound down in the interim, the economy produced a dismal 142,000 jobs in September -- low enough to raise fears that inflation is not on track to hit the Fed’s 2 percent target.The FOMC’s statement on Wednesday indicated that not enough had improved in the interim for the Fed to consider raising rates.Likewise, if the Fed continues on its course through the end of the year, it will likely not be because of a reorientation of its policymaking toward full employment concerns, but rather a reaction to the effect of previously unforeseen economic headwinds on inflation.And if the bank chooses to raise rates in December, it will be because, as Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen explained at the press conference following the September interest rate announcement, they are aiming to gradually raise interest rates to head off greater inflation down the road. Josh Bivens, research and policy director of the Economic Policy Institute and an opponent of a rate hike long before the onset of market volatility in August, said that while the Fed’s policy rationale may be different than his, “so far there has been no gap in policy.” Bivens admitted that the Fed is more concerned about inflation than he would like it to be. (The Fed generally raises rates when it is concerned about inflation and lowers or maintains them when it wants to let unemployment decline more.) “I put a much higher weight on low unemployment than low inflation in my consideration of how the Federal Reserve should act,” he said. “I am not that worried about inflation going above 2 percent, and I am very worried about leaving employment gains on the table and the pain that will cause millions of people.”Since no one is proposing restarting the Fed’s quantitative easing program, however, doing no harm by leaving rates unchanged is the best Bivens and others can hope for from the Fed. Instead, to reignite the economy, Bivens proposes using state intervention to prevent trade partners from keeping their currencies cheaper than the dollar, thereby making their exports perennially more competitive than those of the United States.Bivens also estimates that the budget deal President Barack Obama reached with congressional Republicans this week will preserve 700,000 to 800,000 jobs by preventing the return of spending cuts from sequestration. But it is still a case of damage avoided, not proactive policymaking to boost economic growth. “I would like fiscal policy to be expansionary in the next year,” Bivens added. “That is surely not going to happen.”Also on HuffPost:"
