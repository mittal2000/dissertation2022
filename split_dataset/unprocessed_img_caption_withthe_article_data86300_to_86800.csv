0,BUSINESS,How to Celebrate Your Employees and Boost Your Bottom Line. #WorkHuman,"Maya Mathias, ContributorPeaceful Leadership Advocate & Mentor. Editor, LeadfortheWorld...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-to-celebrate-your-emp_b_7592070.html,"Two of my favorite words, work and human, had been joined at the hip, pulling me into its orb, inviting me to see what unexplored online world lay behind the ad.",2015-06-16,2015-06-16-1434443275-4112603-WorkHumanbannerad.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-16-1434443275-4112603-WorkHumanbannerad-thumb.jpg,"The banner ad cut through the online clutter and caught my eye.WorkHuman 2015 - unlocking the future of the human workplaceTwo of my favorite words, work and human, had been joined at the hip, pulling me into its orb, inviting me to see what unexplored online world lay behind the ad.It did not disappoint.I've spent several years uncovering and now following my latest professional bliss - a quest to bring more heart, soul and inner peace into the workplace. Globoforce, the progressive company and thought leadership powerhouse responsible for creating WorkHuman 2015, their inaugural human resources (HR) conference, was singing my tune. And judging from the lineup of speakers they'd assembled, from Thrive author and HuffPost editor-in-chief Arianna Huffington to happiness researcher Shawn Achor, they were serious about wanting to infuse the world of work with more humanity. So when one of the keynote speakers and Onlyness champion presented a chance to attend WorkHuman (thank you again Nilofer Merchant!), I didn't hesitate. This wasn't just my curious inner explorer wanting to experience something new. The promise of the event was a clarion call that pierced my soul deeply and resoundingly. Could it be possible that there were many more people like me in corporate America, people who were tired of being beaten down by bottom-line-only management practices and who were ready to champion the humanity that sparks truly sustainable workplace creativity and innovation?My intuition told me I had to attend. My heart opened up to the possibility of meeting humane HR leaders throughout the 2.5-day conference. And my mind stayed open to receive the wisdom that seemed destined to unfold at WorkHuman 2015.Fortune favors the bold The themes and speakers at WorkHuman have been circulating in our consciousness for a year or two. Mindfulness, positive psychology, thriving, wellbeing, employee engagement and recognition...none of this was breaking news. What was different was that WorkHuman had curated and collated these synergistic threads with care, and had served them up with a huge dose of heart. We were all aware of the human resources challenges at work, and we were beginning to see the seeds of solutions to those challenges. What we needed most was a watering hole, a campfire where we could raise our hands in solidarity and pride to say ""Yes, I too believe that a humane workplace is more sensible and more profitable than the status quo.""After each keynote speech or breakout session, I could see the glimmer of hope in my fellow attendees' eyes shine just that little bit brighter. I could sense the growing relief and awe of each Globoforce employee, initially unsure if they'd truly been on to something and then thrilled that their instincts to create WorkHuman had been spot on. As I'd remarked to event host and head of Globoforce's consulting services Derek Irvine on the first morning of WorkHuman (captured by their videographer at 0:06 to 0:07 in the wrap video below), ""Derek - this is such a brilliantly-timed event. Kudos to the entire team for thinking of this and pulling it off.""They had me at sunrise yoga And lest you think that we were herded from one room to another, with no down time in between, WorkHuman walked its talk by including pockets of time to network or recharge. There was no stress hanging in the air, forcibly interlacing itself with our self-recriminating thoughts and pushing us into each and every session. Instead, we were encouraged to go with our own flow, at critical points choosing between stimulating walk and talk sessions, nourishing yoga and meditation sessions, or laughter-inducing improv workshops. These are all modalities and skills that I love and practice in my own life and leadership and with my clients. Having them at my disposal during WorkHuman made the experience all the sweeter.Tangible takeaways The harshest cynics and critics among you, assuming you've even read this article up to this point, are probably scoffing at this love fest and wondering if anything of substance and bottom-line significance was shared.Beyond the feel-good energy of the event, which to me is its own endorphin-laden reward, we were introduced to the data visualization capabilities of technology-enabled social recognition, the ability to quantify and actively reward the expression of company values, the mounting and undeniable scientific evidence that there is no tradeoff between professional success and inner peace, the surprising fact that givers can and do achieve extraordinary results across a wide range of industries, and the growing body of positive psychology research that asserts how happiness inspires and boosts productivity.The rest is up to us Despite both the hard evidence delivered by the speakers and the heartfelt desire of WorkHuman attendees, many questions remain. Some of these were voiced during the Q&A sessions. What data can you share with me so that I can convince my senior leadership team that this matters? How do I bring this back to work with me when my company leaders don't and probably won't walk this talk? How can we continue to support each other, because so much of this still feels like we're salmon swimming against the tide of the mechanistic status quo?Change rarely occurs in a straight line. And change agents need equal doses of patience and conviction. It's easy to ignore us when we're outliers, telling stories and sharing proof points that seem far-fetched or irrelevant.But this is no longer a problem to ignore. The war for talent rages on. Disgruntled employees are reaching the end of their rope. When it comes to workplace practices, the chasm between what senior leaders expect and what employees crave grows ever wider. Whether or not we care to admit it, burnout is killing our bottom lines.As leaders of our organizations, it's time to question our singular obsession with data, and with treating our human resources as little more than digits on a management dashboard. Big data and data mining are sexy and powerful constructs, but they cannot fully quantify the collaborative yearnings of a compassionate heart, or adequately measure the creative thirst of a spirited soul. All we need do is to look beyond our spreadsheets and data visualizations, to listen to the drumbeat of our own hearts and souls. Then we will naturally, and yes happily, unlock our own will to champion more humanity at work.This article originally appeared on Maya's Musings blog.

For a time Aunt Gwen was the nanny for my oldest, Sadie, when she was a toddler. Gwen's diagnosis scared me. Bad enough was the thought of losing my friend and sister-from-another-mister. Bad enough was the thought of my husband and their other two siblings losing their sister. The thought of my Sadie losing Her Aunt Gwen terrified me. But she fought. She did all the ""right"" things: surgery, chemo, radiation. They told her she was as cancer-free as they were allowed to tell her.And almost exactly two years after her original diagnosis, we got the scariest news of all: it was back, and it was metastatic. No cure.On her blog, Gwen wrote, ""... how do you continue living bravely through the end knowing that you will be the person who breaks your four-year-old niece's heart for the first time...""I took my girls, then four and 10 months, to visit Gwen about a month after this second diagnosis. It was nearly impossible not to feel a looming sense of dread, mixed with a lot of anger and sadness. We did our best to show the kids a good time. Trips to the park, walking the dog, ice cream cone cupcakes. The works.Sadie has always been into jewelry and all things sparkly. So of course, when she came across the sparkly, heart-shaped necklace, she asked to wear it.Gwen and I exchanged a look, and Gwen donned Sadie with the necklace bearing the proclamation: Fuck Cancer.Fuck cancer, indeed, I thought. How dare you try to take Aunt Gwen away from my girls? Sure as sunshine, eventually Sadie asked what the necklace said.We've always been straightforward about language in our house. Words are neither ""good"" nor ""bad,"" but some words are for Grownups Only. (Somehow this has worked, and we are extremely lucky Sadie doesn't swear like a sailor. Jury is still out on Polly.)""Well,"" I told her, ""It says Fuck Cancer.""""What does that mean?"" she asked.""The first word, fuck, is a grownup word. Cancer is the kind of sickness your Aunt Gwen has. The necklace says Fuck Cancer, because we are very angry that cancer is making Aunt Gwen sick again. We want the cancer to go away and leave her alone.""""Oh, okay,"" Sadie said.It's been nearly 18 months since that conversation, and it's been a real roller coaster for Gwen. Extremely hardcore chemo nearly took her down before she secured a spot in a trial for a new class of drugs called PARP inhibitors. She was in a trial for BMN 673, and it was successful at shrinking existing cancer and preventing new growth. And her quality of life was better than any of the other courses of treatment she's tried since first being diagnosed in 2011.That's because the drug is a match for the BRCA mutation Gwen has. Unfortunately, Gwen was released from the trial, and the drug company, BioMarin, has declined her doctor's request for compassionate use.So, while this drug works very well for Gwen, and her doctor would like her to be on this precise drug, she has to wait until it is on the market in order for her doctor to prescribe it.In the time Gwen was off the drug, she lost every bit of ground gained by being on it. Cancer took hold again, and it was growing precariously close to vital systems, like her spinal cord.There is a nearly identical drug already on the market. Lynparza is the first FDA approved PARP inhibitor. Awesome!Except, because Lynparza is currently only approved for ovarian cancer, and Gwen has breast cancer (the genetic mutation is responsible for both), Gwen's insurance will not cover a prescription for Lynparza.The out-of-pocket cost for Lynparza? $12,000.To give you a sense of how absurd that is, that's $144,000 a year. The median household income in the United States is $51,750.Thanks to the generosity of many people, we have raised enough for three months of the drug. The hope is that one of two things will happen soon: BNM 673 will become FDA approved, and Gwen's doctor can prescribe it, and her insurance will cover it. Or Lynparza will become approved for breast cancer, in addition to ovarian cancer, and Gwen's insurance will begin to cover it.I don't have to tell you: cancer is scary. Hereditary cancer is scary. In addition to my sister-in-law having breast cancer, my mother-in-law has ovarian cancer, which killed her own sister in 2008. Many of my mother-in-law's paternal aunts died from cancer.We had my husband tested and were relieved to learn he is negative for a BRCA mutation, which is great news for him (men with the mutation can develop breast and other cancers, though at a much lower risk than women). It also means our daughters are no more likely than I am to develop any of the related cancers. If you suspect these cancers run in your family, I urge you to get tested. You can get a lot more information here. Gwen's doctor recently wrote her a prescription for Lynparza, and we are cautiously optimistic. You're only allowed a certain amount of optimism when it comes to metastatic breast cancer. Because, fuck cancer.Update: In a terrible, gut-wrenching turn of events, Gwen just received a phone call from the pharmacy saying her doctor was given the wrong quote originally. It's not $6,000 a month. It's $12,000. They will honor the original quote for one month, but no longer than that. We will continue fundraising and fighting this from all angles we can think of."
2,IMPACT,Getting SmaRT About Reducing Remittances Costs,"Gloria Grandolini, ContributorSenior Director of Finance & Markets Global Practice at the Wo...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/getting-smart-about-reduc_b_7582584.html,"When a Moroccan fruit-seller closes his stand each evening at the Porta Palazzo market in Turin, Italy, he thinks about how much money he made that day, how much he can send to his family back in Morocco that week, how much it will cost to send that money, and how many Dirhams his family will receive.",2015-06-16,2015-06-17-1434553308-4967105-FamilyremittancesJune174blog.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-17-1434553308-4967105-FamilyremittancesJune174blog-thumb.jpg,"When a Moroccan fruit-seller closes his stand each evening at the Porta Palazzo market in Turin, Italy, he thinks about how much money he made that day, how much he can send to his family back in Morocco that week, how much it will cost to send that money, and how many Dirhams his family will receive.This fruit-seller is one of the nearly 250 million international migrants who send money back home to family members. For many people in developing countries, their remittances from overseas are a reliable and steady source of income that help them make ends meet. The amount of money migrants remit each year has been steadily rising over the last decade. International remittances totaled $583 billion in 2014; $436 billion of that amount went from developed to developing countries, according to the World Bank Group's estimates. But remitting money isn't cheap.   Correction, June 17: An earlier version of the infographic mistakenly had $523 billion instead of $583 billion. When we started monitoring the cost of international remittance services in 2008, the transaction cost to send money accounted for more than 10 percent of the remitted amount. That fact meant that migrants spent $30 billion on charges to send the money, instead of having that money reach their families. That amount is equivalent to the official development assistance (ODA) given each year by the United States to developing countries.In 2009, the G8 set a target, later adopted by the G20, to reduce the cost of international remittances from 10 percent to 5 percent within five years. The target was dubbed the ""5x5 Objective."" Significant progress has been made and the cost of sending remittances has indeed fallen considerably since then. Today, the average global cost is 7.68 percent. According to our estimates, the cost reduction has saved migrants and their families more than $60 billion.This drop in price has been achieved despite adverse conditions in the marketplace recently - such as the rising cost of compliance and banks' moving toward de-risking their operations, which curtails remittance service-providers' access to bank accounts. The World Bank Group has been leading the global effort to reduce the cost of sending money home and to improve remittance markets through the Global Remittances Working Group, and has helped establish global standards and codify best practices. We've worked with governments to improve remittance markets in more than 30 countries. With local stakeholders, we've launched innovative projects, such as Project Greenback 2.0 on Remittances Champion Cities, to better understand how migrants use remittance services and to how to make them more efficient. Our Remittance Prices Worldwide database monitors the cost of sending remittances from 32 major sending countries to 89 recipient countries, analyzing a total of 227 country corridors.We're committed to making the ""5x5 Objective"" happen and to continuing to work on reducing the global cost of remittance services to 5 percent. But we're also looking even further ahead. At the upcoming Global Forum on Remittances and Development in Milan, we'll introduce a new objective, the Smart Remitter Target (SmarRT), which will monitor remittance transactions at a more granular level. The aim is to ensure that in each country corridor there are at least three remittance service-providers who charge 3 percent or less to send money.To be included in the SmarRT Index, remittance services will need to be accessible on both the sending and receiving ends, and the money will need to be available to recipients within five days.We will also advocate that at least one service in each corridor be available at a significantly lower price than the average in that corridor. That would make a major difference for many of the poorest remittance senders and their beneficiaries.Making remittance services work for migrants supports the World Bank Group's goal to achieve Universal Financial Access (UFA) by 2020. The UFA goal envisions that two billion people worldwide, who are currently completely locked out of the financial system, will be able to gain access to a transaction account to send and receive payments and to store money. Access to a transaction account is a step to financial inclusion and can help people improve their lives. Remittances are often the first financial service that migrants and their families use. A secure and affordable flow of remittances is crucial to empowering working families and expanding financial access.Once achieved, SmarRT will make it easier for the Moroccan fruit-seller to find a remittance service provider who will charge him 3 percent or less to send money home to his family in Morocco. He will also know that his family will have an easy point-of-access to pick up the money, which they'll receive in five days or less.All of these efforts are a critical part of the international development community's agenda to reduce poverty and boost shared prosperity in the next decade."
3,RELIGION,Survival in Paris,"Rabbi Judith HaLevy, ContributorSpiritual Leader, Malibu Jewish Center & Synagogue",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/survival-in-paris_b_7580804.html,"Noah built an ark, commissioned by God. In Paris, architect Frank Gehry built an ark, commissioned by Louis Vuitton.",2015-06-16,"View of the Louis Vuitton Foundation designed by Canadian-American architect Frank Gehry in the Bois de Boulogne in Paris on October 17, 2014. The building which takes the form of a sailboat amongst the trees of the Bois de Boulogne, consists of twelve huge sails glass, and is part of the long tradition of architectural glass such as the Grand Palace. AFP PHOTO / BERTRAND GUAY (Photo credit should read BERTRAND GUAY/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb802fc2200004301dd3764.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Noah built an ark, commissioned by God. In Paris, architect Frank Gehry built an ark, commissioned by Louis Vuitton.Noah's charge was to fashion an ark containing all manner of species, so that all living beings could reboot in a fledgling new world. Noah's ark was to have three levels with outside decks, so that all of the animals could be sustained during the period of the flood. Light was provided by a space called the ""Tsohar"", an enclosure at the very top of the ark illuminating the ark day and night.The light of the ""Tsohar"" was never extinguished, guiding the vessel from above. I do not know whether or not Frank Gehry, (née Goldberg) intended to build an ark as the latest addition to the museums of Paris, but the nautical shape of the vessel of metal and glass is immediately visible as one rounds the path through the Bois de Boulogne. The building even sits in a flowing stream of water. The curves and glassy surfaces, reminiscent of our Disney Hall, enclose three decks,with an upper enclosure filled with light. But this ark does not contain a Bois du Boulogne zoo, or a conservatory for all plant species. The Louis Vuitton Foundation appears to have been constructed as an ark to ferry the human spirit. The current exhibit is the last of the three inaugural exhibits dedicated to the emergence of contemporary Western art. This one begins with the anguish of the human experience. Taking the escalator down to the bottom of steerage, one emerges face to face with"" The Scream "" (the original) by Munch. A silent howl penetrates the air as the iconic thin line sculpture of ""Everyman "" by Giacometti steps into the void. A portrait of the existentialist writer Jean Genet, a head fading into layers of darkness, watches from the wall.As one rises through the museum/ark, each layer offers a contemporary artistic response to the challenge of humanity. The first is an appreciation of the beauty of nature, culminating with two massive paintings, the famous ""Water Lilies"" by Monet. The second theme, that of Man and Music, unfolds with a series of abstract expressionist paintings by Kandinsky that turn color into sound. The Russian Dance, perhaps the most famous painting by Matisse, fills an entire room with strength and joy.Pop Art, with its satirical political edge as well as its appreciation of everyday life objects, is the third, most contemporary response to the spirit of our times. Jewish?. Nothing seems particularly Jewish here. Then, I see the lineup of Warhol portraits. Ten notable Jewish figures of the twentieth century, from the Marx Brothers to Gershwin, from Louis Brandeis to Franz Kafka, Freud, Einstein, and Golda Meir, dominate the gallery wall. Their spirit will be preserved for the epochs to come. Following the portraits, one takes a few steps upwards, and suddenly one is in a cubical space at the top of the ark. Could this be the ""Tshohar"", the ark's guiding light? We have some choices here. One is an installation of pure violence , screen images of modern warfare with a deafening soundtrack of guns as percussion instruments. In another, a man and his son struggle alone across a frozen wasteland. At the center of the uppermost enclosed space is a an installation by artist Doug Gordon, based on the filming of a visit to Poland by two Israeli violinists, who have been invited to Krakow to play with the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra.I enter a darkened hallway filled with video screens and mirrors. The first image is that of a swimming pool, with balletic swimmers diving and cavorting. The scene is beautiful, but there is an ominous edge as the forms disappear underwater. Outside, I read that this is a swimming pool built on the ruins of a synagogue in Krakow. I am reminded of my own trip to Auschwitz, which began in a luxurious spa in a Sofitel in Warsaw, and ended with my standing in the empty showers of the gas chambers.The video switches to images of the two Israelis boarding the train for Krakow. The footage, reflected in the mirrors and the screens placed at all angles, records only the current journey ,but the lights and shadows of the Nazi cattle cars never leave our minds.One of the Israelis explains that his mother, a survivor, is so throughly a part of Israel that she would never return to Poland, but that he felt a pull to do so. The food, he said smiling, so reminds him of home. The Polish orchestra conductor, an older woman who might well have been alive during the Holocaust, picks up the baton and the deep strains of a Mozart Simphoneta begin.As the violinists begin to play, the music of Mozart penetrates into the deepest recesses of my soul. Mozart bounces off of the screens, the mirrors, the walls, filling the ""Tshohar"" with sound. One thing is clear, the ""Louis Vuitton"" will carry the sound of highest of human endeavors into generations to come.The music flows up through the opening at the top of this ark, up past the glass and steel precipices, up over the Bois de Boulogne, over the city of Paris, and out into the world. The unleashed sound knows no boundaries as it circles the earth, playing counterpoint with the angels above. Mozart, music, and the human spirit are eternal.Should the Jews leave France? in a few days here, I can hardly answer the question. Here, at the top of the Vuitton Museum, two Jews play their hearts out and the sound covers the earth. This much I know. We will survive. "

Contrary to his belief, he was not named after the basketball legend Michael Jordan. His mom Lucia McBath insists she named him after the crossing over of the Jordan River, symbolizing a new beginning. For his mom and dad, Ron Davis, Jordan was their new beginning. Their lives were torn apart November 23, 2012, the day after Thanksgiving, when shots were fired at a gas station in Jacksonville, Fla.  Lucia McBath holds a photo of her son Jordan Davis  in the documentary 3 1/2 Minutes, Ten Bullets.Ten bullets hit a car full of teenage boys. When the violence was over, 17-year-old Jordan Davis, an African-American, had been killed by Michael David Dunn, a middle-aged white software developer in town for a wedding. The boys had been playing loud rap music; Dunn requested that they turn it down. They did for an instant, and then they turned it back up. What happened next depends on whom you talk to.The 1950 film Rashomon, directed by the legendary Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, depicts the accounts of the witnesses, suspects and victims of a rape and murder. All have different viewpoints, recollections and interpretations of the same encounter. ""Rashomon effect"" is a term that means contradictory interpretations of the same event by different people. It's a dynamic that pervades just about every trial, where suspects and victims recount the same experience, differently. That's what's on view in this so-called ""loud music"" trial; the surviving boys have a different recollection than Dunn.Producer Minette Wilson initiated this project, and collaborated with documentary director/cinematographer Marc Silver (Global Protest, Who is Dayani Cristal?) and executive producer Orlando Bagwell (Eyes on the Prize). They received open access to the parents of the victim, his friends and the trial. The viewer sits around the dinner table with Lucia McBath and Ron Davis, is invited to prayer circles, hears anecdotes about Jordan from his pals (he was a mediocre basketball player, but quick on his feet) and gets to know the brassy suburban kid who was killed. What the documentary doesn't do is get inside the head of Michael Dunn. We don't find out how Dunn became the adult who dared to ask a carful of teens to turn their loud music down. Nor why on a Friday night while stopping to pick up wine and chips at a convenience store, he was carrying a gun in his glove compartment. Nor what he ever expected to do with a loaded firearm. Without these details, this documentary sheds light on only one side of the tragedy. The film calls into question stand-your-ground laws that have been drafted in many states making self-defense with a gun when a ""threat"" is perceived, legal. Echoes of the Trayvon Martin case are in this documentary. In fact Trayvon Martin's dad calls Jordan's dad and says, ""I want to welcome you to a club that none of us want to be in."" Though the film focuses on this crime in particular, it also brings into view a pattern of young black men being devalued and killed, which spurs many to think that this country has a chronic social/racial problem that has to be solved. The gut-wrenching subject of the film carries the movie. Security footage from the convenience store re-plays the dramatic pop, pop, pop sounds of the gunfire. The court proceedings are riveting. Arguments for Stand-your-ground and against it cause debate. Semi-private conversations between Dunn and his girlfriend are as intriguing as the conversations between Jordan's parents. Both couples are common people who have been thrust into a media spotlight by an incident that none could have fathomed when they woke up that Friday after Thanksgiving. What the documentary filmmakers have assembled is educational, eye opening, often emotional, sad and galvanizing. As the 98 minutes of footage roll by, it becomes apparent that Jordan's tragedy is a chapter within a much longer book. It is also clear that stand-your-ground laws are on trial as much as Michael Dunn was. Notes Judge Russell L. Healey, who presided over the case; ""There is nothing wrong with retreating or de-escalating a situation.""Visit NNPA Syndication Film Critic Dwight Brown at DwightBrownInk.com."

It is fluid and amoeba-like. Aqueous and ever-changing. And just when you think you're grasping it in your hands, it can trickle through your fingers.I am reminded of this as I awkwardly haul a leg over the torso of my lover and sink into his chest and we, in turn, sink deeper into the soft mattress of the bed in our room at the W Hotel. I laugh. It's a knee-jerk reaction I can't extinguish. I mutter ""sorry"" again and again as he steadies me, grabbing onto my thighs, and tells me to breathe. And to stop laughing. But all I can do is look down at a body I find myself unfamiliar with in a new position. It feels like the sexual equivalent of putting your shoes on the wrong feet and trying to walk a straight line over a carpet made of vanilla pudding.He is patient. And even. And non-judgmental. And I am awash with something that isn't love, but feels more like gratitude as he taps my forehead with a single finger and laughs with a Jedi-like understanding I've come to appreciate in him. ""Get out of your head,"" he instructs. But for me, that is impossible. And in the next 10 seconds, a Jane Campion film narrates in my head...On the other side of 35, I find myself at a crossroads. I am smarter than I've ever been. More in touch with my emotional well-being than ever before... yet at the heaviest this body has ever been. Aware that there needs to be MORE to my life, yet decently satisfied with where I've been. In many ways, my life has never been better. I am blessed to have healthy, loving parents and supportive, loving friends. I have a true understanding of things that make me tick thanks to a lifetime of self-reflection, an inquisitive nature and some great therapy. Yet I still have some lingering college-aged habits. Like forgoing breakfast four out of seven days a week. Or letting the laundry build up instead of doing it every few days in manageable piles. Picking my nail polish off and leaving tiny dust-like molecules of watermelon on the floor. I've always believed I was a pretty confident person. I know how I work. I carry my head high. I know what I can handle. I can stand on the wet sand of the beach without being swept away by the tides. There are scars on my shins (and maybe a few on my heart) that have proven I've made it out the other side and all for the better. I'm a master at witty banter. And I know how to wear a red dress with the best of women, regardless of the fact that I'm usually (OK, pretty much always) the largest woman in the room. Yup. All in all, I'd say I'm pretty damn confident.Up until this exact moment. When I'm overcome with rawness. Uncomfortable. Gawky. Doing this in a way I never do it and feeling ridiculously exposed. Wishing my legs were longer and my thighs were smaller and my breasts were perkier and my mid-section more toned. Wishing we'd be in some other configuration of limbs and parts, one that was more familiar and automatically happens for me like intimate clockwork. ""Relax, give me your leg,"" he instructs and I start to fall over like the Leaning Tower of Pisa or a big oak tree in the middle of the woods, unstoppable. ""One leg like this."" And while I'm covering my face and my cheeks glow pink like those same watermelon-colored polish bits, he slings my left leg in front of me and the next thing I know I feel like an Olympic Fat Flo-Jo mid-stride. All I can do is cling onto his broad shoulders or else I'll wipe out and roll off the side of the king-sized pillow top mattress and onto the carpet with a mortifying naked thud. And it's smack broad daylight in the room.The fact that I am sucking at this unfamiliar position (which is, of course, totally familiar for most people) strikes me to my core. No, no, no, not ME I'm confident! I'm self-aware! People look up to me! Women bare their arms, inspired by my pictures -- how can this be happening? Who am I if I'm BAD at this?I'm gripping onto his forearm, my body uncooperatively moving when it strikes me.... This feels good. Really good. nd something in my body must change, because he notices. ""See? Chill out. Gravity,"" he exhales. ""Use it.""""Are you OK?"" I ask about four times in a row while he nods and nods and just tells me to shush and relax and calm down. I am acutely aware that I'm terrible at this. And I hate myself for being so clumsy. I hate my short legs and my thick thighs and my bouncy mid-section. But in between the beats of self-loathing is increasing pleasure that I felt fairly certain was saved for the More Perfect Version of Sarah that lives somewhere inside me. I read somewhere that the definition of confidence isn't believing you are great at everything, with an infallible and false sense of perfection. Instead, that confidence is a comfort and ease with knowing what we do have and what we have not achieved. At the second I recall this, I calm down. Yeah, I'm pretty bad at this move right here. But I can get better at it. This is who I am. This is the body I have right now. And I'm looking at my level-headed partner who doesn't seem at all fixated on my bouncy mid-section, but seems pretty damn invested in me enjoying myself, bouncy mid-section and all. 12 seconds after the panic first kicks in, I conclude that I am exactly the same person I was only moments ago. My sense of self, my pride and my well-earned knowledge, have not slipped away. I am not less of a woman. Flailing, falling tree or no, I am still myself. My confidence is intact. I've simply found a thing I have not achieved yet. And that is OK.And as I roll to the side minutes later, laughing, flushed and tangled in a bed sheet, I note that next time, I won't apologize. I'll jump on and run to the finish line like Flo Jo. And one day, I'll win the damn race.Also on HuffPost:"

Yet when he began teaching Mindfulness to Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippin and the Chicago Bulls, he couldn't even use the word mindfulness. It was considered too out there. Instead he had to be a chameleon; carefully choosing words that wouldn't scare the players.George Mumford with Best Selling Author and Meditation Teacher Sharon Salzberg at a recent JCC Manhattan Mindfulsness talk --- Image by Michael Sandler Yet these days, mindfulness is hot, and it's all over the place. You can read it in the subway, your favorite newspaper, such as the Boston Globe, Washington Post, or New York Times, you can watch it on Sixty Minutes, or even find it in your Costco magazine. The term's shed its woo-woo pedigree, and it's become something of a household word.But what is mindfulness, how do you live it, and what does it mean for you? These are questions George Mumford set about to answer in his beautiful new book, The Mindful Athlete. It's a story in part of Mumford's own redemption, of his personal struggle with a powerful addiction and severe negative self-talk issues, or what he refers to as ""stinkin' thinkin"". He shares how he turned it all around, has been clean for 31 years, and has taught what he's learned. His book is also a guide to living mindfully 24/7, not just when sitting on the cushion. It's not so much a day-to-day, how-to manual, but general guidelines we can put it into practice, and reminders to help us live more from the heart and with integrity and to go beyond the illusion of separateness--where we're all interconnected. George Mumford with his new book, The Mindful AthleteIn college George wanted to play for the NBA, ironically, his roommate was the incredible Dr. J himself. But while Dr. J went on to greatness on the court, George struggled badly with injuries, pain and later addiction. It wasn't until George found mindfulness, that'd he'd make an equally impressive mark on the game. Years later, after studying mindfulness under Jon Kabat-Zinn, author Wherever You Go, There You Are, and founder of the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine at the University of Massachusetts, George began teaching mindfulness to a program for prison inmates. While there, George discovered how he could help inmates take triggers that once caused incredible anxiety and even violent melt-downs, and flip them on their heads, so these same triggers helped them become quiet, introspective, and even more peaceful. During this time, Phil Jackson approached George to work with the Chicago Bulls. The Bulls were a mess, they'd lost their star player, Michael Jordan, who'd gone to baseball, and they couldn't pull it together. George stepped up to the plate and helped bring a team together. He worked with Phil Jackson on the idea of five fingers, one breath and one mind, in essence community building, or as George puts it ""putting the we before the me, while nurturing the me""--where each individual brings his own skills, but let's go of his ego, the entire team works together as one. The team improved, and of course, Michael Jordan came back. George Mumford worked closely with Jordan, as he has with Kobe and many of the other NBA greats. He helped Michael learn to eliminate distractions, to take game-winning perfect jumpers and The Shot in the 1989 playoffs we all remember so well.  Michael Jordan in Contemplation. Photo Courtesy Cliff According to George, Michael Jordan said ""that Zen Buddhist stuff"" really works! But he didn't teach Michael to push distractions away, but instead to embrace them, to become fully aware, noticing and observing everything around him, and then to let it all go; stepping out of his own way and taking the perfect shot. I think we all want to take the perfect shot in life. But we're often too distracted. Cell phones, billboards, the internet, cars honking, kids screaming, you name it, we're constantly pulled left and right. But it's actually not much different than Jordan. Pressure, sponsors, thousands of screaming fans, guys yelling, bumping and sweating, and him needing to quiet the mind, let go of it all, and take that perfect shot.George Mumford shows you how to do this: How to let go of it all, so you can live better and thrive in the present moment. His book is filled with tips, reminders and guidance to help you on your way. But I think it's more than that, it's a guidebook on being a better person, by being present and living truly mindfully and with integrity. George says he walks around in a state of love, blessings, and continuous forgiveness. I get it, and his book is filled with heart. The Mindful Athlete starts with his unabashed story or addiction and having his ""ass on fire"". I found his story incredibly inspiring and helpful for anyone facing addiction or any major personal challenge or crisis. In the middle he teaches and guides about mindfulness and life, before wrapping up talking about spirit and connecting with your higher self. I believe that's what's most important to him, what changed his life, saved him from addiction, and what he hopes to impart on those he coaches as well.There were a few things missing from this book I would have liked to have seen. First, I love the era of Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls, and Phil Jackson with the Lakers. I would love to have had a court-side seat with George in the book, to see what the players were thinking, or not thinking, how they meditated, what they thought about meditating, and exactly what George was teaching them.  Kobe Bryant Focused and In the Now. Photo Courtesy Cliff And I would have also loved to have heard more about what Michael Jordan himself thought of meditating, of sitting on a cushion, and of quieting his mind. How spiritual was his practice? How often did he meditate? And how often do the Knicks meditate now? I think sharing what ball players thought of meditation and sharing their practices could help positively influence kids today, and help us all get to the cushion. Last, I'd like to have seen more day-to-day, here's how you do it stuff. I know that wasn't the purpose of this book, and its already filled to the brim with useful information. But as a coach I always want more functional how-to, step-by-step daily guidance. Mumford said people were asking him for 20 years to write this book, maybe we can get him to write a sequel, perhaps a coaching guide, just a bit faster this time. To Mumford, mind, body, and spirit are all inseparable. He believes we all have a divine spark or divinity within, whether you call it Christ-Consciousness, our Buddha Nature, or simply Divine Nature. And like Michelangelo, chipping away at the marble, by practicing mindfulness and becoming more aware, we can expose the beauty and greatness that is within each one of us. Through mindfulness he hopes you'll discover something sacred inside of yourself, and live with greater joy, love, and compassion.Whoops, ""compassion"" is one word Mumford still won't use with his players--too ""woo-woo"" he'd say! Instead he might go, ""Don't be hatin' on em!""Woo-woo or not, compassion is needed today more than ever, and perhaps mindfulness can help bring us there. Through Mumford's book, we can all learn to be Mindful Athletes in our day-to-day lives.Best-selling author Michael Sandler has been spearheading mindfulness through MindfulRunning.org and RunBare.com.

The team improved, and of course, Michael Jordan came back. George Mumford worked closely with Jordan, as he has with Kobe and many of the other NBA greats. He helped Michael learn to eliminate distractions, to take game-winning perfect jumpers and The Shot in the 1989 playoffs we all remember so well.  Michael Jordan in Contemplation. Photo Courtesy Cliff According to George, Michael Jordan said ""that Zen Buddhist stuff"" really works! But he didn't teach Michael to push distractions away, but instead to embrace them, to become fully aware, noticing and observing everything around him, and then to let it all go; stepping out of his own way and taking the perfect shot. I think we all want to take the perfect shot in life. But we're often too distracted. Cell phones, billboards, the internet, cars honking, kids screaming, you name it, we're constantly pulled left and right. But it's actually not much different than Jordan. Pressure, sponsors, thousands of screaming fans, guys yelling, bumping and sweating, and him needing to quiet the mind, let go of it all, and take that perfect shot.George Mumford shows you how to do this: How to let go of it all, so you can live better and thrive in the present moment. His book is filled with tips, reminders and guidance to help you on your way. But I think it's more than that, it's a guidebook on being a better person, by being present and living truly mindfully and with integrity. George says he walks around in a state of love, blessings, and continuous forgiveness. I get it, and his book is filled with heart. The Mindful Athlete starts with his unabashed story or addiction and having his ""ass on fire"". I found his story incredibly inspiring and helpful for anyone facing addiction or any major personal challenge or crisis. In the middle he teaches and guides about mindfulness and life, before wrapping up talking about spirit and connecting with your higher self. I believe that's what's most important to him, what changed his life, saved him from addiction, and what he hopes to impart on those he coaches as well.There were a few things missing from this book I would have liked to have seen. First, I love the era of Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls, and Phil Jackson with the Lakers. I would love to have had a court-side seat with George in the book, to see what the players were thinking, or not thinking, how they meditated, what they thought about meditating, and exactly what George was teaching them.  Kobe Bryant Focused and In the Now. Photo Courtesy Cliff And I would have also loved to have heard more about what Michael Jordan himself thought of meditating, of sitting on a cushion, and of quieting his mind. How spiritual was his practice? How often did he meditate? And how often do the Knicks meditate now? I think sharing what ball players thought of meditation and sharing their practices could help positively influence kids today, and help us all get to the cushion. Last, I'd like to have seen more day-to-day, here's how you do it stuff. I know that wasn't the purpose of this book, and its already filled to the brim with useful information. But as a coach I always want more functional how-to, step-by-step daily guidance. Mumford said people were asking him for 20 years to write this book, maybe we can get him to write a sequel, perhaps a coaching guide, just a bit faster this time. To Mumford, mind, body, and spirit are all inseparable. He believes we all have a divine spark or divinity within, whether you call it Christ-Consciousness, our Buddha Nature, or simply Divine Nature. And like Michelangelo, chipping away at the marble, by practicing mindfulness and becoming more aware, we can expose the beauty and greatness that is within each one of us. Through mindfulness he hopes you'll discover something sacred inside of yourself, and live with greater joy, love, and compassion.Whoops, ""compassion"" is one word Mumford still won't use with his players--too ""woo-woo"" he'd say! Instead he might go, ""Don't be hatin' on em!""Woo-woo or not, compassion is needed today more than ever, and perhaps mindfulness can help bring us there.

Photo Courtesy CliffGeorge Mumford may not be a household name, but if you've ever followed basketball then you've likely seen his work. If you've seen the Three Peat by the Bulls, the Lakers' championships, Michael Jordan's famous championship-winning jump shot, Kobe Bryant's magic, or even Shaquille O'Neil driving the lane, then you've seen the tip of his iceberg. He's the mindfulness coach and secret weapon behind Phil Jackson and many of the most successful NBA players and teams in the sport. At first glance, you'd never think George Mumford, with his NBA-like stature, giant hands, and strong yet calming presence, would be considered very woo-woo. Yet when he began teaching Mindfulness to Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippin and the Chicago Bulls, he couldn't even use the word mindfulness. It was considered too out there. Instead he had to be a chameleon; carefully choosing words that wouldn't scare the players.George Mumford with Best Selling Author and Meditation Teacher Sharon Salzberg at a recent JCC Manhattan Mindfulsness talk --- Image by Michael Sandler Yet these days, mindfulness is hot, and it's all over the place. You can read it in the subway, your favorite newspaper, such as the Boston Globe, Washington Post, or New York Times, you can watch it on Sixty Minutes, or even find it in your Costco magazine. The term's shed its woo-woo pedigree, and it's become something of a household word.But what is mindfulness, how do you live it, and what does it mean for you? These are questions George Mumford set about to answer in his beautiful new book, The Mindful Athlete. It's a story in part of Mumford's own redemption, of his personal struggle with a powerful addiction and severe negative self-talk issues, or what he refers to as ""stinkin' thinkin"". He shares how he turned it all around, has been clean for 31 years, and has taught what he's learned. His book is also a guide to living mindfully 24/7, not just when sitting on the cushion. It's not so much a day-to-day, how-to manual, but general guidelines we can put it into practice, and reminders to help us live more from the heart and with integrity and to go beyond the illusion of separateness--where we're all interconnected. George Mumford with his new book, The Mindful AthleteIn college George wanted to play for the NBA, ironically, his roommate was the incredible Dr. J himself. But while Dr. J went on to greatness on the court, George struggled badly with injuries, pain and later addiction. It wasn't until George found mindfulness, that'd he'd make an equally impressive mark on the game. Years later, after studying mindfulness under Jon Kabat-Zinn, author Wherever You Go, There You Are, and founder of the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine at the University of Massachusetts, George began teaching mindfulness to a program for prison inmates. While there, George discovered how he could help inmates take triggers that once caused incredible anxiety and even violent melt-downs, and flip them on their heads, so these same triggers helped them become quiet, introspective, and even more peaceful. During this time, Phil Jackson approached George to work with the Chicago Bulls. The Bulls were a mess, they'd lost their star player, Michael Jordan, who'd gone to baseball, and they couldn't pull it together. George stepped up to the plate and helped bring a team together.

13,POLITICS,Planet Politics: The Bushes Are Back,Howard Fineman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/planet-politics-bush_n_7534700.html,,2015-06-15,"Campaign intern Jack Nalen hands out signs at Miami Dade College in Miami, Monday, June 15, 2015, before former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is expected to formally join the race for president with a speech. (AP Photo/David Goldman)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8fef02400005000577e38.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- America’s founders hated what Thomas Jefferson called “an artificial aristocracy founded on wealth and birth.”So you have to wonder what they would think of Barbara Pierce Bush, the 90-year-old, snowy-haired, tart-tongued, blue-blooded matriarch of the Bush family dynasty, who grew up in the wealthy New York suburb of Rye.She is the distant cousin of one president (Franklin Pierce), the spouse of one president (George Herbert Walker Bush), the mother of another president (George Walker Bush) and the mother of another son who Monday announced that he, too, is running for president: John Ellis “Jeb” Bush. Is Jeb Bush “artificial” and thus doomed to be resented and dismissed by average (Jeffersonian) American voters? Is he the kind of aristocrat -- self-made of his own “virtues and talents” -- that Jefferson praised and that American voters often have elected?  We’re about to find out.  As of Monday, being a Bush has been as much (if not more) of a burden than it has been a blessing for Jeb. His family contacts have allowed to him to build a war chest of perhaps $100 million. He has built-in contacts in key states and has no trouble getting attention.  But he has been hampered by questions about his older brother’s controversial record, especially George W.’s fateful decision to invade Iraq in 2003. Almost everyone else in America, including his hawkish rivals for the Republican presidential nomination, have now branded the Iraq War an ignorant, colossal mistake.  And yet Jeb seemed surprised when asked about it, and at first defended his brother out of what he said was family loyalty. After days of dodging hesitation, he finally joined with rest.  And he has the burden of inheriting, by inference, his father and brother’s reputations as relative ideological moderates, especially by the Tea Party standards of today’s hard-right GOP.Jeb has tried to prove his conservative bona fides by being stoutly opposed to abortion and gay marriage. But his family’s history of more open-minded views make Jeb’s own cautious moderation on immigration and public education all the more suspect to the right.Bush unveiled his campaign slogan Monday and it was one word and an exclamation point -- ""Jeb!"" -- with no mention of ""Bush.""  As he enters the race, Jeb is in an unusual position for a member of such a prominent, if not historic, family: not really a clear front-runner, and nowhere near a prohibitive favorite. The smartest money at this moment is on two much younger men, both more conservative and utterly self-made: Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida.In theory, the world’s oldest modern democracy should see a constant churn of names and faces in high places. In truth, political dynasties in America are common and, arguably, becoming more so at a time when Big Money -- personal and corporate -- means so much to the conduct of elections.And with Jeb’s announcement, the United States and the world face at least the possibility of a 2016 campaign between two dynasties: the Bushes and the Clintons.And it would be a familiar exercise. From 1980 through 2008, the U.S. conducted seven general elections with a Bush or Clinton on the ballot.There are advantages to the Bush name and tradition -- and not just connections and access to a giant contributor list.The Bushes “aren’t the freshest fruit in the basket,” said historian Evan Thomas, who has written extensively on the family. “But they appeal because, to a lot of people, they project an old-fashioned image of service to the country.”They also have a knack for embodying elements of social change -- a kind of dynasty by adaptation, if you will. H.W. Bush moved to Texas as a young man, just when the U.S. “Sun Belt” was becoming the base of the new Republican Party; George W. cemented that trend and built upon it.Jeb Bush settled in Florida, now the ultimate “swing” state. And, as fate would have it, he is well positioned to woo the now most influential voting bloc: Hispanics. He speaks fluent Spanish, and has been married since 1974 to Columba Garnica de Gallo Bush of Leon, Mexico. The couple has three children, one now in politics, too.When Jeb and Columba’s kids were young, the first President Bush referred to them jokingly as “the little brown ones.” The comment was seen as a colossal gaffe; now it’s a potent truth.In his two terms as governor of Florida, from 1999 to 2007, Jeb Bush -- pushed along by the rightward drift of his party -- took mostly conservative political positions: pro-life, anti-gay marriage, pro-massive tax cuts and anti-business regulation. There were exceptions, on environmental issues, immigration and education standards, but he moved to the right on those and others as he prepared to launch an appeal to the GOP’s core voters.All the while he and the family have kept their ties to their old base in New England -- roots symbolized by the Bush summer home at Walker’s Point in Kennebunkport, on the Atlantic coast of Maine. Jeb is even building a vacation home in the family compound. It’ll be ready next summer.“The Bushes have the capacity to embody shifting demographic realities,” said historian Jon Meacham, whose book on the first President Bush, Destiny and Power: The American Odyssey of George H.W. Bush, will be published in November by Random House. “It’s the combination of Walker’s Point (in Maine) with Texas and Florida that has made them a durable political force.”What some might call aristocracy by adaptation others call by less flattering terms: elitism and the power of corporate money.The Bushes are all too aware that now is not a moment to be thought of as a professional politician, let alone the scion of a political dynasty. American voters -- indeed, voters worldwide -- have soured on politics as it falls ever more tightly into the grip of ultra-rich individuals and global corporations.Even Republicans -- the party of business, tax cuts and corporate power -- are facing a grassroots rebellion with the kind of populist fervor that could make life difficult for Jeb Bush.“I sincerely hope the Bushes are done,” said a top GOP strategist who is working for one of Jeb’s Republican rivals.  “The only thing he has got is name recognition and establishment money,” said this adviser, who insisted on anonymity. “And he would be the worst of all candidates to run against Hillary, because we would lose the advantage on the ‘dynasty” argument.”Jeb, at 62 years of age, has another, more personal burden: The elder Bushes have always considered him their child most suited to be president. Failure now would be a bitter family scenario.Jeb was the “smart one” -- the academic, almost wonky one. He was a superb student at the University of Texas. He enjoys reading detailed papers as much as his older brother, former President George Walker Bush, enjoys reading the sports pages. He is the master of every topic he discusses, which are many. Most of the time he can duck and dodge skillfully, or take a stand and drive his point home.And he is tall -- 6’3”, or 1.92 meters, a good 4 inches or more taller than W. This matters to the Bush family: they like tall and lanky. It comports with their idea of themselves. In 1991, at a White House state dinner hosted by his father and mother, George W. joked to Queen Elizabeth that he was “the black sheep in the family.” He meant, in part, the runt.Two years after their father lost a bid for a second term, Jeb and George in 1994 began their political journeys to the top. Jeb ran for governor of Florida; George for governor of Texas.The assumption outside the family was that Jeb would win and George would lose. The hope WITHIN the family was that, if only one of them could win, it would be Jeb.But, to almost everyone’s shock and surprise, it went the other way -- and the rest, as they say, is history.Twenty-one years after his early train to the White House ran off the rails -- and after years of soul searching, family heartache (a daughter with drug addiction troubles) and a religious conversion to Catholicism -- Jeb is in.In the summer of 1994, I flew with him in a small plane across central Florida. He was on his way to a campaign stop in that first, ultimately unsuccessful run for governor.We flew over the Everglades, the vast, precious and famously threatened wetlands and wildlife refuge. He looked down at the lush expanse below and launched into a discussion of how the water flowed in a shallow invisible river.In the air, he sounded like a knowledgeable would-be public servant.But when we landed at a small rural airport in central Florida, a group of his father’s old political retainers and allies came out to the plane to greet him. They didn’t know him well, but they treated him with automatic respect, affection and loyalty.It did seem a little aristocratic."

By sharing the stories of these individuals, I hope to inspire youth from all over the world to follow their passions, to take the road less traveled and to disrupt the status quo. This is the 22nd post in the Young & Entrepreneurial Series. To read previous features and to stay up to date with future features, like our Facebook page here.  --- Glints, a career discovery platform, has gotten a lot of buzz in the last few months because of its three young and entrepreneurial founders Oswald Yeo, Ying Cong Seah and Looi Qin En. While a lot of people read the glamorous headlines about these 'Ivy League student dropouts turned entrepreneurs' (the trio spent one semester at the University of California Berkeley, the Wharton Business School and Stanford University respectively), not many people have written about the challenges that these three faced.I first came across the Glints team when this article by the Straits Times was being shared by all my Singaporean friends on Facebook. This was followed by another feature article by the Daily Pennsylvanian on Ying Cong Seah, the Wharton student founder of Glints. These two articles piqued my interest and so when I found out that I would be interning for the Joyful Frog Digital Incubator (JFDI) Asia, the same accelerator the Glints Founders went through, I knew I just had to feature this trio of young entrepreneurs. From left to right: Ying Cong Seah, Oswald Yeo, Looi Qin En; Photo taken from GlintsWith the help of mutual friends and a few Facebook exchanges, I got the chance to sit down with Oswald Yeo and Ying Cong Seah and hear their story for myself.The Glints founding team first met each other back in junior college, won a few business plan competitions, and realized that they wanted to do something beyond just having a written business plan. And they figured, the two years in National Service (a Singaporean requirement) would be the best time to start--this is where their first obstacle would come from.Ying Cong shared, ""We knew people were looking for internships and we knew startups that were looking for interns. That to us was a very clear sign that we had to do something about it, not necessarily as a business but something we could do to help our friends and the ecosystem.""Oswald added, ""I've always wanted doing my own things. Entrepreneurship gives you a good sandbox for creating your own ideas and turning them into a reality.""The First Road Block: 'The Military Incident'  This entrepreneurial spirit wouldn't mesh too well with the rules of the Singapore military. While Glints started out as a social enterprise or movement type of thing, an intern at a Singaporean media outlet would cover the three young founders with a news article headline, ""Full time national servicemen starting a business"". While her intention was to promote youth entrepreneurship, the military didn't agree.Luckily, the Glints team was able to slip out of this one, free of charge because Glints was not really making any revenue yet at that time. In fact, the Glints team took a very lean startup type of approach to doing things. Ying Cong shared, ""We started off very very simple. There wasn't even a website. It was only a Google form where we had people sign up for internship and on the other hand we got companies to sign up for interns. Then we would interview every single one of them and we would do the matching manually.""  The Glints team were part of JFDI Accelerate batch 2014A; Photo taken from GlintsThe Next Steps - The 100-Day Journey at JFDI Asia  After the army, the Glints team had around 8 months before university started. At this time, the Glints team would come across top Asia accelerator, Joyful Frog Digital Incubator (JFDI) Asia by a chance entrepreneurship event that the team had attended. Ying Cong Shared, ""We listened to a talk then we realized that JFDI wasn't an events space but an accelerator. To our good fortune, we got in and we began our 100 day journey.""Oswald shared, ""Prior to JFDI, it was the three of us in a very small office and whenever we got stuck, we only had each other and the four walls. That was terrible. We had no one to talk to. We didn't know anything about the startup process.""But with JFDI, the team was able to find a community of mentors and like-minded individuals that they could rely on. Oswald said, "" The biggest benefits were the mentors and having the community and bringing this sort of structured process to this chaos of entrepreneurship.""'Build something people want'  Oswald emphasized how JFDI really helped the team break down the process of starting a company into actionable steps. He shared, ""During the market validation phase, they told us to get out of the building and ask customers what they wanted and that's what we did."" Oswald recalled going to the National University of Singapore and spending the whole day just picking random strangers and asking them questions then gathering the data from the interviews. This process led the team to pivot from being an internship agency to what it is today, a curated discovery and development platform. This pivot came from the realization that people don't really care about the internship itself but more about the value of the internship in terms of improving their skillset, gaining work experience and finding future job prospects.Ying Cong shared, ""Being able to understand these deeper motivations of why people come to these companies for internships helped us develop a more comprehensive suite of services."" This suite includes the training program of Glints to help students prepare for their internships and jobs. Glints CEO Oswald Yeo pitching to 500 Startups Founding Partner Dave McClure; Photo taken from Glints'Ask for money and you will get advice; Ask for advice and you will get money'  One of the big challenges the Glints team faced was the fundraising process after they had finished the 100-Day JFDI Accelerate program. They only had one month left to do so before they had to start university. All the odds were stacked against them.Ying Cong shared, ""There was so much uncertainty in our lives, and there were only a few weeks left and what we heard from alumni was that it takes at least half a year to even close a round. We were very drained in running a startup for a year already. We wanted to continue seeing that vision through but at the same time, we wanted to balance school, our parents and having customers and investors.""Oswald added, ""I took 40-50 investor meetings and most of them were rejections.

By sharing the stories of these individuals, I hope to inspire youth from all over the world to follow their passions, to take the road less traveled and to disrupt the status quo. This is the 22nd post in the Young & Entrepreneurial Series. To read previous features and to stay up to date with future features, like our Facebook page here.  --- Glints, a career discovery platform, has gotten a lot of buzz in the last few months because of its three young and entrepreneurial founders Oswald Yeo, Ying Cong Seah and Looi Qin En. While a lot of people read the glamorous headlines about these 'Ivy League student dropouts turned entrepreneurs' (the trio spent one semester at the University of California Berkeley, the Wharton Business School and Stanford University respectively), not many people have written about the challenges that these three faced.I first came across the Glints team when this article by the Straits Times was being shared by all my Singaporean friends on Facebook. This was followed by another feature article by the Daily Pennsylvanian on Ying Cong Seah, the Wharton student founder of Glints. These two articles piqued my interest and so when I found out that I would be interning for the Joyful Frog Digital Incubator (JFDI) Asia, the same accelerator the Glints Founders went through, I knew I just had to feature this trio of young entrepreneurs. From left to right: Ying Cong Seah, Oswald Yeo, Looi Qin En; Photo taken from GlintsWith the help of mutual friends and a few Facebook exchanges, I got the chance to sit down with Oswald Yeo and Ying Cong Seah and hear their story for myself.The Glints founding team first met each other back in junior college, won a few business plan competitions, and realized that they wanted to do something beyond just having a written business plan. And they figured, the two years in National Service (a Singaporean requirement) would be the best time to start--this is where their first obstacle would come from.Ying Cong shared, ""We knew people were looking for internships and we knew startups that were looking for interns. That to us was a very clear sign that we had to do something about it, not necessarily as a business but something we could do to help our friends and the ecosystem.""Oswald added, ""I've always wanted doing my own things. Entrepreneurship gives you a good sandbox for creating your own ideas and turning them into a reality.""The First Road Block: 'The Military Incident'  This entrepreneurial spirit wouldn't mesh too well with the rules of the Singapore military. While Glints started out as a social enterprise or movement type of thing, an intern at a Singaporean media outlet would cover the three young founders with a news article headline, ""Full time national servicemen starting a business"". While her intention was to promote youth entrepreneurship, the military didn't agree.Luckily, the Glints team was able to slip out of this one, free of charge because Glints was not really making any revenue yet at that time. In fact, the Glints team took a very lean startup type of approach to doing things. Ying Cong shared, ""We started off very very simple. There wasn't even a website. It was only a Google form where we had people sign up for internship and on the other hand we got companies to sign up for interns. Then we would interview every single one of them and we would do the matching manually.""  The Glints team were part of JFDI Accelerate batch 2014A; Photo taken from GlintsThe Next Steps - The 100-Day Journey at JFDI Asia  After the army, the Glints team had around 8 months before university started. At this time, the Glints team would come across top Asia accelerator, Joyful Frog Digital Incubator (JFDI) Asia by a chance entrepreneurship event that the team had attended. Ying Cong Shared, ""We listened to a talk then we realized that JFDI wasn't an events space but an accelerator. To our good fortune, we got in and we began our 100 day journey.""Oswald shared, ""Prior to JFDI, it was the three of us in a very small office and whenever we got stuck, we only had each other and the four walls. That was terrible. We had no one to talk to. We didn't know anything about the startup process.""But with JFDI, the team was able to find a community of mentors and like-minded individuals that they could rely on. Oswald said, "" The biggest benefits were the mentors and having the community and bringing this sort of structured process to this chaos of entrepreneurship.""'Build something people want'  Oswald emphasized how JFDI really helped the team break down the process of starting a company into actionable steps. He shared, ""During the market validation phase, they told us to get out of the building and ask customers what they wanted and that's what we did."" Oswald recalled going to the National University of Singapore and spending the whole day just picking random strangers and asking them questions then gathering the data from the interviews. This process led the team to pivot from being an internship agency to what it is today, a curated discovery and development platform. This pivot came from the realization that people don't really care about the internship itself but more about the value of the internship in terms of improving their skillset, gaining work experience and finding future job prospects.Ying Cong shared, ""Being able to understand these deeper motivations of why people come to these companies for internships helped us develop a more comprehensive suite of services."" This suite includes the training program of Glints to help students prepare for their internships and jobs. Glints CEO Oswald Yeo pitching to 500 Startups Founding Partner Dave McClure; Photo taken from Glints'Ask for money and you will get advice; Ask for advice and you will get money'  One of the big challenges the Glints team faced was the fundraising process after they had finished the 100-Day JFDI Accelerate program. They only had one month left to do so before they had to start university. All the odds were stacked against them.Ying Cong shared, ""There was so much uncertainty in our lives, and there were only a few weeks left and what we heard from alumni was that it takes at least half a year to even close a round. We were very drained in running a startup for a year already. We wanted to continue seeing that vision through but at the same time, we wanted to balance school, our parents and having customers and investors.""Oswald added, ""I took 40-50 investor meetings and most of them were rejections. But we were very lucky to have met the right people who believed in us.""  All the hustling paid off, as right before school started, the Glints team was able to close a round of funding.Oswald shared, ""The best advice we got in terms of fundraising is, 'Ask for money and you will get advice.

The Confederations Cup kicks off 15 June. AFP PHOTO JOHN MACDOUGALL (Photo credit should read JOHN MACDOUGALL/AFP/Getty Images),https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ba2be452200005700da7101.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This is one of a series of posts discussing what the FIFA case might tell us about the American criminal justice system. Click here for the introduction, here for ""Part 1: Pretrial Publicity,"" and here for ""Part 2: How the Government's Story Develops.""The announcements that several defendants in the FIFA case have pled guilty and are cooperating with the government signaled that this case will showcase one of the most controversial aspects of the American justice system -- the federal government's practice of giving certain defendants more lenient sentences in exchange for their testimony against others.The practice is straightforward. In many multi-defendant cases, initial targets are told what types of sentences they can expect upon conviction, and then given the opportunity to reduce those sentences through ""cooperation"" -- typically in the form of testimony against other defendants. The reductions can be dramatic; sentences that would otherwise be measured in decades can drop to a few years or even probation. It's common knowledge among both prosecutors and defense attorneys that this type of ""cooperation"" is often a defendant's most realistic shot at salvaging some part of the rest of his life.It's also a deeply troubling system. Whether it's even remotely compatible with fairness and justice depends on how it works in practice. If, as prosecutors contend, ""cooperation credit"" is simply a reward for ""telling the truth,"" it's at least theoretically legitimate. If, on the other hand, it's a way of essentially purchasing specific testimony -- ""if you say X, you'll get less time"" -- we'd probably all agree that such a practice is deeply repugnant and thoroughly inconsistent with any notion of fair play.In fact, it's the second of those descriptions that best fits the federal cooperation system, as anyone who's seen the system at work knows. Here's why.First, if prosecutors merely want to compel someone's testimony without seeking to influence the content of that testimony, they don't have to offer any sentencing leniency. Testifying in a criminal case isn't optional; a prosecutor can simply serve a subpoena on a witness, at which point the witness is legally compelled to show up and testify under oath. If the witness ""takes the Fifth"" and claims that his testimony might be self-incriminating -- one of the few legally recognized ways a subpoenaed witness can avoid testifying -- the prosecutors can get an ""immunity"" order guaranteeing that the testimony won't be used against him, at which point he has to testify. So the offer of cooperation credit has to be designed to do something more than just secure whatever testimony the witness would otherwise give if placed under oath.Second, in negotiating with a potential cooperator, prosecutors have ways of making it very clear what testimony they want to hear. Usually, it's not stated as explicitly as, for example, ""we need you to testify that Mr. X knew the consulting agreement was phony."" But the delicate dance that actually takes place is just as effective in getting the message across.The process typically starts with a ""proffer"" session, a meeting in which the potential cooperator (or her attorney) gives the prosecutor a preview of what her testimony would be. Before this point, the prosecutor has probably signaled what he's interested in -- who the ultimate targets are, and what he would like to charge them with -- so there's already a strong incentive to tailor the proffered testimony to what will be most beneficial. Then, during and after the proffer, the prosecutor can let the cooperator and her attorney know how valuable they think the information is; that is, what type of sentencing reduction it's likely to bring. There is often a message -- sometimes implicit, sometimes explicit -- that the information is helpful, but it would really be great if the cooperator happened to recall certain other things. There may then be follow-up proffer sessions at which, not surprisingly, those additional details emerge.Lastly, the government ensures that the cooperating witness remains highly motivated to please the prosecutors throughout the cases against the ultimate targets. In the typical case, the cooperator agrees to plead guilty immediately, but to have her sentencing proceeding postponed until after the targets' cases have concluded through trial or otherwise. The prosecutors promise that if the cooperator fulfills the terms of her deal, the government will recommend a reduced sentence for her. They also warn, however, that they will not make this recommendation if they determine that the cooperator has not testified ""truthfully."" Of course, the cooperator knows what the ""truth"" is in the prosecutors' eyes.Would anyone seriously dispute that this practice creates enormous risks that witnesses will adapt their testimony to whatever the prosecutors want to hear? In light of the immense pressure brought to bear -- often, the threat of a draconian prison sentence, coupled with other life-altering consequences -- it's understandable that even the most honest, upstanding witnesses might give in. And these cooperators all have at least two characteristics that would normally prompt us to view them more suspiciously than we would the average person. First, according to the government, these witnesses are guilty of their own serious felonies. Second, the very act of offering cooperation credit is an acknowledgment that these are witnesses who need special inducements to testify ""truthfully."" How can we possibly subject such presumptively questionable witnesses to such powerful influences and expect that what we'll get in the end is ""the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth""?Interestingly, some years ago a federal appellate court did the unthinkable and concluded that this longstanding practice violated a federal statute that criminalized ""giv[ing], offer[ing] or promis[ing] anything of value"" to a witness ""for or because of"" that witness's testimony. The government, predictably, was apoplectic. The court quickly reversed course in an ""en banc"" opinion, in which the full membership of an appellate court reviews a decision by one of its three-member panels. Remarkably, no one seems to have disagreed with the basic principle that in ""cooperation"" cases prosecutors are, in fact, giving, offering and promising something of immense value to their witnesses for and because of their testimony. The court simply concluded that Congress couldn't possibly have meant to say that prosecutors can't do this -- as it stated with commendable candor, ""this particular statute does not exist for the government.""It's hard to decide what's most disturbing -- this and other courts' belief that it would be absurd to apply a please-don't-bribe-witnesses statute to federal prosecutors, or the oft-stated justification that if prosecutors were in fact held to the same standards as all other attorneys, the justice system as we know it would grind to a halt. If that's really the case, perhaps it's the system that's the problem. If the government can't win its cases without purchasing testimony from presumptively unreliable ""cooperators"" -- in a manner that would get other lawyers criminally charged and disbarred -- is there a point at which we ask whether those cases really ought to be won? In any event, the ""cooperation"" system proceeds apace, in the FIFA case as in others. So as details continue to emerge from cooperators, and as guilty pleas and verdicts follow, it's worth asking whether we're comfortable with the inevitably tainted stories that this system encourages."
19,POLITICS,Fast Track Down,"Lori Wallach, ContributorDirector, Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fast-track-down_b_7585108.html,"To understand what comes next, it's worth unpacking what exactly happened on Friday and how we got there.",2015-06-15,"House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio listens at left as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif. speaks on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, May 21, 2015, before Boehner signed the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act during a ceremony. The legislation expands law enforcement tools to target sex traffickers and creates a new fund to help victims. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb9002924000051009901c5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Fast Track trade authority package was rejected Friday because two years of effort by a vast corporate coalition, the White House and GOP leaders -- and weeks of deals swapped for yes votes -- could not assuage a majority in the House of Representatives facing constituents' concerns that more of the same trade policy would kill more jobs, push down wages and open a Pandora's box of other damaging consequences. Proponents of Fast Tracking the almost-completed, controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) say they are coming back this week for another try. And the White House was on full tilt this weekend trying to pressure House Democrats to flip their votes. But the path to enactment of Fast Track remains unclear, even as the corporate coalition, White House and GOP leaders remain hell bent on finding it.To understand what comes next, it's worth unpacking what exactly happened on Friday and how we got there. The sum of it was that Byzantine procedural gimmicks designed to overcome what polls show is broad opposition to Fast Track by GOP, Democratic and Independent voters backfired. Since the Fast Tracked 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement revealed what really was at stake with the arcane Nixon-era procedure, getting any Congress to delegate years of blank-check Fast Track authority has been a very hard sell. Since 1988, only Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush persuaded Congress to grant the multi-year Fast Track delegation President Barack Obama seeks. In 1998, 171 House Democrats and 71 GOP rejected President Bill Clinton's request. As a result, Congress has only allowed Fast Track to go into effect for five of the past 21 years.Given past trade pacts have resulted in significant American job loss, the small bloc of Democratic Senators willing to support Fast Track authority insisted the 2015 bill include an extension of Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA). TAA is a program that provides retraining benefits for workers who lose their jobs to trade that was first enacted during the Kennedy administration. GOP leaders also had to make a promise, already broken, to win over the deciding bloc of Senate Democrats, that votes to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank would be scheduled before it expired at the end of June. Many GOP Senators and Representatives oppose TAA, which provides glaring evidence of our current trade policy's damage in the form of a casualty list of the millions of Americans losing their jobs to bad trade policy. Major conservative groups, such as the Heritage Foundation, decry it as a welfare program for unions. And both have waged a fierce effort to kill the Ex-Im Bank.To top it off, the GOP congressional leadership added a $700 million cut to Medicare to offset the cost of the TAA program -- undoubtedly egged on by GOP campaign consultants eager to revive the deadly effective 2012 and 2014 campaign ads against Democrats attacking them for cutting Medicare in the context of an Obamacare pay-for provision. (They expected that the Democrats would vote for TAA and the GOP against, a perfect 2016 election set up.)And the hard-fought Senate battle was the easy part.In the face of the expected fewer than 30 Democratic House votes for Fast Track, the GOP leaders had to maximize House GOP votes for the Fast Track-TAA bill passed by the Senate in order to send it to the president's desk for signature. To do this, the GOP House leaders concocted a fantastical procedural gimmick. They used an arcane procedure called ""dividing the question"" and a ""self-executing rule"" (seriously, that what it's called). Those moves temporarily cracked the Senate-passed bill into three pieces to set up separate votes on Fast Track and TAA. Thus, the GOP could vote no on TAA while voting yes on Fast Track. And the self-executing rule mean that if the House passed the rule for consideration of the Fast Track-TAA package, then the Medicare pay-for language in the package would be deemed passed. Then the rule also would put all of the pieces back together -- if both the TAA and Fast Track votes got majorities. And, Fast Track would be enacted.Apparently, the House GOP leadership believed that Democrats' strong conceptual support for TAA meant that Democrats would deliver the votes to implement the Fast Track almost all oppose, allowing the GOP to vote for Fast Track and against TAA.Except that only 40 Democrats agreed to play by the GOP's rules. The TAA half of the package went down with 302 no votes and only 126 yesses and headlines worldwide reported Fast Track's derailment. (Only 86 of the 245 House GOP voted for the TAA half of the package.) No doubt House Democrats would have preferred to be able to support a multi-year extension of TAA, a program that would provide benefits for tens of thousands of American workers each year hurt by past trade deals. But the version of TAA that the GOP had on offer was woefully underfunded, even without taking into account the many additional workers who would lose jobs were the TPP to go into effect. And, it excluded government service workers, farmers, fishers and more. And, it still included a significant cut to Medicare dialysis funding.But from a wider perspective, the GOP strategy required Democrats to vote for TAA knowing that this would result in the Fast Tracking of a TPP they recognize would result in hundreds of thousands of job losses and downward pressure on all Americans' wages and empower whomever is president for the next six years to Fast Track who knows what additional job-killing trade deals.As she announced her opposition to TAA, Democratic House Leader Nancy Pelosi summed it up: ""Its defeat, sad to say, is the only way that we would be able to slow down the fast track."" And that gets to what comes next. Under the House rules, if the GOP House leaders want to call for a revote on TAA, it must occur by Tuesday night. Or they must pass an extension to extend that option. For a TAA revote to succeed more than 90 Representatives would have to flip to supporting TAA. Passing the TAA half of the bill would then enact Fast Track.But that seems improbable for the pro-Fast Track GOP, given their own views on TAA to say nothing of the political peril that would cause given the passionate opposition by conservative groups. Plus, there is plenty of ire about how the procedural gimmick imploded. Because before the Fast Track bill was derailed, the rule enacting the Medicare cuts was narrowly passed on an almost party-line vote. So, instead of putting all of the Democrats on the record for Medicare cuts, the GOP leadership put all but 34 House GOP on the record voting for big Medicare cuts. Will Democrats flip en masse? Their hard choice on TAA came last week. Painful though it was, even considering the meager TAA program on offer, they decided not to play into the GOP plan to pass Fast Track. That then leaves Fast Track supporters with various other unappealing options. The House GOP could pass a new rule that allows for a vote just on Fast Track. But given the narrow margin on that part of the package, this approach would only work if all of the 27 Democrats who voted for Fast Track and TAA were willing to become responsible for passing Fast Track without TAA. And they must do so now that Democratic Leader Pelosi has made public her opposition to the Fast Track bill and concerns about the TPP it would railroad into place. Plus, winning this strategy would require all of the GOP who voted for Fast Track after TAA failed and it was clear the second vote was only symbolic to vote for Fast Track when it counted.If that approach succeeded, Fast Track still would not be passed. Rather, it would trigger a conference to try to reconcile the different House and Senate bills. And then a conference report would have to be passed by the Senate and House.Friday's outcome was a testament to the strength and diversity of the remarkable coalition of thousands of organizations that overcame a money-soaked lobbying campaign by multinational corporations and intense arm-twisting by the GOP House leadership and the Obama administration. The movement now demanding a new American trade policy is larger and more diverse than in any preceding trade policy fight. It includes everyone from small business leaders and labor unions to Internet freedom advocates and faith groups to family farmers and environmentalists to consumer advocates and LGBT groups to retirees and civil rights groups to law professors and economists.The final chapter for Fast Track, which will greatly affect the fate of the TPP, will be written in the coming weeks."
