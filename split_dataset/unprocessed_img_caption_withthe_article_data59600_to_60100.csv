Boys, and youths from homes with dogs, also had larger declines in breathing problems, the authors reported in JAMA.The researchers caution that the study has some limitations. For example, symptom assessment, based on questionnaire responses, was imprecise.Still, Berhane said the findings are useful.""They could inform policymakers to show that reductions in pollution can result in public health benefits,"" he said.SOURCE: bit.ly/1Ysih5i JAMA, online April 12, 2016."

Described as a short film about cyber-bullying, ""The Principal"" will now be shot in another location, according to The Jackson Clarion-Ledger. Stone, 58, released a statement to Mississippi Film Studios President Rick Moore which cited the state's ""Religious Liberty"" bill, or House Bill 1523, as her incentive for moving the film's production. ""I will not work in any state that holds or is actively creating laws to legally support discrimination against American citizens whether due to their race, religion, gender or sexual orientation,"" the statement reads, according to local news station WDAM, ""nor where those laws are passed or approved by the government of said state."" Pointing to Stone's remarks, Moore told WAPT News that the new legislation has prompted an ""immediate shift in conversation"" in regard to the state's film industry. ""HB 1523 has stirred many passionate opinions, which has unfortunately slowed the momentum of the film industry,"" he said. ""The incentive is still strong to shoot in Mississippi, so I expect independent productions without A-list talent will still consider it an option.""The Huffington Post has reached out to a representative for Stone and is awaiting additional comment. The ""Basic Instinct"" actress, who is an outspoken advocate for the LGBT community, now joins a growing list of luminaries who are condemning the HB 1523, which Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant signed into law April 5. On Monday, rock singer Bryan Adams announced that he was canceling his April 14 performance at the Mississippi Coast Coliseum in Biloxi because of the legislation. "
4,WOMEN,Hillary Clinton Weighs In On The Politics Of 'Splitting The Bill',Alanna Vagianos,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-weighs-in-on-the-politics-of-splitting-the-bill_us_570e48bbe4b08a2d32b875dc,"The presidential hopeful says there's no ""hard and fast rule.""",2016-04-13,"Clinton knows ""splitting the bill"" is a complicated conversation.

""I think splitting the cost on a date has to be evaluated on a kind of case-by-case basis,"" Clinton said. While the topic of splitting the bill is by no means an important question for the upcoming election, it is interesting to see where one of the most powerful women in the world stands on a hotly-debated feminist topic. (Because dating as a feminist can be hard.) Clinton told Cosmo that this ""case-by-case"" basis really depends on the person you're on a date with.You know, many years ago I remember [splitting the bill], and I know a lot of young people who even today do because they kind of consider more casual dates, group dates, to be ones where everybody pays their fair share, but I think you also have to be alert to the feelings of the person that you are dating. If it's important to that person to either split in the beginning of the relationship, or for one or the other of you to pay for whatever combination of reasons, you know, you just have to evaluate that and take it into account. So I don't think there is a hard and fast rule, at least that I have ever seen followed in every instance.The presidential hopeful also weighed in on pay transparency, when Cosmo's Prachi Gupta asked if she's ever discovered she was paid less because she's a woman. ""Over the years, I learned in the jobs that I had where I stood relative to others who were working with me,"" Clinton said. ""A few times, I had jobs that were public jobs, so the compensation was public information, but in the private sector, I was a lawyer and I, at the very beginning of my career, did not know where I stood in terms of pay, but as I got more experience and more confidence about my work, then I felt much more free to ask and so I did to find out where I stood."" Is whether to split the bill a hard-hitting question? Nope. Is it helpful to single feminists everywhere? Yep. Head over to Cosmo to read the rest of Clinton's interview. "

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) received some good news in New Jersey on Tuesday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570e575b1e00008700706ea7.jpeg?cache=wM2VVEua2Q&ops=crop_0_495_4000_2126%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"A New Jersey judge has affirmed that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) is a ""natural born citizen"" under the U.S. Constitution and is therefore still eligible to be president. Throughout the primary campaign, Donald Trump has encouraged doubts about whether Cruz can technically be president, since he was born in Canada. The senator maintains that he is a citizen because of his American-born mother, and he renounced his Canadian citizenship in 2014. Trump supporters have picked up this cause and filed lawsuits in various states challenging Cruz's eligibility. On Tuesday, however, state Administrative Law Judge Jeff Masin sided with Cruz. ""The more persuasive legal analysis is that such a child, born of a citizen-father, citizen-mother, or both, is indeed a 'natural born citizen' within the contemplation of the Constitution,"" he concluded. The suit, brought by a group of New Jersey residents and a Catholic University of America law professor, was intended to prevent Cruz from appearing on the state’s ballot on June 7.The issue now goes to New Jersey Secretary of State Kim Guadagno (R), who can decide whether to accept or reject Masin's decision. Guadagno is also lieutenant governor to Gov. Chris Christie (R), who has endorsed Trump. Victor Williams, one of the challengers in the lawsuit, said he has ""full confidence that Kim Guadagno in Hamilton Township will do the right thing and reject Mr. Cruz’s falsified ballot petition and certificate."" If she does not, he told The Record, he will challenge her decision in state court. Trump has gained national attention over the years for being a birther, most notably going after President Barack Obama.In February, Trump tried to do the same to Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) -- who was born in Miami to immigrant parents -- claiming that the senator might not be eligible to be president either. UPDATE:  April 14 -- On Wednesday, New Jersey Lt. Gov Kim Guadagno (R) adopted the judge's decision in Cruz's favor in its entirety, clearing the way for the senator's appearance on the state's primary ballot. The issue may still be appealed in state court."
6,POLITICS,Tennessee Governor Skeptical Of Anti-Transgender Bathroom Bill,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bill-haslam-anti-lgbt-bill_us_570e98d5e4b0ffa5937df6fa,"""Personally, I am not hearing about problems out in the districts,"" Gov. Bill Haslam said.",2016-04-13,Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam (R) is still deciding whether to sign anti-LGBT legislation.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_0_61_2399_1590%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam (R) expressed concern Wednesday about an anti-transgender bathroom bill before the legislature, giving his strongest indication yet that he might not sign it if it reaches his desk.The legislation would bar transgender students in the state's public schools from using the restroom that corresponds with their gender identity, rather than the gender they were assigned at birth. It's currently being considered by committees in the state House and Senate. Haslam told reporters on Wednesday that he hasn't heard that bathroom use is an issue requiring legislative action, and he's worried the state could lose federal funding by regulating it. ""Personally, I am not hearing about problems out in the districts,"" he said. ""I'm hearing that our school boards have figured out how to adjust to each situation that arises, and to date, I'm not hearing parents say we have problem in our schools today.""On Monday, Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery (R) said passing the bill could cost the state up to $1.2 billion in federal education funding because it could violate anti-discrimination laws. White House spokesman Josh Earnest wouldn't comment Tuesday on how much the legislation could cost Tennessee, but he condemned the bill and warned that the state could suffer economically if it moved forward with it. What I can tell you is that the administration is firmly committed to promoting and defending equal rights of all Americans, including LGBT Americans. And specific laws like this that seek to target and marginalize one small segment of the population is nothing less than mean-spirited. That was true when they passed similar provisions in places like North Carolina and Mississippi, and it’s true even as it’s being considered in a place like Tennessee.The Knoxville News Sentinel reported on Wednesday that Haslam has been getting phone calls and emails from corporate executives worried about the legislation -- and he's listening closely to their concerns. ""Obviously, you have to look at both principle and economics, and that's my role as governor,"" he said. ""My job as governor is different from the legislators. They represent their districts. I have to represent all 6.6 million Tennesseans and come to the best decisions I can.""On Wednesday, the Human Rights Campaign released a letter signed by dozens of corporate executives objecting to the Tennessee bathroom bill. Country Music Television and musicians Emmylou Harris, Chely Wright, Ty Herndon and Miley Cyrus have also spoken out against it. Legislation meant to deny rights to transgender individuals has been popping up nationwide in recent months. In November, Houston voters rejected a broad anti-discrimination measure after its opponents stoked baseless fears that it could lead male sexual predators to dress up as women and enter women’s restrooms. North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) has been facing significant backlash after he signed a measure late last month barring cities in the state from passing measures to protect LGBT people from discrimination. The law also requires transgender people to use restrooms corresponding to the gender they were assigned at birth.A number of businesses and celebrities have already pulled out of the state since McCrory signed the bill.Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant (R) signed a sweeping measure last week that provides legal protections for individuals, businesses and organizations that discriminate against LGBT people. And a Michigan state senator recently said he plans to introduce anti-transgender bathroom legislation soon. Tennessee recently passed separate anti-LGBT legislation that allows therapists and counselors to reject patients they feel would violate ""sincerely held principles."" The bill is also awaiting action by Haslam, who said he is still reviewing it. "
7,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Vows To Create An Office Dedicated To Helping Immigrants,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-office-immigrant-affairs_us_570e3493e4b03d8b7b9ede6c,Its focus would be improving services that don't require sweeping policy reforms.,2016-04-13,Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton says she is the best choice for those who want to help immigrants. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570e35341e0000b300706e73.jpeg?cache=4ZwBMw6VpJ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton announced on Wednesday that she will do something new as president: create a national office dedicated to immigrants and refugees. She unveiled her plan for an Office of Immigrant Affairs while receiving an endorsement from immigrant rights group the New York State Immigrant Action fund. Clinton and opponent Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) are campaigning heavily in New York ahead of its primary next week. Immigration is a big issue there -- New York City is home to more than 3 million immigrants -- and both candidates have criticized each other's bona fides on the issue. Much of the conversation has focused on immigration reform. Clinton's plan is notable in that it focuses on services for immigrants and refugees that the federal government can coordinate without Congress or sweeping changes using executive authority.At the event Wednesday morning, Clinton called integration ""an issue that cuts across all levels of government, federal, state, and local."" Her campaign said the new office would ""ensure there is a dedicated place in the White House where integration services for immigrants and refugees are managed."" Clinton said the first-ever Office of Immigrant Affairs ""would build on the work of the Obama administration's task force, and create a dedicated place in the White House to coordinate immigration policies across the federal government and with state and local government as well."" President Barack Obama established the White House Task Force on New Americans in 2014 to examine how to best coordinate efforts on the local, state and national level to help immigrants, from providing services to encouraging them to apply for citizenship.The task force recommended that the federal government encourage localities to create their own plans for integrating immigrants, with assistance from AmeriCorps VISTA service members. It also recommended ways to encourage more immigrants to seek citizenship, including grant funding for citizenship preparation classes. The task force said the federal government should help immigrant workers by ensuring they know their labor rights and encouraging entrepreneurship, and should give immigrants of all ages better access to language classes. New York City and state each have their own offices dedicated to immigrant issues, many of them particularly pro-immigrant, such as the city's municipal ID cards that are open to undocumented immigrants.Clinton is ahead in the polls in New York -- HuffPost Pollster averages of available surveys put her at about 52 percent and Sanders at 40 percent -- and Sanders has been going after her on immigration. His campaign held a call with reporters on Tuesday castigating Clinton for opposing driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants in New York during her 2008 bid for president, while she was a senator from the state. She has since reversed that position. Clinton, meanwhile, has continued to call out Sanders for his vote against comprehensive immigration reform in 2007. He supported a separate reform effort in 2013.This article was updated after Clinton officially announced her plan. "
8,TECH,Google Wants You To Wave Goodbye To Your Free Time,Casey Williams,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/google-goals-calendar_us_570e89d8e4b0ffa5937de513,A new feature will help you fill your leisure time with activities you always put off.,2016-04-13,Google Goals will help you schedule activities you want to do.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570e8d7e1600002a0031b9eb.gif?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Blank space on your calendar used to be a good thing. It was your free time, when you could relax, work on a personal project or hang with friends. Now, Google wants to fill empty calendar space with the activities you’d like to do at some point but never seem to have time for.The company on Wednesday rolled out Goals, a new feature for the Google Calendar app that lets you schedule activities, like jogging or spending time with your kids, during the hours when you have nothing going on. The feature uses machine learning to organize your life in a way that helps you better meet your personal objectives, according to Google.Say, for example, you want to go jogging more often. Tell your Google Calendar how much you want to run per week, and the app will find space in your schedule to fit that in.Just select your goals from a dropdown menu, or enter custom activities you'd like to work on, and the program will ask a few questions -- what time of day is best for that activity, how often do you want to do it and for how long. An algorithm then scans your calendar for open slots and fills them with the things you say you’d like to do more of.Users can mark each goal as completed or not, which helps the algorithm improve scheduling in the future. The algorithm automatically reschedules activities if conflicts come up.Other goal-setting apps help users establish goals, but they “don’t consider the user’s schedule,” a Google spokesperson told The Huffington Post.The Goals feature doesn’t collect any of the information users input into their calendar, the spokesperson also said. That means people who use the service don’t have to worry about Google using data about their goals to personalize search results or serve them ads. “The data is only used to improve the future scheduling of Goals for the user,” the spokesperson added.But make no mistake: Google already collects a lot of user data. It sweeps up information about web searches, location and emails to alter search results and serve personalized advertisements. While a person's Google account does store their calendar information, it doesn't use that information to personalize ads.For now, the Goals feature only works on Google Calendar. That means if you have multiple calendars -- say, a personal Google calendar and an Outlook calendar for work -- the algorithm might not have enough information about your schedule to avoid conflicts.

Scott Walker (R) and 10 other GOP governors trumpeted the benefits of drug testing food stamp recipients in a letter to Republicans on Capitol Hill this week. Federal law doesn't allow states to drug test Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients, but in February Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-Ala.) introduced legislation that would pave the way. ""The legislation authored by Congressman Robert Aderholt confirms states’ rights to drug test SNAP recipients, and we look forward to working with him on this crucial issue and implementing this common-sense reform in Wisconsin,"" Walker said in a Tuesday statement. The governors' letter, addressed to Aderholt and top Republicans on the Hill, insists that states already have the authority to make food stamp recipients pee in cups, even though none have actually carried out the policy amid threats from the Department of Agriculture, which oversees nutrition assistance.“Since SNAP and other welfare programs typically have job training requirements as a core element,” the letter says, “we write today to express our sincere confidence that drug testing recipients of SNAP benefits is not only lawful, but will aid in our ability to move individuals off of this welfare program and back into the workforce as productive members of their communities.”To recap: these governors believe states already have the authority to make food stamp recipients prove they’re not smoking weed, but Aderholt’s legislation offers a belt-and-suspenders double guarantee. Wisconsin lawmakers approved SNAP drug testing last year, and the state sued the federal government for ""clarity"" on whether federal law allows testing. Meanwhile, the actual testing has been on hold and the legal dispute is still pending. Republican governors from Arizona, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah also signed the letter. Notably absent: Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R), whose efforts to drug test beneficiaries of a separate (and far smaller) federal program were halted by federal courts in 2011.More than 45 million Americans receive benefits from SNAP, one of America's most important antipoverty programs. Monthly benefits averaged $126.83 per person in 2015.""If a welfare recipient has the money to buy drugs then they have the money to buy food,"" Aderholt said in February.Aderholt's legislation would allow states to do testing but not require it. The proposal also provides funding for treatment programs. It's not clear what kind of support the proposal might get from other Hill Republicans. The House GOP unsuccessfully pushed a similar measure in 2013.Do you receive SNAP benefits? Do you think drug screening should be required? Tell us about it -- email arthur@huffingtonpost.com.

Morgan Chase , State Street , Wells Fargo .The requirement for a living will was part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform legislation passed in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when the U.S. government spent billions of dollars on bailouts to keep big banks from failing and wrecking the U.S. economy.""The FDIC and Federal Reserve are committed to carrying out the statutory mandate that systemically important financial institutions demonstrate a clear path to an orderly failure under bankruptcy at no cost to taxpayers,"" FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg said in a statement. ""Today’s action is a significant step toward achieving that goal.""None of the eight systemically important banks, which the U.S. government considers ""too big to fail,"" fared well in the evaluations. However, a bank has to fix deficiencies only if the two regulators jointly determine its plan does not have the potential to work.The FDIC alone determined that the plan submitted by Goldman Sachs  was not credible, while the Federal Reserve Board on its own found Morgan Stanley's plan not credible. Citigroup's  living will did pass, but the regulators noted it had ""shortcomings.""""Each plan has shortcomings or deficiencies,"" said FDIC Vice Chairman Thomas Hoenig in a statement. ""No firm yet shows itself capable of being resolved in an orderly fashion through bankruptcy.

Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) is supporting Bernie Sanders for president, he said in a blog post on Wednesday. ""Hillary Clinton has a remarkable record. She would be a strong and capable president,"" Merkley said. ""But Bernie Sanders is boldly and fiercely addressing the biggest challenges facing our country... people know that we don’t just need better policies, we need a wholesale rethinking of how our economy and our politics work, and for whom they work.""The Oregon lawmaker's endorsement is a sharp diversion from his colleagues. Of the 44 Democrats in the Senate, 40 have supported Clinton. Those backers include fellow Oregon senator Ron Wyden and Minority Leader Harry Reid (Nev.)“Having somebody who is identified more as a socialist in many decades of public service than as a Democrat makes it impossible for Democrats in a state like Missouri,” Sen. Claire McCaskill (Mo.) said. “And it makes it very difficult for Democrats in states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida.""Three other Democratic senators, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), and Sen. Jon Tester (Mont.) have not made endorsements. Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) has also not endorsed anyone.Clinton is leading Sanders in both polls and delegate counts. But all's not lost for the Vermont senator. He's scored seven straight wins in the latest rounds of the Democratic nominating contest. And in the unlikely event that Sanders beats Clinton in New York next week, it could be a major upset for the state's former senator. CORRECTION: This entry previously implied that only two Democratic senators hadn't made endorsements. "

Connected below their waists, the two girls shared a colon and bladder. (Their sister, Catalina, was born without any serious health issues.)According to Driscoll Children's Hospital, where the girls' surgery took place, the chance of a triplet birth involving conjoined twins is 1 in 50 million.The overall survival rate of conjoined twins is said to be between 5 and 25 percent.Doctors at the hospital have been preparing for the girls' separation surgery for months.“This is an extremely challenging operation, but we look forward to a successful outcome,” pediatric surgeon Dr. Haroon Patel told ABC News in March.Surgery to separate conjoined twins is always risky, but it was especially complicated in this case, said Patel, because of the way the babies were connected.""This arrangement is fairly rare, in only about 6 percent of conjoined twins,"" Patel told CBS News. ""The last time something was published like this in the U.S. was 1966.""On Tuesday morning, the girls were wheeled into surgery, which involved several specialists from urology, plastic surgery and orthopedics. The sisters were successfully separated before undergoing reconstruction surgery, their family said.According to CNN, this is the first time Driscoll Children's Hospital has separated conjoined siblings."

The Bay Area school promptly responded by saying thanks, but no thanks -- there will not be a new survey. On Monday, the Associated Students of Stanford University posted the results of the annual student government elections, revealing that 90.6 percent of voters were in favor of a referendum calling on the school to administer a new survey.The referendum carries no authority, and only serves as a symbolic call by student voters. The student senate unanimously voted earlier this year to use a referendum to address the question of redoing the survey.Stanford polled undergraduates and grad students in 2015 to find out how many had experienced sexual violence on campus and whether they trusted the school to handle reports of assault. Many universities around the country have done similar surveys of their campuses in recent years after activists, policy experts and the White House called on schools to do so. Pending legislation in Congress would require every college to survey its students about sexual assault. But Stanford students and faculty have criticized the university for how it rolled out the results of its own poll.Stanford says that just 1.9 percent of respondents were sexually assaulted at the university -- a figure that combines male and female rates together, and one that uses a limited definition of sexual assault. By Stanford's reckoning, an encounter qualifies as ""sexual assault"" if the victim was incapacitated, or if the assailant used force or the threat of violence. This means, for example, that if someone was sexually penetrated without their consent, but they weren't incapacitated at the time and they weren't threatened with force or violence, their experience doesn't count toward that 1.9 percent figure. The survey said 4.7 percent of undergraduate women and 6.6 percent of ""gender-diverse"" students experienced sexual assault meeting that definition.

""While the university may continue to ignore the overwhelming support for a new survey, this campaign is not over,"" Cohen told HuffPost. ""As a senator who was re-elected to a second term, I will continue advocating for a new campus climate survey on sexual violence.""The U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights currently has four simultaneous investigations open into whether Stanford violated the gender equity law Title IX in its response to various reports of sexual assault.Two of those federal investigations involve cases related to a single male student who was accused of sexual and physical assault by multiple women.

Another 27 percent said they were unsure.The most striking divisions in perceptions of GMO safety had nothing to do with political party affiliation, as one might have guessed based on the spirited debate on the labeling legislation in Washington.Instead, education level and family income showed the widest gaps. Forty-nine percent of respondents with a college degree said they believe GMOs are generally safe, compared with 36 percent who had completed some college and just 22 percent who completed high school or less.When it came to family income, 51 percent of respondents making $100,000 or more per year said they believed GMO foods are safe to eat, compared with 42 percent of those earning $50,000 to $100,000, and 26 percent of those earning less than $50,000.The poll did find a wide gap along party lines on questions about trusting scientists. Half of Democratic respondents agreed that they trusted scientists “a lot,” but only 19 percent of Republicans did. Thirteen percent of Republican respondents went as far as to say their level of trust in science is “none at all,” compared with 4 percent of Democrats.The poll showed that respondents who trust scientists tend to believe GMO foods are safe. Forty-eight percent of respondents who trust scientists ""a lot"" think GMOs are safe, compared with 28 percent of those who trust scientists ""a little"" or not at all.That overlap is in line with the results of a 2015 Pew poll that found the gap between opinions in the scientific community and the general public on various scientific advancements to be wider on GMOs than any other issue that was included in the poll.

18,BUSINESS,Some Benevolent Green Billionaire Should Buy The Whole U.S. Coal Industry Right Now,Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/billionaire-buy-us-coal-industry_us_570e6b75e4b08a2d32b8952d,The industry's value has dropped two-thirds in just five years.,2016-04-13,"Arch Coal, the St. Louis-based holder of the second-largest reserve of coal in the U.S., filed for creditor protection Monday, with an agreement to erase $4.5 billion in debt.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570e8e5222000029002536bf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The U.S. coal industry is in terrible shape. Peabody Energy, the world’s largest private coal company, filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday. Fellow coal giants Alpha Natural Resources, Arch Coal, Patriot Coal and Walter Energy have each filed for bankruptcy since January 2015. More than three dozen smaller coal companies have gone under in the last four years.And the coal companies that aren't bankrupt are worth a fraction of what they used to be. Thanks to falling demand from China, a natural gas boom in the U.S. and a string of debt-fueled mergers, the total value of the U.S. coal industry has fallen by two-thirds in the last five years, from just over $60 billion to $22 billion. Including money coal companies have pledged to restore damaged land brings the total to just under $25 billion. As a result, one of the most audacious environmental ideas out there is getting cheaper and cheaper to pull off.""The idea is simple,"" Robinson Meyer wrote last year in the Atlantic: buy up the U.S. coal industry, retrain the workers and shut it down.Matt Frost, a former coal company employee who is now a federal contractor who does work for the Environmental Protection Agency, has been promoting this idea in the U.S. Two green business proponents, Gil Friend and Felix Kramer, pushed the idea two years ago.Back then, Friend and Kramer put the price tag at around $50 billion, which given the industry's current value looks like a wonderfully quaint overestimation in hindsight. In contrast, the cost of burning coal each year in the U.S. is estimated at $345 billion. Buying up the coal mining industry wouldn't stop the country from burning coal, but it would help ensure that some of those massive health costs are taken into account by making coal more expensive.Who writes the check? A billionaire environmentalist. And it just so happens that billionaire environmentalists have a knack for having finance and deal-making backgrounds. “Savvy climate hawks like Michael Bloomberg, Richard Branson, John Doerr, Jeremy Grantham, and Tom Steyer know all about buyouts,” Friend and Kramer wrote. Bloomberg's net worth is estimated at $37 billion, and he's already spent $60 million on a campaign to shutter coal-fired power plants. Branson is worth about $5 billion. John Doerr, a prominent venture capitalist, is worth about $4 billion. Jeremy Grantham, who founded asset manager GMO, is a longtime donor to a variety of environmental causes and has said he believes fossil fuels assets will fall in value dramatically. Tom Steyer founded the hedge fund Farallon Capital Management and is worth about $1.6 billion. He spent $76 million to make climate change a key issue in the 2014 elections.A key part of the idea is to utilize the valuable engineering and geology skills of people in the coal industry. “If we really want to make coal less desirable”— and Paul Krugman and The Economist agree that we should indeed want that — “you have to make it more expensive,” Matt Frost told the Huffington Post last year.Billions would have to be spent to find new jobs for the miners who showed up for generations to dangerous, dirty jobs and were forced to fight -- too often literally -- for fair pay and basic safety rules. “You could create a whole new sector of un-mining professionals, people who are really good at helping you keep carbon underground,” Frost said.The next chapter in the U.S. coal mining industry promises to be financially bleak -- but that doesn't mean it has to inflict more harm on coal communities, people's health or the environment.

Sanders looks like a stronger general election candidate than Clinton in polls, but that might not tell us much about November. And how voters assess their finances has a lot to do with partisanship. This is HuffPollster for Wednesday, April 13, 2016. PROJECTION SHOWS CLINTON TROUNCING TRUMP AND CRUZ - Morning Consult: “If the presidential election was held today, businessman Donald Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz would lose to Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, according to an extensive Morning Consult analysis of 44,000 poll respondents. Ohio Gov. John Kasich is the only candidate who could beat Clinton in November. Both Trump and Cruz would lose to Clinton by considerable margins in a head-to-head race, winning just 210 and 206 electoral college votes, respectively. By contrast, Kasich comfortably beats Clinton, racking up 304 electoral college votes to her 234….The results show that the race is still up for grabs, with nearly 20 percent of registered voters saying they are undecided about who they’d vote for between Clinton and either Trump, Cruz or Kasich.” [Morning Consult]How they estimated those Electoral College tallies - The analysts at Morning Consult used data they had collected from national surveys since January and a statistical technique called multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) to estimate which candidate would win each state in a hypothetical election. MRP is a way of using data at a larger geographic level -- like the national level -- to estimate opinion at a smaller geographic level -- in this case, the states. Instead of relying solely on how people say they will vote in the survey, MRP incorporates information about the respondents and the states they live in that’s known to predict vote choice. Morning Consult used respondents’ education, gender and age, plus state-level economic information and outcomes from the 2012 Presidential election. But nothing is certain - Morning Consult specifically notes that this analysis shows a projection of what would happen if the general election were today. And even though it incorporates state-level information, the model still relies on general election polls. Those aren’t yet predictive of what could happen in November, especially when many voters are still undecided. In the Trump vs. Clinton estimates, for example, neither candidate reaches a 50 percent majority in 37 states, and the candidates are within 2 percentage points of each other in seven states.

That's all there is to it (and you can unsubscribe anytime).SANDERS IS OUTPERFORMING CLINTON IN GENERAL ELECTION POLLS - David Lightman: ""Unimaginable at the start of the campaign, Bernie Sanders might be a stronger general election candidate for the Democrats than Hillary Clinton. He leads Donald Trump nationally by 20 points right now in a hypothetical general election matchup, more than double her 9-point lead, according to the latest McClatchy-Marist poll. He leads Sen. Ted Cruz by 12, while she is locked in a tie with the Texan....Sanders outperforms Clinton over Trump in the swing states of Arizona, North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin, as well. And underlining all that: the independent senator from Vermont energizes and excites younger voters, he’s not dogged by an FBI investigation into use of a private email server and his anti-establishment message is perfectly pitched to the key of 2016. That’s not to say that would last."" [McClatchy] Why that may not mean he's a stronger candidate - More from Lightman: ""So far, Sanders has largely escaped serious criticism from Clinton, the news media, or Republicans…..Sanders is enjoying politics’ first impression syndrome, a honeymoon period in which he’s been seen as fresh, authentic and genuinely angry at Wall Street and income inequality....Should Sanders become the party’s nominee, Clinton’s barbs will be just the warmup act, as Sanders gets grilled over his big, expensive ideas and liberal voting record….'The less you know about a person, the more positive you’re going to feel,' said [Larry] Sabato [director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics]. 'Sanders really hasn’t been vetted yet.'"" [McClatchy] CRUZ AND TRUMP SUPPORTERS UNLIKELY TO DEFECT TO A THIRD PARTY CANDIDATE - HuffPollster: ""More than a quarter of Donald Trump’s supporters would rather vote for a third-party candidate in November’s general election than cast a vote for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) — and a similar share of Cruz’s supporters feel the same way about Trump….But there are two big reasons to be skeptical of this actually happening: November is a long way away, and voters just don’t usually support third-party candidates in large numbers….In April 2012, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll asked likely voters nationwide if they would consider voting for a third-party or independent candidate. Forty percent of people said they would consider it — even though by then it was fairly clear that former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney (R) would be going up against President Barack Obama. Come November, fewer than 2 percent of voters actually voted for a non-major party candidate."" [HuffPost] Trump's support is deeper than it looks -Steven Shepard: ""Donald Trump’s support among Republican voters appears to be as deep as his hard-core GOP opposition, suggesting that the forces seeking to block his nomination will have to do more than just prevent him from winning enough delegates for a first-ballot victory, according to a POLITICO analysis of voting and polling data. Trump has won only about 37 percent of the vote in the GOP primaries and caucuses thus far. But that doesn’t mean the entire 63-percent majority of Republicans who voted against him are resolutely opposed. National polls show that even as Trump’s image has cratered among the broader electorate, more Republicans have a favorable opinion than view him unfavorably. In the states that have already voted, as many Republican primary voters said they would be satisfied if Trump won the nomination as said they wouldn’t, according to exit polls….And as Republicans barrel toward a fight on the convention floor for the party’s presidential nomination, majorities say that Trump should be the nominee — even if he falls short of the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch on the first ballot."" [Politico] PARTISANSHIP, NOT POVERTY, DRIVES VOTERS' ASSESSMENTS OF THEIR FINANCES - John Sides: ""There are actually smaller class divides in views of the economy now than under several previous presidents. More important to the story is partisanship. We’ve known for some time that people’s identification with a party affects how they perceive the objective world — even how physically attractive they find other people. The economy is no exception. Except in periods where economic conditions are unambiguous, such as at the height of the Great Recession, there are big —and growing — differences in how Republicans and Democrats view the economy, depending on which party controls the White House...Democrats and Republicans have strikingly different perceptions of their finances no matter what their income is. In fact, party is so significant that the wealthiest Republicans actually have slightly lower evaluations of their personal finances than do the poorest Democrats.""

Because it wasn't until later on that that event was discovered, the Roosevelt High School students had escaped discipline.Roeder said the freshman student's older sister, who he described as a graduate in her early 20s, suggested that the club ""renew that tradition.""But apparently not everyone was on board -- including the staff at the Des Moines Social Club, which Roeder said booted the stripper from their building.Members of the swim club also expressed upset over the dancer. ""They knew right away that this was a very bad idea and not what they wanted,"" Roeder said.One of the girl’s parents, speaking to the Des Moines Register, said it was meant to be a joke and the dancer didn’t completely disrobe.""A parent supposedly was there, but didn't realize what was going on,” Graham Gillette told the paper. Roeder said a parent meeting was called Tuesday about the event after parents found out and told the school's principal.As of Wednesday, they're still weighing possible discipline for the girls. Though the event took place off-campus and with student-raised money, it was a school-related function and potentially violated the district's student code of conduct.One thing's for sure: Roeder said the girls' social events are going to be a bit more limited.""They are going to make some changes in terms of the oversight of this club. It’s been operating with a bit of independence for several years,"" he said. ""That independence probably needs to be reeled in."" Roeder said the club is the oldest high school synchronized swim club in the country and has been around since the 20s. It is run and funded by the students."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has raised an unprecedented amount of money from small donors for his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. Now, he is using that massive list to help raise money for down-ballot Democrats that would be allies in Congress.On Wednesday, the Sanders campaign sent out fundraising emails to its list on behalf of Nevada 4th district candidate Lucy Flores, Washington 7th district candidate Pramila Jayapal and New York 19th district candidate Zephyr Teachout. Flores is running against incumbent Republican Rep. Cresent Hardy, Teachout is running for an open seat vacated by Republicans, and Jayapal is running for an open seat in a safe Democratic district. All three have endorsed Sanders’ presidential campaign.The fundraising emails for the three candidates are a first test of Sanders' ability to increase the political power of progressives who overlap with his policy vision for the country. Whether or not he becomes the Democratic Party presidential nominee, he will retain a huge amount of power to build this wing of the party through his wide base of support of both voters and small donors.“Bernie Sanders is doing the kind of coalition building and progressive power building that we’ve really wanted to see from a Democratic presidential candidate,” said Neil Sroka, communications director for the progressive group Democracy for America.Democracy for America endorsed Sanders in December and has been encouraging his campaign to do more for down-ballot candidates that have been supporting him. Sroka said the organization has been pushing the campaign “for quite a while” to do this. They wanted the campaign to help candidates who not only share his policy priorities, but also have a strong chance to win both their primary and general election campaigns.The emails all note the need to elect Democrats who would be able to help move the agenda of a Sanders presidency.“Zephyr literally wrote the book on political corruption,” the email asking for donations to Teachout’s campaign says. “She understands better than anybody how special interests try to buy off politicians, and she's dedicated her life to fixing our broken political system. Zephyr is exactly the kind of person I'd want in Congress when I'm president.”“Pramila helped lead the fight for paid sick leave and a $15 minimum wage in Seattle,” an email on behalf of Jayapal reads. “She's not afraid to take on powerful special interests. She's fought for immigrant rights, opposed the war in Iraq, and worked to protect Social Security. She's also running her campaign with our political revolution. It's a people-powered movement that will change how campaigns are run -- one the political establishment doesn't really like to see.”“Throughout this campaign, I’ve told you that no candidate for president -- not Bernie Sanders, not the greatest president you could possibly imagine -- can take on the billionaire class alone,” the email supporting Flores states. “Lucy Flores is exactly the kind of person I'm going to need in Congress when I am president.”Sanders' email for Flores also notes that Emily’s List, the pro-choice Democratic women’s group, declined to endorse her campaign after she announced her support for Sanders. Emily’s List, which supports Hillary Clinton’s presidential bid, had previously hailed Flores as an “inspiring community leader” and endorsed her 2014 lieutenant governor campaign. Emily’s List instead endorsed Susie Lee in the Democratic primary.“Lucy Flores endorsed our political revolution before the Nevada caucus, and everything changed,” the email reads. “EMILY’s List decided to endorse a different person in Lucy’s House race this time around. So I want to support Lucy like she’s supported us, because we stand together.”Emily's List has endorsed Jayapal in her race. This is isn’t the first time that two of the three candidates endorsed by Sanders have worked with his campaign. Both Flores and Jayapal appeared at rallies to introduce Sanders in their respective home states of Nevada and Washington. Flores also appeared in an advertisement for Sanders that ran ahead of the Nevada caucuses.Aaron Bly, Jayapal’s campaign manager, said that the Sanders campaign reached out to them on Tuesday about the possibility of helping them raise money. “We jumped at the chance,” he said. “We need progressives up and down the ballot, not just in Congress, but also here in Washington [state],” he continued.The Sanders campaign sent individual emails to a limited selection of their list on behalf of each candidate earlier on Wednesday.

23,POLITICS,Bernie Sanders Has A Very Lonely But Very Committed Following On Wall Street,Sam Stein and Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-wall-street_us_570e6dece4b03d8b7b9f08e0,It's more of a support group than a revolutionary force.,2016-04-13,Bankers for Bernie is an actual thing. Just not that big a thing. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For months now, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has ridden a message of concern and anger over the indulgences of the U.S. banking industry to greats heights in the Democratic primary. Now, as that primary hits its closing stretch, and as Sanders is in need of an upset win, he's competing in the one state where his cause célèbre comes with real complications. New York is the epicenter of the big banks. The state, according to an official with its Department of Labor, employs more than 108,200 people in the ""depository credit intermediation"" industry -- such as commercial & savings banks, and credit unions. If you add related industries, from securities and commodities to investment banking, that figure rises by hundreds of thousands, according to federal data.In short, a lot of people in New York work for the companies that Sanders doesn't exactly place on a pedestal. They also, likely, vote. And it stands to reason that a good chunk of them do so in the Democratic primary (this being New York and all). Sanders isn't about to change his message for the sake of picking up a few more backers. Undoubtedly, he's gained substantially more support outside the Empire State than he's lost inside of it by preaching his regulatory reform values. Perhaps he's gained the backing of more New Yorkers because of it too. But to understand just how much antipathy there is for the Vermonter among those who work in the banking industry, all you have to do is pick up a phone. ""Oh, that's impossible,"" said one high-ranking analyst at a top bank, when asked if she could put The Huffington Post in touch with any colleagues who supported Bernie. ""There has been a lot of politics discussion but I have not heard one person come out in support of Bernie Sanders."" Or, you could just glance at the numbers. Taking campaign finance data through February, HuffPost isolated donations from individuals who worked for the nine of the biggest banks: Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, UBS and Wells Fargo. All told, just 248 people employed by those banks across the entire country made contributions worth more than $200 to Sanders ($200 is the amount after which you must disclose your name and employer). And that's out of the more than two million people who have made contributions to the campaign.In New York, there were just 34 such individuals. By contrast, the number of New York-based major bank employees who gave to Hillary Clinton was 295.And yet, like droplets of paint on a vast canvas, there are Sanders' devotees inside the banking universe. They aren't pariahs. Nor are they treated as lepers by their co-workers -- on the occasion that they let their Bernie-backing-ways be known to them. They're just inclined to see their employers in a similar, albeit slightly less, critical light as the candidate they support. ""I've definitely had conversations with coworkers and there is definitely a healthy debate about being a Bernie supporter. But I do find that my colleagues on this side are open minded. They realize that there are issues out there that he speaks to,"" said a lawyer for one of the big banks who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""I love all the focus on income inequality. I love his stance on environmental issues. Having been in finance for a very long time and work on issues related to the financial crisis for a long time, there is plenty of blame to go around: the Congress, the banks, homeowners and mortgage brokers… That being said, everyone's line of rhetoric on breaking up the banks comes from a real place. It is obvious that some of these banks are too big to manage properly.""A close look at the Bernie-backing banking employees -- in New York and beyond -- shows that many of them aren't really in the money-managing part of the business. They are web developers, tellers, tech supporters, software engineers, programmers and IT architects -- the type of job functions that (abusing some stereotypes here) tend to draw more progressive and lower-income individuals. They often are self-reflective about their life choices.""I work in IT and I work in Ohio. We aren't on Wall Street,"" said one JP Morgan Chase employee. ""I work with a lot of young people and immigrants. Politics doesn't come up. People just don't talk about it. ... Personally, I struggle every day thinking, here I am working for a big bank. It is not exactly what I would prefer to be contributing to society. And I would support Bernie and his policies regardless. I'm a progressive liberal kind of guy.""Like most people interviewed for this piece, this JP Morgan Chase employee didn't want to speak on the record out of concern that it would get him in trouble at work. It wasn't so much a fear of backlash for supporting a candidate who's called their employer's business model fundamentally corrupt, as it was a respect for the public relations officials with whom they work. Still, there are those willing to have their names out there.Janice Grudecki, a marketing manager at Wells Fargo in Minneapolis didn't just donate to Sanders. She's hosted a phone bank party that was listed publicly.""I don't think there is any sense of contradiction,"" she said of working for one of the big banks that Sanders wants to break up. ""I honestly think that a break up of the banks is good for everyone.""Inside the city, those financial sector-based Bernie backers who are willing to be identified tend to be the more well-established types. Their professional status provides them a sense of security from ostracization. But they are also instinctively unconventional -- which explains some of their professional success -- and they've adopted that mindset to their political habits as well. In an October 2015 piece titled ""Bankers for Bernie,"" Politico Magazine identified a few of these iconoclasts. And in a Guardian op-ed this week, another one of them, Asher Edelman, wrote ""I'm the real-life Gordon Gekko and I support Bernie Sanders."" Taken collectively, these financial-sector supporters won't win Sanders New York's primary on Tuesday. But they do number enough to form a minyan or, perhaps, a support group. One member, Paul Ryan (no, not that Paul Ryan, the one who is the Managing Director at Tripoint Global Securities), was drawn to Sanders through a circuitous route. The Occupy Wall Street movement resonated with him in a profound and complicated way. And then, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) burst on to the scene. ""You're wondering why you're sick and tired of the people you work with, the greed and stupidity of it all. You start to feel down about it. And all of a sudden someone crystallizes it. It's not a psychological failing. It is a political issue,"" Ryan explained. Sanders is, for Ryan, the one actual change agent in the field; and certainly the only candidate speaking truth to excesses and problems he sees on Wall Street. ""I'm not the wavy gravy type. I'm not bringing my bong to the Bernie Sanders rally,"" he explained (later he clarified that he owns a Martini glass but not a bong). ""Policy wise I want someone who is going to make the big change. How he does it is a political issue and frankly Hillary shows no political will to do anything about it.""Ryan acknowledges that he's a bit of a canary in a coal mine on this stuff. Others in his field find the Occupy Wall Street movement misguided: Elizabeth Warren is an enemy and Bernie Sanders a rebel-rousing oddity. But the mood is changing, he argues. There is a growing ""consciousness"" about the problems Sanders is speaking to. When Edelman published his op-ed in the Guardian, Ryan sent him a note. ""Hey Asher,"" it read, ""It is nice to know that you are out here in a fairly lonely club."" "

""CPD cannot begin to build trust, repair what is broken and tattered unless --from the top leadership on down -- it faces these hard truths, acknowledges what it has done at the individual and institutional levels and earnestly reaches out with respect. Only then can it expect to engage the community in a true partnership,"" the task force wrote.The scathing 190-page report addressed issues ranging from the department's unequal treatment of black people to the city's acquiescence to the will of the powerful police union. It also slammed the supposedly impartial oversight body, the Independent Police Review Authority, calling it ""badly broken."" The report called the community's lack of trust in the CPD ""justified,"" and said the department has done little to confront racial bias within its ranks. ""CPD’s own data gives validity to the widely held belief the police have no regard for the sanctity of life when it comes to people of color,"" the report read.Mayor Rahm Emanuel in December formed the nine-member task force following a rare mea culpa for the way he and the department handled the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald.The report emphasized multiple issues the McDonald shooting -- and subsequent fight over transparency and accountability -- brought into the national spotlight. The task force, which includes a mix of legal experts, academics and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick (D), spent four months gathering feedback from current and former members of the department, public servants and community members. The task force made more than 100 different recommendations for reform, the most striking of which included a call for CPD's superintendent to publicly recognize the ""history of racial disparity and discrimination"" in the department.Other recommendations addressed community empowerment, creating a new structure for officer accountability and tackling ""institutional"" issues that range from the department's ""code of silence"" to its lack of de-escalation and crisis training:Replace IPRA with a civilian-based oversight board Beyond the racial disparities in policing, the task force noted that the CPD's current system of discipline and oversight ""benefits bad officers at the expense of good officers.”The task force has given the department and the city council 90 to 180 days to enact policies and plans to implement the changes. The report was revealed just hours after CPD Interim Superintendent Eddie Johnson was unanimously confirmed by the city council Wednesday afternoon.Addressing reporters after Johnson's confirmation, Emanuel said ""there's no question there’s work we have to do in restoring trust and building certain values of transparency,"" noting he had not yet seen the report and could not comment on it specifically until he had been briefed. “I don’t really think you need a task force to tell us there’s racism in America … in Illinois, or that there’s racism that exists in the city of Chicago, or that exists in our departments,” he added. The report is cautiously optimistic on the prospect of true change, noting that while reform is possible, it must begin with CPD's ""acknowledgement of the sad history and present conditions which have left the people totally alienated from the police, and afraid for their physical and emotional safety.""""And while many individuals and entities have a role to play, the change must start with CPD.""Scroll down to read the executive summary of the task force report:"

The artist told The Huffington Post the project was inspired by her friends who were young mothers. ""I could see first hand how hard they worked to raise their children and work and continue their education, which was in direct contrast with the stereotypes of irresponsible young mothers with no ambitions other than to get benefits (welfare) and a house from the government,"" she said.""This myth is really pervasive, and it actually affects women in terms of how they are treated and perceived by society, from healthcare professionals right through to strangers on the street,"" she added. ""I wanted to challenge these ideas as well as honor the work and lives of women who choose to have children at a young age.""Since she started the project in 2013, Benson has photographed 27 mothers with their children all across the U.K. Her subjects include friends, acquaintances and strangers she found through word of mouth and photo callouts. Through the process, the photographer has learned a great deal about their vastly different experiences.""Young motherhood is very complex,"" she said. ""There are a whole host of reasons why a woman gets pregnant and decides to keep her child, and the decision to be a mother at a young age is not a tragedy in and of itself.""Now a mother to a 7-month-old baby, the artist has reached even greater clarity about parenthood. ""Most mothers, no matter the age or circumstances they are in, just want the best for their children and themselves,"" she said. ""There's no difference when it comes to young mothers.""""All these judgements are made about their morality and their capability are besides the point and actually a real hindrance, but the amazing thing is that despite all the baggage others put on them, they do an amazing job,"" she added. ""That should always be celebrated.""When Benson photographed the moms, she also filmed interviews with them about their personal experiences and advice for other young mothers.

The artist told The Huffington Post the project was inspired by her friends who were young mothers. ""I could see first hand how hard they worked to raise their children and work and continue their education, which was in direct contrast with the stereotypes of irresponsible young mothers with no ambitions other than to get benefits (welfare) and a house from the government,"" she said.""This myth is really pervasive, and it actually affects women in terms of how they are treated and perceived by society, from healthcare professionals right through to strangers on the street,"" she added. ""I wanted to challenge these ideas as well as honor the work and lives of women who choose to have children at a young age.""Since she started the project in 2013, Benson has photographed 27 mothers with their children all across the U.K. Her subjects include friends, acquaintances and strangers she found through word of mouth and photo callouts. Through the process, the photographer has learned a great deal about their vastly different experiences.""Young motherhood is very complex,"" she said. ""There are a whole host of reasons why a woman gets pregnant and decides to keep her child, and the decision to be a mother at a young age is not a tragedy in and of itself.""Now a mother to a 7-month-old baby, the artist has reached even greater clarity about parenthood. ""Most mothers, no matter the age or circumstances they are in, just want the best for their children and themselves,"" she said. ""There's no difference when it comes to young mothers.""""All these judgements are made about their morality and their capability are besides the point and actually a real hindrance, but the amazing thing is that despite all the baggage others put on them, they do an amazing job,"" she added. ""That should always be celebrated.""When Benson photographed the moms, she also filmed interviews with them about their personal experiences and advice for other young mothers.

27,IMPACT,Mozambique Devises National Plan To End Child Marriage,Eleanor Goldberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mozambique-devises-national-plan-to-end-child-marriage_us_570d41aee4b0836057a2991c,The institution affects nearly 1 in 2 girls in the African nation.,2016-04-13,"Students in school uniforms pose for a photo in Beira, Mozambique. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570d46af150000ee010b4aa6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Mozambique, which has one of the highest rates of child marriage in the world, announced a national plan on Monday to put an end to the institution.Though the African nation has seen some notable declines in child marriage -- a practice that comes with a slew of health and developmental risks -- it still affects nearly one in two girls there, according to UNICEF. Those figures could be eliminated altogether though, now that a band of government officials, nonprofits and donors have launched a multi-pronged national plan to end child marriage. In 2011, 48 percent of women between the ages of 20 to 24 were married before they turned 18, according to UNICEF. That was down from 56.6 percent in 1997. But those figures belie the actual number of girls who are married.Population growth has meant that the actual number of married girls has increased, Girls Not Brides, a nonprofit involved in the national plan, said in a press release.The eight-pillared strategy, which was spearheaded in part by the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Affairs, will address health and education issues.The campaign will involve reforming the legal framework, developing a social mobilization campaign, improving girls’ access to education, and sexual and reproductive health services, according to Girls Not Brides.But advocates say the work is far from over, considering that it will require extensive collaboration, donations and on-the-ground programs.“We would be mistaken to celebrate too soon,” Girls Not Brides said in a statement. “No real change comes from a piece of paper alone and the coming months will determine the fate of the national strategy, be it gathering dust on a shelf somewhere, or transforming girls’ lives across the country.”Mozambique has made declarations in the past about ending the practice that didn’t have everlasting results.Child marriage is officially illegal in Mozambique, but it is not punishable by law and the civil legislation on the issue is weak. The country was also involved in a charter adopted by the African Union, which denounced child marriage. And in 2014, first lady Maria da Luz Guebuza spoke out at a rally urging parents to not marry off their daughters.Part of the problem, advocates say, is that the institution is so embedded in society that many girls aren’t opposed to it. The other issue is that many struggling parents are motivated by the “bride price,” the amount of money they’ll get in return from marrying off their daughters, HuffPost Impact executive editor Jessica Prois noted while reporting from Mozambique in 2014.To ensure that the plan is effective, Girls Not Brides is calling on donors and international agencies to lend technical and financial support and is looking to heavily involve the girls and communities that are affected by child marriage.“You can change attitudes,” Mariana Muzzi, a child protection specialist with UNICEF Mozambique, told HuffPost in 2014. “You’re not going to immediately solve the economic problems, but [...] you can change the attitude and say, ‘Yes, I think my girl is worth it and I want her to become a nurse or a doctor.’ It can be done.”"

""That's nice,"" they'll say, tapping the next song from a menu projected by their smart contact lenses before hearing it play from paper-thin wireless speakers.The heyday of CDs is slipping increasingly further behind us. A report by IFPI, a music industry nonprofit, released this week states that global recorded music sales in physical formats dipped below that of digital formats for the first time in 2015, comprising 39 percent of industry revenue compared to digital's 45 percent. In 2014, physical and digital format sales were about equal. Why the change? Streaming, of course. Services like Spotify and Apple Music are big and getting bigger, with streaming revenue growing by 45.2 percent from 2014. Overall global digital sales -- which includes streaming and downloads -- were up by 10.2 percent.But it's not just that more people are choosing to enjoy music via digital platforms that accounts for the gap. Sales of physical music are declining, too -- although by a lower rate than the previous two years.Revenue in the global music market reached $15 billion in 2015, up 3.2 percent from the year before. According to the report, that makes 2015 ""the most significant growth since 1995.""That's good news for an industry which has struggled for years to cope with technological changes and rampant pirating. But perhaps it's not for people who like to hold their whole music library, and the rights to play it on any number of devices, in their hands. "
