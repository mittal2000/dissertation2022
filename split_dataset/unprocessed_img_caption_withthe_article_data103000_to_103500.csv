The statement laments the deaths of Yvette Johnson, John Crawford III, Tamir Rice and others, calling for an end to police brutality and ""institutional racism."" Student co-authors Sarah Cole, Miles Malbrough and Keyanna Wigglesworth emphasize the power in numbers, and urge comradeship among protesters. It reads, ""There is immense strength in unity and solidarity, and there are a number of different tactics we can all use to fight against the social, political, and economic disempowerment of black people."" Read the Harvard Black Student Association's response in its entirety below.On the night of Monday, November 24th, a grand jury failed to indict police officer Darren Wilson in the fatal shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown. Less than two weeks later, another grand jury chose not to indict Daniel Pantaleo, the Staten Island police officer who killed Eric Garner using a chokehold. The executive board of the Harvard College Black Students Association sends its deepest and most heartfelt condolences to the families and friends of Michael Brown and Eric Garner for the immeasurable sense of loss and pain that they must feel.

A breathtaking view of remarkable snow-covered mountain peaks; vast green open spaces and old-growth forest; enveloped by the scent of crisp air sparking one's imagination and serenity while propelling one onward to explore more.Mesmerizing Naikoon Park located on Graham Island in Haida Gwaii, British Columbia, Canada is the home of Haida people. The nearest city is Masset located ten miles away. The park offers a seductive blend of seclusion and enchantment around every bend. So very easy for one to fall in step with the vibrant spirit of Naikoon Park -- where carved totems offer welcome -- discovering it for oneself at one's own pace for the first time.This was certainly how my husband Andy and I experienced Naikoon Park and all its natural wonders when I visited there this summer. Invited by Craig Paulson, Recreation Section Head, Skeena / Haida Gwaii, British Columbia (BC) Parks, my mission was to better understand the BC Parks system and how to make this inimitable experience accessible to individuals with physical limitations as well as seniors. How might those who are blind and/or deaf experience this fascinating terrain? In response, I designed a secure and fully accessible enclosed shelter with its own restroom, sink and deck that will sit harmoniously in the park campgrounds. This design is still in the conceptual phase and undergoing review.I am especially excited to be able to share Naikoon Park by virtue of a virtual [and interactive] hike that is made available most recently through the partnership of Old Massett Village Council and British Columbia Parks. As Craig Paulson reports, ""The genesis of the website takes an accessible Park experience further. We made the flat part of the trail to the ocean universally accessible, but wanted to provide those who might not be able to climb to the summit an experience of the remainder of the hike."" Glenys SnowDymond, Universal Access/Barrier Free Design Consultant, whose ""vision and fortitude"" brought the website to life, notes that ""This virtual hike [of Naikoon Park Tow Hill Blowhole Boardwalk] has evolved through years of discussions and commitment between Old Massett Village Council and BC Parks to provide 'thematic access' to Tow Hill and the Blowhole in Naikoon. The virtual hike creates a wonderful opportunity to experience a sense of place in this rare and unique area on Haida Gwaii.""Our trip literally rippled with moments of exquisite splendor: glaciers paired with verdant farms and fields as accessible as my wonder as we became fully enchanted by this mystical place. One gets the distinct impression of setting foot for the first time on land still untouched by a human presence. Where each hike -- long and arduous -- is rewarded with one astonishing vista after another. A bit of comic relief came in the form of a trip to a local mountaineering shop for supplies: among the wilderness gear purchased were large canisters of bear spray due to the grizzly population. I inquired of the sales associate: how do you use this? To which he replied, ""Spray your husband... and run.""This season, I'm giving thanks and giving back. The links that follow will bring one close to the sights and sounds of this stunning and always surprising Park system. One might even be compelled to take the next step and plan a visit to experience more of Naikoon Park from a personal view. Let us know what you think of this British Columbia treasure which has been named one of National Geographic Traveler's 20 must-see places in the world for 2015. As for me, I'm going back at the very next opportunity. Just imagine.And, be sure to check out these links; it's a trip for the ages: http://naikoonpark.com/  www.facebook.com/YourBCParks"

They said there was no evidence he had fought directly.""As a youth, he was not able to resist the influence of his Islamist friends,"" said chief judge Thomas Sagebiel.Although he still displayed the attitudes of a radical Islamist, the judge expressed hope that a youth sentence would have the necessary educational effect.In Germany, people aged 18-21 can be treated according to youth law if they are judged to lack maturity.The sentence was six months less than prosecutors had sought but more than the three years and three months sought by his defense lawyer, after Kreshnik B., in exchange for more lenient treatment, admitted joining IS and receiving weapons training.He looked relaxed as he entered the court and looked down at his hands as the verdict was read. He was dressed casually and wore a full beard.During his brief trial, the court heard recordings of phone calls with his sister in which he said he hoped to be a martyr. His family had informed authorities as soon as he disappeared.""The accused realized there were tensions between IS and other groups, also Islamists, and that opponents of the regime of Bashar al-Assad were fighting one another. This, as well as the pleas of his family ... was why he returned,"" the court said.IS militants have captured large swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq, beheaded Western prisoners, killed many non-Sunni Muslims and declared a caliphate governed by sharia law in the heart of the Middle East.Thousands of Western volunteers have traveled to Syria and Iraq to join militant groups, raising fears in Europe and the United States of attacks by returning fighters.About 550 German citizens have joined Islamic State and about 60 have been killed. Some 180 are believed to have returned. Prosecutors are investigating about 300 suspects.French judges last month sentenced a returning jihadi, aged 27, who spent only days in Syria to seven years in prison. Britain has also imprisoned people for training in Syria.Some politicians and legal experts argue tough sentences only build resentment and more de-radicalisation programs are essential. Authorities have also stressed how important it is to hear from disillusioned jihadis able to counter propaganda. (Writing by Alexandra Hudson; Editing by Noah Barkin)"

(Photo by Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8dfcb260000350083bdab.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The decision by grand juries in Ferguson, Missouri, and Staten Island, New York, not to indict white police officers whose use of force resulted in the deaths of two black men has led many to take their demand for justice into the streets. There has been no end of media commentary on how grand juries work, what they heard, and what standard had to be met to indict the police officers. Some have argued that the grand jury process was faulty. Some have argued that, given the bar that must be met to indict, the decisions were correct even if they angered many.There are dramatically different views of the work of these grand juries in white versus black communities. Polling data on the Ferguson grand jury process show that 58 percent of whites agree with its decision compared to only 9 percent of blacks. In short, the majority of whites seem content that justice was done; most blacks will never be content. This disparity in racial views comes in part from differences in the perception of justice in America. An outcome is accepted as just by most (by no means all) whites when judicial procedures are followed. For most blacks, judicial procedures have been historically suspect and cannot be counted upon to produce a just outcome. These two cases have also sparked a wider conversation about justice in terms of police procedure, law enforcement weapons, and officer training, and whether the grand jury process is broken. These wider conversations are important and necessary. They touch on other aspects of procedural justice.   But procedural justice is not enough. Earlier this year, the Justice Department announced that it would review the cases of people sentenced 10 or more years ago for drug crimes, with a view toward making it possible for some convicts to get clemency. These convicts received procedural justice at the time they were tried and sentenced, but the sense a decade later is that justice has not been served, principally because punishments today are much less severe for the same crimes. Deputy Attorney General James Cole put it this way when the program was announced: ""For our criminal justice system to be effective, it needs not only to be fair, but it also must be perceived as fair."" Those who have taken to the streets see a great unfairness. Their perception is only in part their sense of procedural injustice. Even if procedural justice is improved -- better policing, better grand juries -- concerns about justice will not go away. Unfairness, in their view, permeates black-white relationships, not only in law enforcement and criminal justice but in areas as diverse as education, housing, employment, and health care. Black-white relationships, black opportunities, and black outcomes in America have been unfair since the first slaves were introduced here 400 years ago. The gains of the civil rights movement made substantial progress in wiping away legal barriers to justice, but societal barriers of many kinds persist.""Justice is the end of government,"" James Madison said in Federalist #51. ""It is the end of civil society. It ever has been and ever will be pursued until it is obtained, or until liberty be lost in the pursuit."" That is the struggle that goes on today in police offices, courtrooms, schools, neighborhoods, businesses, and in the streets of America. The danger, in the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, is that we will define the problem too narrowly. We will convene panels and commissions to fix the law enforcement and legal system but ignore the broader demands of justice. If we make that mistake, the loss of these two men will fade from memory and many of the potential gains to society from these tragedies will be missed. We owe them more than that. We owe ourselves more than that too."

The larger events which led to his death were acts of structural violence.",2014-12-05,[UNVERIFIED CONTENT] The Staten Island Ferry passes the Statue of Liberty in New York.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8dfc6240000500098f8e9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Death, like life, occurs within an interconnected web of forces. Eric Garner died at a specific place and time, but he was drawn there by those larger unseen forces. So was the officer who took his life.One of them never left.The neighborhood where Eric Garner died was near the terminal point for the Staten Island Ferry, which leaves lower Manhattan from a newly-built building on Whitehall Street.The Whitehall building is a few minutes' walk from Wall Street, and it shows. Commuters leaving at the end of a downtown workday enter a gleaming and futuristic edifice of steel and glass, a 21 landmark which evokes the preceding century's enduring faith in the future.They called it ""the American Century"" back then, and the metropolis of New York was its capital. Its great works of architecture were temples to prosperity, shrines to an era of growth they thought would never end.A 2005 Newsday article gushed that the Whitehall ferry building's landscaping seemed to ""embrace harried commuters in rough, thoroughly secular imitation of St. Peter's Square welcoming pilgrims."" It employs a ""state-of-the-art heating and air conditioning system, partially powered by solar panels."" It boasts a number of retail shops, as well as New York City's only indoor farmer's market.The terminal station on Staten Island is considerably more modest. A small building stands alone against the dock, wedged between a large parking lot and inland waters which are often covered with small whitecaps. The address is 1 Bay Street. The spot where Eric Garner died is just a few minutes' walk from the ferry terminus, at 202 Bay Street. Pilgrims would feel less welcome there.The image on Google Maps shows the storefront of Bay Beauty Supply, where multiracial models strike poses in the window. Next door is ""Wig Zone"" (or is that ""Wig Zone Fever""?). A small neon sign tell us there's an ATM inside. Stenciling on the window reads ""On Sale, Regular Wig, $9.99.""Two neighborhoods, separated by a twenty-five minute ferry ride.We were told that Mr. Garner was selling ""loosies,"" or individual cigarettes, on the street the day he died. We weren't told why he was selling them - or why he was able to find a steady supply of customers there, paying a steep markup for a single smoke because they couldn't afford to buy an entire pack at a time.That's part of the poverty trap: Those who can't afford regular prices wind up paying even more.According to news reports, Garner had been employed by the City of New York as a horticulturist. We don't know how he came to be unemployed, but we do know that New York City's payroll has been cut by more than 16,000 employees since the financial crisis of 2008.That financial crisis was caused by banker fraud. Fraud. Criminal behavior. Committed on Wall Street. At the other end of the ferry line.None of the bankers who orchestrated that fraud have been arrested. But Eric Garner was. He was being arrested again when he died.It's absurd to think that Eric Garner made a conscious decision to abandon a good job with the city in order to live the precarious and penurious existence of a cigarette seller on the street.We know that unemployment is higher among African-American males than it is for the overall population. The unemployment rate for African-American males in New York City is 14 percent. That's the official rate, anyway. The actual rate is undoubtedly much higher. Several years after the financial crisis struck, the Fiscal Policy Institute identified a number of New York City neighborhoods with especially high unemployment rates for black men. One of those neighborhoods was the North Shore of Staten Island, where Eric Garner died.Conservatives like Rep. Steve King rushed in to argue that health problems, not police officers, killed Mr. Garner. """"If he had not had asthma, and a heart condition, and was so obese,"" said King, ""he would not have died from this.""But, like the landscape and the circumstances in which he died, Eric Garner's health was shaped by larger economic forces. His health problems are endemic in low-income communities, the product of environmental conditions, stress, external pressures, and the unavailability or unaffordability of healthier foods.It's not easy to go gluten-free in some parts of town.The American Heart Association notes that 44.4 percent of African-American men (and 48.7 percent of African-American women) suffer from cardiovascular disease. The overall death rate for cardiovascular disease was 236.1 per thousand in 2009, while the death rate for African-American males was 387.0 per thousand.And about that asthma: The National Medical Association observes that ""The racial differences in asthma prevalence, morbidity and mortality among minorities are highly correlated with poverty, urban air quality, indoor allergens, lack of patient and physician education, inadequate medical care, misuse of medications and lack of available resources in communities where they live.""These are systemic problems, just as surely as police violence toward African-American males is a systemic problem.Speaking of which: It should be self-evident to any reasonable person that we wouldn't be talking about Eric Garner's health today if excessive force had not been used against him last July, and if that force had not resulted in the loss of his life - despite the fact that he kept telling the police officers at the scene that he couldn't breathe. But the officers on the scene when Eric Garner died were acting for systemic reasons, too. In part, their behavior was the residue of a discredited ""broken windows"" policing philosophy, which argued that major crimes could be reduced with a zero-tolerance attitude toward minor offenses.There are no broken windows on Wall Street.The officer who manhandled Garner had a record of abusive behavior. There is no excuse for his actions. But he, too, was in the grip of larger forces. It's worth remembering that police officers are middle-class and working-class individuals. They are actors in a larger drama, as Eric Garner was.As are we all.There is overt violence, and there is structural violence. The video of Eric Garner's death shows us an act of overt violence. The larger events which led to his death were acts of structural violence.Our moral leaders have told us time and time again that violence against any one of us wounds us all. Until we recognize and address both forms of violence - the seen and the unseen, the overt and the structural - our society cannot be made whole. Until the hidden heart of violence is made visible, none of us will be able to breathe."

This year, I felt stuck in my career after shooting 20 plus segments as The Mom Strategist™ for the Emmy nominated show America Now. I wanted to go from one syndicated show to the next one and that did not happen. I reached out to agent after agent and studio executives sharing my ""reel"" with amazing feedback but still no takers. Needless to say, I was bummed and disappointed that my amazing work was not met with a flood of new opportunities. To get unstuck I had to get real with myself about how to move through this period in my career. I had to take different actions to create new possibilities and opportunities. I learned some simple truths that supported me and that I know will support you in the business of your life.As I created strategies with my coaching clients over the last twelve years they all found themselves asking the exact same question at some point, ""Why am I stuck in a certain area of my life?"" We all battle that feeling of staying in the same place or that our life is not moving fast enough in the direction we would like it to go. We rock, kick, cry, murmur and complain mostly about ourselves in our weakest area(s) of growth. Nothing changes in our lives until we make a decision to move in a different direction. But how do we move when life paralyzes us by fear, anxiety and feelings of being overwhelmed? What do we do to get unstuck?Here are eight reasons why we find ourselves ""stuck"" and my truths for how to get unstuck:1. To keep up appearances  We are afraid to let the people we interact with everyday know just how bad we are hurting, disappointed or discouraged. Instead we put on our brave faces to keep up appearances. Truth: You can not get what you need pretending like you already have it and that everything is okay when it is not. You are the one responsible for being vulnerable with the right people who can influence your situation for the better. You have to be willing to say exactly what you need so that you can attract it in your life.2. We don 't want to be judged  If we make a bad choice or decision we often are our biggest critics replaying over and over how we screwed up. We judge ourselves so much that we become afraid of openly sharing what we need with others because we fear additional judgment.Truth: Give yourself a break. If you share your issues, problems and concerns with the right people you will not risk judgment but instead gain support. If you feel judged by your village it is time to up-level your tribe. 3. Change is hard. Doing things in a way that is familiar does not stretch or stress.  Instead, we continue doing things that do not necessarily serve our highest good. We forget about creating a grace period for the transition of change. Give yourself realistic time to adjust to the new ideas and opportunities that will move your life in a new direction.Truth: Comfort is the enemy of change. The next time you struggle with doing the things that will advance your life like working out, going back to school, or asking for that promotion, get real with yourself about what feeling you are after. Are you seeking comfort or change?4. We stay in circles that stifle our growth.  We have all been guilty of having relationships that are one-sided (you do all the calling to check-in, etc.), or friends who are not interested in moving forward or looking forward to their own personal growth and development. We surround ourselves with people who are not in a position to advise, guide or cheer us on in the new dreams we have in our lives.Truth: You have outgrown your relationships and it is time for you to build relationships with people who are at your ambition level and above.5. We allow people to take more than their share.  If you find that you are the person giving all the advice, money, time and energy to support those around you, and those same people look the other way when you have a need, you have taught them how to treat you and it is time for you to shift those dynamics.Truth. Giving too much creates toxic relationships because they drain and create demands that are unrealistic, not sustainable and they devalue our gifts.6. We set low expectations for ourselves.  We are capable of so much more than we give ourselves credit for. Women minimize their successes and small gains and maximize their failures. When we reduce our accomplishments instead of celebrating them we squelch our motivation to set bigger goals.Truth: We often minimize ourselves because we are afraid of our brilliance. We are intimately familiar with failure and are not as afraid of failing. Succeeding at something new prompts a different type of fear in us. It is the fear of the unknown that truly scares us. Again, we become afraid to be brilliant because it requires us to be vulnerable to others and ourselves.7. We lack accountability.  Who is taking a stand for your success, dreams and plans? We hide from ourselves by isolating ourselves from others when we are stuck. We keep the dirty little secrets about our fears and challenges to ourselves so that we can wallow in self-pity instead of creating strategic actions to bring about change.Truth: Get a mentor, coach or consultant who will challenge the change inside of you and hold you accountable. Stop running and hiding and pick up the phone and call a person in a position to support your growth. (Yes, you might have to pay for this service. You are worth it!)8. Invest in yourself. You are a product of the books you read, classes you take, programs you view on the television/computer and the people you hang out with. Are your investments paying off for you? When was the last time you read something (other than this article) that could influence your life for the better?Truth. Invest in your life.As for me, I decided to write a few shows for myself to create opportunities in the media space.

10,SPORTS,4 More Reasons Wisconsin Should Make the College Football Playoff,"Seth Abramson, ContributorAttorney; Assistant Professor, UNH; Poet; Editor, Best America...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/4-more-reasons-wisconsin-_b_6270846.html,"In other words, we can look at what some very smart people are saying and see in their words more than a glimmer of hope for the Badgers if they win on Saturday.",2014-12-05,"Wisconsin's Kyle Costigan (54) celebrates with the Paul Bunyan Axe trophy after Wisconsin beat Minnesota 34-24 in an NCAA college football game Saturday, Nov. 29, 2014, in Madison, Wis. (AP Photo/Andy Manis)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7760b250000360039e88c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A couple days ago, I posted an argument for the Wisconsin Badgers making the inaugural College Football Playoff if they beat Ohio State on Saturday. The article drew a wide readership and many strong responses, a majority of which were along the lines of, ""Wisconsin has no place in the playoff discussion."" The College Football Playoff committee putting seven-wins-in-a-row Wisconsin at #13 this week, behind two teams from Mississippi whose combined record over their last 10 games is 5-5 -- with one of those wins coming against an FCS team -- seemed to confirm what many thought: Wisconsin has no shot at the College Football Playoff, win or lose Saturday.But wait.The final word on college sports, ESPN, has now chimed in to say that it believes Wisconsin is very much alive for the playoffs if it wins on Saturday and Florida State loses to Georgia Tech -- a scenario that's not at all unlikely. As ESPN correspondent Heather Dinich wrote in a feature article on the playoffs on Thursday (December 4th), ""If Florida State and Ohio State both lose, the committee would then have to choose among a one-loss Florida State, a second Big 12 team, and Big Ten champion Wisconsin or Mississippi State.""So you're saying there's a chance.In fact, ESPN doubled down on this prediction in its GameDay Kickoff Show live chat, in which Dinich said that if Florida State drops out of the top four spots after this weekend, the beneficiary would be ""Ohio State or Wisconsin.""Because the top experts in the field are now saying Wisconsin's still part of this discussion, and because the question of whether Wisconsin should or should not be discussed as a serious contender to make the playoffs drew a lot of attention and energy this week, I've supplemented my six arguments in favor of the Badgers making the CFP with four more. Ten reasons in total seems like a good number. Given that the CFP committee has pretty clearly signaled that Florida State won't hold on to their #4 ranking if they lose this weekend (after all, they dropped a spot last week even after beating Florida), and because it's inconceivable that a Mississippi State team that's lost two of its last three games would be in the playoffs ahead of a Wisconsin squad that -- with a win over Ohio State -- would have won eight straight games (including seven wins against FBS bowl teams), this article and its predecessor now seem more timely than ever.1. No One Believes Two Losses Is a Disqualifier for the Playoffs. Throughout the college football world this week, we heard that if Alabama got its second loss this weekend against Georgia Tech, it could still make the CFP. We heard the same thing about an Arizona win over Oregon: that it could be enough to put a two-loss Wildcats squad into the playoffs. Kansas State fans took to social media en masse to note that if they beat Baylor and Florida State loses, they should get the #4 spot behind #3 TCU in January, even with two losses. Vegas oddsmakers announced on Monday that Missouri (9-2) had the seventh-best chance of making the playoffs -- 28-1 odds, certainly long ones but not nothing, either -- if they win on Saturday. Yet somehow there has been a sense that Wisconsin (10-2) -- despite becoming officially the hottest team in the FBS if Florida State loses and the Badgers beat the Buckeyes -- was fooling itself to even consider a Big Ten championship and an 11-2 record worthy of playoff consideration. Josh Moyer on ESPN said it would require ""unprecedented craziness"" on Saturday, and other pundits agreed. But let's be clear: the chances of someone making the playoff this year with two losses are not particularly long, whether that someone is Arizona, Kansas State, Georgia Tech, Missouri, Mississippi State or, yes, Wisconsin. Heck, the committee even put a three-loss Ole Miss team within hailing distance of the top four. So let's not pretend a team having two losses is a basis for dismissing them from consideration for the playoffs.2. The Argument Against Wisconsin Ignores the Reality of ""Good Losses"" and ""Bad Wins."" I wrote in my previous article that Wisconsin didn't lose to then-#13 LSU on the field in August -- which is true, given the in-game freak injuries to two-thirds of its defensive line, the loss of its starting quarterback, and a miscommunication that led to Melvin Gordon inadvertently sitting out the second half -- but even if you treat the LSU loss as an on-field defeat, it's a ""good"" loss.The definition of a ""good"" loss is basically any loss that actually strengthens your argument for being a top college football team. Wisconsin, on the road, against a higher-ranked opponent, without its starting quarterback, without its starting running back, without two-thirds of its defensive line, was beating LSU 24-7 at halftime and 24-13 going into the fourth quarter. Whatever you think of what happened in the fourth quarter, remember that this was a game which -- according to the rankings of the two teams and the fact that it was being playing down South -- Wisconsin was supposed to lose. Nothing in that loss suggested that Wisconsin had been erroneously ranked or otherwise misjudged by the AP voters who put them at #15. In fact, the result only confirmed their -- and the nation's -- judgment of this Badger squad as Top 15 material in August. They're much more than that now.There's no way around it: whatever happens on Saturday, one of Baylor's two most recent games will be a game in which it gave up 46 points to a 4-8 team. That's the very definition of a ""bad win."" While Mississippi State -- like every SEC team -- more or less gets credit for a ""good loss"" whenever they lose to anybody in-conference (whereas Wisconsin beating Top 20 Nebraska and Minnesota teams over the past three weeks seemed to mean nothing at all), even the ""good loss"" theory doesn't excuse Mississippi State losing two of its last three, and Ole Miss losing three of its last seven. Not when Wisconsin hasn't lost in months and by Saturday night it might be boasting three wins against Top 20 teams in its last four contests -- including one win, this Saturday in Indianapolis, against a Top 5 team.3. If It Comes Down to Wisconsin and Baylor, Wisconsin Should Be In. Let's assume for a moment that the CFP committee won't put Mississippi State, a non-conference champion, two-loss team that (a) lost its last game, and (b) has lost two of its last three, into the playoffs. And let's imagine, as this article imagines -- and not unreasonably -- that Florida State loses to Georgia Tech on Saturday. If that happens, it's entirely possible that this whole discussion comes down to Baylor and Wisconsin, as the Oregon-Arizona winner (and Pac-12 champion) is likely in, as are Alabama and TCU with (heavily predicted) wins this weekend.If it comes down to a one-loss Baylor team and a two-loss Wisconsin team, a lot of people will be surprised to learn that it's an incredibly close call on the merits, but in the end Wisconsin is the better option for the CFP committee. There are the obvious reasons for this, at least one of which have to do with the fact that if it comes down to Wisconsin and Baylor, TCU is likely already into the playoff due to a win over a horrid Iowa State team this weekend. So here are some numbers the committee would be looking at in that scenario:(a) Wisconsin would be B1G champs, whereas Baylor would merely be an unofficial conference co-champion from a conference already well-represented in the playoffs.(b) Wisconsin's 26-24 road loss to a Top 15 SEC opponent (LSU) in August is a better result than Baylor's pathetic 48-46 win over a terrible (4-8) Texas Tech team last week. If ""good wins"" and ""bad losses"" matter, Baylor having one loss and the Badgers two is a misstatement of where the two teams stand on that score.(c) Wisconsin would be 11-2, and Baylor 10-1, meaning that while Wisconsin would have an extra loss, it would also have an extra win.(d) Wisconsin, with a win Saturday, would have won eight in a row, with seven wins against FBS bowl teams, no narrow victories over bad teams, and three blowouts (more-than-three-score victories) against FBS bowl teams. By contrast, Baylor is 7-1 in its last eight games, with a narrow win over a bad Texas Tech team just last week and only one blowout of an FBS bowl team during that span. And the committee has made clear that recent performance matters a great deal in its deliberations.(e) Wisconsin has defeated (assuming a win against Ohio State) eight FBS bowl teams in total, while Baylor (even with a win Saturday) would only have defeated half that number: four.(f) Wisconsin went 3-1 in non-conference play, playing teams with a combined record of 24-24 and beating one FBS bowl team handily; Baylor went 3-0 in non-conference play, but played teams with a combined record of 11-23 and beat no FBS bowl teams.(g) Wisconsin is a slightly more complete team, ranking #3 nationally in defense and #19 in offense, whereas Baylor has the #3 offense nationally and the #23 defense.(h) Wisconsin wins on the intangibles: a Heisman contender, a Coach of the Year semifinalist, a fan base known to travel well, and the fact that it behooves college football -- all of it -- to have a Big Ten conference that's playing well and duly respected for it. The Big 12 will already have that angle covered with #3 TCU. 4. Smart People Believe Wisconsin Could Make the Playoffs. Is this case for Wisconsin only being made on The Huffington Post? No. Besides ESPN, The New York Times has registered its support for the Badgers, noting two weeks ago that ""recent performance"" could be considered by the CFP committee to justify saving a #4 spot for the Badgers this January. But it wasn't just journos with professional reputations on the line who saw the Badgers as a possible playoff entrant, it was rich guys in Vegas with big-time money at stake. Prior to Wisconsin being named #13 on Tuesday -- rather than the #10 or #11 many expected based on the Badgers' placement in the AP and Coaches' polls -- the three top oddsmakers in Vegas gave Wisconsin 33-1, 35-1, and 40-1 odds to make the CFP, which sound like pretty long odds until you consider three things: (1) those are the eighth-best odds of any team in the nation, meaning that Wisconsin is properly in the playoff conversation, even if they're on the periphery of it; (2) those odds don't take into account this Saturday's games, meaning that a Wisconsin win over a Top 5 opponent (however hampered by the Barrett injury), coupled with a Big Ten championship, could move those odds substantially before Sunday's final CFP selection; and (3) of the seven teams with better odds than Wisconsin to make the playoffs, (a) Wisconsin only needs to outperform four of them to get into the CFP, and (b) at least one of those teams (Alabama or Missouri) has to lose on Saturday, while another (Ohio State) would have fallen behind Wisconsin if a Wisconsin win makes this whole Wisconsin-to-the-CFP conversation necessary. And as already noted, three more of those seven teams -- Oregon, Baylor, and Florida State -- will be playing Top 15 opponents this weekend, making the possibility that one of them loses a very real one. In other words, we can look at what some very smart people are saying and see in their words more than a glimmer of hope for the Badgers if they win on Saturday.A former public defender and current columnist for Indiewire and SB Nation, Seth Abramson is the author of five poetry collections and the Series Co-Editor for Best American Experimental Writing (Wesleyan, 2015).

Those were the memorable instructions I heard years ago from the Austrian ski instructor behind me on the Alps. They hold true today for all sports. Watch a great surfer, the back leg is bent so far that the thigh is parallel to the board. A soccer player with power bends his planted leg in order to generate enough force with the striking foot to fire the ball into the net. The best linemen in the NFL bend low despite their massive size. And, like my instructor pointed out, who can make love without bending their knees?Bending the knees sufficiently is the hardest part, and this only gets harder as athletes age. Golfers progressively stand up more, losing that ideal position for addressing the ball. Tennis players fail to get low enough to generate rotation power from their core. Bowlers don't plant with enough knee bend and the ball hits the alley hard losing spin.Knowing this, you might think that people train to bend their knees. Odd, but watch most people cross-train, if they do at all, they ""go the gym"" or ""ride the bike"" usually with the TV on; in the gym they might bench press or use the elliptical machines; they might even take a Yoga class, believing that is the key to improving their flexibility.The reality is that most sports demand power in knee bending. To generate power for striking a ball, to hold a position while rotating the hips and the back, to get low enough to apply pressure to the back of a surf board or a ski, it takes concentric and eccentric power in the muscles, meaning the ability to generate force while bending and extending. You can only optimally develop that coordinated power by repeating that motion with progressively higher weights and volume of repetitions.So if you are going to train to become a better athlete, the ideal method is the simple squat exercise. The squat, when done properly, perfectly trains all the muscles of the lower extremity and the core muscles, the gluteal (butt) muscles, the abdominal muscles and the paraspinal muscles, in a coordinated fashion. Done with body weight alone, it can be performed anywhere. When adding weights to a bar or making the squat more complicated, such as adding an overhead thrust of a bar with weights, more of the body is engaged and the goals of coordinated fitness are achieved earlier.Proper squat form means the head is in a neutral position, the chest is upright, facing forward, the knees are bent over but not beyond the toes, the hips are lowered as far as they can go, the weight is on the heels, the abdomen muscles are sucked in, and the butt is pushed backwards. The cheapest, most available and best exercise for all sports exists right in your own body. So ""bend ze knees,"" at the very least you may notice it improves your love life!"
12,ENTERTAINMENT,"With 'Wild,' Laura Dern Becomes The Movie Mother Of The Year",Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/laura-dern-wild_n_6271712.html,,2014-12-05,"Laura Dern attends the AARP Movies for Grownups Film Showcase at Regal Cinemas L.A. LIVE on Sunday, November 9, 2014 in Los Angeles. (Photo by Vince Bucci/Invision for AARP/AP Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb490852100000001c80f70.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"According to 2014's movies, Laura Dern has given birth to Reese Witherspoon, Andrew Garfield and Shailene Woodley. Dern is 47, which means she had little Reese, who's now 38, at age 9. For an onscreen mother-daughter duo, that age difference seems like it would ignite red flags. Yet it doesn't matter one bit in ""Wild,"" which finds Witherspoon portraying Cheryl Strayed, who, in 1995, hiked the Pacific Crest Trail by herself after her mother's death and recounted the experience in an Oprah-endorsed best-seller. Dern and Witherspoon's familial chemistry is one of the many authentic elements of the big-screen adaptation, steered by ""Dallas Buyers Club"" director Jean-Marc Vallée and written by ""High Fidelity"" author Nick Hornby.Dern had other mom roles this year in the teen weeper ""The Fault in Our Stars"" and indie festival hit ""99 Homes."" ""Wild"" and ""TFIOS"" have placed Dern, the daughter of Diane Ladd and Bruce Dern, within reach of potential Oscar nominations. (""99 Homes"" hasn't yet hit theaters and therefore isn't eligible this year.) It may seem like Dern is stuck in the supporting realm, but she doesn't mind. The bubbly actress, who landed her first significant role at age 13 in the movie ""Foxes,"" cashed in on her leading-lady chip with HBO's short-lived ""Enlightened,"" and her movie work in 2014 hasn't left anyone wanting. This year you played a mother who loses her daughter and a mother whose daughter loses her. Does living inside those two scripts bring you closer to your own mother at all? Well, certainly, working on these two scripts, in all their differences and all their similarities, because the writers are so authentic. With John Green -- who is such a beautiful man and a great writer -- [""The Fault in Our Stars""] wasn’t his life story, but for him his writing was inspired by a real girl and her family, and so we wanted to pay tribute to his words in that way. ""Wild"" is an even more specific way to pay tribute to Cheryl and to [her mother, Bobbi], but certainly working on things that crack your heart open like this deepens all relationship, and I think it has made me want to make my mom know how loved she is even more. We’re very lucky to have a very loving and deep mother-daughter relationships; we’ve worked together many times and we’re very close. But still, in a new way through this story and through Bobbi’s incredible words, it makes you really want to be grateful for everything you have and the people you have. Had you read the book first? No, I did not. I was offered the part having heard of the book and since loving the book, but had not read it. And then I read the book and the script right after they offered it and spoke to Jean-Marc Vallée. He told me over Skype -- because he was finishing his film ""Dallas Buyers Club"" and doing this and so we were on Skype together -- and he described everything and then I read it and fell madly in love with Cheryl’s words and the story and Bobbi through her, and I spoke to Cheryl on the phone. The minute you read the book, you’re in forever.After reading it, what sort of questions did you have for Cheryl about her mother? She died of cancer when Cheryl was 22, so I'm sure Cheryl herself still has so many questions, too. For me the key was that the essence of the things she says never work in a Pollyanna tale. The profundity of them works and impacts the viewer and the reader because she’s earned her gratitude. We know she’s been through hell and she’s still willing to say, ""Happy people sing,"" and to want to find the gift in everything she’s walked through. That’s what’s so profound because if I wanted to learn more about anything, it was, ""Tell me where she’s come from, I want to know everything she walked through to know how she got here."" And the people I know that really have a wisdom and humility and gratitude are most often the people who’ve been through the most. So it’s a really beautiful thing to learn from those people, to be reminded how lucky we are. But also I had to know as an actor everything she walked through to get her to the place that she could say those things and not say them lightly to her daughter, but say them because she wants them for herself. That’s what moves me so deeply about her. Is hiking the Pacific Crest Trail something you could do if you were in a bad way like that? No. [Laughs]No hesitation whatsoever. Let me be clear. If 10 of your friends and 10 of mine want to come and I can, like, go off and sit and stare at a lake for 10 minutes but we’re all camping together at all times, the idea of immersing myself in nature is really intriguing. But the alone part is an absolute no. I could never have been that brave. Forget it.Did you and Reese know each other before ""Wild""? We’d only met socially, and very few times, but always really loved each other. We shared how much we admired each other’s work and we both started at a similar age, very young. We shared directors and similar actors, really close friends. We’re both from the South. We have a lot of commonality, but we’d never worked together, so it was a huge joy for me that she wanted me to be part of it and produced this and found the material. It is so her baby. She gives so much to people, from having fought to get this movie made the right way with the right filmmaker and to protect Cheryl so deeply. So I feel really, really lucky to be on the ride with her, but from the minute we got to play out this story, which just cracks your heart wide open, we’ve only known each other in a really deep, authentic way. We’ll be friends forever because there’s no cordial ""hello."" We were two peers and women about to embark on needing to express the deepest kind of love story, and how fun for two actresses to do that. How rarified to share that kind of love story. You mentioned sharing directors with Reese, and one of those is Alexander Payne, who gave us two of the best characters of the past 20 years in ""Citizen Ruth"" and ""Election."" Have you kept up with the buzz about ""Obvious Child""? It really picks up the torch that ""Citizen Ruth"" carried years ago. You know, I haven’t seen it yet, so I don’t know. I’m curious. Did you feel that?Yes, it is very much 2014’s version of ""Citizen Ruth"" in the way it addresses abortion with an open mind. Oh, how cool. I can’t wait.""The Comeback"" has returned ... Yes! It’s so genius.Does it give you more impetus to get ""Enlightened"" back on HBO, too? Well, I’ve gotta say, now that it has returned, we can never say never. It’s nine and a half years later, so that’s exciting. I know that the story closed now, but I guess you never know. Oh my god. I would play Amy any day of the week. I just love her so much, so it would be impossible to say no to getting to be in her skin more, as excruciating as it is. It's such a visceral, uncomfortable experience, just like ""The Comeback."" Ah, I love it. Lucy was my hero. I was raised on ""I Love Lucy,"" so that’s my favorite kind of audience experience. So I love playing those kinds of characters and hope that, if not with ""Enlightened,"" with other things, I get to explore that uncomfortableness in drama and comedy.Outside of ""Enlightened,"" it seems like you've only taken supporting roles lately. Are the right leading parts not out there right now? I think a combination of a few things. I think that first off, until this last year, I dedicated -- because I was a co-creator on ""Enlightened,"" too -- three years of my life to that, so I really only had the time to do ""The Master"" and a few other things when I was able to leave and do smaller parts. It was the nature of making that kind of commitment to something. But with that said, the things that have been most exciting that I have been asked to do with filmmakers I love have been supporting roles. And they’re incredible roles. There’s no lead role that I can dream of playing that would mean more to me than playing Bobbi in ""Wild,"" for example, because I’m just so in love with this opportunity and love her so much. But certainly I would love to explore a character in the depths of the way I got to explore Amy. It made me rabid to do that again in a film, so now that I have the time hopefully the opportunity will come soon, too, where you’re just deeply delving into the character from beginning to end, because that’s a really fun thing to explore.Is that what led to your football movie with Judd Apatow? I know you're producing -- are you acting in it, too? Yes, I’ll definitely be acting in it as well, and it will be a really fun ensemble for a great group of women. Are you a big football fan? I am a huge fan of the world and I was raised by a huge football fan, being my father. And as an American and someone who spent a lot of time in the South with my own family, really the one deep ritual we had was the sports season. So that really interests me. What it gives us in our lives, that's what I find really fun. And mostly -- and we’re in really early stages about what is is and what it's going to be -- but mostly I’m just really excited to be on a journey with Judd Apatow because he explores the same world I’ve always loved being in, like with Alexander Payne and David Lynch, where it’s heartbreaking and funny and uncomfortable all at the same time. But he’s figured out a way to do it on a large scale and access a really wide audience who seem to really connect to it to, too, and that’s the kind of storytelling I really love.""Wild"" is currently playing in select theaters."

This is something that happens everyday.,2014-12-04,"PHILADELPHIA, PA - DECEMBER 3: Demonstrators gather in Philadelphia to protest the Eric Garner grand jury decision during a Christmas Tree lighting ceremony at City Hall December 3, 2014 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Organizers called for the demonstration after a grand jury in the Staten Island borough of New York City declined to indict the police officer who used a chokehold on Garner, resulting in his death. (Photo by Mark Makela/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae01fe2400005000964f84.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When I was in college I belonged to an a cappella group called The Inspiration. There is nothing like the experience of different voices coming together in harmony. There is also nothing like being a part of a group of voices that are just missing each other. This discord usually results from either someone in the group singing off key and being momentarily tone-deaf or from someone simply not listening to the other voices in the room. This was my experience the evening that the decision to not indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo for the killing of Eric Garner came out of New York. And this seems to be what our nation is going through with thousands if not millions protesting and speaking out for justice and millions more intentionally or unintentionally employing privilege and choosing to ignore it.There is much in common between singing in harmony and marching in unity with others. Social activism and public demonstrations serve several purposes. Sometimes it is difficult for one voice crying out (or singing) to be heard, but when a group of a few hundred or thousand gather that one voice can become be amplified. Large demonstrations can bring injustice to light, raise awareness to the uninformed, bring hope to those who are discouraged and maybe even influence those in leadership positions. Singing and all forms of art are likewise powerful ways for messages to be expressed.Being a part of a demonstration, like singing, is also cathartic in that it allows one to express and embody the complex emotions that they may hold within. This is of course not the primary reason why anyone takes to the streets. The marching of the last few weeks and months has been for justice, not for an emotional release. Yet there is something about joining with others who feel your pain and lifting your voices and arms and fists that allows for some healing to begin. When marching with others we remember that we are not crazy for being upset or for crying as we read and watch the news. We are encouraged to not give up hope. We are reminded that we are not the only voice singing and that no matter how loud the sirens might get, when our voices come together we can be louder.   On the afternoon and early evening after a New York grand jury decided not to indict Officer Pantaleo after he choked an unarmed African American man named Eric Garner, I joined several hundred other voices as they marched from Philadelphia's 30th St. Station fifteen blocks eastward to City Hall. The experience in the courtyard of City Hall was one of a painful and stunning discord. Not on the part of the demonstrators. In fact there was a beautiful unity on our end with people from diverse racial, ethnic, socio-economic and religious backgrounds all together marching and chanting and raising our voices in harmony.The People United Will Never be Defeated! No the discord came from the city's response. As marchers arrived in the courtyard, someone thought it appropriate to go on with the planned Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony that evening. Thus as people were demonstrating, the emcee and the DJ and the performers went on as if we were not there and as if Eric Garner and Michael Brown's deaths and our outrage did not matter.It truly seemed like Black Lives Did Not Matter.The DJ tried to drown out the sounds of the protesters by blasting Christmas songs. Dance troupes and soloists all came to the stage with all of them seeming to miss the irony of singing ""Silent Night"" or ""O Holy Night"" to a loud group of protesters filled with hurt and anger. Organizers of the tree lighting could not see this even with the presence of the famous/infamous ""Philly Jesus"" activist walking among the protesters (rather than being on stage celebrating the birth of the real Jesus or celebrating the hyper-materialistic holiday we observe around His birth). The sounds blaring from the speakers and the cries to ""Shut it Down!"" from all of us gathered created a heartbreaking discord. I wanted someone to HEAR us and postpone the lighting for just one night. I wanted someone -- anyone -- to just acknowledge the crowd and why we were all there. But nothing. Just a tone-deaf yell from backstage that the show must go on and a turned back to the protesters. A huge tree stood over all of us. Today shiny ornaments and lights hang on it. Not very long ago a black man would have hung on it. There was a time when those in power did not have to listen to the pleas and cries of black individuals at gatherings like this. They could ignore the cries about injustice as they lynched black individuals and then focused on decorating their trees with strange ornamental bodies. In so many painful and terrifying ways this lynching is still happening. And the careless ignoring of the cries of oppressed peoples are also still falling on deaf and tone-deaf ears. One of the marks of privilege and power is the ability to ignore the cries and pain of those who are oppressed. This is something that happens everyday. Some of us can afford to change the station and not pay attention to Black suffering (or any other type of suffering) because we have the power to not feel it. The distance to not care.When folks don't feel heard they do what they must to fix the song. They sing louder. The march over to the person who is ignoring them and sing in their face until they get the right pitch. Hopefully that is enough. Yet sometimes it's more than just one person singing off key. Sometimes the group needs to pause their singing altogether and work as a unified group to get the song right.That's what many people are feeling today. It feels like these aren't just isolated instances that can be chalked up to one cop who racially profiled or one officer who used excessive force on an unarmed man. It doesn't seem like it is just one grand jury and one prosecuting attorney whom we knew would side with the police. It feels like there is something wrong with the system. Our policing system. Our criminal justice system. And while we're at it our incarceration system, educational system and quite frankly the way that people of African descent in this country are viewed (dangerous, monsters, hulks, thugs, demons...). My old singing group occasionally had moments where we too were off. Groups that are tight can adjust mid-song and get back on key. We could sometimes do that. At other times we needed to stop singing and start over. The musical director would go around the room and make sure we all knew our notes and that we all were comfortable with our parts. If someone was off key, we helped him or her fix it. It takes a humble member to admit that they are singing off. Or they can keep on singing off-key, ignoring the frustration of the group. Kind've like the tree lighting organizers did in Philadelphia.I am a pacifist. Committed to non-violence. I'm anti-war, anti-gun violence and against harming others. I'm heartbroken that so much of our nation is coming off as so off-key that I and many of my sisters and brothers in the street feel like civil and in some cases uncivil disobedience is the only way to get the attention of those in our society who refuse to fall into harmony with the rest of us. When it seems like you don't care about black lives, when it seems like you can't hear black voices and all of the other voices out here with us, it make people yell louder and do whatever they/we must do to get you to hear. When it seems like people would rather turn the music up in their cars and sing loudly with the windows up, it makes people want to go into the street, block traffic, lay on the ground and wake everyone up to the fact that our American song is now way off key.Police forces need to lean in and listen. I get the desire to keep these demonstrations safe, but to be overly present in riot gear at a demonstration against police brutality, the over militarization of the police, and unaccountable police forces is an odd miscue. Philly police for the most part have been doing a pretty good job of this, but that has not been the case in other parts of the country. And I have to give a shout to the Black officers who were sent to be in the midst of the crowd last night (while their white counterparts held the outskirts). I saw your tears, felt your conflicted pain, and heard you chanting with us in unity.Our judicial system needs to lean in and listen. The decisions not to indict and even take these situations to a trial scream in off key voices that black lives do not matter -- and certainly not as much as blue ones.And those of us who don't feel connected to this news must lean in and listen. White privilege isn't simply the fact that a white individual can more often than not shop without being followed, commit certain crimes and avoid the harsher punishments of their black counterparts (see #CrimingWhileWhite) or be thought of as being smarter, safer, harder working, prettier, etc. just because of the way you look. White privilege is also the ability to not have to care about things like this. What does caring look like? It means stomaching the traumatizing video of Eric Garner's death. It means saying something on social media. It means not going on with business as usual in your work place or classroom while your black colleagues and students cry silently. Don't keep singing ""Jingle Bell Rock"" while the rest of us are singing ""Strange Fruit.""Stop doing the mundane things that can wait a night and listen to the cries and the songs of justice of a people who are devastated, heartbroken, feeling let down by their country, feeling unsafe in their own cities, and afraid for their young people. We can get back to harmony. But the first step is stopping the music for a second, looking each other in the eye, and then listening to each other."

Huricane Sandy was recorded as the deadliest and most destructive hurricane of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season. It caused over $68 billion in damages, and hundreds of people were killed along the path of the storm in seven countries. Today marks the two-year anniversary of its storm surge hitting New York City and the surrounding area which flooded streets, tunnels and subway lines and cut power in and around the city. (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8dfb72100004202c9683b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- A handful of hedge fund executives aiming to direct more taxpayer money to charter schools pooled their own vast resources to help elect a Republican majority in the New York State Senate last month. They won on election night. Now, it looks like they'll get what they wanted policy-wise.From the final week of September through Election Day, the super PAC New Yorkers for a Balanced Albany, which is managed by the pro-charter school group StudentsFirst NY, spent $4.4 million on eight state Senate races. The effort was the largest of any super PAC during the New York state Senate elections and the most spent by any group on those races.Soon after the election, the state Senate's Republican leader, Dean Skelos, declared that increasing funds for charter schools and lifting the cap on the number of such schools in New York City and the state would be top agenda items for the next legislative session.“It’s a real power play,” said Billy Easton, executive director at the Alliance for Quality Education, a nonprofit promoting increased funding for public schools.But advocates for public schools aren't giving up. On Tuesday, Fordham law professor Zephyr Teachout led a protest by teachers and other activists to highlight the financiers' flood of dollars before the policy debate in Albany begins. Teachout lost a closer-than-expected primary challenge to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) earlier this year.It's not hard to understand why hedge fund managers support the GOP generally: They both want lower taxes on the rich and fewer financial regulations. But at first glance, the financiers' support for charter schools may appear uncharacteristically altruistic.Charter schools operate on taxpayers' money but are managed by private for-profit or nonprofit companies. They were first introduced to New York state in 1998, and since then, they have become a favored cause of the state’s social and financial elites. Individual hedge fund managers may indeed think the charter movement is better for children.The financial industry's vigorous support of privatized education, however, aids its bottom line. Venture capitalists see big promise in the K-12 education market, estimated to be worth about $790 billion next year. Donald Cohen, executive director of think tank In the Public Interest, told The Nation, “It’s really the last honeypot for Wall Street.”A report by GSV Advisors, highlighted by The Nation, found both investors and for-profit education entrepreneurs view the expansion of charter schools as key to increasing profit-seeking investment. They see government regulation and teachers unions as standing in the way.EPR Properties CEO David Brain, whose real estate trust invests in for-profit charters, predicted on CNBC's ""Mad Money"" that charter school funding will likely grow and the caps on their numbers be eliminated ""as the political alignment really supports charter schools.""Teachout told The Huffington Post that the hedge fund managers' electoral spending seemed ""brazenly quid pro quo in terms of the policy aims.” Third Point’s Dan Loeb and Tiger Management’s Julian Robertson each gave $1 million to New Yorkers for a Balanced Albany to elect a Republican Senate. Elliott Management’s Paul Singer and Tudor Investment founder Paul Tudor Jones II pitched in $500,000 a piece. Louis Bacon, Seth Klarman, Carl Icahn and Roger Hertog all made six-figure donations. Singer also gave $500,000 to another pro-Republican Senate group called Balance New York.The hedge fund donors gave direct contributions to political parties and candidates as well. Loeb, Singer, Hertog and Jones donated a combined $477,300 to the New York State Senate Republican Campaign Committee through the end of June, according to the most recent disclosure reports.To counter the criticism of those donations, Jenny Sedlis, executive director of StudentsFirst NY, pointed to the more than $8 million spent by New York State United Teachers on the state legislative elections. The union made $4 million in candidate contributions and spent $4.5 million on independent expenditures.“After spending more than $8 million on this year's elections alone, it is the height of audacity for the special interests that created our broken education system to attack civic-minded individuals who are standing up for students,” Sedlis said in a statement.The teachers union, which raises funds in small amounts from dues-paying members, made its independent expenditures in nine New York State Senate races and 13 New York State Assembly races. Its direct contributions were far more spread out to additional legislative candidates and PACs.Though much of the pro-charter school money went to boost GOP campaigns, Republicans are not the only New Yorkers who support charter schools. Gov. Cuomo is also a staunch backer. And the same hedge fund donors who bankrolled New Yorkers for a Balanced Albany put $214,000 into Cuomo’s coffers. Overall, the governor raised more than $2.6 million from the securities and investment sector.Cuomo has previously come to the aid of billionaire hedge fund activists. When New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) sought to fund universal prekindergarten in the city with higher taxes on the rich, Cuomo stepped in to quash the tax increase. The governor further forced the city to allow charter schools to operate inside public school buildings or to pick up the tab on their rent for private buildings.He looks likely to side with charter proponents again. After the election, Cuomo stated his support for expanding the number of charter schools in the state.Tuesday's protesters would rather see the government increase funds for already operating public schools than divert money to charter schools. But they said they fear those with the biggest wallets will have their way in the next legislative session.“It’s not going to happen without a real fight,” Teachout vowed."

That's up from a paltry $18 billion six months ago. Uber's investors are apparently unfazed by bad press. In recent months, the company has had to apologize for a top executive threatening to smear journalists critical of the business. It's also been rated F by the Better Business Bureau, protested by its own drivers, kicked out of Las Vegas and accused of dirty practices aimed at undercutting its rivals.But Uber is willing to acknowledge it has issues.""The events of the recent weeks have shown us that we also need to invest in internal growth and change,"" CEO Travis Kalanick said in the blog post announcing the new funding. He promised Uber would make changes to become ""a smarter and more humble company.""One possible teensy consolation for Uber is this factoid suggested by Wall Street Journal editor Dennis Berman: Roughly four years ago, the company was worth $60 million. Today it's worth $40 billion. At this rate of growth, it is appreciating by $19,839 per minute, according to Berman's math.If you had invested $10,000 in the company when it started, that $10,000 would be worth about $80 million now, estimates tech investor Semil Shah -- though the effects of the company repeatedly issuing new stock would have cut that gain down significantly by making stock worth less. Maybe your $10,000 share would only be worth $20 million today. Still, $20 million > $10,000, according to my math.At the moment, Uber is worth more than most members of the Standard & Poor's 500 index. It is worth more than Delta Air Lines and the railroad company CSX. It's also worth more than all the personal real estate in Anaheim, California. Whether the company is actually worth all that money, or whether it's just the poster child for a growing startup bubble, is a different question altogether. Uber is making a lot of money, though the exact amount won't be entirely clear until the company goes public -- at which point maybe you can help boost Uber's valuation, too.An Uber spokeswoman declined to provide further comment.

The board was scheduled to take comments from activists on both sides of the abortion issue before voting on the regulations Friday. (AP Photo/Steve Helber)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8dfbd3c000020010dfbf2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Virginia's Board of Health voted Thursday to begin a process of revising tough restrictions on abortion clinics, in a setback for abortion opponents. Both abortion rights advocates and opponents had rallied in Richmond, Virginia, ahead of the decision, which was set in motion with the election of Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe last year. The board voted 13-2 to move ahead with the Notice of Intended Regulatory Action, as six new McAuliffe appointees joined seven other board members to amend the current rules that single out such clinics from those performing other outpatient procedures.The regulations pushed by former Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell and Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli were a part of a wave of so-called ""TRAP Laws,"" or Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers, advanced by Republican legislators in a number of states. Such laws require abortion clinics to comply with the same construction standards as new hospitals. Five clinics had already been forced to close in Virginia because of the prohibitive cost to expand hallways and parking lots and install locker rooms, janitors' closets and ventilation systems. Reproductive rights proponents say that such regulations are medically unnecessary and aim to restrict access to the procedure, while abortion opponents say they're instead meant to make the procedure safer for patients. The Virginia Department of Health estimated that complying with the regulations could force each of the state's 18 remaining abortion clinics to spend over $2.5 million each. The board met to reconsider the rules under the direction of Virginia Health Commissioner Dr. Marissa Levine, who announced in October that, in her view, the regulations ought to be amended ""to be aligned more accurately with medical best practices."" Of the 14,279 public comments the state's health department received ahead of its decision, more than 10,000 requested that the regulations be repealed. NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia hailed the board's decision to move ahead with amendments to the regulations after the vote. ""We are absolutely thrilled with the Board’s vote to move forward with amendments to medically-inappropriate restrictions on women’s health centers,” the group's executive director, Tarina Keene, said in a statement. ""The Board’s decision today is a first, crucial step towards ensuring that these politically-motivated restrictions are revised, and that our safe, trusted women’s health care centers can remain open and accessible for Virginia’s women and families.”McAuliffe also commended the board in a statement Thursday. ""These clinics provide essential preventive care and cancer screenings to many women and families and unfortunately were facing closure due to onerous regulations that were the result of politics being inserted into the regulatory process,"" he said. Existing rules dictating clinic architectural and operational requirements will remain in place for up to two years as the state's executive branch, health department and board of health consider specific amendments. According to the Guttmacher Institute, 22 states require facilities where abortion services are provided to meet ambulatory surgical center standards, even though less than 0.3 percent of abortion patients experience complications that requires hospitalization.

Directed by Amanda Dehnert, the production features a kind of crazy quilt of styles -- from British pantomime and vaudeville mugging to hip-hop choreography and story theater narration. Some of it works, and some doesn't. The main problem is the inconsistency of tone. While Dehnert takes an admirably innovative approach to the classic Sondheim show by injecting a more lighthearted and playful atmosphere, she misses the mark in the deeper, more emotionally affecting aspects of Sondheim's and book writer James Lapine's musing on the mysteries of childhood. Much to Dehnert's credit, she has assembled a solid cast who do fine work with the difficult Sondheim score and engage the story with energy and enthusiasm. Miriam A. Laube is outstanding as the witch, with a richness of voice and depth of acting that is admirable. Kjerstine Rose Anderson is an exciting and hilarious Little Red Riding Hood, and Jennie Greenberry is a marvelous Cinderella. Miles Fletcher as Jack and Jeff Skowron as the Baker are both skilled and engaging, as is John Vickery as the narrator. Royer Bockus is captivating as Rapunzel. The show moves along briskly, with Martin Majkut conducting a small, talented orchestra. Costumes by Linda Roethke are fanciful and fun."

Gabriel Snyder, who is currently overseeing digital efforts at Bloomberg Media and was previously top editor at Gawker and The Wire, has been hired to replace Foer.Speculation had run rampant that Foer might leave the magazine, which he returned to edit in 2012 following its sale to Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes. Some staffers fear that Hughes and chief executive Guy Vidra are too focused on increasing Web traffic, and that such a strategy could pull the magazine away from its legacy of narrative journalism and criticism. Staffers said they were blindsided by Vidra's hiring to a newly created position above Foer. And concerns grew following a Oct. 24 all-hands meeting in which Hughes and Vidra spoke about the magazine as if it was a tech start-up, sources told The Huffington Post. At the meeting, there was even some talk of the staffers getting shares in the company after the restructuring. The message conveyed by Hughes, according to one staffer, was to be less like The New Yorker and more like Facebook.The conflicting visions seemed evident during last month’s centennial gala. Foer and Wieseltier, who has worked at the magazine for thirty years, evoked its traditions and heralded past editors, while Hughes and Vidra emphasized the need to experiment and grow online. In a Thursday memo to staff, Foer acknowledged the competing plans for the magazine's future. ""Chris and Guy have significant plans for this place,"" he wrote. ""And their plans and my own vision for TNR meaningfully diverge.""Several New Republic staffers told The Huffington Post they side with Foer and Wieseltier, and that some are considering following them out the door.“All of us here are pretty depressed and disgusted,” a senior staffer said.In his memo, Foer described The New Republic as ""one of the great loves of my life -- a set of ideas, a history, a collection of people I revere. ""I grew up here, made my best friends here, and learned so many profound lessons about the world in the process,"" Foer wrote. ""Part of the joy has been the struggle: We've fought to preserve an institution that was perpetually imperiled,"" he continued. ""It's been hairy at moments, no doubt, but also exhilarating and immense fun. I've had an especially wonderful time these past two and half years. We've published essays and journalism that have actually, in moments, changed the world, or at least people's opinions about the world.""In a separate memo to staff, Vidra praised the outgoing editors and explained why management believes Snyder is best equipped to steer the magazine in a new direction.""Gabriel is ideally suited to bridge traditional journalism and digital media. He is committed – as am I – to The New Republic’s mission of impact, influence and persuasion, but understands that fulfilling that mission in today’s media landscape requires new forms,"" Vidra wrote. ""He truly reflects the 'straddle generation' of journalists and editors who remain deeply rooted in the qualities of traditional journalism -- having worked with brands such as the New York Observer and The Atlantic -- but also understands what it takes to create content that will travel across all platforms. We believe he is the right person to help us to maintain the core DNA of The New Republic, while propelling us forward to the 21st century.""Vidra also announced a coming ""recalibration of our resources,"" which will involve making changes to staff structure and decreasing the number of print issues published each year from 20 to 10. He said that The New Republic's center of gravity would shift from Washington, D.C., to New York, noting that the magazine will have a ""newly re-designed, expanded office"" in Union Square. ""New York was the original home of The New Republic, and we’re thrilled to further expand our presence here,"" he wrote. On Twitter, previous New Republic writers and others close to the magazine criticized the shift. The New Yorker's Ryan Lizza, who had previously been a New Republic staff editor, tweeted that he wanted his ""contributing editor"" title immediately removed from the magazine's masthead.""So for Chris Hughes, 100 years of The New Republic was apparently enough,"" tweeted The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8dfc224000050005775a2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(Adds details, quotes starting in fourth paragraph.)By Richard CowanWASHINGTON, Dec 4 (Reuters) - U.S. Republicans, outraged with President Barack Obama for easing deportations of millions of undocumented residents, plan legislation in 2015 strengthening the U.S.-Mexican border to discourage illegal immigration.The move, likely to come early next year according to House Republican leadership aides, may lead to other steps the House of Representatives could contemplate to repair parts of U.S. immigration law.When legislation materializes, it would follow a year and half of congressional inactivity in the aftermath of the passage of a sprawling Senate bill backed by Obama but killed by the House.""I think there is the realization...that this issue is not going away,"" said Republican Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, who has labored to write broad immigration legislation.House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul likely will oversee the effort, according to leadership aides. McCaul has pushed legislation imposing tough standards for border apprehensions.Given the House's rejection of the Senate's work in 2013, a strategy is emerging for 2015 to have the House take the lead in the hope of making better progress.The 2013 Senate bill's pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented residents was a lightning rod for opposition.""I want it to start in the House,"" said Republican Senator John McCain, a leading immigration reform proponent.McCain said bills improving border security, establishing an online system for companies to check their workers' immigration status and expanding visas for high-tech foreign workers could be first out of the gate. The latter two are important to U.S. businesses.Senior House Republican aides said it was unclear what bills might move next year beyond border security.Republicans hope to gain more control of the immigration debate as they will hold majorities in the House and Senate for the first time since 2006.They need to improve their standing with Hispanic-American voters as the party strives to capture the White House in 2016. DIFFICULTIES ABOUNDPassing tougher immigration measures will be difficult, though, as Democratic votes will be needed.Obama warned business leaders this week that ""it's going to be hard, I think, for me and for other Democrats"" to support piecemeal legislation that deals with the concerns of business but does not address undocumented Americans.One leading Democrat on immigration, Representative Zoe Lofgren, was asked if she could support a Republican border security bill, for example.""It depends on what it is,"" Lofgren said, adding Republican Representative ""Steve King wants to do a (border) wall with electrified wire...I don't think that's a winning vote.""Ultimately, Republicans must address the approximately 12 million undocumented residents living in the United States for extended periods, McCain and Diaz-Balart said.Many Republicans argue that allowing them to stay in the U.S. rewards law-breakers.Meanwhile, House Republican leadership is more conservative with the recent election of Representative Steve Scalise to the third-ranking position. Scalise opposes giving legal status to undocumented residents.Furthermore, the House immigration debate could unfold as a seasonal spike of illegal migration from Central America gets underway. Last summer's arrival of tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors stoked tensions between Republicans and immigration advocates.For legislation to succeed in 2015, ""a lot of things have to line up and they're not lined up now,"" said one Republican congressman who asked not to be identified.
