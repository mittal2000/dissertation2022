2,POLITICS,Lindsey Graham Was The Butt Of Jon Stewart's Jokes For Years. Now The Comedian Has Impressed Him.,Scott Conroy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lindsey-graham-jon-stewart-911_us_566dc159e4b0fccee16eed78,"""I don't know if it would've happened without him.""",2015-12-13,Jon Stewart's grandfather was born in Inner Mongolia.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55c26dcd1d00002f00143f5b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"MANCHESTER, N.H. -- For years, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) was a frequent punching bag for former Daily Show host Jon Stewart, who created and honed a caricature of the 2016 Republican presidential candidate as an effete, mint julep-sipping relic of the Old South.There appear to be no hard feelings. Graham was at work in Washington last week when he ran into Stewart -- who was in town to lobby Congress to pass a bill that would extend health care funding for 9/11 first responders. During that encounter, Graham said, he told Stewart that he was a firm supporter of the comedian’s pet cause.In an interview with The Huffington Post, Graham recalled that Stewart cornered him in the halls of the Senate to lobby for the bill and that the South Carolinian assured him immediately that he would help get the legislation enacted.After parting ways with Stewart, Graham said that he approached Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) between votes -- with help from Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), a co-sponsor of the 9/11 responder bill -- to press him to spearhead passage. “[McConnell] told both of us it would be in the package, and I think that’s good news for the first responders, who were exposed to a lot of bad stuff after 9/11,” Graham said. “I know there’s some offset problems, but the big picture’s got to prevail here. These men and women went into harm’s way after the largest attack on American soil in modern history, and I know some of them have suffered, and I’m confident that Sen. McConnell’s word is his bond, and it will be in the omnibus package.”McConnell told Politico Friday that the 9/11 responder bill would indeed be included in the impending year-end spending bill. His office told Politico that the GOP leader had always intended to support the bill, regardless of Stewart’s efforts.Graham, however, painted a different picture of the comedian's influence.“I think Jon, in taking on this cause as his cause with his visibility and profile -- and, quite frankly, his sincerity -- made a big difference,” Graham said. “He became the face and the voice of this cause, and he did it in a really nonpartisan manner. He was forceful, but he wanted to get a result. And I think his tenacity, along with those in the 9/11 community, won the day. I don’t know if it would’ve happened without him.”Graham was in New Hampshire for campaign events late last week and is slated to return to the first-in-the-nation primary state next weekend. In New Hampshire, he will once again be joined by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who won the primary twice but has not been able to boost Graham’s standing as an extreme long shot. Despite his struggles on the campaign trail, Graham expressed satisfaction that the 9/11 responder legislation appears set for passage.“It means that every now and then, Washington can still get it right,” he said. “It means that celebrity can be used for good, and it means that petitioning your government is alive and well.”Related on HuffPost:"

Exactly what the nature of that ""attack"" was going to be, however, was not specified. Was it going to be another, this time more extensive, round of bombings or was it going to be a broader campaign to take control of the city itself? On December 11th, Taliban militants did attack the Spanish Embassy in Kabul killing a Spanish policeman and an officer at the embassy. In addition four Afghan policeman and a foreign civilian were killed in the fighting. It's unclear whether the U.S. embassy warning was referencing the attack on the Spanish embassy or some other planned campaign.The warning came only weeks after Taliban forces had seized and temporarily held the northern city of Kunduz; the first time they had controlled a city since 2001. It followed a number of largely unsuccessful but persistent Taliban attacks in Kabul over the summer and fall. These attacks included a car bomb attack against NATO forces in central Kabul on October 11, an attack on an Afghan intelligence center in the western area of the Afghan capital on October 5, a series of bombings on August 7 and 8 against an Afghan army base in the Shah Shaheed residential district and a suicide bombing at the Kabul Police Academy that killed 20 cadets. Over the first half of the year, civilian casualties in Afghanistan reached a record high of 3,329, up four percent from the comparable period in 2014, although fatalities had fallen to 1,592, a decline of six percent.On October 15, the Obama Administration announced that it was halting further troop reductions from Afghanistan and that the current deployment would continue thought 2017. The announcement quelled widespread speculation that a complete U.S. and NATO withdrawal was imminent. Originally, the White House had promised that all American troops would be out of Afghanistan by 2014. The warning, coupled with the continued incidents of violence, reinforced the widely held belief that the Taliban is continuing to gain strength in Afghanistan. This perception has been steadily increasing since 2006 and has become more widespread as U.S. and NATO troops have steadily withdrawn from forward operating bases throughout Afghanistan. The conventional wisdom is that when U.S. and NATO troops are eventually withdrawn, the Taliban will be able to retake control of Afghanistan. The U.S. decision to extend the American deployment is thus only a short respite, putting off for a few more years the inevitable return of the Taliban. While the Taliban's return to power is not out of the question, there are a number of factors that make such a return extremely difficult, if not unlikely.  Mullah Akhtar Mansoor, new Taliban leaderFirst of all, there has been growing evidence that the Taliban leadership is badly split into two mutually antagonistic groups. On July 30, a Taliban spokesman had confirmed that the group's leader since 1994, Mullah Mohammad Omar, died in April 2013 from an unspecified illness in a Karachi hospital and that the Taliban Leadership Council in Pakistan, the Quetta Shura, had appointed Omar's deputy, Mullah Akhtar Mansoor, to head the movement and had officially designated him as the Amir Ul Mumineen, the ""commander of the faithful."" The same position claimed by the head of Islamic State, al-Baghdadi. The announcement came in response to an Afghan government announcement that it was preparing to release credible evidence that Mullah Omar had been dead for at least two years.Mansour was a member of the Taliban government that ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001 where he served as aviation minister. He had fought alongside Omar as part of the original anti-Soviet mujahedeen in the 1980s and had been part of the Taliban movement and its core leadership from the very beginning. Mansour, however, lacks the prestige of Mullah Omar. Indeed, the official announcement of Omar's death and Mansour's appointment as his replacement sparked widespread resentment within the Taliban when it became clear that Mansour had effectively been issuing orders in Mullah Omar's name for the previous two years while the knowledge of Omar's death was kept secret from the rest of the Taliban rank and file. Moreover, in the weeks following Mansour's appointment, reports began to circulate that Mullah Omar's death had been orchestrated by the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence agency and that it had been carried out by Mullah Mansour himself. Officially the Taliban had claimed that Omar died a natural death, only later disclosing that it had been as a result of a long-running battle with Hepatitis C. It's unclear to what extent these reports were true or whether they were misinformation orchestrated by the National Directorate of Security (NDS), the Afghani intelligence agency. In any case, a competing leadership group drawn from Mullah Omar's family and other close associates declared that they would not accept Mansour's leadership. Chief among them was Mullah Abdul Manan, Omar's brother, Mullah Mohammad Yacoub, Omar's eldest son, and Mullah Mohammad Rasool Akhund, a longtime friend of Omar. On September 15, a statement on the Taliban's Voice of Jihad, its official website, claimed that Mullahs Akhund and Yacoub had both agreed to swear loyalty to Mansour. On November 2, however, this same faction of the Taliban announced that they had rejected Mansour's leadership and had appointed Akhund as their leader, bestowing on him, in direct competition with Mansour, the title of Amir Ul Mumineen. During the Taliban years in power, Akhund had been governor of Nimroz province and during the period of insurgency he had functioned as the ""shadow governor"" of Farah province. Both provinces, in the extreme southwest of Afghanistan, are part of the Taliban's historic power base. Akhund in turn appointed Mullah Mansour Dadullah, a well-known Taliban military commander and longstanding rival of Mansour, as one of his military deputies. Since then open fighting has erupted between the two groups. Since November 9, approximately 80 Taliban fighters loyal to Akhund's faction, possibly including Mansour Dadullah, have been killed in clashes with pro-Mansour Taliban fighters. On December 2, Afghan government sources claimed that the Taliban leader Mullah Mansour had been injured, possibly fatally, in a firefight that had erupted during a meeting of Taliban commanders in Kucklah, Pakistan. The Taliban subsequently denied the report claiming that they had been planted by the NDS. On December 4, the Afghan government issued a second statement claiming that Mullah Mansour had died as a result of the injuries suffered in the alleged firefight. On December 6, the Taliban issued an audiotape purported to be from Mansour in which he expressed his condolences to those who had been killed in the firefight but claiming he was still very much alive. Interestingly enough both Afghan government sources and a number of Taliban leaders expressed doubt about the authenticity of the recording. For the moment, at least, it appears that the divisions within the Taliban are substantial and that the movement is badly split. It is unclear whether Mansour is still alive or what impact his possible death may have on those divisions.There have been ""splits"" in the Taliban before, typically between so called ""moderates"" that were open to a reconciliation with the Afghan government and ""hardliners"" that were determined to continue fighting. It's possible that such ""splits"" were ""manufactured"" by the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence directorate (ISI) in an attempt to manipulate American perceptions of the Taliban and to encourage an American withdrawal. The most recent ""split"" may be a case of the same, although this time it seems more genuine. In addition to the split in the Taliban, the strategic landscape in Afghanistan is completely different in 2015 than it was in 1996 when the Taliban first came to power. First of all, in 1996 there was no central government. The Najibullah government had collapsed in 1992 and Afghanistan spent the following four years sliding deeper into a state of anarchy. The countryside was dominated by warlords who had no political legitimacy and who ruthlessly exploited the villages they controlled. Internationally, Afghanistan wasn't drawing much attention from any of the major powers. The U.S. had withdrawn from the region following the withdrawal of Soviet troops in 1989 and the subsequent unravelling of the Afghan government. Russia, in 1996, seven years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, was in a state of disarray and was hardly in a position to exert significant influence much less lend meaningful support to any potential allies in Afghanistan. India and Iran, especially the latter, were interested bystanders. Iran had long standing interests in Afghanistan given its historic ties to the Shia Hazari people of western Afghanistan. Moreover, the chaos in Afghanistan had resulted in almost three million Afghan refugees in Iran. Tehran too had a vested interest in seeing some semblance of order brought to Afghanistan even if it wasn't in a very strong position to impose its preferred solution. India gave some aid to the Northern Alliance, but otherwise was not actively involved. In these circumstances, Pakistan's ISI had a relatively free hand to organized and direct the Taliban movement and orchestrate their rise to power in Afghanistan.If the United States and NATO forces withdraw from Afghanistan, it is very likely that Russia will return to its traditional role as the Afghan government's principal sponsor. Already, the Kabul government has asked Moscow for additional military aid and Moscow has agreed to sell Afghanistan an unknown number of Mi-35 attack helicopters. In addition, Russia has in recent years emerged as the principal supporter of the Tajik centered Northern Alliance and it has long standing ties to Afghan vice president Abdul Rashid Dostum, a Tajik and also a former general in the Northern Alliance.  General Abdul Rashid Dostum, photograph courtesy of A DostumAccording to unconfirmed reports, current Russian financial and military aid to the Northern Alliance amounts to about 200 million dollars a year. It is no coincidence that the Northern Alliance militias are sporting brand new Ak-47s. In addition, Russia has deployed air forces at its former Ayni air base in Tajikistan, close to the Afghan border, allowing it to provide air support for the Northern Alliance and to a lesser extent, if need be, Afghan government forces elsewhere in the country. India had provided some support to the Northern Alliance and had operated a military hospital at the former Soviet air base in Farkhor, on the Afghan-Tajikistan border during the 1990s. More recently, it also paid for the modernization of both the Ayni and Farkhor air bases. There have been persistent reports that the Indian government is interested in stationing Indian air forces at either of the two air bases, but has consistently been blocked by Moscow from doing so. Iran has long-standing ties to the Shia Hazara people of western Afghanistan that stretch back centuries. Moreover, there are long standing frictions between Afghan Pashtun's and the Hazara. The latter were subject to intense Pashtunization campaigns during the 20th century and were forcefully urbanized. Large numbers of Hazara refugees escaped to Iran during the Taliban years. Iran has funded Shia mosques, universities, TV stations and charities in Afghanistan with particular attention to the Hazara communities. Many Hazara leaders have been educated in Iran and have sought refuge there from time-to-time. Iran has organized and trained Hazara militias, some of which are currently deployed in Syria in support of the Assad regime, and that could be redeployed to Afghanistan in the event of an imminent Taliban takeover. Notwithstanding these close ties, however, the Hazara community is politically and ethnically complex with significant differences between educated, Western oriented, urban Hazaras and their uneducated rural brethren. It would be a mistake to see them solely as Iranian proxies. In addition, Iran has historically supported the Tajiks of the Northern Alliance against the Taliban, even though they were predominantly Sunni, and would be expected to do so again, this time more forcefully, in the event of an attempted Taliban takeover. Pakistan's future role in Afghanistan is a complex and an uncertain one. Since 1994, the Taliban has been Pakistan's principal vehicle for exerting its influence in Afghanistan. Pakistani funding, safe havens and support have been critical both to the rise of the Taliban to power in Afghanistan and for their continued survival since 2001. During the American and NATO led intervention that began in 2001, Pakistan has been officially supporting the U.S. led operation, been fighting the Taliban related Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan insurgency in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), while at the same time providing assistance to the Afghan Taliban, as well as al-Qaeda militants hiding in Pakistan. In recent months there have been persistent reports from Kabul that Pakistan's ISI has been involved with organizing the Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan and may have tried to facilitate the migration of Taliban supporters to that jihadist organization. Sources in the Afghan government believe that the ISI may be laying the groundwork to use the Afghan Islamic State affiliate to advance its objectives in Afghanistan should the Taliban organization disintegrate or ultimately look to reach a peace agreement with the Kabul government. Although the withdrawal of NATO forces from many of their forward operating bases have increased the ability of the Taliban to project its force into the rural areas, the Taliban remains deeply unpopular in the cities. Currently, the Taliban has the ability to exert considerable force in some 40% of Afghanistan, virtually all of it in rural areas. It has the ability to stage attacks in the major cities but it lacks the ability to take or hold the major cities. It does have considerable financial resources available to it and has an annual budget believed to be in excess of two billion dollars with which, among other things, to bribe or suborn its opponents. The impression of its rising power notwithstanding, however, it is still a very long way from re-exerting the degree of control over Afghanistan that it had in 2001. As long as the U.S. and NATO forces remain in Afghanistan it is unlikely that it can reassert that position. Even if U.S. and NATO forces were to completely withdraw, Russian, Iranian and Indian supported proxies would prove to be a considerable obstacle to its return to power in Kabul.  Afghan military attack during the recapture of KunduzIn that sense the Taliban raid on the city of Kunduz must be seen not as the start of a new Taliban campaign to assert its control over the major cities but rather as an attempt to underscore its continued relevance in Afghanistan and more importantly to legitimatize the role of Mullah Mansour as the leader of the organization. According to Afghan sources, the Taliban spent millions of dollars in bribes to local elected officials and senior military officers to ensure that they would be conveniently absent during the time of the attack in order to ensure its success even though they had no expectation that they would be able to hold the city over the long-term.The entire attacking force is believed to have been approximately 900 men, most of whom were not active Taliban militants, but locally recruited free agents. Raising a temporary army in rural Afghanistan is not difficult. Virtually everyone in rural areas is armed. A couple of hundred thousand dollars and the prospect of a little loot on the side will get you the services of 500 to 1,000 fighters for two to four weeks. Ammunition is extra. The choice of Kunduz was also symbolic. The city lies across the key transportation route connecting central Asia with the Arabian Sea to the south and with the Punjab plain and the Indian subcontinent to the southeast. According to Afghan intelligence sources, Mullah Mansour had been scheduled to make an appearance in Kunduz following the Taliban takeover of the city but was unable to do so when his convoy ran into unexpected roadblocks. The attack was little more than an expensive PR stunt. Its purpose was simply to set the stage for Mullah Mansour's public debut and in the process remind the rest of the world that the Taliban is still relevant. It is still too early to dismiss the Taliban in the future of Afghanistan but neither is its success or a return to its previous position of power the foregone conclusion that many believe it is. For now the situation remains fluid and the future of the Taliban and of Afghanistan continues to remain in flux."

7,COLLEGE,The Re-Education of Justice Scalia,"Patricia McGuire, ContributorPresident, Trinity Washington University",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-re-education-of-justi_b_8799878.html,"Justice Scalia should know better; if nothing other than judicial temperament could guide him, he should know that a wise judge must think twice before opening his mouth to say something really stupid and highly prejudicial in front of the parties arguing their case before him.",2015-12-13,"WASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 15: U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia addresses the The Legal Services Corporation's 40th anniversary conference luncheon Septemeber 15, 2014 in Washington, DC. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is also scheduled to address the LSC, which was established by the Congress in 1974 'to provide equal access to justice and to ensure the delivery of high-quality civil legal assistance to low-income Americans.' (Photo by Chip Somode/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae60c22000003000ff45fb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"While Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia's comments doubting the ability of Black students to succeed at competitive universities may not be a total surprise, given his well-known and relentlessly right-wing views, they are extremely disappointing given his leadership position in American society. He made the comments during oral arguments last week in the case of Fisher v. The University of Texas at Austin revisiting that university's affirmative action in admissions policies. Sadly, we are living in an age in which too many public leaders, or those aspiring to high leadership positions, seem to feel free to say any darn thing that pops into their heads no matter how ignorant, corrosive or just plain wrong. When those statements disparage and degrade an entire segment of the population that the leader is sworn to serve, the comments become more than merely outrageous; they threaten to damage the entire fragile fabric of this very diverse national community.Justice Scalia should know better; if nothing other than judicial temperament could guide him, he should know that a wise judge must think twice before opening his mouth to say something really stupid and highly prejudicial in front of the parties arguing their case before him. Judicial prudence alone, if not a more well-honed moral sensibility, should have checked his tongue before he pronounced a view that African American students should go to ""slower track"" colleges. From the Supreme Court transcript, here is the entire exchange with Gregory G. Garre, the lawyer for the University of Texas:MR. GARRE: What I'd like to say too is, if this Court rules that University of Texas can't consider race, or if it rules that universities that consider race have to die a death of a thousand cuts for doing so, we know exactly what's going to happen. Experience tells us that. This happened at the University of Texas after the Hopwood case: Diversity plummeted, especially among African Americans. Diversity plummeted at selective institutions in California, Berkeley, and UCLA, after Prop 209. And that is exactly what's taking place today at the University of Michigan. Now is not the time, and this is certainly not the case.Justice Scalia was apparently asking some kind of question about whether the strange theory of ""mismatch"" in higher education has any validity. The ""mismatch"" theory claims that affirmative action policies harm minority students by placing them in environments where they cannot succeed; a great deal of social science research and actual practice in higher education debunks this theory. But whatever anybody thinks of the theory, asking questions about it in the context of oral arguments in an affirmative action case is completely fair. As an experienced justice, Scalia surely has the rhetorical repertoire to ask the question with sensitivity and grace -- if he wanted to do so. Instead, he phrased the question in a way that made a declaration from the bench that seemed not only to agree with the theory, but to take it to an even baser level of vile mischaracterization of Black students as unable to perform.Justice Scalia needs some serious re-education. I'm not sure what kind of history or sociology Nino Scalia studied as an undergraduate at Georgetown University, but it appears that he was untouched by any study of American history, slavery, the Civil War, Reconstruction and the rise of the Civil Rights Movement, the economics and sociology and psychology of generations of poverty, the segregation of American public education, the condition of families and cities. Perhaps he skipped Theology classes on social justice. Quite obviously, his comments flunk any reasonable test of knowledge and critical reasoning about the racial and social history of the United States and the reasons why public policy must create educational and social opportunities for individuals who continue to suffer the pernicious effects of two centuries of racism; private action alone is inadequate to remedy the broad social consequences of the deep poverty that is the consequence of the denial of equal opportunity in education and employment. Affirmative action is not about pitting the lesser versus the better; rather, it's about creating opportunity for those who have historically had none, who, if given the opportunity, can flourish and change the course of history for their families.Poverty certainly afflicts White as well as Black and Hispanic children in America, but in American cities, the pernicious effects of poverty clearly segregate neighborhoods, schools and school systems, and Black and Latino children suffer the effects of poverty disproportionately. Abysmal public schooling, reinforced by racially biased housing patterns and funding formulas, has left generations of impoverished urban Black children on the lowest rungs of educational achievement. The ""achievement gap"" is not about the ability of students to succeed, but rather, about the ways in which generations of deficient public schools have robbed children of their real academic potential; impoverished families cannot send their kids to private schools, hire tutors and coaches, spend money on all of the perks that open pathways to elite colleges.The only way to remediate the poverty that reinforces racism is to improve educational opportunities for Black children who can and will succeed mightily, changing the fortunes of their children and families significantly.  Scalia's reference to ""a less advanced school, a slower track school"" is also an affront to Historically Black Colleges and Universities, as well as those institutions of higher education who actually do a great job educating a broadly diverse student body. This comment plays into the current vogue of exalting a few elite colleges and universities while disdaining the rest. Is a college with a very tiny number of African American students really ""better"" than one that has many? Perhaps all students at the University of Texas should be protesting policies that diminish their opportunities to experience a truly diverse student body.When given the chance to become academically powerful, Black and Hispanic students excel just as much as White students. At Trinity in Washington, where I am president, we educate a student body that is majority African-American and Latina, mostly low income women from the District of Columbia where the poverty rate is among the worst in the nation for families living on the eastern side of the city. Our experience demonstrates that students who have been previously marginalized in the American experience of elite education can and do learn very well when given the opportunity to do so in an environment that supports and encourages their success.   Scalia's comments also reinforce the pernicious idea that what is mostly White and elite is best, and somehow should not be disturbed by the challenges that come with greater integration of different learning styles and cultural habits, different skin colors and belief systems and points of view. His statement reveals a deep yearning to turn back the clock to some mythical times when nobody made trouble about integrating schools; a time at least before 1954 when Brown v. Board of Education made it clear that separate could never be equal, that the true promise of the American experiment could only be realized when all children have equal opportunity in education.Seven years ago, nearly 70 million Americans voted for the first African American president in the history of the United States. At that time, commentators heralded President Barack Obama's election as the beginning of a new ""post-racial"" American society. Now on the verge of a new election season, the United States is suffering a paroxysm of racial hatred, violence and protests; campuses boil with racial tensions and serious demands for improved racist conditions faster. The Black Lives Matter movement became necessary because of repeated and reprehensible instances of police violence and homicide against Black men. The presidential campaign is shot through with racial and religious hatred and despicable public statements by candidates who would be our leaders. The idea of building a Good Society where people live together in peace and justice is largely dismissed as a ""politically correct"" fantasy.Into this hot mess we now have a Supreme Court Justice carelessly tossing verbal grenades about the capacity of Black students to succeed in college. What might have seemed risable at any other time is incendiary in this time. Justice Scalia needs to reconsider his ill-conceived notions of the potential of Black students to succeed at the University of Texas and other universities; he needs to go back to school, perhaps spending some quality time on some college campuses where he can learn more about the powerful potential and performance of Black students when they have opportunities to excel in higher education, including those colleges deemed ""elite."" Justice Scalia needs some re-education on the idea that a national public policy to ensure equal opportunity in higher education is a genuine public good, that our national moral compass on the topic of race and opportunity needs a firm re-set to ensure ongoing educational and economic justice for future generations."

Not perfectly, not timely, but with seriousness and gravity. The metaphor of the day was some variant on turning point/pivot/fork in the road/hinge of history. No one proclaimed ""mission accomplished.""Beyond ratifying the substantial, but inadequate, voluntary national commitments to lower climate emissions, which had already emerged as the first major Paris contribution to climate progress, the final Paris agreement opened three major avenues for climate advocates and solutions.First, perhaps most important, the entire world, including Iran and Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, agreed that the fossil fuel era will end this century. It will thus end while most of the world's already identified fossil fuel reserves are still in the ground. The end of the carbon era in human economics may or may not come in time to avoid the worst climate chaos, but come it will, and the pace of market adjustment to this shocking new reality will now accelerate. The collapse in the market value of coal companies was just the early warning signal of a sudden shift in economic power and importance. It may be too late for most institutional investors to avoid taking a bath on their fossil fuel portfolios.Second, this reality will unlock a freshet of new investment in a huge variety of low carbon solutions. Some -- like rail -- mature but newly valued; some -- like the emerging technologies to be incubated by Bill Gates' new Clean Tech Initiative -- still unproven; and others -- like the solar panels which Narendra Modi's Solar Alliance will perfect and deploy -- on the verge of sweeping away their fossil fuel competitors. As this new wave of investment drives the price of low carbon infrastructure down even lower, the requirement that national goals be regularly and transparently updated every five years guarantees that, nations will further cut emissions to capture the new economic opportunities. We are only half way to closing the 2-degree emissions gap, still further from the needed (and now formally aspired) to 1.5 degrees goal. But the new economics of clean energy in 2020 should take us where we need to go.Third, the Paris Accord plucked most of the low-hanging fruit for climate diplomacy. The remaining issues -- how to create a reliable environment for massive, private north to south low-carbon investment; who pays for damages and losses which result from climate change not avoided; how cities, particularly in the global south, access capital to build resilient infrastructure to withstand a less friendly climate are much harder. But they also now stand out starkly as the focus for dialogue and the benchmarks for further progress.The unwillingness of global elites to revisit outmoded institutional assumptions -- for example that nation states don't need to make a seat at the climate table for their cities, that the U.S. and Europe can ration the flow of development finance to the Global South, or that ad hoc, after the fact disaster relief is a reasonable global mechanisms to deal with massive and growing natural disasters -- is now clear as the focus for urgent attention.Thus far we have stumbled in the diplomatic arena towards modest indeed levels of agreement, amidst massive mistrust in an atmosphere polluted by climate deniers' (until today successful) effort to delay collective recognition. The aha moment has come. Now we are free -- if we choose -- to race towards first climate stability, and then, once we reach that plateau, and stand poised to actually lower concentrations of greenhouse gasses, climate recovery.My own deep engagement with this effort begin in 2005, when the Sierra Club's grass-roots leadership decided to pour everything we had into confronting climate. We took on preventing America from doubling down on its reliance on coal as our first challenge - a campaign whose success made a substantial contribution to the ability of the US to follow the road to Paris. It has been ten years -- but today's announcement is, I think without doubt, the greatest single victory since the emergence of the modern environmental movement.Thank you, everyone."

Banks was found unresponsive in his cell in Forrest County Jail on Friday, and he was officially pronounced dead at a hospital soon thereafter.Warren Strain, a spokesman for the Mississippi Department of Public Safety, told The Huffington Post on Saturday that a preliminary autopsy showed ""no blunt force trauma"" or any other evidence of a homicide.Banks had an enlarged heart and scar tissue in his chest when he died, and the preliminary findings point to a death from natural or accidental causes, Strain said. A drug overdose would fall under accidental causes, though it's too early to tell whether Banks had drugs in his system and the investigation is ongoing, Strain said. The suspect was accused of shooting Deen and Tate to death when they asked him to step out of his car during a routine traffic stop for speeding on May 9. His girlfriend, Joanie Calloway, and brother Curtis were also charged in the shooting.Banks was denied bond for the two counts of capital murder and was given a $100,000 bond for one count of grand theft auto and one count of felony firearm possession, according to the New York Daily News.The Mississippi Bureau of Investigations will continue to handle the case, Strain said. Homicide has been completely ruled out, but investigators will look at security videos from inside the jail as well as toxicology reports to nail down a confirmed cause of death, he said."

14,THE WORLDPOST,Arab Israeli Leader: 'We Are Living Proof That Arabs And Jews Can Refuse To Be Enemies',Charlotte Alfred,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ayman-odeh-joint-list_us_5668898de4b0f290e521ac36,Ayman Odeh leads a coalition of predominantly Arab parties in the Israeli parliament.,2015-12-12,Ayman Odeh heads a coalition of parties historically representing Arab citizens of Israel.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5668a5781300002a00738ffb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every week, The WorldPost asks an expert to shed light on a topic driving headlines around the world. We recently spoke with Ayman Odeh, the head of the Joint List coalition in Israel's parliament.Ayman Odeh made history in March when he led a coalition of four predominantly Arab political parties called the Joint List to win around 10 percent of votes in Israel's election, making it the third largest faction in the Israeli parliament.The Joint List pledged to fight against discriminatory policies and racism against Palestinian citizens of Israel and other marginalized groups in Israel. Palestinians citizens, often referred to as Israeli Arabs, make up around 20 percent of the population of Israel.The election gave Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a fourth term in office after his nationalist Likud party won the most seats and managed to form a razor-thin majority coalition government.The months since the election have seen a hardening of the political environment amid a spike in violence on the streets of Israel and the West Bank. At least 19 Israelis have been killed in a wave of Palestinian knife, vehicle and gun attacks since September. At least 112 Palestinians have been killed in the same period, including suspected attackers and people participating in protests. The World Post spoke to Odeh, who is visiting the U.S. in an effort to bring the voices of Palestinian citizens of Israel to bear on discussions of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Since the election, has the Joint List been able to have much impact on the Israeli political conversation or the struggles of the Palestinian minority?There is no doubt that this last election brought us the most racist government we have had in at least 20 years. But we keep working on both aspects -- influencing public consciousness and making practical changes.Regarding the public consciousness, we are starting to forge connections between different kinds of marginalized groups in Israel. For example, earlier this year there was a wave of demonstrations by Ethiopian Jews against police violence, and as the leader of the Arab minority, I decided to join them. While it is our moral stance to be with any marginalized group, there is also a pragmatic reason -- I want to make these connections, I want to stand with them, and then they will stand with us.On the practical level, we are working with the finance ministry on an important plan on employment, and a big part of that is increasing women’s employment. It's not our dream plan, but it’s a plan that is being worked out with us.The biggest challenge is to convince [the Israeli] people that our interests are mutual. It is not me against you. For example, if we succeed in raising the participation of Arab women in the workforce, this is good for the Arab population and it's also good for the economy. The struggle for equality is really a struggle for democracy, and that’s why it’s a struggle for all the population. The Joint List represents Arabs and Jews, and this is living proof that Arabs and Jews can refuse to be enemies and live together.How do you manage tensions within the Joint List coalition? Do you think it can hold together for another election?I agree with myself on 80 percent of things, but when I look at myself in the mirror in the morning I still have inner debates about the right thing to do. So of course, between 13 members of four parties there are inner arguments. Sometimes there are harsh arguments -- that’s more than natural. We sit together every Monday and we argue, and then we take a decision. But I can promise you we will run in the next election as well. You said the reason for this visit to the U.S. is to bring the voices of Palestinian citizens of Israel to American political leaders. What would you like the U.S. to do differently regarding policy toward Israel?We have a lot of anger about the foreign policy of the U.S. I think all the peoples of the East are angry at America. The U.S. is friends with dictatorial regimes, then invades places like Iraq and Afghanistan, and what happens afterwards is a catastrophe. In the place of their leaders, fundamentalist movements that use the name of Islam spring up, and all that’s left is terror and bloodshed. Regarding the Israeli-Palestinian issue, it's not that there is a problem with American policy regarding Israel, it’s that American policy is the problem. In the last meeting between Netanyahu and Obama it seemed like America wiped their hands of the situation. But in reality, the U.S. gave billions of dollars to Israel, some of which goes to the military, to deepening the occupation. If America would really stand behind the two-state solution they could make real pressure on Israel.The current wave of deadly violence in Israel and the West Bank has now been going on for months. What do Abbas and Netanyahu need to do in order to end the loss of life? I want to be very clear, I don’t believe there will ever be a more pragmatic leader than Abu Mazen [Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas], and I think most of the world today knows that the big problem is the Israeli government.I understand that there are many dreams, but in the end we need to reach a historic reconciliation. I sat alone with Netanyahu and said to him: 'Lets talk about the bottom line, do you agree to a Palestinian state in the 1967 borders?' And he said no. We have to remove all citizens from violence and bloodshed. We can talk a lot about how to kill mosquitoes, but at the end of the day we need to dry out the swamp. The occupation is the source of all bad in our region. I’ve said again and again that we need to free both peoples from this horrific occupation. Occupation harms first and foremost the Palestinian people, but it also harms the Israeli people so deeply.There is a saying that a people who occupies another people cannot be free. I want to challenge that slightly: There isn’t a people here who is occupying another people, there is a system that is oppressing both people. The occupation is the Palestinian people’s tragedy. But it also is the Israeli people’s prison. We want to liberate both peoples from the occupation.The interview took place on Wednesday Oct. 9 in New York, with the assistance of Hebrew translators. It has been edited and condensed for clarity.More from The WorldPost's Weekly Interview Series:Also on HuffPost:"

He endorsed restrictions on Muslim entry of the kind proposed by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.“I honestly believe what Trump said is very, very true,” Speiger said. His exact position wasn't clear, though. He said that the ban on entry should not apply to U.S. citizens, but “U.S. Muslims, yes I do believe that.” But when asked to clarify if he would forbid permanent, legal U.S. residents who are Muslim from re-entering the country after traveling, Speiger was noncommittal.“They need to be screened thoroughly,” he said. “That’s something I cannot answer, because I am not a politician.”Speiger said he is deciding between supporting Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in the Republican presidential primary.The demonstration’s organizers initially said on the event's Facebook page (which was since deleted) that they had planned to burn Qurans, but then canceled the idea on the grounds that it was reportedly illegal to do so.The hourlong demonstration and counter-protest took place on the 15th Street side of Lafayette Square Park just east of the White House and the Department of Treasury. The park itself was closed off for unrelated reasons. A spokeswoman for the National Parks Service said that it had been closed out of security concerns sparked by an unattended package, which was later determined to not be a threat.Also on HuffPost:"

There is no action, just promises. As long as fossil fuels appear to be the cheapest fuels out there, they will be continued to be burned.”The Obama administration believes that getting 190 nations to reach an agreement is an essential first step, arguing that the provisions of the accord can be strengthened afterward. ""[T]he key for Paris is just to make sure that everybody is locked in, saying, 'We're going to do this,'"" President Barack Obama said in September. ""Once we get to that point, then we can turn the dials.” The accord emerging from the Paris conference is the first deal committing all countries in the world to take action against climate change.Hansen’s 1988 testimony to Congress affirming that climate change is driven by human activity is credited as a foundational moment in the movement to combat rising global temperatures.Hansen, who retired from NASA in 2013 and still teaches at Columbia University, has in recent years become one of the country’s most outspoken climate change activists.Hansen famously argued that approving the Keystone XL oil pipeline would be “game over for the climate.” He was arrested several times while protesting against the pipeline at the White House.On Nov. 6, Obama announced that he would not permit Keystone XL's construction, following a seven-year review process.Also on HuffPost:"

Wow, this is great. They’re getting red.”The delicate little fruit is crunchy like an apple and sweet. It’s a popular snack in the Marshall Islands, Lepton told The WorldPost, but kids pickle it with salt and Kool-Aid, which defeats the purpose of eating fruit in the first place. As the Global Climate and Health Alliance made clear with an announcement on Dec. 5, small and low-lying islands like the Marshalls that are most at risk of climate change also face intense health issues related to a warmer planet. These dangers come from heat stroke and tropical illnesses like dengue fever, the Alliance warned. Hundreds of thousands of people could die.But health issues not related to climate are a more immediate problem here. Sixty-five percent of people in the Marshall Islands are overweight or obese, according to a 2013 study funded by the National Institutes of Health -- slightly less than in the U.S. More than one-third of Marshall Islanders have diabetes, according to the International Diabetes Federation, one of the highest rates in the world. Only two places -- Tokelau and Micronesia, both neighbors of the Marshall Islands -- have higher rates.Eating habits here have changed since the old days, when fish and fruit provided all the nutrients humans needed to survive in this paradise. Today, rice, flour and meat are the base of almost every breakfast, lunch and dinner. Almost all of it is imported -- at high prices. The Marshall Islands produce no rice, no wheat, no cattle. The diet has contributed to an unhealthy lifestyle. But Lepton and his colleagues at the Ministry of Resources and Development are trying to change that with a return to traditional agriculture. It’s not easy to farm in the Marshalls -- the soil is sandy and its organic content is low. But the climate is warm and fruit trees are abundant. And with help from modern science and crops that can resist drought and heat, farming may become possible on a larger scale. This return to the land may contribute to healthier lifestyles, even as droughts and rising seas threaten the islands' sensitive soil.Climate change is likely to further endanger indigenous sources of food that the government is promoting. Rising seas threaten farms and the fresh water they need to survive. During times of drought, fish can become scarce. And because ocean warming and acidification have harmed the coral reefs that form the base of the atolls, the entire marine ecosystem is threatened.At the farm where he works in this rural village at the far western edge of Majuro Atoll, Lepton grows crops both common and unusual to these islands, including varieties that grow in the conditions climate change is likely to bring. There is breadfruit and several types of banana, dryland and swamp taro, lemons and limes, papaya and mango, sweet potato, cassava, pandanus, mountain apple and coconut. There are salt-tolerant and drought-tolerant types of several crops, some started from seeds donated by the government of Taiwan.Lepton and other farmers in Laura use no pesticides or chemical fertilizers, which in 2010 were found to damage the water supply. They make their own compost from coconut palms and pig manure. Lepton, whose work reaches even to the far-flung atolls, said he hopes a better understanding of agriculture will spark a renaissance for healthy eating. The Ministry of Resources and Development farm hosts a training program for farmers from the outer islands to learn from the combination of traditional and modern farming techniques on display, and to take home seeds and cuttings of plants resistant to climate change. On Saturdays at 9 a.m., Lepton hosts the ministry's radio program, broadcast throughout the islands.“I talk about planting and how to plan for the future,” Lepton said. “How to take cuttings of plants during the dry season. Because of climate change the wind is getting stronger and the banana trees are falling, but you can still eat the fruit and cut the tree, and the stump will grow again.”Just down the road from the farm, Lepton met with a family he’s trying to encourage to farm in a sustainable and healthy way. Anja Hiram grows corn, squash, coconut, breadfruit, bell pepper and cabbage, among other crops. He also fishes for shark off the coast at the edge of his small plot of land. “Big ones!” he said, smiling.Hiram lives with his family in a one-room concrete house. A 10-year-old Ford 1512 tractor, another gift from Taiwan, rested outside. He sells his produce in a market in Majuro, 30 minutes’ drive down the atoll’s only main road. “It’s better than rice,” he said.It’s an uphill battle for Lepton, Hiram and like-minded colleagues to change the eating habits of urban Marshallese, who have grown accustomed to unhealthy imported foods in recent decades.“There is a lack of interest or maybe they don’t want to do the work,” Lepton said. “I hope some day they will change their minds.” Also on HuffPost:"

21,POLITICS,Judge Says OC Prosecutors Violated Constitution By Avoiding Judge Who Exposed Misconduct,Matt Ferner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/thomas-goethals-orange-county_us_566b5a0ce4b0fccee16eadd2,"Diverting murder cases away from him ""disrupted"" justice, the ruling said.",2015-12-12,District Attorney Tony Rackauckas has maintained that no one in his office acted improperly.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/566b68bb1600002c00eb8aa8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"LOS ANGELES -- The Orange County District Attorney's Office has unconstitutionally ""disrupted"" justice in the county by blocking murder cases from being heard by a judge who exposed misconduct, a local judge ruled.Superior Court Judge Richard King, in a strongly worded Dec. 3 ruling, wrote that the prosecutors' actions ""have substantially disrupted the orderly administration of criminal justice in Orange County, the sixth largest county in the nation,"" by repeatedly disqualifying Superior Court Judge Thomas Goethals from hearing their murder cases. ""It has negatively impacted not only the assignment of murder cases, but all felony cases as well,"" King wrote.County prosecutors recently requested that Goethals be removed from a murder case, and King issued the 46-page ruling as a rejection of that request. In the ruling, he says that during a three-year span from 2010 to 2014, Goethals was assigned 35 murder cases and was disqualified only once by OCDA prosecutors. However, from February 2014 through September 2015 -- during the same period when Goethals' rulings found that county prosecutors and police had committed misconduct -- Goethals was assigned 49 murder cases and was disqualified by county prosecutors in all but three.""This disparity is not coincidental,"" King writes. He spends a large portion of the ruling linking the disqualifications to multiple controversial rulings from Goethals, one of which booted the OCDA office -- all 250 prosecutors -- from the penalty phase trial for Scott Dekraai. Dekraai pleaded guilty last year to shooting and killing his ex-wife and seven other people in a hair salon in 2011, in what remains the largest mass murder in Orange County history.Dekraai's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Scott Sanders, unearthed violations within the county's secret jailhouse informant program, as well as internal records from the program that may have been improperly concealed for over 30 years.Another ruling from Goethals recused former deputy district attorney Erick Petersen from two other criminal cases in the county, saying evidence was withheld from the defense. While both prosecutors and defense attorneys are legally entitled to remove a judge from a case, King argues that what the OCDA office is doing is an abuse of that provision.""Not only did this remove one of the most experienced, independent, and capable judges from hearing cases which require such independence and expertise,"" King wrote in his ruling, ""it sent a clear and loud message to other local judges that they could expect similar treatment if they allowed the defense to inquire into similar allegations of misconduct.""King says the disqualifications are in violation of the Separation of Powers Doctrine of the state and U.S. constitutions.The DA's office disagreed with King's ruling in a statement issued Wednesday and said that the office would seek an immediate appeal.""Even following his ruling recusing the OCDA ... prosecutors have consistently litigated their cases in front of Judge Goethals, including a serious robbery case in his courtroom today,"" Wednesday's statement from the prosecutors' office read.But King says that the ""blanket"" disqualification of Goethals has caused ""murder cases and other felony cases to languish unnecessarily."" As a result, ""the court’s responsibility to ensure the orderly administration of justice has been severely impacted.”District Attorney Tony Rackauckas has maintained that no one in his office intentionally behaved inappropriately. In an attempt to resolve the controversy, his office has assembled its own commission to investigate claims of prosecutor misconduct. But the size and complexity of the county's problem with its tainted informant program has prompted some legal experts to call for a sweeping federal investigation into the OCDA's office. And just last month, more than three dozen former prosecutors and legal experts called on the Department of Justice to conduct a full investigation into the OCDA office as well as the Orange County Sheriff's Department over claims that county prosecutors have been obstructing justice, possibly for decades."

Crapser, who was adopted in the U.S. at age 3 by parents who never completed his citizenship paperwork, has lived here for 37 years.Judge John C. O’Dell declined to give Crapser, 40, a discretionary form of relief from deportation, known as “cancellation of removal,” according to Lori Walls, Crapser’s immigration attorney. Crapser, who has been detained for eight months, declined to appeal, she said.“The judge weighed Adam’s criminal history against the rest of his history (adoption, multiple instances of abandonment and unimaginable abuse, the fact that he is married and has children) and held that Adam did not deserve relief,” Walls said via email. The Korean consulate will issue a travel document for Crapser, who does not speak Korean, “within maybe a week,” Walls estimated, although Immigration and Customs Enforcement may require additional time to arrange the deportation.“Adam, his family, and advocates are heartbroken at the outcome,” Walls told The Associated Press. Previously: Like most Americans, Adam Crapser is eager to avoid any kind of run-in with the law. The difference for Crapser is that based on a few wrong moves, he could now be plucked from the U.S. and deported to an unfamiliar country ― and he’s not alone.Thousands of foreign-born adoptees raised in the U.S. are vulnerable to deportation as adults due to a failure of immigration law and inaction by their adoptive parents. Without U.S. citizenship, they can be tossed out of the only country they’ve ever really known.“It’s troubling that at any point, ICE could snatch me off the street and put me in a detention facility before I’m shipped off to Korea,” Crapser said.The 40-year-old Oregon resident came to the attention of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency when he tried to become a legal permanent resident in 2012 by applying for a green card. His adoptive parents had not filled out the paperwork to make him a citizen when he was a child, which he didn’t realize until after 9/11, when he needed to produce proof of citizenship to get a job. Meanwhile, the visa on which he’d entered the country as a small child had long since lapsed.Crapser has admitted his record is not perfect: He has a few convictions for small-time burglary, unlawful possession of a firearm and assault (he fought with a roommate). As he told The New York Times, “I’ve learned a lot of lessons the hard way.”But in recent years, he’s tried to turn his life around. He’s a married man with three daughters, and he’d like a legal job.The U.S. government, however, hasn’t issued him a green card. Without it, Crapser can’t legally hold a job. At the beginning of this year, ICE agents informed him that the agency was starting deportation proceedings against him.In a Portland, Oregon, immigration court on Thursday, Crapser filed for asylum in an effort to stay in the U.S.“I wouldn’t be able to live as a Korean. I’d be ostracized,” Crapser said. “I’d be a gyu poh ― a foreign born Korean. People wouldn’t associate with me because I don’t know the language or the culture. “The stay-at-home father described his current situation as “emotional.” He told The Huffington Post, “It’s the worrying. It’s been that way for more than a year.”If he is sent back to South Korea after nearly four decades here, Crapser said, “All they would be doing is repeating my history and making me abandon my children.”Prior to the Child Citizenship Act of 2000, foreign-born children adopted by U.S. citizens entered the country as permanent residents, according to attorney Dan Berger, a member of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. After the typically lengthy and expensive process of adopting children from overseas, Berger said, many parents would ""take a breath"" and not apply for citizenship for their child.""They weren't always realizing it was a separate application that had to be filed, with a fee,"" Berger said of obtaining U.S. citizenship. ""The really good international adoption agencies would keep on top of this. Parents would be nagged until they did the citizenship process."" Foreign-born adoptees who have green cards can work, are eligible for a driver's license and even qualify for Social Security benefits and student loans. Unlike citizens, they can be deported, even for nonviolent misdeeds.Time will eventually solve this problem. The 2000 bipartisan law granted automatic citizenship to an estimated 75,000 adopted children then under age 18. The law applied to future adoptees as well.Crapser, in his 20s when the law was passed, had already tried for several years to regain legal resident status. For a long time, he was thwarted by his adoptive parents, who refused to give him his adoption paperwork.""That's the toughest part -- I tried to get this rectified on my own, but in reality, the adoptive parents hold a lot of power in the situation with the adoptee,"" Crapser said. ""And if you have a tumultuous relationship with your adoptive parents ...""""Tumultuous"" would be a generous way to describe Crapser's relationship with the adoptive parents he called ""sociopathic."" Crapser was originally adopted, along with his sister, by a Michigan couple, who relinquished the siblings after six years. The two children were split up, and Adam bounced around foster homes until he was almost 11, when he was adopted by Thomas and Dolly Crapser of Oregon.The Crapsers had multiple adopted and foster children, though Adam Crapser said he was the only foreign-born adoptee. He said the couple regularly abused and humiliated the children. He recalls being beaten, burned and having his head slammed into door frames.He compared his adoptive mother, a devout Jehovah's Witness, to Cruella de Vil, the ""101 Dalmatians"" villain obsessed with having a variety of animal furs. ""It was like 'one of each' for her: They had a Latino boy, a Filipino boy, Caucasian siblings, a black girl, me,"" Crapser said. ""We were shown off at Jehovah's Witness gatherings to make it look like she was doing Jehovah's work.""In 1991, the couple was arrested and charged with 34 counts of rape, sexual abuse and criminal mistreatment of their children. They were convicted a year later on several counts of criminal mistreatment and assault. Thomas Crapser was also convicted on one count of sexual abuse, although he served just 90 days in prison.The Crapsers were not immediately available for comment.Before the 2000 law, foreign-born children who had been adopted and lived nearly their whole lives in America often didn't realize that their legal status was dicey, Berger said. He noted that it was not uncommon for those who had low-income jobs or didn't travel outside the U.S. to not really grasp that they were not citizens."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/566b98bb1900002400789ba3.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Nearly half of Americans who rent are spending more on housing than they can afford, according to a report released this week. But it’s still possible to find affordable living in a thriving city -- if you’re willing to move to Des Moines, Iowa. That might sound like a ridiculous suggestion to anyone who lives outside the Midwest. But consider how grim the rental real estate market looks, basically everywhere else:There are more renters than any time since the 1960s, spanning all demographics, according to the Harvard University’s Joint Center for Housing Studies' biennial ""America's Rental Housing"" report. Last year, 49 percent were “cost-burdened,” meaning they spent more than 30 percent of income on housing, the threshold for what's considered affordable. That’s down from 2011’s record high of 51 percent, but up slightly from 2013.  More renters have led to a tighter market, pushing vacancy rates down and rents up, while incomes for many haven't grown. The report's forecast for the future isn't promising: Researchers write that rent increases outpacing income growth have led to the huge number of renters paying too much for housing, “with little prospect for meaningful improvement.”Enter Des Moines, where income is higher than the national average and rents are increasing at a slower rate than in other cities, effectively inverting the trend that the Joint Center for Housing Studies report says makes renting so unaffordable. What's more, unemployment and cost of living are both low, and there's a promising job market. In the metro area that encompasses Des Moines, 38 percent of renters are cost-burdened. While that’s a distressing number of struggling households, it’s lower than 95 percent of U.S. metro areas. In many other cities with cheap rents -- including Detroit, Indianapolis, Tucson, Arizona, and Memphis, Tennessee -- the number of renters paying too much for housing is near the national average or higher.Higher incomes, as well as plentiful empty land in the suburbs, contribute to Des Moines' affordability, explained Jonathan Spader, a researcher who worked on the Joint Center for Housing Studies report. “What’s keeping rent affordable is that they have the ability to build out into areas where transportation to jobs in other parts of the city is still possible and relatively quick,” Spader said.“You can buy a cornfield and put an apartment complex on it,” said Eric Burmeister, executive director of the Polk County Housing Trust Fund. “It’s one of the easiest places to develop, probably, that any developers would find.”Burmeister, whose nonprofit tracks, funds and advocates for affordable housing in the Des Moines area, said the city’s decade-long push to revitalize the downtown -- initiating the earlier projects itself -- also has created opportunities for private developers.Nationwide, there has been a substantial increase in housing in response to the growing number of renters, Spader said. The increasing supply is necessary to limit rent growth, though it’s not clear if development can keep pace with demand.Des Moines has had a particularly dramatic construction boom of its own. But like the rest of the country, most of the Des Moines development has been multifamily housing with higher rents, doing little to address the critical shortage of lower-income housing. In the metro area, 71 percent of renters with incomes from $15,000 to $30,000 are cost-burdened, compared with 77 percent nationally.  Thats where groups like Polk County Housing Trust Fund come in. Des Moines has a large and effective group of nonprofits that work on affordable housing, said Jerry Anthony, an associate professor who works on housing and land use policy at the University of Iowa. He pointed out Polk County Housing Trust Fund's ability to provide more flexible funding than other government affordable housing programs. The Housing Trust Fund also has helped ensure a decent amount of affordable housing for people making above 30 percent of the median income. But two years ago, Burmeister’s organization determined that it hadn’t been providing enough assistance to residents who make less than that. The group has since focused on creating housing for those with the lowest incomes, primarily service industry workers.One of the ways the Housing Trust Fund does that is by subsidizing a small number of new units, at a cost of over $62,000 each. In the last two years, the trust has worked with developers to subsidize about 30 units to ensure affordable rents for extremely low-income households.“We have some developers in central Iowa, local developers who get it and recognize that affordable housing is a long-term play if we want to, as a region, remain sustainable,"" Burmeister said.So, if you're going broke paying rent, you could always follow the lead of millennials and take a closer look at Des Moines.Clearly, a small city in Iowa is going to lack some of the amenities that make high-cost cities like New York or San Francisco desirable places to live. But there’s local excitement about Des Moines' changes, particularly downtown -- from a sculpture garden to craft cocktail bars. Which raises the question: Will Des Moines stay affordable as it grows?  Burmeister said he hopes so. But he said there's work to be done, detailed in the ""Housing Tomorrow” plan, which shows how the region can adequately address affordable housing needs in the next few decades, and why it's necessary.  “It’s my job to always say, remember the foundation that makes this a great place to live, and those are the folks that serve us cocktails in our latest whiskey bar of choice, or take care of our kids after school or take care of my mother in a nursing home,” Burmeister said. “If we want to continue to be a great place to live, then we have to provide for and make sure that the service workforce is taken care of as well.""Kate Abbey-Lambertz covers sustainable cities, housing and inequality.
