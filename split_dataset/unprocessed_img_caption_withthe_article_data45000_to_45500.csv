0,POLITICS,Obama Power Plant Rules Face Key Test In U.S. Court,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-climate-strategy_us_57ea747ce4b0c2407cd9718a,Industry groups and 27 states claim the administration's Clean Power Plan is illegal.,2016-09-27,"U.S. President Barack Obama speaks during the dedication of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, U.S., September 24, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57ea74fb1b00007f08ef2819.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The centerpiece of President Barack Obama’s climate change strategy, federal rules curbing greenhouse gas emissions mainly from coal-fired power plants, faces a key test on Tuesday when opponents try to convince a U.S. appeals court to throw out the regulations.Twenty-seven states led by coal-producer West Virginia and industry groups are challenging the Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Power Plan rules before 10 judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.They argue that the EPA overstepped its regulatory authority under the federal Clean Air Act when the agency issued the rules, which the U.S. Supreme Court has put on hold while the case is litigated.During Tuesday’s arguments, these opponents will face off in court against the EPA, 18 states, corporations including Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google, and a number of cities that support the regulations.The Clean Power Plan was designed to lower carbon emissions from U.S. power plants by 2030 to 32 percent below 2005 levels, with each state assigned its own emission reduction target and tasked with designing its own plan to achieve that goal.Power plants are the largest source of U.S. carbon emissions. Nearly 1,500 coal- and gas-fired power plants together emit nearly two billion tons per year of carbon dioxide.The Clean Power Plan is the main tool for the United States to meet the emissions reduction target it pledged to reach at U.N. climate talks in Paris last December.“It’s an invasion, in our estimation, of the state regulatory domain,” Scott Pruitt, the Republican attorney general of Oklahoma, one of the states suing the EPA, said at a Washington event this month.Richard Revesz, director of the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University’s law school, said the suing states were exaggerating the regulatory reach of the EPA.“The Clean Power Plan, while certainly a very important rule, is not the boundary-breaking behemoth that the petitioners make it out to be,” Revesz said.The Clean Power Plan, if it survives the legal challenge, could prompt a faster shift to renewable energy sources and accelerate the closure of the country’s oldest coal plants.The fate of the Clean Power Plan was thrown into question on Feb. 9 when the Supreme Court made a surprise 5-4 decision to grant a request by the challengers to put the rule on hold while the appeals court considered the matter.The eventual appeals court ruling could decide the case, even if it goes to the Supreme Court. The Feb. 13 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia left the court ideologically split with four conservatives and four liberals. A 4-4 ruling by the high court would leave in place the appeals court ruling.GARLAND STEPS ASIDEThe arguments will be heard by 10 judges rather than 11 because the court’s chief judge, Merrick Garland, has recused himself from the case. Garland is Obama’s nominee to replace Scalia. Of the 10 judges who will hear the case, six were appointed by Democratic presidents.A 5-5 ruling would leave the regulations in place.A ruling is unlikely before the end of the year and possibly not until after Obama leaves office on Jan. 20.The outcome of the Nov. 8 presidential election could be pivotal for the regulations. If Republican Donald Trump wins, the government could reverse the rules or decline to appeal to the Supreme Court should the appeals court strike them down. If Democrat Hillary Clinton is elected, the losing side in the appeals court ruling could be expected to take the case to the Supreme Court.If the case does reach the high court, it may not make it in time for the justices to hear it during the court term that begins next Monday and ends in June.(Reporting by Valerie Volcovici; Additional reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham)"
1,POLITICS,Opioid Epidemic Goes Unmentioned In First Presidential Debate,Jason Cherkis,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opioid-epidemic-presidential-debate_us_57e9e185e4b082aad9b69917,But the issue is a big concern in key swing states.,2016-09-27,Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have very different ideas on how to combat the epidemic.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― In the first presidential debate Monday night, Democratic and Republican nominees Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump covered a wide range of topics including trade policy, climate change, income equality and the recent tragic police shootings. Trump even found time to lament the crumbling conditions of the nation’s airports.But one issue that is ravaging communities and causing thousands of deaths across the country did not get a single mention: the opioid epidemic. During the early days of the primaries, the topic was front and center. Especially in states like New Hampshire, parents who lost loved ones to the epidemic routinely confronted the candidates.After the primaries ended, the topic has drifted from the spotlight. But overdoses continue to cause turmoil in key states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Mexico. During a six-day stretch in August, Cincinnati had 174 overdoses. That same month, a town in West Virginia experienced 26 overdoses in one night. In late September, Cleveland experienced seven fatal overdoses in a single day.If she’d been asked about the epidemic, Clinton would have had an answer ready. Last May, she came out with a detailed policy proposal that addressed the crisis. It mirrored what Congress recently passed into law, but added more rigorous funding.Clinton said she was inspired to confront the problem because of so many grieving families she met in New Hampshire. “This is tearing families apart, but it is below the surface,” she said. “We aren’t talking about it because it is something that is hard to deal with.”Trump has said he’d combat the epidemic by building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico."
2,POLITICS,One Issue That Could Reshape America For A Generation Was Snubbed At The Debate,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-presidential-debate_us_57e98ec3e4b082aad9b6227d,Neither candidate said what he or she plans to do with the Supreme Court.,2016-09-27,"People pause near a bus adorned with large photos of candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump before the presidential debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, on Sept. 26.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― The next president could very well set the course of the Supreme Court for far longer than the duration of his or her White House stay, and yet neither candidate gave the subject any play on Monday.Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump had more than 90 minutes to make their respective cases to the American public at the first of three televised presidential debates in the lead-up to Election Day. But neither nominee spent any time describing their vision for the nation’s high court, let alone the federal judiciary ― a huge part of a president’s legacy.Part of the blame lies with Lester Holt, who delivered a solid moderator performance but never brought up the subject of the Supreme Court ― a curious move in a debate centered on domestic policy issues.It was a monumental missed chance, if only because it could’ve reminded millions of voters about an ongoing Supreme Court vacancy that’s breaking all kinds of records ― and helped people understand the intimate ties between a candidate’s policy agenda and the future of the courts.Clinton has said she wants to build on some of the accomplishments of President Barack Obama, but she has robust policy aspirations of her own ― many of which will undoubtedly be targeted through litigation and are almost certain to land eventually before the Supreme Court.“After years of accusing liberals of judicial activism, conservatives are wholeheartedly relying on Republican-appointed judges to undo progressive achievements,” Clinton wrote in a January op-ed in The Boston Globe. “They’re using radical legal strategies to accomplish through the courts what they’ve failed to do through legislation, like dismembering the Voting Rights Act or attacking unions.”Trump doesn’t have his rival’s policy chops. And on the campaign trail, he has made clear that not even sitting federal judges or the Constitution itself are out of bounds for his cheap shots. In the face of those indiscretions, he likes to brag that even principled conservatives will eventually bow to him based on whom he might nominate to the Supreme Court.“Even if you can’t stand Donald Trump, even if you think I’m the worst, you’re going to vote for me,” a confident Trump said at a Virginia rally last month. “You know why? Judges.”His not-so-short list of potential candidates to the high court is clearly aimed at that on-the-fence crowd ― those who may recoil at the thought of Trump as commander in chief but who may be willing to stomach him as long as he’s the appointer in chief. Just look at Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who last week succumbed to Trump in part due to his Supreme Court promises.All of this and more could’ve been explored at length at Monday’s face-to-face between Clinton and Trump. Instead, the Supreme Court was a big no-show.“It’s disappointing that one of the most critical issues facing our democracy, the future of the Supreme Court, didn’t get any airtime in tonight’s debate,” Nan Aron, president of the liberal Alliance for Justice, said in a statement. Aron’s group has pushed for a hearing for Merrick Garland, Obama’s choice to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia.Here’s hoping the next debates fix this oversight. With one existing vacancy and the potential for as many as three more in the next four to eight years, the court is likely to shape America’s constitutional future for far longer than the next president will."

6,HEALTHY LIVING,Check Your Privilege Before Talking About Obesity And Personal Responsibility,"Yoni Freedhoff, U.S. News & World Report",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/check-your-privilege-before-talking-about-obesity-and-personal-responsibility_us_57ea8a9ee4b024a52d2aa2b1,Many people's realities make lifestyle reform a nearly impossible luxury.,2016-09-27,"Personal responsibility-based healthy living efforts require privileges -- such as time, stability and personal health -- that the vast majority of people don’t possess.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57ea8e611b00007f08ef28af.jpeg?cache=uYEv7XFruF&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I was sitting and chatting with a journalist this past weekend. She’s hearteningly passionate about her work, and hers is a health beat. She wanted to know how she and the media as a whole might do better at helping the public adopt healthy habits in the name of improving obesity and other chronic diet and lifestyle responsive diseases.I think my answer may have surprised her. “Not that there aren’t ways the media could improve upon their reporting,” I said, “but I’m not sure it really matters in that the folks who both read about healthy living and have lives that are appropriately and realistically conducive to change are an incredibly privileged and small subset of the population.”Spelling that out more succinctly here, personal responsibility-based healthy living efforts require privileges that the vast majority of people don’t possess.First, there’s the privilege of time. Yes, we all share the same 24 hours a day, but there’s little doubt that for some, the time required to intentionally exercise, shop for fresh, whole ingredients, prep foods and cook rightly play second fiddle to working long enough hours to pay for their and their family’s necessities. There’s also the time involved in caregiving responsibilities, which could include looking after children with special needs, aged parents or an ill spouse.Working in Canada where health care is socialized and so too are the bulk of my office’s programs, I have the fortune of being able to work with people from every socioeconomic strata, and I can tell you that though everyone possesses the theoretical ability to focus on healthy habits and lives, many people’s realities make lifestyle reform a nearly impossible luxury.The longer public health and public opinion focus their attentions on the personal-responsibility narrative of obesity and other chronic non-communicable diseases, the longer we’ll wait to see population level changes. If any amount of desire, guilt or shame were sufficient to drive sustained change, we’d have been rid of the so-called lifestyle diseases decades ago. We’re not going to swim our way out of this flood, as not everyone can afford swimming lessons, not everyone has the time for swimming lessons and even though knowing how to swim is an undeniably good thing to know how to do, not everyone is interested in taking swimming lessons."
7,POLITICS,A Major Union Just Launched A Boycott Against Donald Trump,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-union-boycott_us_57eae07ce4b0c2407cda47d6,It's asking travelers not to stay at his hotels or play golf at his courses.,2016-09-27,Donald Trump is clearly not speaking for workers in Las Vegas.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57eae0d71a00002c005b52c2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The union that recently organized workers at Donald Trump’s Las Vegas hotel announced Tuesday that it was launching a formal boycott of the Republican nominee’s properties around the country.The Culinary Workers Union, a powerful player in Nevada politics, said it will be urging people not to stay at Trump hotels, eat at Trump restaurants or play golf at Trump courses until he starts bargaining with the union over a first contract. The Las Vegas group, which is part of the national hospitality industry union Unite Here, has been waging a long-running battle with the Trump Organization.The boycott will be supported by the AFL-CIO, a federation of 56 unions that represent some 12 million workers around the country, according to Bethany Khan, a Culinary Workers Union spokeswoman. She said it will involve properties that Trump “owns, has invested in, or has partnered with.”“Other unions can respect [the] boycott and not deliver goods or pass the picket line,” Khan told HuffPost in an email.Unions don’t take such boycotts lightly, since they discourage business at a workplace that employs their members. But in the case of Trump’s Las Vegas hotel, the Culinary Workers Union accuses him and his team of failing to bargain in good faith, even though the union won an organizing election last year. The hotel is a joint venture between Trump and his friend, casino magnate Phil Ruffin.Federal regulators have certified the union as the official bargaining agent for the workers, making such a boycott perfectly legal under labor law.In a statement, the union said it would encourage customers to observe the boycott until the hotel “honors its legal duty to bargain with the union.”As HuffPost previously reported, management at Trump’s Las Vegas hotel waged an intensive anti-union campaign ahead of the election, shelling out more than half a million dollars to consultants in an effort to persuade workers to vote no. The Culinary Workers Union won anyway, by a count of 238 to 209.Hotel management then tried to claim that the union had illegally swayed the election in its own favor, an assertion dismissed by officials with the National Labor Relations Board. The hotel appealed that decision to the full board in Washington; a final ruling hasn’t been made.The union, in turn, has accused the hotel of intimidating workers and retaliating against pro-union employees during the organizing campaign. The labor board’s general counsel, who acts as a kind of prosecutor, found merit in many of those claims. The general counsel filed charges against the hotel, which the full board hasn’t ruled on, either.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e949481b00003007ef23c3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Pundits’ expectations for Donald Trump’s debate performance on Monday night could hardly be more abysmal. The GOP presidential nominee’s advisers have repeatedly stressed his lack of preparation, lowering the bar so far that, as The Huffington Post’s Amanda Terkel put it, “if he doesn’t vomit, he’s exceeding expectations.”Yet the American public’s expectations for Trump’s performance don’t seem to be historically, or even unusually, low. By a 10-point margin ― 53 percent to 43 percent ― likely voters say they expect Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton to do better than Trump in the debates, according to a September CNN/ORC poll. But that’s a relatively small gap compared to past election cycles.In four of the previous six presidential elections, pre-debate polling from CNN and Gallup found a wider gap in expectations, YouGov’s Will Jordan noted on Friday. In two elections, 2000 and 1992, the “expectations gap” between candidates was only a couple of points smaller than it is this year.This year’s relatively close margin may be because neither Trump nor Clinton has the advantage of presidential incumbency. Although Bill Clinton was seen as a somewhat stronger debater than incumbent George H.W. Bush in 1992, recent sitting presidents have otherwise been perceived to hold a wide advantage in debates. The open election in 2000 saw a relatively modest expectations gap between candidates, although Barack Obama was seen as a much stronger debater than John McCain in 2008.Polarization may also play a role, with expectations lining up broadly along party lines. According to CNN’s most recent poll, 88 percent of Democratic likely voters and 75 percent of Republican likely voters expect their party’s nominee to be the better debater. In contrast, four years ago, only two-thirds of Republicans expected Romney to do a better job than Obama.Trump also has to contend with higher expectations from independent voters. Forty-eight percent of independent voters expect him to do a better job than Clinton in the debates. When Romney and McCain debated Obama, only one-third or fewer independents expected the Republican candidates to prevail. CNN’s survey was conducted at the beginning of September, so it’s possible that expectations for Trump have since taken a slide ― but given his increasing strength in horserace polling over the same time period, that seems somewhat unlikely.

The GOP presidential nominee’s advisers have repeatedly stressed his lack of preparation, lowering the bar so far that, as The Huffington Post’s Amanda Terkel put it, “if he doesn’t vomit, he’s exceeding expectations.”Yet the American public’s expectations for Trump’s performance don’t seem to be historically, or even unusually, low. By a 10-point margin ― 53 percent to 43 percent ― likely voters say they expect Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton to do better than Trump in the debates, according to a September CNN/ORC poll. But that’s a relatively small gap compared to past election cycles.In four of the previous six presidential elections, pre-debate polling from CNN and Gallup found a wider gap in expectations, YouGov’s Will Jordan noted on Friday. In two elections, 2000 and 1992, the “expectations gap” between candidates was only a couple of points smaller than it is this year.This year’s relatively close margin may be because neither Trump nor Clinton has the advantage of presidential incumbency. Although Bill Clinton was seen as a somewhat stronger debater than incumbent George H.W. Bush in 1992, recent sitting presidents have otherwise been perceived to hold a wide advantage in debates. The open election in 2000 saw a relatively modest expectations gap between candidates, although Barack Obama was seen as a much stronger debater than John McCain in 2008.Polarization may also play a role, with expectations lining up broadly along party lines. According to CNN’s most recent poll, 88 percent of Democratic likely voters and 75 percent of Republican likely voters expect their party’s nominee to be the better debater. In contrast, four years ago, only two-thirds of Republicans expected Romney to do a better job than Obama.Trump also has to contend with higher expectations from independent voters. Forty-eight percent of independent voters expect him to do a better job than Clinton in the debates. When Romney and McCain debated Obama, only one-third or fewer independents expected the Republican candidates to prevail. CNN’s survey was conducted at the beginning of September, so it’s possible that expectations for Trump have since taken a slide ― but given his increasing strength in horserace polling over the same time period, that seems somewhat unlikely. Research shows that media coverage of the debates often matters at least as much as the public’s reaction to them, so the conventional wisdom that Trump will do poorly certainly gives him some advantage.Going into Monday night, however, the electorate’s expectations for Trump don’t seem to be exceptionally forgiving.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Bush announced their support for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Sunday in a bid for party unity ahead of Trump’s first debate with Democrat Hillary Clinton.The Bush family and many connected to it remain cool to Trump. Former President George H.W. Bush reportedly plans to vote for Clinton in the Nov. 8 election, former Trump rival Jeb Bush has said he will not vote for Clinton or Trump, and George W. Bush has avoided the presidential race while helping raise money for Republican congressional candidates.But a number of former Bush appointees have decided to endorse the New York businessman, who is in a tight race with Clinton and is to debate her one-one-one at Hofstra University on Monday night in Hempstead, New York.Fifty former Bush appointees were on a list of people described as founding members of a coalition of Bush alumni supportive of Trump. The list was provided by a Republican official close to the Trump campaign.The list included former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft, former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao, former Treasury Secretary John Snow and former Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson.The list also included former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, former Veterans Affairs Secretary Anthony Principi and former deputy White House political director Matt Schlapp, who is chairman of the American Conservative Union.Thompson, in a statement, explained his decision to be on the list.“Americans want to trust our leaders again, to know that they are fighting for everyday Americans by creating jobs, growing our economy, defending our nation from terrorism, and respecting the voters enough to be straight-forward and honest with them,” Thompson said.Trump has struggled to rally many in the Republican Party behind him. On Friday, he received the endorsement of former rival Ted Cruz, but many establishment figures remain skeptical about him, such as Ohio Governor John Kasich."
13,POLITICS,"Republicans Ask Democrats To Trust Them On Flint Funding, Offer No Reason To Trust Them",Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/flint-funding-cr-wrda_us_57e97d8ae4b08d73b832e1f3,"This should end well, believe me.",2016-09-26,House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and House Speaker Paul Ryan promise they'll get to Flint later. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e99ded1700002900ac7595.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― As a government shutdown suddenly looks possible, Republicans are imploring their Democratic colleagues to agree to a short-term spending bill now and trust that they will address the Flint water crisis in other legislation later. The only problem? The bill Republicans say should be the vehicle for Flint ― a long-awaited water resources measure ― is supposed to move through the House this week without Flint.House GOP leaders contend that they want to address the Michigan water crisis in the so-called Water Resources Development Act, not the short-term bill, known as a continuing resolution. Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said Thursday that Flint “should be dealt with in the WRDA bill,” and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Monday that the water resources bill was “the best place” to address it.So it is perhaps curious that House Republicans are trying to move the bill without Flint aid. “The sooner we get the WRDA bill through in the House, the sooner we can begin conference,” McCarthy said.But McCarthy didn’t commit to making sure Flint was eventually attached. In fact, even if the House passes the water bill, they would need to vote on an additional piece of legislation to set up conference. And with lawmakers set to leave town after this week for the next month and a half, Flint aid would almost certainly be delayed until November at the earliest ― if it happens at all.That’s a big reason why Democrats are insisting that Flint be part of the CR, particularly when Republicans are willing to attach emergency Louisiana flood aid to the government funding bill.There is an amendment from Michigan Democrat Dan Kildee to add Flint aid to the WRDA measure, but there’s a good chance the House Rules Committee doesn’t allow a vote for the same reason that the legislation doesn’t currently include money: It’s in the jurisdiction of other committees, namely, Energy and Commerce, and Appropriations.Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Bill Shuster (R-Pa.) told the Rules Committee on Monday night that he opposed including the amendment because it would set a precedent for local drinking water provisions in WRDA. And asked Monday if he would support Rules giving the amendment a vote, McCarthy dodged the question by noting that he’s not on the Rules Committee.McCarthy was enthusiastic about a WRDA conference, however, noting that “there are other issues” lawmakers could address in conference ― potentially even California drought provisions, other sources suggested.But Democrats have no guarantees on Flint if it isn’t in the CR. And if Republicans want to dig in on not including the aid in the continuing resolution, Democrats could block government funding, betting that the GOP takes the brunt of the blame over a shutdown.Meanwhile, WRDA has its own issues. House Transportation and Infrastructure ranking Democrat, Peter DeFazio of Oregon, withdrew his support of the legislation last week after Republicans stripped a section allowing the government to use the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund to dredge harbors. DeFazio also sent the Rules Committee a letter on Monday calling out an $810 million project to build athletic fields and a splash park.If most Democrats follow DeFazio’s lead, Republicans will be looking to pass the bill almost entirely on their own, meaning Flint provisions could imperil the legislation.All of this is to say Democrats have a number of reasons to demand Flint funding in the CR. And if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is intent on keeping the funding out, Congress could be heading toward a government shutdown that no one expected."

But James did speak out against recent police killings that have amplified Kaepernick’s protests, saying that they have created a “scary-ass situation” for those who, like him, are parents of young black children.“My personal feelings is that I got a 12-year-old son, a 9-year-old son, a 2-year-old daughter, and I look at my son being four years removed from being able to drive his own car, being able to leave the house on his own,” James said. “It’s a scary thought right now to think, if my son gets pulled over, and you tell your kids, if you just comply, if you just listen to the police that they’ll be respectful and things will work itself out.”“And you see these videos that continue to come out,” he continued. “It’s a scary-ass situation ― that if my son calls me and says he’s been pulled over, that I’m not that confident that things are going to go well and my son is going to return home.”Watch James’ comments on police brutality:James and fellow NBA stars Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul and Dwyane Wade took the stage before the ESPY Awards in July to speak out against police violence. James said Monday that while he plans to stand for the national anthem, he is happy Kaepernick and other NFL players who have joined the protests have continued pushing the conversation.“I don’t have the answer, none of us have the answer,” James said. “But the more times that we can talk about it, the more times we can conversate about it. Because I’m not up here saying that all police are bad, because they’re not. I’m not up here saying all kids are great and all adults are great, because they’re not.”“But at the same time, all lives do matter,” he said. “It’s not black or white, it’s not that. It’s everybody. But it’s tough being a parent right now, when you have a pre-teen. But the conversation has continued from the ESPYs speech that myself, CP, D-Wade and Melo had, and that’s definitely a good thing.”James has spoken out against police killings of African-Americans in the past, too. He was among the NBA players to wear “I Can’t Breathe” t-shirts during warm-ups in 2014, after a New York police officer killed Eric Garner in Staten Island. James posted images referencing the police shooting death of Ferguson, Missouri, teenager Michael Brown in 2014, and he, Wade and their then-Miami Heat teammates, posed in hoodies after the killing of unarmed Florida teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012.The NBA and its players’ union said in a statement last week that they anticipated players would bring Kaepernick’s protest to the basketball court, and other NBA players and coaches spoke out about the issue during media sessions on Monday.Toronto Raptors guard Kyle Lowry struck a similar tone as James, saying the killings made him nervous to be a parent.“Me having two younger black kids, making sure people are aware that me growing up, definitely getting pulled over was a scary thing, and definitely was a nervous thing,” Lowry said, the Toronto Star reported. “I think now we have to use our voices.”Lowry’s teammate DeMar DeRozan said he will likely protest.“I had a close friend of mine a couple of weeks ago who was murdered by the police, shot 17 times,” DeRozan said, via the Star. “It was something I haven’t spoke out about. It was more so of just understanding what’s going on in our society and how much I can help. And that’s what it’s all about. So most definitely I think we will, and I will (protest), for sure.”Stephen Curry, who has backed Kaepernick’s protests, reiterated that stance while saying he would stand for the anthem before Golden State Warriors games this season. At the Knicks media day, Anthony said his team would act collectively to address police brutality. John Wall similarly said his Washington Wizards would “talk as a team, as a group, and figure out what we want to do.”San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, meanwhile, said he would respect any of his players’ decision to protest during the anthem if they chose to.“My players are engaged citizens who are fully capable of understanding what their values are, and what they think is appropriate and inappropriate, and what they feel strongly about,” Popovich said. “Whatever actions may or may not be taken are their decisions, and I’m not going to tell anyone ahead of time that if they don’t do A, B and C, they’re going to be gone or traded. I think that’s ignorant.”Los Angeles Lakers guard Nick Young has previously said that he has considered kneeling during the anthem once the season begins. "

You don't have to go apple picking.,2016-09-26,You don't have to hide your kid in a pumpkin patch this fall. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e9626b1700002a00ac73f1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s officially fall, the season that seems to come with a checklist of weird parenting stuff we’re supposed to accomplish. Not normal stuff like “brush teeth,” and “get children to school.” No, this is stuff like “Photograph your child with a laughably large amount of pumpkins” and “release your child to wander within a labyrinth of corn.” Why are we still doing all this old-timey stuff like corn mazes, anyway? Is it like how we teach our kids the names of the farm animals from birth even though most of them have no immediate need to name a farm animal, much less the sound it makes? There has got to be more immediately relevant information for an urban toddler than farm noises. So much of my time as a parent is spent trying to keep my kid occupied while making lasting memories. That’s why, a few weeks ago, my son and I spent an hour-and-a-half on the train so we could go to the local Medieval Festival.You know who likes the Medieval festival? Me, when I was a very cool teenager who liked to pretend I had just time-traveled into my middle school. My son could not have been less interested. He actually covered his eyes out of spite when I tried to show him jousting.We ended up on the playground, but he would have been just as happy rolling a car down a slanted surface literally anywhere in America. I’m sure this won’t be the last time I try to organize family fun that is fun for no one, but in the spirit of my recent failure, I’d just like to provide this list of fall parenting traditions in which you do not have to partake, at all. You don’t have to go apple picking.Apple picking is a job. It’s OK if you don’t want to go pay money to do something that people get paid to do. You can get apples at the grocery store. You don’t have to bury your kid in pumpkins.I get it. My kid looks really good next to a pumpkin ― orange is a great color for him. But you don’t have to go somewhere where there are a bunch of pumpkins, then wait in line for an hour to snap a picture of your child adorably situated next to pumpkins. And then you just have a pumpkin in your house that you eventually have to throw out while your child cries. You don’t have to carve a jack-o-lantern. Because I’m not sure how carving something with a sharp knife ever became a kid-friendly activity, anyway. And if you are like me and have no basic crafting skills, your jack-o-lantern will look like its face is melting off and people will judge you.There are crafts you can do with a toilet paper roll and a crayon that will be much less hazardous.You don’t have to visit a corn maze or go on a hayride. Did you know the corn maze only started in 1993? I just assumed this was some kind of old-timey farm tradition but no ― we had TV when somebody made this up. And hayrides are kind of fun, but just in the sense that getting driven around on a truck can be fun. I don’t think the hay adds any significant percentage of fun to the experience. But the whole point with all of these things is that you CAN do them if you want to, but you don’t have to. If you just don’t want to, or you think it’s weird, or YOU’RE weird, or you’re only interested because you feel the steely claws of Pinterest at your neck pushing you to pose your spawn with seasonal gourds, then I give you permission to NOT do these things. A story! When I was 17, I went to prom with my ex-boyfriend. We had broken up the week before, but I felt an obligation to go to prom together anyway. Because it was “PROM!” I would remember prom for my whole life, and the pictures would be important instead of just embarrassing and I would always regret it if I didn’t go to prom.I had a shitty time at prom.What I’m saying is that apple picking, or going on a hayride, or carving a jack-o-lantern might be your version of parenting prom. Something that sounds like it would be important for the formation of lasting memories, but which you and your kids actually don’t care about.And as a parent, you’ve got better things to do. Like impulse-buying a bunch of stuff from the Target Halloween section and using it year-round. Which is definitely my favorite fall tradition. "
16,POLITICS,Hundreds Of Suspiciously Similar Letters Praise The Payday Loan Industry Ahead Of Crackdown,Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/payday-loan-letters-similar_us_57e80567e4b0e28b2b549145,But it's unclear who's behind them.,2016-09-26,"A man walks out of a payday loan store in London on Oct. 3, 2013.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e831121b00002e00ef20de.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Happy payday loan customers are all alike, it seems. Hundreds of individually submitted comments to a federal regulator praising the payday loan industry contain identical phrases, like “It was a very efficient process and definitely the most reasonable option for me.” That phrase appeared in 18 separate, supposedly legitimate and unique online customer comments. Forty-nine customers somehow ending up independently writing messages containing these exact two sentences: “To avoid bouncing a check, I turned to a loan to help pay some bills. I found that it was a great choice for me and I was able to pay my power bill on time and without penalty.” In total, more than 220 of the comments submitted to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ― regarding the agency’s proposal to crack down on payday loans ― use many of the same sentences, according to an analysis conducted by Allied Progress, a nonprofit focused on the influence of special interests. The group sent a letter to the CFPB outlining its findings on Monday, noting it had not analyzed every comment submitted. More thorough analysis, it said, would likely turn up more strangely similar comments.  In June, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau proposed the first federal rules targeting payday loans and other high-interest consumer financial products. As a required part of the rule-making process, the agency is accepting comments from individuals, the industry and advocacy organizations until Oct. 7. Of course, form letter writing campaigns, petitions and coordinated messaging from interest groups is nothing out of the ordinary in the federal rule-making process. Groups across the ideological spectrum employ these tactics to argue that their views represent the wishes of masses of ordinary Americans. While it’s unclear who is responsible for the similar online messages, it has been previously reported that the payday loan industry wanted to try to fill regulators’ inboxes with pro-industry customer comments. In August, the Cleveland Plain Dealer’s Stephen Koff reported that payday lenders were getting borrowers to write to regulators praising the industry and warning that regulation would restrict their access to credit.What makes this far different from run-of-the-mill astroturfing is the possibility that borrowers were coerced into writing pro-industry letters as a condition of getting a loan or might have thought that was the case. (The industry told Koff this was not the case.)And Dave Dayen reported for Vice that industry leaders discussed plans to inundate regulators by having borrowers write letters praising the industry at the same time they were taking out a loan. In that case, there were talking points for the letters.Particularly relevant is Dayen’s report that a corporate lawyer boasted his firm had three full-time writers to help with the effort.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated that the CFPB is accepting comments until Nov. 7. It’s accepting comments until Oct. 7."

Or at least, that’s what Trump’s campaign wants you to believe.In the run-up to the first presidential debate Monday night, Trump’s team has been working to lower the bar so far for him that it’s basically just lying on the ground. Story after story talks about how Clinton is spending her time poring over wonky policy details in briefing books while Trump is just hanging out.Trump senior adviser Jason Miller sent a memo last week stressing that Clinton “has more debates under her belt than almost any presidential candidate in history,” whereas Trump has been in a one-on-one debate only once. “Hillary Clinton is on the ropes and needs to change the game,” Jason Miller, the Trump campaign’s senior communications adviser, said in a memo. “Given her extensive experience debating, high level of preparation and scripted nature Clinton’s campaign no doubt views [the Monday debate] as the best opportunity to alter the trajectory of the race. ... [Trump is] not rehearsing canned 30-second sound bites or spending hours in the film room like an NFL player. He will be prepared, but most importantly, he will be himself.”This sort of expectation-managing creates an imbalanced scenario in which, as long as Trump shows up on time and manages not to puke or something, pundits will declare him the winner.And the Trump team is certainly making its own preparations. Politico reported Friday that the campaign is building a detailed “psychological analysis” of Clinton by analyzing videos of her 16 years of debates. The two candidates’ differential treatment was clear during a Sept. 7 veterans forum, the first such event during the general election. The moderator, NBC News host Matt Lauer, challenged Clinton on the use of her private email server and repeatedly interrupted her to stop her from filibustering. But with Trump, Lauer lobbed softballs like, “What have you experienced in your personal life or your professional life that you believe prepares you to make the decisions that a commander-in-chief has to make?” “Candidates should expect to be challenged. They’re applying for a challenging job. But where Mr. Lauer treated Mrs. Clinton like someone running for president, he treated Mr. Trump like someone running to figure out how to be president, eventually,” New York Times TV critic James Poniewozik wrote in a scathing review the following day. Clinton’s team, meanwhile, sent out a press release on Friday with the headline, “Clinton Campaign: Trump Cannot Pass Debate Test If He Repeats These Debunked Lies.” Trump lies all the time ― and often gets away with it. During the Sept. 7 forum, Trump again repeated the falsehood that he opposed the invasion of Iraq, and Lauer did nothing to call him out. “The debates are about each candidates laying out their vision for America, not making things up. Donald Trump should ― as Hillary Clinton will ― be expected to present his solutions for the problems that the country is facing,” Clinton campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri told reporters on Friday.There’s a good reason for pre-debate wrangling: Scoring a knock-out could have enormous consequences. With a far closer race than many political observers anticipated, any development that could shift the polls even a few percentage points is desirable. Political science research has shown that although debates don’t result in major poll changes, polls can shift by two or three percentage points during debate season. That doesn’t necessarily mean candidates’ performances during those events were the sole cause of the swing, but there does seem to be some effect. Big debate moments can also come to define a candidate for the rest of the race and beyond, for better or worse ― Richard Nixon sweating next to a cool John F. Kennedy, Al Gore sighing while George W. Bush spoke and Michael Dukakis’ emotionless response to a hypothetical question about his wife being raped and murdered. And a strong debate performance can re-energize a candidate’s base, much as it did in 2012, when Republican Mitt Romney pulled off a surprisingly strong showing against President Barack Obama ― a jolt the Clinton campaign could use right now as it tries to excite Democrats. While Clinton will have the hurdle of meeting the public’s high expectations, Trump will have to debate the first female presidential nominee in history ― which comes with its own challenges. Clinton is traditionally a strong debater, and has benefited from the missteps of men who simply don’t know how to deal with a woman on the stage. In 2008, Obama’s “You’re likable enough, Hillary” line backfired during a debate before the New Hampshire primaries, coming off as condescending in what was supposed to be an attempt to contrast his charisma with her more serious style. Clinton ended up winning in New Hampshire. But more famous is what happened during the 2000 Senate race in New York, when Republican Rick Lazio walked out from behind his lectern and over to Clinton, invading her personal space and demanding she sign a campaign finance pledge. Clinton tried to shake his hand as he pointed and towered over her. The maneuver was a disaster and has essentially become the textbook example of how a man can screw up when debating a woman.There will certainly be a big audience no matter what happens during Monday’s event: More than 100 million people could tune in, exceeding previous records, for the 9 p.m. ET debate at Hofstra University in New York. A presidential debate commission official told The Huffington Post that several thousand journalists applied for credentials, and they expect more than 1,000 to actually attend. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
18,MEDIA,Trump Campaign Manager Bashes Reporters Ahead Of First Debate,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-campaign-manager-debate_us_57e917a7e4b08d73b8322381,"“These are not profiles in courage and this is not journalism,"" Kellyanne Conway says of some embedded network producers.",2016-09-26,"Kellyanne Conway, Donald Trump's campaign manager, criticized reporters covering the campaign.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e91a181700002900ac7227.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Kellyanne Conway, the campaign manager for Donald Trump, claimed Monday that some embedded network producers following the GOP presidential nominee are overwhelmingly “negative” in their coverage. “Start looking at the Twitter feeds of ‘objective’ reporters, particularly our embeds,” Conway said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” “These are not profiles in courage and this is not journalism. There are people who cover our campaign who actually just slander our candidate on Twitter.” Conway said she found 92 percent of the tweets posted by at least two embeds to be negative. “Why are they on our campaign plane?” she asked. “Why are they covering our campaign?”Throughout the nearly 14-minute interview, Conway suggested the Trump campaign was the victim of media bias and said her biggest worry regarding Monday night’s debate with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was “not being treated fairly afterward” by the press. “I’m worried some of the headlines are already written,” she added. Conway’s swipe at the reporters who doggedly cover Trump’s presidential campaign around the country ― and tweet about it ― came in response to persistent questions Monday over her boss’ false claim that NBC News anchor and debate moderator Lester Holt is a Democrat.“Lester is a Democrat,” Trump said last week on Fox News. “It’s a phony system. They are all Democrats.”Actually, they aren’t. “He said Lester Holt was a Democrat. Lester Holt is a Republican,” journalist Mark Halperin pointed out to Conway on Monday. “How could he say such a thing that just black and white [is] factually incorrect?”“I don’t know he knew what Lester Holt’s registration was,” she responded. (Watch below around 8:10.)Trump has an unprecedented tendency among major party nominees to say things that aren’t true, which several news organizations pointed out this past week. The comment about Holt fits a pattern in which Trump says things on TV with seeming authority that he has no evidence to back up. Conway repeatedly deflected questions regarding Trump’s false assertion about Holt by saying the media is populated by Democrats and how “appalled” the campaign was by criticism of NBC’s Matt Lauer after his moderator performance at a presidential forum earlier this month. She also pushed back on co-host Mika Brzezinski’s description of Trump’s remark about Holt as a “lie.”“He didn’t lie” Conway said, adding that “a lie would mean that he knew the man’s party.”In other words, Trump was ignorant when he made the false claim about Holt on national television rather than knowingly lying.For weeks, Trump has been suggesting the moderators would treat him unfairly in what appears to be a blatant attempt at influencing them whether consciously or not to go easier on him out of fear of being labeled biased. The Trump campaign has also suggested moderators shouldn’t fact-check the candidates by challenging false statements. While Trump questioned Holt’s ability to treat him fairly, Conway said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week” that Holt is a “respected, brilliant newsman.” She also suggested Monday they were fine with Holt because “each campaign had a right to object to certain moderators.”Conway’s comment was surprising given that the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates is known for not allowing campaigns to vet moderators, as HuffPost reported last month. “There was absolutely no consultation with the campaign about moderators,” a debate commission official told HuffPost on Monday. “We vetted. We selected. We announced.” Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

The committee will “provide advisory support to Mr. Trump on those issues and policies important to Catholics and other people of faith in America,” according to a Sept. 22 press release.Santorum, who has compared fighting same-sex marriage to fighting terrorism, will join over 30 other advisors on the committee including Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, Matt Smith, president of the Catholic Advocate and Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony List. Together, they will aid Trump in strategizing around key issues like religious liberty, judicial nominations and pro-life activism.Santorum, who dropped out of the GOP presidential race in February, endorsed Trump for president in May saying that he had a “long heart-to-heart” with the nominee and that he is “committed to working with Donald and his Administration to ensure that conservative priorities are advanced — not simply judicial nominees, but nominees to key administration positions.”The addition of the former Republican senator to Trump’s roster continues to up his campaign’s anti-queer ante. Trump has previously stated that he would “strongly consider” appointing judges to the U.S. Supreme Court who could reverse marriage equality. He’s also said he believes North Carolina should be able to choose to discriminate against queer people and most recently pledged to sign the First Amendment Defense Act, which the New Civil Rights Movement notes is “a bill that would allow discrimination against same-sex couples by any person, business, or institution.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar,rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
20,POLITICS,Trump's About To Face His Biggest Test Of 2016,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-debate-teleprompter_us_57e9508ce4b0e80b1ba33921,No script. No teleprompter. No coaching.,2016-09-26,Donald Trump got through the GOP primary debates by insulting his opponents on stage and ducking from policy discussions. It's unclear whether a similar strategy would have good results against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in Monday night's first general election debate.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e955d01a00002d005b4c93.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― A month of scripting Donald Trump’s words and hiding him from all but the friendliest of interviews is about to pay off brilliantly Monday night at his first general election presidential debate.Or it’s about to come crashing down around Republicans whose presidential nominee cannot possibly get through 90 uncoached minutes without reverting to his natural state.“Give me steep odds,” joked one Republican National Committee member privately when asked if Trump could make it through the evening without saying something outlandish.“Wasn’t it Pilate who said: ‘What is truth?’” joked another, when asked if Trump could check his propensity to toss out falsehoods.Party leaders who started the primary season a year ago never imagining that the reality TV host could wind up as their nominee spent much of early August wondering whether a random name atop their ticket who said nothing at all could have been outperforming Trump. If only he would stick to attacking Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and laying out basic Republican themes, rather than insulting a Mexican-American federal judge and the family of a Muslim American soldier killed in Iraq, he could have a decent shot at the White House.Now, thanks to an intervention by the Trump family five weeks ago that brought in new campaign leadership, Republicans have accomplished exactly what they thought they could. Trump has turned an 8-point Clinton lead into a virtual tie in the latest national polls.The plan itself was simple in concept. While original campaign manager Corey Lewandowski guided Trump to the Republican nomination with the strategy of “Let Trump be Trump,” his new handlers have insisted on the exact opposite.Just a few months ago, a Trump campaign event meant a stream-of-consciousness discourse about his poll numbers, some insults about his opponents, a promise to build a wall along the southern border and to force Mexico to pay for it, the renegotiation of existing trade deals, and a promise to get tough somehow with Muslim immigration and the so-called Islamic State.Starting a month ago, the teleprompters that he used to ridicule go with him everywhere. The rambling of his primary events has given way to prepared speeches containing mainly Republican boilerplates about lower taxes, fewer regulations, more school choice, more domestic energy production, more military spending ― with nods to trade, the border wall and terrorism.An actual unscripted remark from Trump has become rarer ― an exception rather than the rule ― and has been mostly saved for evening rallies, when Trump appears to want to please his supporters with more off-teleprompter excursions. It was at a nighttime rally in Pensacola, Florida, earlier this month that Trump suggested that Iranian sailors who use gestures they shouldn’t be using toward U.S. Navy ships would be blown out of the water. It was at an evening Miami rally that Trump said Clinton should lose her Secret Service detail because of her support for stricter gun laws, and suggested that would result in violence against her.Even more importantly, Trump has all but ended media interviews with organizations other than Fox News, and even those have favored morning show hosts and Trump supporter Sean Hannity. While Clinton, once derided by Republicans for not holding news conferences, has staged several brief ones with the reporters who travel with her, Trump has not had a news conference since July and has had only a single brief discussion with traveling reporters earlier this month.That strategy has resulted in Monday night’s first debate looming as the first real trial by fire.During the primary debates, Trump made his mark largely by promising to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants, insulting his rivals on stage and then retreating into the background when the discussion turned to policy.It’s hard to imagine that technique working in a general election setting, where Trump has to win over not only the solid Republican base, but also groups he has struggled with, such as suburban, college-educated women. These key voters likely will not be impressed with “Crooked Hillary” insults, and almost certainly will expect a president to know basic facts about the United States and the world off the top of his head.Neither self-discipline nor command of facts is a Trump characteristic, and 90 minutes of a one-on-one confrontation, with no prepared script and no coaching permitted, could test the limits of the campaign’s new model.Trump has bragged about how he doesn’t study. Monday night could offer a glimpse into whether that strategy is a winning one for the nation’s highest office.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Ali, who stopped by HuffPost last week to promote Colgate Bright Smiles, Bright Futures, spoke about the recent controversy around the San Francisco 49ers quarterback. She said she champions Kaepernick for his response to racial inequality and police brutality in America.“I commend Colin Kaepernick because he had a lot of courage,” Ail told host Jacques Morel. “And you could tell that it’s not something he did not put a lot of thought into. He knows what he’s talking about.”Kaepernick’s political statement has drawn heavy criticism, but Ali drew a parallel to her late father, boxing legend Muhammed Ali. In addition to his athletic legacy, Ali was also notorious for publicly condemning racial injustice. “He’s going to reference Muhammad Ali and how they may have hated him back then. People didn’t always love him you know and now what he’s become,” Ali continued. “You know, people can’t always see the end of the road.""She then praised the quarterback’s commitment to speak out about an issue he believes in deeply.“He’s very passionate about it and he’s trying to speak up for people who can’t speak for themselves,” Ali said. “But at the same time, I don’t expect everybody to do it because everybody is not that individual.” In addition to her thoughtful commentary, Ali also filled us in on her new venture with Colgate’s Bright Smiles Futures. Her partnership with the organization will help impart the significance of oral hygiene to underserved children. Watch the full conversation with Laila Ali below:"

But people connected to the Speyer Legacy School say it is an LGBT-inclusive environment and the administrator’s sexual orientation had nothing to do with his departure. In a city where the one percent jostle for the opportunity to pay tens of thousands of dollars a year for elementary school, Speyer stands out for its focus on “accelerated learners.” A “group of high-powered mothers” that includes Malena Belafonte, the daughter-in-law of singer and civil rights activist Harry Belafonte, started the K-8 school in 2009, according to the New York Times. (Belafonte declined to comment on the lawsuit and referred questions to the school. “We just launched our fashion platform, which is what we are focusing on,” she said.) But despite its powerful benefactors, Speyer is relatively new, and the high-stakes lawsuit could hurt its reputation and cause parents to opt for the school’s older, more established competitors — especially if the allegations are true.Alan Cohen, 63, served as the assistant head and head of the lower school, grades K-4, for about a year, ending in June 2016. Cohen told The Huffington Post he has been an educator for more than 30 years, and was attracted to the job because of the opportunity to work exclusively with gifted children, a population that has been “swept under the rug,” he said. “These are our future leaders.” (New York City offers a public school program for gifted kids, but there are not enough slots for qualified applicants.) But Cohen soon encountered problems at Speyer, according to his lawsuit. Cohen claims that Barbara Tischler, the head of the school, met with him last fall to discuss a report she received from the school psychologist that a staff member was asking about Cohen’s sexual orientation. Cohen was upset that he was being asked this, but acknowledged he was gay, according to the lawsuit. (Tischler did not respond to requests for comment.) Cohen says staff members discussed his sexual orientation and the wife of a board member offered to set him up on a date. In the lawsuit, he cites a case in which a staffer he says it was “common knowledge” was gay was up for a promotion, but Tischler allegedly suggested Cohen talk to the staffer about how she could dress more feminine.Cohen claims to have seen a document in March showing his contract was going to be renewed and he was getting a 3 percent raise. But the next month, he says, his contract was not renewed. He says Tischler told him he was “not a good fit,” which came as a shock, because he says he had only received positive feedback about his work. He claims he was replaced with a female teacher who is married to a man and has “far less experience.” (This person only holds an interim position, according to the school’s website.) Cohen said it was not one person at the school who had a problem with his sexual orientation, but instead “systemic.” The school “was not progressive” in “any form or fashion,” he later added. But current and former employees of the school, who asked to remain unnamed because of pending litigation, disagree with that characterization. A senior administrator at Speyer who identifies as LGBT told HuffPost that she has never felt discriminated against because of her sexual orientation. “They’ve never mistreated me, they’ve always respected me and they value me as a person,” she said.A former Speyer administrator who also identifies as gay said the school was happy to have her openly out because she provided a role model for students who may be exploring their sexual orientation. When her son was born, her wife received a “lovely basket” with onesies and other baby gifts, her family was invited to school events, and she felt like her performance was judged on its merits, she said. “It’s really a wonderful place,” she added. “That’s an emphasis that they have. It’s important that kids feel safe, and you can’t help kids feel safe unless the grown-ups feel safe.” If Cohen’s allegations prove true, the discrimination would be a “clear violation” of New York City and New York State Human Rights Laws, said Samuel Bagenstos, a law professor at the University of Michigan, in an email. Under federal law— which is not implicated in this case — the issue is less settled. The EEOC says discriminating against people due to their sexual orientation violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but the courts haven’t fully resolved whether they agree, Bagenstos added. The burden of proof will still be on Cohen to show he was intentionally discriminated against based on the fact that he’s gay, said Merrick Rossein, a law professor at CUNY. The second stage would “require the school to come forward with a legitimate non-discriminatory reason” his contract was not renewed, Rossein added. “This, for me, is putting my integrity on the line,” Cohen said. “This is about being very proud of who I am.” "

The flavor contains chili pepper-infused chocolate with chunks of chocolate chip cookies (made from her own recipe!). It’s supposed to be indicative of Clinton’s “sugar and spice” personality.For everyone’s least favorite GOP candidate, Donald Trump, Ample Hills decided to go postal and use artificial coloring (something the creamery usually avoids). Trump’s Make America Orange Again is a “shamelessly orange marshmallow creamsicle flavor with chocolate brownie bricks (to build a wall).”You can snag either of these flavors at any of Ample Hills’ New York City locations through Election Day or on their website. If you purchase a Scoop The Vote 4-pack ($40), you’ll get two pints of each flavor and three campaign buttons.All of this isn’t even the best part: A portion of all election flavor proceeds will go to Michelle Obama’s organization Let Girls Learn.

Jerry Brown (D) signed AB 797, the so-called Right to Rescue Act, into law on Saturday following a series of pet deaths across the state.According to AB 797’s requirements, rescuers must have no other way to gain access to the animal and must have a reasonable, good-faith belief that the animal is in imminent danger. They must also contact law enforcement before entering, must use no more force than necessary and must remain at the scene, with the animal in a safe location, until law enforcement arrives.It only takes 10 minutes for temperatures inside a car to become dangerously hot, according to the Humane Society, which supported the bill. On a 70-degree day, car temperatures can reach 89 degrees within 10 minutes. When it’s 72 degrees outside, it takes about an hour for car temperatures to reach 116 degrees.In California, it’s already a crime to leave an animal unattended in a vehicle under dangerous conditions like excessive heat or cold, or with a lack of ventilation, food or water. The state also has good Samaritan laws that protect people who rescue someone during an emergency situation.“AB 797 will save lives,” said Dan Felizzatto, Los Angeles County deputy district attorney, in a statement backing the bill last month.“Every year, hundreds of animals suffer, and many die, in Los Angeles County from being left in hot vehicles. By the time a citizen spots an animal trapped in a hot vehicle the situation is often dire, and requires immediate action,” he said.Law enforcement and peace officers alerted by bystanders may not always respond to the scene in time, Felizzatto said.“AB 797 provides a legal framework for a good Samaritan to follow in order to remove an animal from a hot vehicle, without fear of legal repercussions,” he added.Florida, Tennessee, Wisconsin, Ohio and Vermont have all enacted laws that support such break-in rescues. In Michigan, lawmakers are considering making it a felony offense if a pet dies in a hot car."

30,CRIME,Police Identify Houston Mass Shooter Who Was Found With Nazi Paraphernalia,Alana Horowitz Satlin and Kim Bellware,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/houston-shooting_us_57e90eb3e4b0e28b2b54cfa9,Nathan DeSai was shot to death by police after wounding 9 people.,2016-09-26,"An undated photo of Nathan DeSai, the man suspected in a Houston mass shooting on Sept. 26.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e9af5c1a000026045b4e9e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Officials have identified 46-year-old Nathan DeSai as the “disgruntled lawyer” who wielded two guns and wore a military-style uniform during a mass shooting near a Houston strip mall early Monday. DeSai injured nine people before he was fatally shot by police. Two victims remained hospitalized Tuesday, but their conditions had been upgraded to fair and stable, according to Houston police. Four others were released from the hospital after treatment and three were treated at the scene of the shooting in southwest Houston.Monday evening Homicide Capt. Dwayne Ready said investigators found “old Nazi emblems” in DeSai’s black Porsche. He added that DeSai was wearing green, historic or “vintage-type” military-style apparel. Ready didn’t elaborate on insignias or symbols on the clothing. He said investigators searching the suspect’s nearby condo may have found similar items, including artifacts going back to the Civil War. Police recovered a rifle and a handgun, legally purchased in 2009 and 2011, and more than 2,000 rounds of ammunition at the scene. Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, who was out of the country on city business Monday, was told in initial reports that the shooter was a “disgruntled lawyer” who “was either fired or had a bad relationship with his law firm.”Kenneth McDaniel, DeSai’s former partner at the firm McDaniel & DeSai, confirmed to ABC the pair had shuttered their business in February due to a downturn in the local energy market but declined to elaborate. DeSai’s father, Prakash DeSai, told ABC affiliate KTRK he had seen his son for dinner the day before the shooting. The elder DeSai said his son seemed upset on Sunday because of “personal problems,” including his law business. He said his son had been running his practice from his condo since the firm closed. Police said DeSai opened fire around 6:30 a.m. Monday near a strip mall in West University Place, a wealthy area near Rice University. The neighborhood is about 7 miles from downtown Houston.Ready said DeSai was “shooting randomly at passersby and anyone he could get his hands on.” He fired from outside his car, standing near a tree for cover. Jennifer Molleda’s husband was among those wounded. Molleda told ABC 13 her husband had just left for work when she heard his tires screech to a halt outside. Molleda said she spoke to her husband by phone as she lay on the floor of their condo after she heard the gunshots.“I’m hit! I’m hit!” she said she heard her husband scream. She said he was unsure of where his injuries were. The windshield of his car had been shot through, and Molleda said her husband had been hit by glass fragments in his eyes, face and arms.“He was shooting into windshields at people’s faces,” Molleda said of the gunman. “There was no shooting tires; there was pure intent.”Molleda said several witnesses recalled seeing a red laser focused on their face. As Molleda was preparing to visit her husband in the hospital Monday morning, she said she wanted to know what prompted the shooter.“I would want to know why? What was so miserable in your life that you’d have to hurt others? He almost killed my husband today,” she said.The shooting comes just days after a gunman shot and killed five people at a mall in Washington state. Arcan Cetin, 20, allegedly opened fire at Macy’s in Burlington, which is north of Seattle.This post has been updated to include information from police about the shooter’s identity."

Evidence of the plumes is visible in recent observations made by the Hubble Space Telescope, William Sparks, an astronomer with the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, said in the briefing. The new report confirms similar observations that were made in 2013.The plumes provide additional evidence that beneath Europa’s icy surface lies a vast underground ocean of liquid water. In addition, they suggest that it might be easier than some had thought to search for signs of life on the moon, which has long been considered one of the likeliest places to find extraterrestrial life in the solar system.“If there are plumes emerging from Europa, it’s significant because it means we may be able to explore that ocean of Europa for organic chemicals or even signs of life without having to drill through unknown miles of ice,” Sparks said.Here’s an artist’s illustration of water vapor plumes erupting from Europa’s surface:Scientists estimate the plumes rise about 125 miles from Europa’s surface before raining back down. If there’s life in the subsurface ocean, it could be brought to the surface by the water jets, becoming visible to a visiting spacecraft. “Who could ask for more?” Seth Shostak, senior astronomer at the SETI Institute and a noted expert on the search for extraterrestrial life, said in an email to The Huffington Post. “Europa, one of the choice locations in the solar system for biology, is possibly offering it up to us on a platter. Rather than sending a lander and a drilling rig capable of making a 10-mile hole in granite-hard ice, all we may have to do is send an orbiter around this intriguing moon, outfitted with a catcher’s mitt. We grab some of that plume, bring it back to Earth, and look for evidence of alien microbes in the comfort of our labs.”The live-streamed announcement capped days of intense speculation over just what NASA would reveal at the briefing.Some had wondered if the space agency might announce that alien life had been found. But in the hours leading up to the briefing, NASA threw cold water on that idea, saying “Spoiler alert: NOT aliens” in a pair of blunt tweets, including this one:Europa is one of at least 67 known moons of Jupiter. Scientists have long speculated that its cracked crust hid a vast ocean. In fact, the suspected ocean might hold more water than all of Earth’s oceans combined, The Washington Post reported.“We know that on Earth, everywhere that there’s water, we find life,” Robert Pappalardo, a scientist with a planned Europa mission, said in a video released earlier by the space agency."
