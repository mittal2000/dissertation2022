(Photo by Ronald C. Modra/Sports Imagery/ Getty Images) ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5badffa9200000e500ff2d91.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The recent accusations of child abuse against NFL player Adrian Peterson, and his subsequent suspension from the Minnesota Vikings, have touched off a heated conversation about corporal punishment. Peterson's actions, as well as the NFL's response to them, have provoked a variety of responses. Former NBA star Charles Barkley defended Peterson this week, claiming that ""every black parent in the South"" disciplines their child in a manner similar to how Peterson allegedly punished his son by striking him with a switch. NFL Hall of Famer Cris Carter, who admitted that he was physically disciplined by his mother as a child, declared the tradition was wrong and said we now know you ""can't beat a kid to make him do what you want to do."" Detroit Lions running back Reggie Bush followed up a few days later, saying that his parenting approach included disciplining his 1-year-old daughter ""harshly.""The growing body of research into corporal punishment has found overwhelming evidence that it actually makes children more aggressive and encourages them to continue the cycle of abuse. Studies have even shown spanking to physically alter the gray matter in kids' brains. Despite these findings, many parents continue to stand by the practice.A recent HuffPost poll showed that even supporters of spanking think that what Peterson did should be illegal. But we wanted to open up the conversation to the HuffPost Black Voices audience.We asked for your thoughts, feelings and opinions on the subject. Here are some of the responses we received.""There's a difference between a beating and a whoopin! I whooped my kids, I never beat them. And I'd do it again!"" -- Margo McClellan""Stop the violence!"" -- Roxy N. Melody Dorsey""I still believe 'spare the rod, spoil the child!' Know your child and what 'works' with him/her."" -- Yolanda Collins""When did the 'rod' become a belt or switch? Oh, during slavery when blacks were beat with whips. As we have progressed in society, we know more, and can understand child development better."" -- Timmie J. Winston Jr.""I'm not going to let the justice system reprimand my child, I'll do it myself, thank you very much."" -- Pas Jb""The most effective punishments I got was taking away privileges. Whippings are more about how the parents feel, not necessarily corrective actions."" -- Robert Eclectic Rebel Moreland ""Not sure if I'm a better person for it or not, but who am I to tell another parent how to discipline their child."" -- D.L. Williams ""Spanking and beating with switches or extension cords is not discipline. You'd go to jail for doing it to your dog, but have the audacity to say 'you can't tell me how to discipline [my] child.' Yes the law can! There is a difference between discipline and abuse. A whopping never stopped a kid from doing something, just like the death penalty never stopped a murder from being committed."" -- Mek Greene ""I don't think a kid should be beat to bleeding status but other than that anything goes. My grandmother pulled a Smith & Wesson snub-nose .38 out on me when I was 16 years old. Never had another problem from me the rest of my life. Five years later she told me the gun was unloaded. Regardless, it sure made a believer out of me. Talking, pleading, and reasoning to these kids simply does not work. Some type of fear must be present for control and benefit."" -- Kenneth Kennard""He could have taught the child about sharing, but this was a case of 'I don't want to be bothered, so I'm going to beat him until he stops.' He basically sent the child mixed messages. Disciplining aggression with aggression. It's madness."" -- Shanya T. Hayes""The only thing the man did was go too far. But we are always crying that black dads need to be in the child's life and now you want to tie his hands. He can't do both."" -- Nila Draper Granberry""Whippings and beatings are a part of African-Americans' history. We treat our children like property. They will do as told or get beat. I whipped my son and I am very sorry. I will take that mistake to the grave. It does not change behavior."" -- Michelle Jackson""I'm the parent and if I want to instill corporal punishment I can. This idea that Society can tell me how to discipline my kids is insane. If you don't want to spank your kids... that's you. But it's MY KID and MY DECISION. Are you going to be there when and if they go to jail or when things fall apart? So you ain't here with me to decide how to punish my children."" -- Allen Sutton""These kids today are no worse than we were. I was a bad motherf*cker and used to get beat weekly whether at home or at school. It never taught me anything except violence is a way to make people do what you want."" -- David Ring""Me and everyone I know got our asses kicked southern style, and we from Cali. Some parents don't have to beat they kids and some do, depends on the DNA floating through their system... I have kids and I'm 4000% against child abuse, but a good ass whopping and child abuse are two totally different things."" -- Nahte Rai""There are not racially or regionally appropriate ways to discipline children. I never spanked my children. They are amazing adults now: responsible, sensitive, and loving. I believe doing physical violence to another person, even spanking, is harmful if you want your children to achieve their full potential."" -- Gary Barber ""Adrian you go head and handle your business. Keep hope alive!"" -- Georgia Stovall""Just because it's the way many southern black parents treat their children doesn't make it right. I believe that it is child abuse and just because it's common in black families doesn't make it any less abusive. Look at how many violent pathologies many black children suffer from, parental abuse may well be the root."" -- Frank Farmer""Let's not make it more than what it is. A lot of us received spankings/beatings because we were caught doing what we were told not to do. But now Black parents can't discipline their children - but white cops can get away with shooting them dead."" -- Kavin Coleman""People are saying it's no one's business how he chooses to discipline and they speak of 'how well they turned out' after being whipped as a child. How many of you have asked a child that is in foster care or juvenile detention, because of the DISCIPLINE they sustained, how they feel about it. Just saying stop minimizing and justifying. AP's baby was four years old... how much could he have possibly done to warrant that kind of whipping?"" -- Levenia Alexis""Was Dr. King beaten? What did he become? Was he a peaceful man or was he angry?"" -- Samuel Scott""The idea that 'I was hit and I am ok' does not work. Apply that norm to other behaviors like RAPE, SLAVERY, killing etc, and you see the problem immediately. Past behaviors [being] acceptable do not make them acceptable today."" -- Patrick Matthews""Total support for Adrian."" -- Keianna Washington Carty""I was spanked as a child, but I didn't see it as helpful to my upbringing, therefore I do not spank my own children. We talk and come up with other ways of handling our problems that are peaceful and useful. I am raising mine to be thinkers and problem solvers, not obedient dogs. Children are blank canvases and often mirror their environment. Usually when a parent sees something undesirable in a child, instead of getting angry and violent it's time to ask oneself how either they or their environment might have contributed to the manifestation of that undesirable behavior. Then address it constructively so the child understands WHY it's wrong."" -- Marlena Nkene""I thought my dad was wrong for all the times he disciplined me. Yes I had all types of things used for those whopping, whatever was close by. Later in life I see it brought out the best in me. So we need to continue getting that switch and tearing those legs up or someone else will! God bless our children."" -- Deborah Avie-Elliott""I was beaten as a child, and it left scars, so NO, I have never struck my child or my grandchildren that I raised. They all turned out just fine without being hit as a form of discipline..."" -- Victoria ByrdSome responses have been edited for clarity."

Muslims in the country are trying their best to separate themselves from the actions of the so-called Islamic State, an extremist group that has spread their bloody reign of terror across large swaths of Northern Iraq and Syria. “We want to make clear terrorists and criminals do not speak in the name of Islam, they have trampled on the commandments of our religion, and that murderers and criminals have no place in our ranks, in our religion,"" Mazyek said during a news conference.German politicians and faith leaders from different religions also came out to show their support. Nikolaus Schneider, head of the Council of Protestant Churches, thanked the organizers for taking a stand.""You have unequivocally said that Islam and terror don't belong together,"" Schneider said during a peace rally. ""We believe you,"" he added, drawing cheers from the crowd.An estimated 400 Germans have fled the country to join the IS fighters in the Middle East, Reuters reports. Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière has urged Germany’s 4 million Muslims to be vigilant about the group’s recruitment tactics.  But Azize Tank, a parliament member, was regretful about the fact that Muslims in her country felt compelled to explain the actions of a terrorist group thousands of miles away. ""Normal Muslims shouldn't always have to apologize for everything,” Tank told Deutsche Welle. She hoped politicians would do more to make young Muslims feel welcome in Germany. ""You need to give young people jobs and make sure there's an environment that prevents them from joining extremist organizations,” Tank said."

There were no clashes with Islamic State militants during the operation, it said.Without naming its sources, it said MIT had tracked the hostages as they were moved to eight different locations during their 101 days in captivity. HAMSTRUNGTheir capture had left Turkey, a member of the NATO military alliance and a key U.S. ally in the Middle East, hamstrung in its response to the Sunni insurgents, who have carved out a self-proclaimed caliphate in parts of eastern Syria and western Iraq, just over the Turkish border.The rapid and brutal advance of Islamic State, bent on establishing a hub of jihadism in the center of the Arab world and on Turkey's southern fringe, has alarmed Ankara and its Western allies, forcing them to step up intelligence sharing and to tighten security cooperation.Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said on Saturday tens of thousands of Syrian Kurds had crossed into Turkey over the past day after Islamic State seized dozens of villages close to the border.The United States is drawing up plans for military action in Syria against Islamic State fighters, but Turkey had made clear it did not want to take a frontline role, partly because of fears for the fate of the hostages.The militants have beheaded two U.S. journalists and one British aid worker, using the tactic to put pressure on Western governments after U.S. air strikes helped halt Islamic State's advances.British and U.S. officials have said in recent weeks that their nationals had been killed by Islamic State militants in part because other countries were paying ransom money.France was able to secure from Islamic State the release of four of its nationals in Syria earlier this year, after what President Francois Hollande said was help from other countries.Hollande reaffirmed on Thursday that Paris did not pay ransoms or exchange prisoners for the release of its citizens who are held hostage overseas.Officials will not divulge the number or nationality of hostages taken in Syria for fear of putting their lives at risk.

Though our lives are now complete, let's still take a look at how we got here ...Duff broke onto the scene in ""Lizzie McGuire"" back in 2001, and immediately all of our lives changed for the better. Lizzie was just like us. She was clumsy, awkward and insecure, but she was also charming, relatable and just seemed to get us.Though the series ended in 2004, Duff went on to star in movies, release albums and become a successful entrepreneur. Then, she just walked away.Duff told us, ""I had toured for like 5 years, so once I was done with my last tour, I was just like, 'I’m done. I need a break. I need to go away. I need to like live.' And I did.""During her hiatus from the spotlight, Duff enjoyed doing a lot of normal people stuff. She got married, had a baby (Luca) and even traveled.Today, Hilary Duff is back. She's going to release a new album, she's set to star in ""Younger,"" a new show coming to TV Land, and she's working with Trident in support of Oral Health America’s Smiles Across America (SAA) campaign, a program that helps underserved kids receive dental care.During the week of September 15th, every pack of Trident gum purchased at retailers nationwide has led to a five-cent donation to the program.Recently, Duff told us about the SAA campaign, her new album and that big ""Lizzie"" news:So why did you want to get involved with Trident?  I think hearing about the work that Trident does with Smiles Across America got me inspired because oral health care is really important for kids. I have a two-year-old, and I know how important it is to get them to brush their teeth and how challenging it can be. Any tips for other parents? I have two. It’s starting early ... and always try to make a game of it. Challenge him.I'll be like, ""I bet you can’t stand on one foot brushing your teeth."" And he’s like, ""Yes, I can! Yes, I can! Yes, I can!” You know they want to be able to do everything. They love a challenge. Sometimes we sing songs, and some days it’s easier than others. Since this is Trident, have you, in your career, ever requested to be paid in Layers? [To publicists] Can you guys arrange that for me?[To HuffPost] When they called me, I was actually like, “But you don’t understand. This is the gum I buy.” I was so excited because when you get to be a part of something you’re actually a fan of … it’s ideal. But no, I have never requested to be paid in Layers. The program sounds awesome, but let’s get to what everyone has been wondering for years. Would you be interested in doing a ""Lizzie McGuire"" reunion?  Would you pay money for that?In a heartbeat.  [Laughs.] I love it! I would be totally open to it. My schedule is a little busy right now. But um … why not? I mean, so many people loved her. I loved her. Honestly, working on that show, I got so strong with my physical comedy and all the things that they would throw at me. I got covered in goo every week, and I got, like, smashed in the face with a locker every single week. And all this, I mean it was a really, really fun show. And obviously people really loved her. Maybe a ""Lizzie: Where Are You Now?"" like 10 years later.Team Gordo or Team Ethan?Lizzie always chooses the right way. Personally? Ethan!No, no, I’m just kidding. I always choose the good guy. Are you sure? Yeah, the naughty side of me wants to be like, ""The hot guy,"" but then I always choose the good guy.Why wasn’t Miranda in ""The Lizzie McGuire Movie""? Oh my gosh, I love how this is just flashback ""Lizzie McGuire"" stuff. You know what, I don’t really know, but she was definitely missed. I think we should just start over, and you should come in here, and I should just put a bunch of butterfly clips in my hair and wear like mismatching jeans and top.Wow, that would actually be awesome. So for your new album, how would you say it's different from the others, and is there a track that defines it? The album is very different. My last record was seven years ago. I haven't just frozen in time. Being a mother has given me a confidence I didn’t have before, so maybe that came across in the studio for sure. Being more, you know, ballsy with what I have to say. And not holding back.There’s a song called ""Belong"" that I really love. It sounds cheesy when I talk about it, but it’s not cheesy at all, and it’s more about just like not waiting for anything. Just going for it and not holding back. Like I said, it sounds cheesy when I talk about it, but it’s not at all. So, Hilary ... Why not take a crazy chance? Why not do a crazy dance?Oh my God. Thank you. This has been the greatest moment of my life.  Well, where's the dance?You really want me to dance? Yeah! You put me on the spot![HuffPost reporter proceeds to shake what his mama gave him by performing an original dance move called ""The Earthquake.""]Oh my gosh! Wow! I’m going to teach Luca the ""Earthquake."" I think he would really like it.This interview has been condensed and edited.

""Voter fraud is real and the voter IDs is the only way to stop it.""Davis accused her opponent of defending ""a law to suppress minority voting,"" referring to federal court rulings that the state's voter ID regulations and changes to the redrawing of electoral boundaries that were defended by Abbott are discriminatory toward Hispanics.She has focused her campaign on education, women's rights, equal pay and her personal story of overcoming poverty to attend Harvard Law School.Both parties know the booming Hispanic population in Texas could upend Republican dominance by 2030 when Hispanics, who are Democrat-leaning, become a majority in the state.Abbott and Davis both have campaigned in south Texas and their campaigns have Spanish-language websites. Democratic Latina State Senator Leticia Van de Putte is running for lieutenant governor and Abbott has made his Hispanic wife, Cecilia, a prominent part of his campaign.Abbott's first television commercial was produced in English and Spanish, and featured an endorsement by his Hispanic mother-in-law, Mary Lucy Phalen.""The Hispanic vote is very important to both parties for different reasons,"" Republican strategist Bill Miller said.

Today, we turn to the immigration crisis on Europe's borders.As many as 700 people are believed to have drowned in two tragic accidents last week during what may have been the deadliest weekend in the Mediterranean in history. On Sept. 10, traffickers sank a ship with 500 Syrians, Egyptians and Sudanese who were trying to reach Europe. More than 200 African emigrants are thought to have drowned only days later when their boat sank off the Libyan coast. Tens of thousands of migrants attempt the perilous journey across the Mediterranean from North Africa to Europe each year. Paying smugglers small fortunes to be transported in what are often ramshackle boats, they hope to escape war or poor economic conditions and settle in the European Union. Many never make it across. This year alone, nearly 3,000 people are believed to have died while trying to reach southern Europe. The WorldPost spoke to Michel Gabaudan, president of Refugees International, an independent organization that ""advocates for lifesaving assistance and protection for displaced people,"" about the rising number of emigrants and the devastating rate of accidents. Newspapers report on intercepted boats and accidents in the Mediterranean nearly every week. Is the number of people trying to cross into Europe steadily growing?There's a very steep increase in the number of people crossing from the North African coast towards Europe. About 60,000 people crossed last year. Today, in mid-September, we are at 130,000, more than twice as much. There’s also been a dramatic increase in the number of people dying at sea. We estimate about 700 people died last year, and now the figures are anything between 2,200 and 2,500, without counting last week's deaths. These are estimates because people are not registered.The routes have also moved. A few years ago, the largest movement ran from Morocco towards Spain, and these were mostly people from Sub-Saharan Africa who were moving essentially for economical reasons -- young men without jobs looking for an opportunity. The Spanish connection has now almost entirely been blocked by border enforcement and we’ve seen the routes shift towards departures from Tunisia, Libya and Egypt instead. The boats carry a mixture of people. In the last boat, there were Sudanese, Egyptians, people from Gaza and many Syrians. What's the Syrians' situation like?We were in Egypt a couple of months ago and talked to many Syrian families there. The Syrians who had arrived in Egypt basically came through Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan and they came to the country legally. They were initially very well received by the Egyptians under the previous government [of Mohammed Morsi].The new government [led by former army chief Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi] has taken a completely different line, and when the new government assumed power there was a tremendous campaign of denigration, accusing the refugees of being pro-Morsi. Living conditions deteriorated all of a sudden, right at a time when there’s no indication the Syrian conflict will come to any kind of resolution in the near future and expectations of going back to Syria one day are being deafened. Many of these families have relatives in Europe and they’re becoming desperate about their future. We warned them that the trip they were about to undertake wasn't light, their women were at high risk of being abused by traffickers, they could drown and they would certainly not receive an open-armed welcome in Europe. Why would they want to take this risk? They told us their economies are gone; they don’t have jobs; they don’t have access to services; their children are not going to school. ""We have nothing to lose, so we’ll try,” they said. It’s dramatic that people are reaching that level of desperation. What explains the huge rise in deaths at sea? Are smugglers getting more brutal?I’m not sure I have the answer to that. The bottom line is that this is a business for the smugglers and they treat people like cattle. They have no sympathy for the refugees' plight, for the fact that they suffered in Syria or suffered economic deprivation. There's a huge line of refugees waiting to cross. I think it’s just brutal economics. Has the international community done anything to address the crisis?There are some worrisome moves. The Italian government has run a project for the past year called Mare Nostrum -- Our Common Sea. They sent boats to try to rescue refugees in international waters, where most of the accidents take place. It's been suggested to expand those patrols to Frontex, the European border agency. However, the new patrols would occur in territorial waters. To me, that looks much more like border protection than rescuing people. The High Commissioner for Refugees has suggested several measures to the international community that could reduce the flow of migrants -- people recognized as refugees should be given much better chances of resettlement in European countries, many people could qualify for humanitarian visas, why not look at student visas or employment visas for people that could perform jobs that are needed in Europe. A lot of measures would give refugees a little bit more hope and reduce the movement. If you reduce the movement, you’ll have less people die.What's the one point in this debate that's often overlooked? When we look at the immigration crisis from the West, we often argue there are countries in the region that can deal with the issue and we can give them help. ""This is far away and we have our own problems,"" is the argument.Right now, in Lebanon, one person in four is a Syrian refugee. It’s one in six in Jordan. In Iraqi Kurdistan, one in four are people displaced by the current violence. In our countries, the presence of 40,000 kids at the border becomes national drama and is used politically. The sacrifice we make is nothing compared to what other countries are making, and we seem to ignore that.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."

(Photo by Stacy Revere/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb76d151f0000df002505c7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Florida State may have put it hopes of a repeating as national champion at risk by (eventually) suspending Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Jameis Winston for an important game against a major rival. But, perhaps, it achieved, even if only reluctantly, a more important victory for its female students and fans. Following a vulgar, misogynistic outburst on campus earlier this week, the redshirt sophomore superstar was sidelined for No. 1 Florida State's nationally-televised clash against No. 22 Clemson. The University initially suspended Winston for just the first half following the incident on Tuesday, but, amid criticism, increased the punishment to include the entire game on Friday. Winston, who won the Heisman Trophy and led Florida State to a national title as a freshman, has previously been accused of sexual assault and been caught stealing crab legs from an area supermarket during an up-and-down stint in Tallahassee.With ESPN's ""College GameDay"" on Florida State's campus on Saturday, there was at least two female fans who seemed to appreciate the increased punishment for Winston's offensive and sexually charged exclamation. Amid the handmade ""GameDay"" signs with jokes about crab legs and digs at Clemson, there was one sign with a powerful message: ""Women > Winning""In a pointed commentary segment on ""GameDay"" on Saturday, ESPN's Samantha Ponder referenced signs like this one while reporting that patience with Winston is wearing thin among Florida State's female fans. ""After the initial accusations of everything that has gone on in the last year or two, the Florida State faithful were just that, very faithful to Jameis Winston, defending him loyally,"" she said. ""It seems like that's starting to change. Even the signs that you see in our audience today are a lot different than you would have expected from Jameis a couple of weeks ago. I've been talking to tons of fans and people around the program and the patience is wearing thin, especially from female fans.""Florida State's decision to lengthen Winston's suspension came just hours after NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell addressed that league's failures in dealing with violence against women. With the NFL facing a credibility crisis sparked by its mishandling of the Ray Rice domestic violence case, Winston's history of off-field misbehavior may make him less attractive as a prospect despite his talent.""It'll hurt him significantly,"" an NFL scout told NFL Media's Albert Breer. ""Especially with all the stuff going on in the league. This may force him to stay another year to clean up his image. He's a fraud. You can't believe anything he says, because he keeps doing the same things over and over."""

Police have charged Frein with opening fire outside a state police barracks in northeastern Pennsylvania on Sept. 12. Cpl. Bryon Dickson was killed and Trooper Alex Douglass was wounded by the gunman with a high-powered rifle. (AP Photo/Chris Post)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c9a8bb9230000f4006d9618.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CANADENSIS, Pa. -- Jill Nobles is a single mother living in the backwoods of Pennsylvania, seven miles from the home of alleged cop killer Eric Frein. Less than two weeks ago, she felt safe -- now she clutches her pepper spray when she leaves the house, unsure if cops will block off her route back when she returns at night.It has been almost eight days since Frein, 31, allegedly ambushed two Pennsylvania state troopers at the police barracks near his home, killing one of them. As local, state and federal authorities continue their manhunt for the suspect, the community's tension grows. Nobles, who is trying to obey officials' requests that local residents stay inside, told HuffPost Crime on Saturday morning that she's still terrified.""I've been panicking, monitoring the police scanner and Twitter,"" she said. ""We're so far out the local police don't come up here. I have my pepper spray in my hand every time I come back to the house. All the neighborhoods here are hunkered down, we're all in contact texting each other.""She's not the only one on edge thinking of Frein, a known survivalist and sharpshooter, who could be hiding anywhere in the thick woods of Pennsylvania. Every false alarm on the scanner sends dozens of police cruisers, armored cars and press vehicles flying through the backroads of the Poconos Mountains. There have been at least two false alarms over the past two days. On Friday night, police surrounded Frein's home as rumors of shots fired and ""They got him!"" swept the area.CNN reported that police were ""closing in"" on Frein and had him surrounded, but that was misleading. Officers continued their search Friday near Frein's parents' home.At the area bars -- one of the few places locals are gathering, since the high school football games were canceled and schools closed -- locals talk about what they'd do with the FBI reward of $100,000 for catching Frein, though many admit that he's probably long gone, hiding in the 3,000-acre Promised Land State Park or beyond.They sat Friday night huddled close in the bars chain smoking, conversations suddenly dropping when they pick something up on a police scanner. The frustrating situation had residents wondering what, if anything, they could do while a killer was on the loose.""He's made us a prisoner in our own homes,"" a patron at Old Ranger's Inn, who did not wish to be identified, said. ""You're afraid to walk your dog if you hear a crack in the woods.""Despite the increasing tension, locals mostly agree that Frein would be foolish to come back to the area, which boasts more than a dozen gun shops.""Believe me, all of us are armed,"" the patron said.""Everyone has a gun,"" said Mike, a resident who declined to share his last name. ""Everyone.""At a location close to Frein's last known address, officers lit flares and barreled down streets on a tip that the alleged killer had been spotted.As bystanders stood by, desperately hoping Frein had been captured, a woman close to the suspect's family said Eric had always been a ""laid back kid"" who was quiet and rarely got into trouble.""Yesterday I sat with Eric's parents at a neighbor's house and we just spent the day praying,"" the woman said. Others said they recognized the Frein family by the full-sized candy bars they gave out to children on Halloween.Frein was added to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list after he shot two officers, Alex Douglass and Bryon Dickson, outside the Blooming Grove police barracks last Friday night. Dickson was killed, while Douglass remains hospitalized.With federal agents now in the mix, the once-quiet winding backroads are now crowded with more than 200 officers and state tactical units. Armored cars drive by as men dressed in camouflage scan dense woods, their faces painted in stripes of green, white, and brown, assault rifles slung over their shoulders. Resident Steve Vitkovsky referred to the heavy police presence as a ""marvel,"" something he hasn't seen the likes of since 2009, when Pennsylvania officer Joshua Miller was fatally shot while attempting to apprehend a kidnapping suspect. ""For [Frein] to go to the hornets nest and kick it? It's a shocker,"" Vitkovsky said.CORRECTION: Bryon Dickson’s name was misspelled in an earlier version of this article.

""The piece refers to Rhimes 19 times and has only one mention of [Pete] Nowalk [creator of 'HTGAWM'],"" Abad-Santos wrote. Rhimes also found this puzzling:Over at Vulture, Margaret Lyons called the New York Times piece ""inaccurate, tone-deaf, muddled, and racist."" Lyons noted a selection of obviously angry Rhimes characters (Mellie, Cyrus, etc.) who are white. Stanley failed to mention any of them. ""What's the difference between a rant and a monologue? Sometimes just the race of the person delivering it,"" Lyons wrote. She ended her response piece by hypothetically assuming that even if Stanley's assessment were correct, there's still a flaw: ""Is there anything in this article in particular that suggests any of these characters are based at all on Shonda Rhimes?,"" Lyons questioned. ""There is not."" The takeaway from all this? Perhaps this: When writing about a beloved, powerful and successful producer, it may be best to not totally associate that person with their shows' characters, or more specifically, with characters of one race."

San Francisco drag queens are sparring with Facebook over its policy requiring people to use their real names, rather than drag names such as Pollo Del Mar and Heklina. In recent weeks, Facebook has been deleting the profiles of self-described drag queens and other performers who use stage names because they did not comply with the social networking site's requirement that users go by their ""real names"" on the site. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafcdc7200000e500ff7637.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sister Roma of the the legendary Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, the drag group that began in San Francisco in 1979 and has performed and raised money for AIDS and other causes throughout the country, was recently shocked after being logged out of Facebook and stripped of an identity known to thousands of people in the LGBT community and beyond.“Like a lot of people, I was simply using Facebook, and then I was forcibly logged out, and I was instructed to sign in and I had to change my profile name to match the legal name as it appears on my drivers license or credit card or my profile would be suspended, and would be deleted,” Sister Roma said. Sister Roma was yet another target of a Facebook policy that has caused an uproar in recent weeks, as many other drag queens and performers, as well as people who need anonymity on Facebook for safety reasons, such as LGBT people in countries where there are laws that could jail them simply for being gay or transgender, have faced a similar situation. The policy has been in place for years, but most troubling about it to many is that it is not enforced unless a complaint is filed, leading Sister Roma and others to conclude that they are perhaps being targeted by individuals or groups hostile to LGBT people. For many people who are not yet out about being gay, lesbian or bisexual, anonymity is key as they make friends on Facebook to help guide them. And for many transgender people, still in the process of transitioning, their names may not match the name on their drivers license at a given time.""So I did that,” Sister Roma explained in an interview with me on SiriusXM Progress. “I entered my legal name and then my profile popped up, with my picture and then it said my legal name, Michael Williams, and I was like, ‘Oh I didn’t expect that to happen.’ I didn’t realize that I was going to be presented to the world as Michael Williams, which is not how I identify myself or how anyone identifies me.”Sister Roma then went about the arduous task of trying to contact Facebook. I mean, I was really pissed,” Sister Roma said. “So I tried to contact Facebook and I don’t know if you’ve ever tried to contact Facebook, but good luck, honey! It is not easy. So I actually googled, ‘How do you contact Facebook?' and I discovered that there’s a little tiny help button you can push but with just a very limited number of issues that they will address with you. So I just turned to social media. I went on Facebook. I went on Twitter. I said, ‘This is outrageous. How dare they tell me who I am! Nobody knows my legal name. It’s not important'…And that’s when the emails started to come in from people. I got emails from people that would rip your heart out. People with legitimate, important reasons that they use protected names on Facebook that do not match the names on their legal ID.”Along with San Francisco City Supervisor David Campos, other activists and members of legal groups such as the ACLU, Sister Roma met with Facebook officials. But, as has been reported, Facebook refused to budge on the policy, despite the backlash. Sister Roma does believe, however, that the Facebook officials finally understood why anonymity is important to many people, even if they didn't indicate a change would happen. Other employees of Facebook, who approached the activists during the visit, said they agreed that the policy needs to be changed. The group hopes a second meeting with Facebook will get some action."

In that time he became a vocal leader among the bishops and earned a reputation as a feisty culture warrior in line with the Vatican of the late St. John Paul II and retired Pope Benedict XVI.That track record won him fans on the Catholic right, but George was seen as out of step with Francis’ desire for more pastoral bishops who are less focused on picking fights over sex and more involved in promoting the church’s social justice teachings and sticking close to the poor.Cupich, who will now be in line to get a cardinal’s red hat, would seem to fit that bill.Named by Pope Benedict XVI to head the Diocese of Spokane in September 2010, Cupich (pronounced “SOUP-itch”) has steadily staked out positions that align him with Catholics who want the church to engage the world rather than rail against the forces of secularism.In March 2012, for example, in the midst of the bishops’ nasty battle with the Obama administration over religious freedom and the employer mandate to provide free contraception coverage, Cupich wrote an essay in America magazine titled “Staying Civil.”In that column, Cupich called for dialogue with the White House and the Department of Health and Human Services rather than constant confrontation, and said the crisis was a chance to find “common ground.”“While the outrage to the H.H.S. decision was understandable, in the long run threats and condemnations have a limited impact,” he wrote.The phrase “common ground” also resonated because it was associated with the approach of George’s predecessor in Chicago, the late Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, who embodied the hopes of a more progressive church — hopes that seemed to end with George.George is 77 and has been battling a recurrence of bladder cancer, and he said he expected a successor to be named sometime this fall, though not this quickly. All bishops are required to offer their resignations at age 75.Word that George’s replacement was to be named began circulating Friday evening and seemed confirmed when the archdiocese announced a press conference at 9:30 a.m. on Saturday, but without revealing the topic.While Cupich had been seen as a long shot to replace George, his name also began surfacing Friday night and was confirmed by multiple church sources and first reported by The Associated Press.Cupich is a Nebraska native who was educated in Rome and served in a number of church posts before he was first appointed a bishop as head of the Diocese of Rapid City, S.D.As head of the Spokane diocese, which covers the eastern half of Washington state, Cupich was known for reaching out to a largely unchurched population and for promoting the church’s social justice teachings in a region suffering from the effects of the recession.Cupich also gained notice in 2012 by adopting a moderate line when Washington voters went to the polls to vote in a referendum to legalize same-sex marriage.In a pastoral letter read from all the pulpits in the diocese, Cupich defended the church’s position against same-sex marriage but he called for a respectful debate and he forcefully condemned any attempt “to incite hostility towards homosexual persons or promote an agenda that is hateful and disrespectful of their human dignity.”“It is deplorable that homosexual persons have been and are the object of violent malice in speech or in action,” Cupich wrote. “Such treatment deserves condemnation from the Church’s pastors wherever it occurs.”Cupich also frequently praised the new approach of Pope Francis, who was elected in March of 2013, echoing his call for a more collaborative church and a greater attention to the church’s social justice teaching.In June this year, Cupich was a featured speaker at a Washington, D.C., seminar sponsored by Catholic University of America convened to question whether one could be a good Catholic and espouse libertarian economic ideas.The event was headlined by Honduran Cardinal Oscar Rodriguez Maradiaga, one of Francis’ closest advisers, and in his talk Cupich echoed the cardinal’s powerful denunciation of libertarianism’s effects.Growing inequality, Cupich said, is creating “a powder keg that is as dangerous as the environmental crisis the world is facing today.”Cupich said political leaders cannot wage this debate “from the 30,000-foot level of ideas” but must take into account the real-life implications of policies as they play out on the ground.“Reality,” he said, quoting Francis, “is greater than ideas.”The move to Chicago will be a big change for Cupich in many ways. He is leaving a diocese of 90,000 Catholics and 82 parishes to take charge of a sprawling and storied archdiocese with more than 350 parishes and 2.2 million Catholics. "

Wharton. The kits date from 1976 to 1979, when the department had primitive methods for cataloguing evidence. ""There was no computerization. There was no tracking,"" spokeswoman Dewanna Smith told The Huffington Post. The rape kit backlog has bedeviled the city's police department since 2010, when TV station WREG uncovered more than one thousand kits that hadn't been DNA-tested. That was just the tip of the iceberg as investigators counted 12,164 cases in their most recent inventory, which Police Chief Jim Harvey presented to the city council on Tuesday. In 2013, there were 351 rapes reported in Memphis, according to city records. Before finding this batch, the oldest, unresolved kits were from 1985, according to the Memphis Daily News.DNA testing didn't exist in the 1970s, when the evidence from the additional 196 cases was collected, but investigators will see what can be gleaned from the samples of blood, saliva, semen and hair in the kits. Officials will attempt to notify the alleged victims that their cases are part of the backlog, Smith said. Cases in danger of expiring due to a statute of limitation will be given priority as officials scramble to examine them. The city is $3.75 million short on the $6.5 million it needs to test all the kits, according to Harvey's presentation to the city council.
