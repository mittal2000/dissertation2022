0,SCIENCE,Is Obamacare Punishing Hospitals The Wrong Way?,Joe Satran,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obamacare-hospital-readmissions_us_55f732e1e4b0c2077efbb909,A new study finds flaws in Medicare's effort to reduce hospital readmissions.,2015-09-15,The Affordable Care Act seeks to lower hospital readmission rates.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55f73413180000530061d0c0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"An elderly homeless man is admitted to the emergency room complaining of a fever and cough. Doctors take an X-ray and diagnose him with pneumonia. They keep him in the hospital for three days while he takes antibiotics and recovers. Then they discharge him, telling him to continue taking the antibiotics for another week. He takes only half his pills and the disease returns, so he checks back into the hospital. Who's to blame? According to the federal government, the hospital is. Under the Affordable Care Act, hospitals are fined up to 3 percent of their Medicare payments if too many Medicare patients return to the hospital within 30 days of discharge. By giving hospitals a financial incentive to reduce readmissions, the idea is to encourage better quality care.It's turned out to be a rather large incentive. In 2015, 2,592 hospitals around the country -- more than half of those in operation -- were hit with readmissions penalties, which totaled $420 million. Yet a study published this week in JAMA Internal Medicine suggests that many readmissions are unavoidable, especially those involving patients like our hypothetical homeless man with pneumonia. The authors of the paper, who are all affiliated with Harvard Medical School, examined 29 patient characteristics -- including race, education, disability, alcohol intake and prescription drug benefits -- to see whether they had an impact on readmissions. And -- surprise, surprise -- they did. The study found that these 29 factors account for nearly half the difference between the readmissions rates at the best- and the worst-performing hospitals. Medicare officials already make some effort to account for the differences in hospitals' patient populations. In computing the expected readmissions rate for any given hospital, they factor in a handful of patient characteristics, including age, sex and conditions being treated. But a number of groups, including the American Hospital Association, have argued that Medicare doesn't sufficiently account for the differences among hospitals. Specifically, they say that the current system penalizes hospitals that admit a larger-than-average share of the poor and especially ill individuals who are the most likely to return to a hospital no matter how effective their care is. The new study supports that idea. Once researchers factored in all the other measures, many of which were associated with socioeconomic status, the readmissions gap between the top and bottom quartiles of hospitals shrunk from 4.4 percentage points to 2.3 percentage points. ""By taking account of that disparity between the patient populations between the best- and worst-performing hospitals, we really narrow that range, and so the worst-performing hospitals don't look nearly as bad,"" said the study's lead author, Harvard gerontologist Michael Barnett.""And maybe the best-performing hospitals don't look as good, because they're taking care of patients that are much less likely to have been readmitted in the first place,"" he added. Prior research has suggested that teaching hospitals, such as those affiliated with Harvard Medical School, are among the institutions hit hardest by readmissions penalties because they tend to serve a disproportionately large share of at-risk patients. Medicare's failure to account for hospital differences doesn't only hurt the facilities' bottom line, Barnett said. It could also hurt patients. That's because the incentive program discourages hospitals from admitting patients who are likely to be readmitted. And it takes money away from hospitals that do serve such patients, making them less able to treat future patients effectively. Barnett admitted that it would be difficult for Medicare to take all 29 of the factors his team analyzed into account when assessing penalties. But he noted that the health records that Medicare officials use to compute the penalties already include a number of those factors, and that if the program accounted for just those additional factors, the difference between the best- and worst-performing hospitals would shrink by 25 to 30 percent. Bills before the House and Senate would require that Medicare do so. An even better approach, to Barnett's mind, would be to shift the readmission rate calculation toward one focused on improvement. That way, hospitals would be judged by how much they reduced readmissions from year to year -- which is ultimately the point. "

""It was a surreal feeling being out there at practice,"" Olson told the USC Ripsit blog. ""I'm excited to help this team in any way I can and be a great teammate. I love this team and I always have, and now it feels great to be a part of it."" Olson was born with retinoblastoma, which is a cancer of the retina. As a result of the cancer, he had his left eye removed at 10 months old, and his right eye in 2009 at age 12. Despite the difficulties he would face because of his blindness, Olson eventually made his high school football team as the starting long-snapper anyway.As ESPN noted, Olson established a relationship with the Trojans football team back in 2009. That season, he ended up flying out to Notre Dame to see USC face the Irish. He also went to a USC practice the day before his surgery. Head coach Steve Sarkisian said that ""someday, [they] hope to get Jake into a game.""USC sports information director Tim Tessalone reiterated this wish in a phone conversation with The Huffington Post Sarkisian's point, but also emphasized Olson will be treated like every other player on the roster.""Sark, in the past, has said the hope is to get him in the game one day,"" Tessalone said.

2,BUSINESS,Men Educated At Ivy League Schools Vastly Outearn Female Classmates,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ivy-league-income-gap-by-gender_us_55f860c0e4b00e2cd5e82ae2,"It has a lot to do with choice of major. Oh, and sexism.",2015-09-15,Some of these Harvard grads are going to crush their peers when it comes to income.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55f868c0180000270061d1f6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Attending the country's most prestigious schools doesn’t make you immune to the unfortunate societal stew of sexism, bias and history that drives the income gap between men and women in the U.S.Men who graduate from the country’s most exclusive universities vastly outearn their female counterparts, according to startling statistics released over the weekend by the Department of Education. Ten years after starting at Harvard University, men make on average $53,600 more per year than women who graduated from the school. That's a lot of money -- roughly equivalent to the U.S. median income. This is the pattern at all of the country's elite schools, as The New York Times reported. The gulf is widest at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where men outearn female graduates by an eye-popping $58,100 a year, the Times noted.You can view the full data set at the education department’s website. The department tracked income, as reported on federal tax returns, for nearly every college student who took out a federal student loan and enrolled in 2000 and 2001. Those without loans and those who were in graduate school a decade after starting college were not included in the data set, but those who didn't finish their undergraduate degree were. The New York Times parsed the data and graciously allowed us to reproduce their chart:Much of the gender wage gap can be traced back to men and women’s choice of college major, experts told The Huffington Post. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean the brightest, most successful women in the country are voluntarily deciding to make less money than men. The choice to move away from STEM majors -- those in science, tech and engineering that generally lead to high-paying jobs -- comes after years of subtle biases that often steer young girls into the social sciences and humanities.“Women overwhelmingly choose humanities and social sciences. Men choose engineering and computer science. The men are getting the big bucks,” said Linda Babcock, an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon who has researched the gender gap extensively. “But that’s not necessarily because of inherent interest in the topics.”A decade after starting college, the average female Carnegie Mellon graduate earns an average of $76,200; their male counterparts earn $108,000. An overwhelming majority of social science majors at the university are women, Babcock said.“If you went to mechanical engineering,” she added, “it would look exactly the opposite.”If you compare the incomes of men and women who major in the same subject, about half of the gender gap disappears, said Amelia Haviland, one of Babcock’s colleagues at Carnegie Mellon. Still, even when they major in the same subjects as men, women often end up taking less lucrative jobs after school. More women now major in math than men, Haviland noted, yet there remains a big gap between what male and female math majors earn. Men are more likely to become actuaries (salaries can reach as high as $250,000 a year); women more often wind up teaching in high school, where salaries are lower.If you then take into account the fact that women are more likely to drop out of the workforce at different times for child-caring, the gap shrinks some more.The penalty women face in their careers for having children is what's really holding women's pay back, Claudia Goldin, an economics professor at Harvard, told HuffPost. “The real issue is what happens after [graduation] -- at 10 to 15 years out the gaps are huge,” said Goldin, who is currently heading up a big cross-university program that aims to get more women into economics, a field in which they're underrepresented.“Every school is looking at this data and thinking, ‘oh, this is bad,’” Babcock said. “But the status quo is working against them.”As awareness of this problem grows, a lot of schools and companies are trying to push more women toward computer science and engineering.“Across the university many of us are very passionate about understanding this,"" Pulin Sanghvi, executive director of career services at Princeton, told The Huffington Post. At the start of the year, the Ivy League school convened a diversity inclusion committee in the career services department, focused on not only gender, but ethnicity. Princeton's gender income gap falls slightly below Harvard's, according to the Department of Education's data. Babcock notes there’s a lot of subtle things going on that push young women away from studying STEM -- peers might discourage girls from the “boy subjects,” and there are few role models in the media for females.I remember, decades ago, wondering what happened to all the girls in my honors science and math classes when I showed up on the first day of eighth grade. The following year, there were only two girls in my Advanced Placement biology class. It wasn't exactly an encouraging situation. My bio teacher once paused in the middle of a lecture to tell me I was pretty.“Think about what you see in the media, the faces of Silicon Valley,” Babcock said. “Who do you see as the head of tech companies? You see men. Those are impactful messages that young people see over and over and over again. And you start thinking, ‘that’s not for me.’ The messages are subtle. The impact is not.”"

Their push has been met with a security crackdown that has resulted in increasing numbers of refugees to attempt to enter England from other ports. The camp has been described as one of the largest of its kind in Western Europe. Although few Brits across the English channel are supportive of taking in the refugees, many of their compatriots are finding ways to improve the lives of those living there. Their stories have received less attention than the conflict between the French and British government over how to handle the region’s migrant crisis. In an effort to counter that, Positive News, a U.K.-based, solutions-oriented news outlet, outlined a number of efforts from everyday people who are trying to make even a small positive impact on refugees’ lives.One group, Jungle Books, was founded by British teacher Mary Jones. Jones created a library stocked with more than 200 books, which help the refugees learn how to read and write in English, thereby improving their employment prospects, according to Positive News. A school has also been created.In addition, a Facebook group, People to People Solidarity, is serving as an online hub for Brits looking to coordinate taking action. It has more than 26,000 members.Another group, Bikes Beyond Borders, has donated bikes and supplies like sleeping bags and tents to those living in the camp. The bikes allow for a less time-consuming trip into town for refugees to apply for jobs or fill out forms.Rosie Strickland, a participant in a recent “critical mass” bike ride to deliver bikes and supplies to the Calais camp, wrote of the experience in a followup piece on Positive News: ""We left the camp with a deep sense of irony and of our own privilege. How can it be possible that we can walk away, board a ferry, and reach England so easily when our friends fend for their lives in a lawless, sometimes ruthless, and filthy camp, fighting to be recognised as human?""MORE:Ensia: Surprising ways Kenyans are embracing climate-smart agricultureNPR: Alabama’s Science Standards Get A MakeoverThe What’s Working Honor Roll highlights some of the best reporting and analysis, from a range of media outlets, on all the ways people are working toward solutions to some of our greatest challenges.

Frank Pallone says ""murky"" legal landscape around the fast-growing industry merits scrutiny.",2015-09-14,"An employee at the Boston headquarters of DraftKings, one of the fastest-growing daily fantasy sports web sites.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The opening weekend of NFL broadcasts were filled with advertisements for websites like DraftKings and FanDuel, the largest participants in the growing world of daily fantasy sports. Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) noticed the ubiquitous ads, and now wants Congress to review the legality of daily fantasy -- and the involvement of professional sports leagues and teams with the budding industry.Pallone, the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, called on committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.) to hold hearings on daily fantasy sports, which have become lucrative outgrowth of traditional fantasy gaming.“Despite how mainstream these sites have become, the legal landscape governing these activities remains murky and should be reviewed,” Pallone said Monday in a press release that accompanied a letter to Upton. The Energy and Commerce Committee holds jurisdiction over professional sports and gambling.Gambling on professional sports is illegal under the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, or PASPA, except in states that allowed it before the law passed. The Unlawful Internet Gaming Enforcement Act, or UIGEA, prohibits online sports gaming. But fantasy sports have remained legal through a carveout in UIGEA that protects so-called games of skill.Daily fantasy, in which users draft new lineups of players each day, has thrived under that carveout, especially over the last two years, and has grown into a multimillion-dollar industry in part through partnerships with sports leagues and teams. MLB and the NBA have invested in DraftKings and FanDuel, respectively, and dozens of teams across the four major American leagues have marketing relationships with the two websites. The sites boast millions of users, have attracted huge investments, and tout that they can pay out seven-figure prizes. To Pallone, though, the games played on DraftKings and FanDuel look enough like traditional gambling to merit congressional inquiry.“Fans are currently allowed to risk money on the performance of an individual player,” Pallone said in the release. “How is that different than wagering money on the outcome of a game?”Pallone is not the only one who has raised concerns about daily fantasy. As the industry has grown, gambling experts and Jim Leach, the former Republican congressman from Iowa who authored the UIGEA, also have questioned its legality. Pallone is an advocate of legalized sports gambling, and was critical of a recent federal court decision saying that PASPA prohibited New Jersey from legalizing sports betting.In addition to the legality of daily fantasy, Pallone wants to examine the changing attitudes within sports toward legalized gaming. His letter to Upton and Rep. Michael Burgess (R-Texas), chairman of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing, and Trade, notes that NBA commissioner Adam Silver has advocated for legalized and regulated sports gambling, and that MLB commissioner Rob Manfred has hinted that his league may take a softer approach to the issue than in the past.Those developments, Pallone wrote, should give Congress cause to question the relationship between leagues, teams, players, and the operators of fantasy sports sites, and whether players should be allowed to participate, as some have in the past."
10,POLITICS,The Days Of Awe And Syria,Howard Fineman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-days-of-awe-and-syria_us_55f70d70e4b042295e371c40,"During the High Holy Days, we should reflect on what the world can do to bring peace to those fleeing war.",2015-09-14,Refugees arrive at the border between Austria and Hungary on Sept. 14.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON – At the start of the Jewish New Year of Rosh Hashanah, which began Sunday night, congregants pray to God to bring peace, spiritual and temporal, to all mankind. The High Holy Days' “Days of Awe” are an appropriate time to consider the fate of a people who now are particularly in need of that peace – Syrians.In this season of reflection, repentance and renewal, it is also appropriate to consider the moral and political obligations of Germany, Europe, the U.S. and the rest of the world to bring about that peace. In sum: Germany is trying to lead, Europe is going slow, the U.S. is playing for time, and wealthy Arab states are doing nothing. In Israel there is talk of helping – the opposition leader suggested accepting some refugees – but it’s just talk. As for Iran and Russia, they have long backed the man who created the Syria chaos in the first place, Bashar Assad.German Chancellor Angela Merkel has led the European effort to welcome Syrian refugees, though last week she had to scale back her own adherence to the European Union’s liberal rules for admitting them. A steady stream had become a flood. Still, Germany probably will take in more refugees than the rest of the 28-member EU combined.It is usually wrong, and always risky, to compare events of our time to those of Nazi years. Hitler’s “Final Solution” was singularly demonic: a brutal genocidal machine without parallel. And yet, in the beseeching voices of refugees fleeing the killing fields of Syria, an echo of those earlier dark and blood-soaked times is impossible to ignore.Stern but caring, Merkel is all too aware of the history: In the 1930s and 1940s, German trains were packed with Jews on their way to death in concentration camps. Now they are packed with Syrians desperate to escape the Islamic State and Assad and to live in peace and prosperity in her country.She is trying to offer her prosperous country as a model of humanitarian decency. Merkel is no prophet. No politician is. But if prayer is in the air, it might be worth saying one for her. The rest of Europe, especially the east, is balking at the Merkel project and even reacting with concertina wire and hate speech, especially in Hungary. In the U.S., the Obama administration issued a carefully worked statement suggesting that it would “prepare” to take in to 10,000 Syrian refugees in the next fiscal year. This year that number is about 1,500. Millions of Syrians are in exile, at least temporarily, in Jordan and Lebanon, two neighboring countries that are among the poorest and most enfeebled in the entire Arab world. Meanwhile, the Gulf Arab states, which have all the cash in the world and plenty of room, haven’t offered to take a single refugee. In Israel, opposition leader Isaac Herzog has suggested that the Jewish state, reborn from the ashes of suffering, should extend a hand to at least some Syrian refugees. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged the plight of the Syrians, but rejected the idea on logistical grounds. And in a new poll, only one in 10 Israelis said that they would support allowing any Syrian refugees to settle in the country. Wariness is understandable. The two countries technically remain in a state of war, and there is no faction fighting in Syria that would not wish to destroy Israel if it wasn’t too busy trying to destroy its sectarian enemies within.As Syria fails, Syrians suffer.So in this solemn but hopeful season, prayer may be the only answer – and knowing that “mankind” means the child staring with imploring eyes through the window of a train."

Analysts had expected about 4.5 million for the first 24 hours, compared with 4 million during the first day last year.Apple began taking preorders on Saturday for the phones, which will begin shipping Sept. 25.The company said it was working to catch up to demand for the iPhone 6S Plus, the larger of the two new phones, which exceeded its forecasts for the preorder period.""Preorders this weekend were very strong around the world,"" Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said in a statement.After shattering sales records last year with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, Apple has been dogged by questions of whether it can sustain the momentum this year.BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis said the company had always enjoyed a burst of sales of new phones from die-hard fans and customers who are due for an upgrade.""Will these phones have the same staying power as the iPhone 6?"" he asked. ""It's still going to be a challenge.""The exclusion of the Chinese market last year set a low bar Apple to clear with preorders this year, he added.However, John Jackson of IDC said the 6S and 6S Plus' strong early performance dampened concerns on Wall Street.""Apple has this track record of outperforming its own outperformance, but the iPhone 6 looks like an extraordinarily tough act to follow,"" he said. ""The fact that they are fast out of the gate with this refresh is a very encouraging sign.""FBR Capital Markets senior analyst Daniel Ives said he was encouraged by the response in China, where Apple's website showed particularly long wait times for the phones.""It shows that they are off to a white-hot start, with China really being front and center as a main driver of initial demand,"" he said.After last year's redesign, the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus feature more modest updates, such as improved cameras and 3D touch, a display technology that responds according to how hard users press their screens. But Apple executives have stated that only a fraction of users have upgraded to the iPhone 6, suggesting the company has ample room to grow.Last week Apple announced the phones, as well as a new TV set-top box that responds to voice commands, but the new products underwhelmed many social media commentators and investors.Apple relies heavily on the sale of its flagship iPhones, which generated nearly two-thirds of its revenue in the latest quarter.(Reporting by Julia Love; Editing by Alden Bentley and Lisa Von Ahn)  Also on HuffPost:"

Over the weekend, Lively posted a photo from her recent L'Oréal Paris promotional shoot featuring stars like John Legend, Eva Longoria and Karlie Kloss. The actress compared the shot to Swift's ""Bad Blood"" squad. Some, however, thought the former ""Gossip Girl"" star was taking a jab at the pop superstar -- so much so that Lively took to Instagram Sunday to make it clear that she has nothing but love for Swift. ""Umm whoever thought I was throwin shade clearly doesn't know I have a ""Taylor Swift Please Be My Wife Voo Doo Doll"" #obsessed,"" she wrote alongside an Instagram photo of her niece, Heather, posing with Swift at a recent 1989 World Tour stop.

Bush in 1990 and of Roberts under President George W. Bush in 2005. Cruz said both were ""easier,"" uncontroversial nominations because they lacked a true conservative record.""Neither Souter or Roberts had said much of anything. They didn't have a paper trail. They wouldn't have a fight,"" said Cruz. ""Whereas if you actually nominate a conservative, then you gotta spend some political capital. Then you gotta fight.""Cruz added that if the Bushes had gone instead with two ""rock-ribbed conservative"" judges -- Edith Jones of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit and J. Michael Luttig, formerly of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit -- Obamacare would have been struck down in 2012 and same-sex marriage would not have been legalized nationwide.Then came a promise.""I give you my solid word that every justice I put on the Supreme Court will be a jurist committed to following the Constitution and not acting as a philosopher king imposing his or her will on the American people,"" he said.Cruz didn't always think Roberts was a poor choice for chief justice.In 2005, while then-Judge Roberts awaited Supreme Court confirmation by the Senate, Cruz wrote an effusive defense of the nominee, whom he called ""brilliant"" and ""a principled conservative"" who could be trusted to faithfully observe the Constitution.""The Senate should confirm him swiftly,"" wrote Cruz, then solicitor general of Texas and a well-respected Supreme Court advocate.Roberts actually agrees with Cruz on gay marriage, as The Washington Post notes: He dissented from that landmark decision. (Souter, for his part, retired in 2009, years before the Supreme Court even considered the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, the Defense of Marriage Act and same-sex marriage bans.)Another strange aspect of Cruz's critique is that he and Roberts share a noted admiration for their former boss (and Roberts' predecessor), the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist. Both served as law clerks to Rehnquist, albeit at different times during the justice's lengthy tenure on the court.This month, Roberts celebrates his 10th anniversary as chief justice.Following the Supreme Court's back-to-back rulings in favor of Obamacare and same-sex marriage in June, Cruz lamented to radio host Sean Hannity that the decisions represented ""some of the darkest 24 hours in our nation's history.""Since then, Cruz has called for retention elections for Supreme Court justices and criticized the court's work at a Senate subcommittee hearing."

But the news marks the first confirmed meeting between Biden and a heavyweight fundraiser who has publicly backed Clinton.Positive poll numbers have led Biden, a former senator who has twice before run for president, to consider joining the race to challenge Clinton, also a former senator and first lady.But he has remained undeclared as he and his family are weighing whether they have the energy and commitment for a presidential race after the recent death of his son, Beau.In an emotional interview with talk-show host Stephen Colbert, during the same New York trip, Biden, 72, said he was not in a place where he could say he could devote his full self to running for president again.Wolf, who owns a financial consulting firm, previously served as chairman and chief executive officer of UBS's Americas division as well as president and chief operating officer of UBS Global Investment Bank, both units of UBS Group AG.

19,SCIENCE,Why This Trailblazing Astronaut Never Dreamed Of Going To Space,Eliza Sankar-Gorton,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mae-jemison-astronaut_us_55e8921be4b0c818f61b371a,"""I never had doubt that women could do any of this stuff.""",2015-09-14,Mission specialist N. Jan Davis works with Mae Jemison while in orbit.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55f056491700004301569bac.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Mae Jemison made history in 1992 when she rocketed into orbit aboard NASA's Space Shuttle Endeavor, becoming the first African-American woman to go into space. And while the physician-turned-astronaut left the space agency the following year, she hasn't abandoned her interest in spaceflight or in science more generally.Jemison, 58, has become an outspoken proponent of diversity in science, technology, engineering and math education, arguing that it's ""bulltwinky"" to suggest that women and minorities aren't good enough to make it in those fields.She doesn't just talk STEM -- she lives it. Jemison is heading up the 100 Year Starship program, which aims to develop the technologies that will enable human interstellar travel. In addition, she's working as a spokesperson for Bayer's Making Science Make Sense initiative, which fosters science literacy among students through hands-on demonstrations and volunteer speakers. And she's helped publicize the results of Bayer's Facts of Science Education survey, which she hopes will help move STEM education forward.Jemison recently spoke with The Huffington Post about the origins of her interest in space, the surprising twists and turns of her career and why she'll never fulfill her dream of being a singer.Did you always dream of being an astronaut? I'm going to say no, but not because of the reason you think. I always assumed I'd go into space, but I did not assume I'd have to be a crew member ... When I was growing up, during the Apollo era, I thought that by the time I was old enough to have a job like that, I'd just be a scientist working on Mars. I didn't dream I'd go to space -- I assumed I would, which sounds a little arrogant, especially growing up in the '60s as a young girl, a young African-American, a person of color.Why would I just assume? I just thought the universe, the world, was going to figure this out, and that women could do all these things. There was a Russian woman who went up, Valentina Tereshkova, in 1963. I never had doubt that women could do any of this stuff.You seem hesitant to use the word 'dream.'I think it's overused. Dreams have an ethereal quality to them, as though we don't really know we can make them happen. Some things are more concrete than that. I always dreamed I could sing like Shirley Bassey, and that's not happening, I don’t have even the start of a wonderful singing voice. I can sing loud, but Shirley Bassey is wonderful. So I always assumed I had the skill set to do many different things. I think of it as, ""This is what I want to do."" I am careful about using that word 'dream' because it implies this is something you can’t necessarily make happen. So have big thoughts, have big ambitions. Growing up, who were your role models?We learn from everybody, whether we call him or her a role model or not, even if that person is not a positive role model. You may learn procrastination from somebody as you’re growing up. The folks who influenced me most in terms of my behavior and things like that were my parents and my schoolteachers. People that I worked with in labs, dance instructors -- oh my God, the work ethic and imagination of dance instructors and social scientists. They were the ones that probably influenced me the most.In terms of space, there were really cool people that went into space, but here's the thing: I would have wanted to go into space if there had never ever been anybody of any kind in space ... I knew who the women and the African-Americans that had been to space were, I knew [NASA astronaut] John Young, and certainly I was very impressed with them. But I would have applied. It didn't matter. Did anyone discourage you from applying to the space program? I didn't run around telling people, ""I’m going to apply to be an astronaut."" That's my business. Why would you share what you want to do with every ancillary person that may or may not tell you to do this? I probably got more discouragement when I worked in a Cambodian refugee camp.How did you come to work in Cambodia?In medical school, in the late 1970s, early 1980s, as the Khmer Rouge were being run out of Cambodia by the Vietnamese, there were all these refugees coming into Thailand. My medical school staffed a facility, and one of the deals was that fourth-year medical students could come. So I was in a place where there were refugees coming in, still just off the border with skirmishes going on. My mother was uncomfortable with me going into that environment -- more around that, where you could see an active problem, than the astronaut program. You left NASA in 1993. How did you feel about that transition?One of the things I think is really important is to have new experiences and talk about new experiences. What I found is, a lot of what I learned about space exploration, I look back on those technologies and I think, ""Wow, they would be really great and helpful for the developing world."" When I left NASA, I left because I wanted to work on how to use advanced technologies on helping developing countries and sustainable technology design. That’s where my past experiences blend. And it's important to have different disciplines and be wide open to thinking about the world differently. Do you agree with those who say the U.S. has a STEM problem -- that not enough young people are pursuing educations and careers in science, technology, engineering and math? If so, what should be done to remedy the situation?As far as the U.S. is concerned, we have a problem with exploiting, developing the full range of talent that we have in this country, and this is particularly true in the science, math and engineering fields. It happens because many of the people in those fields don't recognize the talent of the full range of women and the full range of minorities as important. When I started with the Bayer program 20 years ago, there was less recognition of science and science careers and jobs. Over the years, if you look at the [Facts of Science Education] survey, parents and teachers recognize the importance of it, which is great. People even know the word STEM, and there was a whole phrase coined! People recognize the importance of hands-on education. It's not about just drilling and saying, ""Memorize the periodic table."" It's the hands-on engagement that makes the difference. What do you think explains the lack of diversity in STEM?Girls do as well as, or better than, boys all the way through high school. That's fact. They go into college wanting to go into STEM fields, but graduate in lower numbers percentage-wise. The survey asked professors about this. A lot of the professors at these research universities say they recognize and consider the women the best-prepared to graduate in a STEM field. Yet they were okay with the women not graduating because they felt that maybe the women couldn't cut it, that they weren't tough enough. It was bulltwinky. And we know it's nonsense because at Harvey Mudd College, Maria Klawe, the president, was able to -- in just five years -- triple the number of women graduating in computer sciences. They changed the way the courses were taught, but they didn't make the work any less. They separated the kids who quote-unquote know computer science and try to lord it over folks, but they all had to be in the same place at the end of the year. They brought mentors and images, and guess what? It also helped males. What advice do you have for STEM teachers?  Before I started working with Bayer, I was working on a program -- a camp called The Earth We Share -- and it was for kids ages 12 to 16. That the rough age where it's like, ""What’s the role I'm going to play?"" And people start looking at each other and [saying], ""What am I supposed to act like?"" And you see girls dropping out from wanting to be in science. But you know what? We had more girls applying than boys, and the girls ran the place. I was like, ""Okay, you need to let the guys do some stuff!""I think this is the whole idea of public figures, and maybe it's because I was close enough to them to actually be a role model, they were like, ""Okay, this is Dr. J's camp. I don’t have to let go of my assertiveness."" It was just amazing. So interesting, because the girls had no compunction about being in charge. That had to do with people’s expectations and attitudes. What’s the best piece of advice you ever received? I have no single piece because each one is episodic. One that's not really great for one situation is perfect for another. But the one that I've always found helpful ... I don't know if it’s even advice, but it’s a way of living: Just find the humor in stuff. Stuff is really funny. You can take yourself so seriously and so dramatically. Go ahead and mope, you got one day to mope, or two days to mope. But then look for the humor in it, it's kind of funny. I'm not talking about loss and death, but some of the things where you're like, ""That was just crazy"" are pretty funny. What are the goals of the 100 Year Starship program? The idea behind the 100 Year Starship program is this: As we strive for an extraordinary tomorrow, we create a better world today. As we look at building the capabilities for sustaining human travel outside the solar system, we’ll find solutions for some of the most pressing science and technology and cultural problems that we face on Earth today ... The further and further away from the Earth [you] travel, the more self-sufficient you have to be, and the more you have to think about the whole thing differently. When you do that, you bring other perspectives to bear.Our proposal to DARPA [the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency] was, ""An inclusive, audacious journey transforms life here on earth and beyond."" The first word is ""inclusive"" and that comes from the perspective I bring. I know that we need a full range of talent across not only disciplines, but also ethnicity, gender and geography, to really deal with this. 100 Year Starship is about building a global ambition to do bigger things. Which of your other projects are you excited about now?The work that I do with Bayer, I think it’s really important about public-private partnerships -- corporations going in not just to sell their product, but also to support the next generation of scientists. I wouldn't be here without my third-grade science teacher or my sixth-grade teacher. They both had the latitude to let me do different things so they could keep me interested. The Thank You campaign Bayer is doing allowed me to thank Mrs. Miller, and she got to come to my launch. She was one of the people that knew I was crazy about space. It helps me as much as it helps them, to express that appreciation.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."
