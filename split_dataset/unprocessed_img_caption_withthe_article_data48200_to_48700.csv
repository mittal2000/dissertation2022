And if it doesn’t, U.S. track star English Gardner proved you can still win Olympic gold.The 24-year-old sprinter told USA Track & Field that after Thursday night’s time trial for the relay, which advanced them into the final, she returned to the apartment she shared with her parents in Rio and never touched her spike bag. During warm-ups Friday night, she left her bag in a tent. About 10 minutes before the race was to start, she prepared to practice hand-offs with Allyson Felix. She went to her bag to get her shoes: “I opened my bag, and it looked like stuff had been moved around. And there was only one spike in it.”“I’m normally not a person to forget my shoes. That’s kind of like, you know, a soldier showing up to a war without his guns,” said Gardner, who ran the third leg of Team USA’s relay. Felix overheard Garnder and was able to save the day by lending her a spare set of her spikes ― which were custom-made for Felix’s narrow feet and roughly a half size larger than Gardner’s typical 7.5 shoe. “It was nothing an extra pair of socks couldn’t fix,” Gardner told USA Track & Field. Taking to the track in her borrowed spikes, Gardner ― along with Felix, Tianna Bartoletta and Tori Bowie ― blazed to a gold medal-winning finish of 41.01 seconds.Felix on Sunday told NBC that she always packs extra spikes. “I’m kind of the momma of the group now,” she said. It wasn’t the first time the veteran’s quick thinking helped Team USA. The Americans were almost shut out of gold medal contention Thursday when Felix and Gardner dropped the baton during the handoff in the qualifying round. Felix told Gardner to pick up the baton and keep running, even as the team finished in a dismal 15th place. But since the team completed the race, they were able to appeal their elimination on the grounds that a Brazilian runner in the next lane had bumped Felix, disrupting the handoff. Following Friday’s gold medal-winning race, Gardner thanked her teammate and tried to return the shoes, but Felix refused them. “You keep those,” Felix told Gardner, according to USA Track & Field. “You earned a gold medal in them.”"
2,COLLEGE,Why I Went To Summer Camp,"Hayden Vick, ContributorSenior at UNC-Chapel Hill, camp counselor, writer, classroom v...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-i-went-to-summer-camp_us_57ba0c30e4b007f18198c9bf,I had no idea what I was getting myself into.,2016-08-21,Summer camp: A place where the most inspiring people might also be the smallest.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57ba0c821700001900c74868.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ah, 7:30 is here again, and the ringing of the bell I now know all too well has stirred the men of cabin six. Sleepy-eyed and exhausted, we all get out of bed at the bell’s request because we know that the day ahead is sure to be full of adventures and new surprises at every turn. I also hop up because I know that eight seven- to ten-year-olds might need my reminder that it’s time to get the day started. Yes, every day at camp starts this way: 7:30 sharp and by bell. And yes, I did choose this as the way to spend my summer of 2016.I learned that being a camp counselor is a lot more than teaching basketball and guiding a cabin of boys around all day. It is the largest commitment I’ve ever experienced, and I can truly say I had no idea what I was getting myself into. What made me qualified to be responsible for 32 little dudes in a span of three months? What had I done to deserve the opportunity to mentor a counselor-in-training? I didn’t really know what to expect coming into camp and somehow, the summer still exceeded my expectations.Six activity periods dictate campers’ daily schedules, and what makes Falling Creek so awesome is that every camper has the power to choose his six activities based on his own preferences and interests. In the gym that was finished just two years ago, I spent almost every day teaching basketball and often getting my butt handed to me by campers one-on-one. I learned so quickly how to lose to someone younger than me, sometimes half my age. Embarrassing at first, but so humbling and great exercise after all.I still don’t think it’s sunk in that I got to be a (hopefully positive) role model for the 32 boys in my cabin, not to mention the numerous others with whom I interacted via basketball, meals, etc. Summer camp is a time of exploration, excitement and growth for these guys, and I am so proud to have been apart of that at Falling Creek.We come silently into the place known as campfire, take our seats as a cabin, and wait for the traditional ceremony that involves speakers, skits, and music. Campfire is a place where everyone can feel completely free to say whatever they want without fear of judgement or condemnation in the least, an open forum where I’ve personally seen tons of laughter on some nights and tons of tears on others. Perhaps the perfect depiction of the essence of campfire is Dusty Davis’ “Stone Soup” piece in which he embraces and illustrates all that campfire is so beautifully. In his story, Dusty also includes Psalm 1:33, which is said at the beginning of each campfire: “Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity.”All summer, I was completely transparent about not feeling like I belonged at camp for the first few nights, especially on the day of my arrival. No air conditioning, bugs everywhere, and not exactly my favorite place back in May when I figured out what was in store for me for the next three months. I may never have gotten used to the bugs, but I do know that I was welcomed to this place by everyone there, and so I was able to welcome it into my heart as well.So what would a camp counselor say are the perks to spending your summer as I’ve spent mine? Rather than procure a simple list, I’ll just say that the seemingly cliché anecdote is more fact than fiction: It’s an experience that will get into your heart and stay there. I can honestly say that I put my whole self into this role, in every interaction with every camper, as well as with fellow counselors. I like to think I exerted every possible ounce of energy toward giving as much to camp as it gave to me. Needless to say, I’m infinitely thankful for all of the people, from the age of six and up, who I may not have ever met if it weren’t for my summer at camp; as so many people will tell you, it’s the people who make the place what it is. Regardless of where life takes me, I’ll always cherish my summer spent as a counselor at Falling Creek Camp."
3,BLACK VOICES,What It's Like To Lose Your Natural Hair To Chemotherapy,"Dianne Shaddock Austin, ContributorNatural hair blogger and cancer survivor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/my-journey-back-from-hair-loss-losing-my-natural-hair_us_57b9c968e4b07d22cc388b33,"Just as the hair on my head started to grow back, I lost all of my lashes and eyebrows. Eyelash/brow hair loss is another",2016-08-21,My unstyled hair just a few days before my first chemotherapy treatment,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b9caa81700003600c747ed.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"My natural hair journey started four years ago. After several attempts to go natural and slipping back to the creamy crack, I finally took the plunge and stopped relaxing my hair. It was a decision made out of my sheer admiration for women who confidently wore their hair naturally kinky, curly. I wanted to duplicate the look. I loved the natural kinky, coily, curly hair that sisters were sporting, and I couldn’t stop that longing that I had to be natural too. I was the sister who always washed her hair after paying money to have it relaxed because it looked too straight and flat. Natural hair had texture, body and a personality that I wanted to duplicate with my own head of hair. After an awkward transition period, I took the plunge, did the big chop and never looked back. I loved all things related to natural hair and even started to blog on the topic.Then in 2015, I learned that I had breast cancer. My cancer had not spread and was highly treatable, but the recommended treatment would include chemotherapy and radiation. In my case, based on the type of chemo treatment that I would receive, I would lose every last strand of my naturally kinky, coily hair.I was thankful to be alive. I was thankful that my condition was treatable and hadn’t spread; yet I could not ignore the irony of the fact that I spent almost four years of growing out my coils only to lose every last strand of my hair because of the chemo that would be pumping through my veins obliterating any remaining cancer cells. I had no idea what to expect, so I started doing research online to learn more about other black women who have lost their hair because of chemotherapy. My doctor was helpful in his own way, but all he could say is that I would lose my hair and that it would grow back. There was very little information online that highlighted the experiences of black women with Afro-textured hair who have lost their hair through chemotherapy. Two weeks after my first chemo treatment, my hair started to fall out in clumps. Two days later, I was completely bald.I was able to learn quite a bit from the stories of white women who experienced chemotherapy related hair loss. Many women reported that their hair texture more often than not changed from straight before chemo to curly after chemo. The phenomenon is known as “chemo curls”. During the transition period between chemo induced hair loss and post chemo hair growth, women reported extreme hair color changes i.e. going from dark hair pre chemo to totally gray or starting as blondes and turning brunette as the hair began to grow in. Many revealed that these changes were permanent despite being several years post chemo. Others reported that their hair never grew back at all.I became nervous and wondered if my natural hair would grow back. My oncologist shared that my hair would start to grow 2 months after my last chemo treatment. Would my hair color or texture change? My hair was kinky/coily before chemo with clear signs of gray. According to the popular hair typing chart, my curl texture was a mix of primarily 4b with a sprinkling of 4a and 4c. Honestly, I just prayed that my hair would grow back – period.Literally two months to the day after my last chemotherapy treatment, I saw signs that my hair was starting to grow back! It was just peach fuzz for sure but it was a sign that it was growing. My hair color did not change.In February of 2016, two months later, real hair started to replace the peach fuzz. But this wasn’t “my” hair by a long shot - it was straight. I remember thinking once again about the irony of it all. ‘ I’m a natural hair blogger with straight hair’! The chemotherapy definitely affected my hair in ways that I had not anticipated.It’s now August - nine months after my last chemotherapy treatment and I’m happy to report that my hair continues to grow. I’m excited that my hair texture changed from straight to curly. But it still is not quite “my” hair. My hair texture in fact did change from its kinky, coily texture to a slightly curlier texture. It is actually several different textures ranging from curly to kinky: Curlier on the top and at the nape of my neck. Kinkier along the edges and in the back. My hair is not as thick as it was pre chemo although it looks as if it is for which I am grateful. It has only been a few months since my hair started growing in earnest so I’m anticipating that my hair will continue to evolve and possibly go back to its original texture and thickness. At this stage, I’m thankful that I’m healthy and that my hair actually grew back. I know that not everyone is as lucky. Just as the hair on my head started to grow back, I lost all of my lashes and eyebrows. Eyelash/brow hair loss is another side effect of the chemo process along with the loss of other body hair. According to my doctor, the lashes and brows often fall out several weeks after chemo. It is taking much longer for the lashes and brows to grow back but there are signs of growth.The goal of sharing my cancer hair loss journey, clearly a highly personal experience, is to help other black women who may be wondering what to expect from chemotherapy. Everyone’s experience is different but it helps to have a glimpse into another person’s journey. This post is part of HuffPost’s My Natural Hair Journey blog series. Embracing one’s natural hair — especially after years of heavily styling it — can be a truly liberating and exciting experience. It’s more than just a “trend.” It’s a way of life.

4,WEIRD NEWS,Massive Snakeskin Found Near River Where 10-Foot Snake Was Recently Spotted,Nina Golgowski,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/massive-snake-skin-found_us_57b9c71ae4b03d513688f41c,Locals worry it's the skin of the snake that got away. But one group of herpetologists says it's all a sham.,2016-08-21,"In this photo taken Monday, the skin is seen stretching about 12-feet in length. It's described as at least four-inches in diameter at its widest point.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57bb1c9e180000ad02bcc469.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"An elusive 10-foot-long snake dubbed “Wessie” is giving a Maine community the shakes for the second time in two months. But not everyone is convinced the creature is even real.Police announced that a 12-foot-long snakeskin was discovered near the Riverbank park in Westbrook, Maine, at about 3 p.m. on Saturday. Westbrook police told The Huffington Post Monday that at its widest, the skin is around 4 inches in diameter. Someone found it near a boat launch, authorities said.It is close to the area where, in June, two local officers reported seeing a roughly 10-foot-long snake eat a large mammal and swim away.The creature, which evaded capture, went on to supposedly brag about its life on the lam in a parody Twitter account.But because of a lack of photo evidence of the snake and the intact condition and curious placement of the skin in the police photo, some have suggested that it’s all a hoax.Westbrook Police Captain Sean Lally said that as of Monday morning the skin’s origin remains unknown.“It could’ve been planted but it would have to be (by) someone who owns a snake over 12’ long and that doesn’t account for the two sightings,” he told HuffPost by email. “The only way to definitively prove that there is a snake is to capture it. Otherwise, it’ll remain a myth and the myth is what makes it intriguing to people.”Lally said his department has sent a tissue sample and photos to a herpetologist to see if they can determine the species of snake. He’s not sure how long it will take to find out.Rob Christian, a herpetologist and the president of the Maine Herpetological Society in Millinocket, has reviewed the photo himself, however, and is confident that it was planted by someone.“Snakes don’t shed out in the open like that,” he told HuffPost Sunday. “Getting a full shed like that, even under ideal conditions, is really unusual.”Christian, who said he’s spoken with local police about the discovery, noted that when snakes shed their skin in the wild they rub up against rocks and rough vegetation to help peel away the old skin.“You’re going to find the snakeskin wrapped around branches,” he said. “You wouldn’t see a regular shed out in the open like that, especially a large snake like that.”He was also suspicious of the stretched-out placement of the skin.“Typically when you get a large snake, over four feet long, [the shed skin is] getting rolled up into a ball,” he said. “Most of the time what people will do is they’ll stretch it out and let it dry out.” That’s what he believes happened here.It’s not clear who took the photo ― the police or the person who found the skin ― or if the skin was moved or touched before the picture was taken. Police did not immediately respond to a request for comment.If this turns out to be a con, who would plant a snakeskin along the river? It could be a simple prank. But Christian and the herpetological society point to local animal rights activists who have been petitioning for stricter state rules for owning, breeding and selling animals.The new set of rules, which state wildlife officials approved Wednesday, crack down on illegal ownership in particular. The change caused some reptile collectors ― including researchers ― to fear that their animals would be banned or become harder to obtain, The Kennebec Journal reported.Christian believes “Wessie” popped up with curious timing, just as discussion and argument of these rules was getting heated. He feels the story may have encouraged people to vote a certain way out of fear, since the elusive snake was suspected to be someone’s illegal pet that either escaped or was set free. He added that the kind of snake that produced the skin is likely not venomous or dangerous to humans, however.Christian accused a local animal rights group, led by activist Kristina Snyder, of being behind the alleged plant. Snyder denied the claims to HuffPost. She said she has faced similar accusations from herpetologists since she helped push the legislation, but that her primary interest has always been in tightening laws that protect big cats, not snakes.“I didn’t ever think this would tie me to a snake story,” she said. “I don’t even know snake species so I don’t know what was found or seen.”Asked whether she was behind the snakeskin, she said: “I can give you a very emphatic absolutely not.”Hoax or not, police are asking park and river guests to “remain alert, maintain a safe distance from any wildlife, and report any sightings of the snake to the Westbrook Police Department,” they said in their Facebook post.This story has been updated to include Lally’s interview and a response from Snyder."

A cause of death was not listed on the bureau’s website but, according to TMZ, Pearlman died from “an ongoing cardiac problem.” The celebrity news site states the official cause of death is listed as natural causes. TMZ notes the producer died Friday at a hospital in Miami, before he was scheduled to have surgery. He was reportedly transferred to the hospital from prison, where he was serving a 25-year sentence. Pearlman, who earned the nickname “Big Poppa,” was one of the most successful producers of the 1990s, known for creating bands such as The Backstreet Boys, *NSYNC, LFO and O-Town. Pearlman managed the bands under his own record label, Trans Continental Records. In 1998, Pearlman’s business practices came into question when the Backstreet Boys filed a lawsuit against the producer over an unfair contract. People reports that, according to court documents, the band claims to have received just $300,000 while Pearlman somehow earned millions. *NSYNC filed their own lawsuit against Pearlman in 1999, after dealing with similar monetary issues, and in 2002, Aaron Carter also sued the producer. In 2006, it was discovered that Pearlman’s crooked money dealings went beyond his boyband empire. Investigators learned that Pearlman had been part of a massive Ponzi scheme and had swindled investors out of more than $300 million.In 2008, he was convicted of fraud, money laundering and conspiracy. He pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison. The judge told Pearlman he could reduce his sentence if he repaid the people he cheated, but he never paid, People reports. Pearlman was also plagued by allegations of molestation, after accusations were published in a 2007 Vanity Fair article titled “Mad About The Boys.”In 2014, Lance Bass told The Hollywood Reporter that he would “hear things” about Pearlman.“He would always have young boy limo drivers for Trans Continental Records; those limo drivers would always be put into different boy bands,” he said. “I’d hear rumors that he would molest the boys before they would even get into the groups. I don’t know how much of that is true, but to me, where there’s smoke, there’s fire.”Upon hearing the news of Pearlman’s death on the weekend, *NSYNC members Bass, Justin Timberlake and Chris Kirkpatrick paid their respects on Twitter. “He might not have been a stand up businessman, but I wouldn’t be doing what I love today wout his influence,” Bass wrote. This post has been updated to include information about Pearlman’s cause of death. "

It's always embarrassing. Embarrassing for me, that is. Normally, I'm the too cynical, too loud mom, who curses too much. But on the first day of school my internal chant of ""You are not going to cry"" starts before we are even into the car. There is no precedent to excuse this. Nothing particularly horrible has ever happened on a first day of school. It just turns me into emo-mom extraordinaire.And this year was worse. Not only was it my oldest son's first day of middle school, but I wasn't going to be there. I had back surgery a couple of weeks ago (I'm going to be fine), and I am not yet supposed to do things as exciting as leaving the house for major emotional events. This was the first year I was going to miss. It sucked. For me. My son was totally cool about it and absolutely blase about my inner turmoil.All day I waited. And I worried. And scenes of bullies in John Hughes movies kept scrolling through my head, and I just knew there was some barely pubescent little hellion who would be totally deserving of my wrath before the day was out. It didn't matter how carefully we had picked his school as somewhere that would embrace and celebrate who my kid is, the awful scenes of bathroom swirlies and kids being bashed against lockers kept rolling. And by 3pm, I was mess.Instead, that afternoon my kid burst into the house, all smiles and said, ""I made a transgender friend today! She has other gay friends!"" He was bouncing. My oldest son is gay, and the idea of having other gay kids in his classroom for the first time (there were no other out gay kids in his elementary school) was what made him really look forward to middle school. My son went on to tell me that his new friend's parents want her to be a boy and not a girl. ""So I told her my parent's will like her a lot."" I leaned over and kissed his forehead and both of his cheeks. ""I am sure we will, baby.""""Mom!"" he swatted my hands away. ""Just stop.""(I am going to stop here and take a moment. I don't have a trans kid. My gay kid is about as gender conforming as you can get. I have no experience having a transgender or gender nonconforming child. But if you are a parent with transgender or genderqueer kid, it's time to get with the program. Your kid needs you to love who they are, and not who you think they should be.)I really wish I had been a fly on the wall at the school that day, but instead I just tried to get the story out of my son of how this conversation had transpired. I just couldn't imagine some 11-year-old transgender girl announcing her gender identity to my kid out of the blue.So from the details I can piece together from my 11-year-old (who thinks his mother is ridiculous) here's what happened:My son was lost and couldn't find his next class, so he found someone who looked like they were lost too. He walked up to this other student and said, ""Hey guy, what's up?""The other student said, ""I'm not a guy. I'm a girl.""""Oh,"" said my kid. ""Hey girl, what's up? Are you transgender?"" The girl looked at him for a minute and then nodded. ""That's cool,"" he continued. ""I'm not transgender, but I'm gay.""""That's cool,"" she said back. ""I have some gay friends who go here too."" My son was very excited to hear this. It turns out they were both lost and looking for the same classroom.Then they walked past the bathrooms, and the girl explained she needed to go, but wanted to go into the girls' room because that was her real bathroom. My son said he would stand outside the door while she was inside and wait until she was done, and then they could find their class together.After that was completed, they continued through the halls and she asked him how his parents felt about him being gay. He just shrugged. ""It's fine. We know a lot of gay people. A lot."" She told him about her parents, and things went from there.They found their classroom, and afterwards promised they would find each other the next day.And now I feel like my kid really is in some 80s movie, but the 2016 version. Because come on!? For real? I am 40 years old, and the idea of two lgbt kids just happening to randomly find each other both looking for the same class just seems too perfect a set up, too unreal. If I watched a movie or a TV show where a conversation like that happened, I would probably roll my eyes at the too-perfectness, the fakeness, of it all. But it did happen, and it made my kid's first day of middle school awesome.So, maybe it is time to put emo-mom away for awhile, and just let his life happen. Because we are in a new age, a new world, a new reality. Will there be assholes and homophobes? Yes, always. But there will also be two LGBTQ kids who find each other randomly walking down the hall. And that is pretty fantastic."

It is quite simple: refuse to answer for whom they are going to pull the lever for president. That way, they believe, they will not alienate the Trumpistas, while also not attaching themselves to him.But, Meet the Press's Chuck Todd is not going to let them get away with it. He set his baseline standard in 2014 during the race for the Senate in Kentucky. In the debate between Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes (D-KY) and Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Grimes said her vote for president in 2012 was private and personal, and did not disclose for whom she voted.That was too much for Todd. It was fine, for example, for McConnell to have lied flat-out to more than a half-million Kentuckians about the fate of their healthcare if McConnell were elected, and did the bidding of his paymasters to take it away. McConnell had just claimed that the state exchange, KyNect, was ""only a website."" That was non-disqualifying.But, it was disqualifying to Todd for Grimes not to disclose for whom she had voted for president.Well, OK. Each of us has standards, this is Todd's. Indeed, when challenged on it, he doubled-down.  It was clearly his moral Rubicon, forcing him to shed his 'honest broker' role and to reveal his judgment.Now, two years later, Todd will have to apply this standard to nearly every Republican running for the House or Senate. Their strategy of refusing to disclose will run into Todd's buzzsaw. Nor will it be sufficient to state they are not voting for Trump. They will have to say for whom they are voting. Otherwise, Chuck Todd will state unequivocally that they are 'disqualified'. And, he will repeat it. He has no choice. It may or may not sway many elections. But, Meet the Press is the longest running Sunday gab show. Some swing voters may take some cues from his insistence that they are disqualified."

It's my first baby's first time being gone all day, away from me, with other people for more of her awake hours than in my care. It's her first time experiencing so many of the many interactions with other people, both wonderful and awful, that are inevitable parts of life. I know that my job as a parent is to help her as she experiences these things, not to shield her. Yet I am her shield, because although she's getting ""big,"" she's still so small.And she's nervous. I was surprised when she told me so. She told me she was scared, and it made me sad because I had no idea. We talked about what she was nervous about. I tried to both soothe her, as well as let her know she can always talk to me, even when I can't ""fix"" it. She's nervous, so I paint on my smile. Some mornings, mascara helps because it makes me not want to cry. But I do show her my feelings. I'm not completely false and inhibited in offering her my own strong emotions about her going to full-day school for the first time, but I am the grown-up. She needs me to be strong. She needs to know that part of being strong is sometimes crying and feeling sad, but she also needs to see my happiness, and the excited anticipation I have for all that lies ahead for her this coming year.Because the truth is that while I am sad, I'm also ecstatic. I know she'll love school. I know we'll miss each other. I know it will be both. I know we'll both adjust, because that's what people, and especially children, do. I know we'll have new things to look forward to, like the coveted after school snack. I know that from here on out our life is different. It's changing. It's evolving. Life does this, whether we fight it or embrace it -- it moves and shifts.But I can't help noticing that lately I find myself just looking at her; just looking at the way the dimple in her chin becomes deeper when she throws her head back and laughs with her baby sister. I find myself frequently plopping onto the middle of the carpet more and more often, with my daughter asking, ""What are you doing, Mommy?"" and me answering, ""Just sitting here,"" as I pull her and her little sister into my lap to read.I'm finding how true it is that laundry, and dishes, and phone calls and nearly everything can wait, at least for a few minutes, at least for one book. I'm already discovering how I wish I could go back in time and stop what I was doing when she asked me to play dolls more often than I probably did. And I know this transition will be even harder for this little sister left at home than it will be for me, so these smiles and cuddles of mine are for her, too.I'm putting on a brave face, but my face crumples and leaks tears more often than I wish it did. I'm putting on a brave face, and I'm smiling at tiny things I might not have noticed so easily just last year when kindergarten seemed a world away.I'm putting on a brave face even though I know I'll smile and wave to her as the school bus leaves our driveway, and that then, after it's out of sight, I'll silently sob as I walk back up the front steps.I'm putting on a brave face, and I'll be doing it all over again in a few years for this little sister. I'll be doing it again for high school, and college, and for so many things that right now seem that world away.But, for right now, I have an almost kindergartner, a toddler still home with me, and the clarity and gratitude to stop and simply appreciate it."

In particular, Russia is reportedly making various efforts to vitalize its economy by luring Chinese tourists, commonly known as youker. According to the August 21st report of Cankao Xiaoxi, a Chinese daily newspaper published by the Xinhua News Agency, Russia's such move seems not irrelevant with China's troubled relationship with its neighbor countries. As Chinese authorities seem to be deliberately regulating Chinese citizens' trips to these countries, Russia is naturally benefiting from this and trying to cash in on this positive trend. [Chinese tourists in front of the Kremlin Palace in Moscow, Russia./ Source: Search engine Baidu]What Russia is currently doing to attract Chinese tourists is quite simple. Moscow started to expand transportation infrastructure and the number of hotel rooms near Vladivostok, one of the most popular destinations among Chinese travelers. Russia has also introduced a visa-free regime for Chinese tour groups.Russia will obviously make microscopic efforts in the future. Russia is expected to promote Chinese interpreter training program and seek to develop tailor-made packages for Chinese tourists. Ultimately, Russia plans to establish Chinatown and special tour program for China tour groups. If this is the case, China and Russia could rapidly increase various kinds of economic interchange as well as joint projects between companies from the two countries. Of course, there are pessimistic observations as well. Such observation is not an exaggeration considering the fact that Russia possess weak soft power and it's not a country that manufactures world hit goods preferred by Chinese. Besides, many Chinese tend to worry about the safety of traveling in Russia. Nevertheless, Russian tourism players are likely to make active efforts for a while. Korea, whose relationship with China remains uncomfortable after its decision to deploy THAAD in Korea, should not remain a mere spectator."
17,POLITICS,Jerry Falwell Jr. Seriously Compared Trump To Winston Churchill,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jerry-falwell-donald-trump-winston-churchill_us_57b8a976e4b0b51733a3cffe,The scramble to boost Trump's losing campaign is getting desperate.,2016-08-20,"Jerry Falwell Jr. introduces Donald Trump at a rally in January at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b8ab7d1800002100bcc091.jpeg?cache=2IJEB18DtW&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Campaign leadership shakeup? Check.Sort-of apology? Check.Offensive outreach speech aimed at African-Americans and delivered to a white audience? Check.The struggling presidential campaign of Donald Trump has tried many things in recent days to revive the GOP nominee’s dimming chances against Hillary Clinton.Now, we can add a prominent surrogate’s comparison of Trump to legendary British prime minister Winston Churchill to the growing list of Hail Mary passes by the campaign and its allies.“We need a leader with qualities that resemble those of Winston Churchill, and I believe that leader is Donald Trump,” evangelical Christian leader Jerry Falwell Jr. wrote in an op-ed in The Washington Post on Friday. “As Churchill did, Trump possesses the resolve to put his country first and to never give up in a world that is increasingly hostile to our values.”The analogy to Churchill comes not from anything Trump has done yet, but from the strength with which Falwell believes Trump will confront the global jihadist terror threat, just as Churchill stood up to the Nazis.Falwell, president of Liberty University, a conservative Christian institution in Virginia, was an early endorser of Trump. In the aftermath of the terror attack in San Bernardino, California, in December, Falwell said that if more people carried guns, “we could end those Muslims.” (Falwell later clarified that he meant Muslims who carry out acts of terror, rather than all Muslims.)In other ways, Falwell’s Washington Post op-ed reads more like a typical conservative indictment of Democratic foreign policy. Just as Trump is the “Churchillian leader we need,” in Falwell’s telling, President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Clinton are, conversely, the “Neville Chamberlains of our time” for brokering a deal with Iran to eliminate its nuclear weapons program. (Chamberlain was Churchill’s immediate predecessor, best known for trying to appease German dictator Adolf Hitler with the cession of a portion of Czechoslovakia.)Many conservatives have called the Obama administration’s Iran accord a foolhardy, Chamberlain-esque deal with the devil. The White House, nonproliferation experts and even many top Israeli security officials argue that while it is imperfect, it is the best shot at preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.But Falwell clings to the hardline conservative myth that Republican leaders in Congress could have done more to stop Obama’s foreign policy. “All of this was enabled by a feckless establishment Republican Congress,” he wrote.In fact, congressional Republicans are limited in their ability to obstruct Obama by the Constitution’s separation of powers. They are able to hold up legislation related to domestic policy proposed by the president, but as commander in chief, he can negotiate certain foreign agreements and prosecute counter-terrorism efforts as he sees fit.In his Friday op-ed, Falwell also urged conservatives to vote for Trump out of concern for the liberal Supreme Court justices Clinton would get to appoint.“If Clinton appoints the next few Supreme Court justices, not only will the Second Amendment right to bear arms be effectively lost, but also activist judges will rewrite our Constitution in ways that would make it unrecognizable to our founders,” he wrote.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
18,POLITICS,Why Progressives Are Cautiously Optimistic About Hillary Clinton,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-progressives-cautiously-optimistic-hillary-clinton_us_57b7951de4b0b51733a3a699,The Bernie Sanders wing insists the momentum is on its side -- and they will fight to keep it that way.,2016-08-20,Progressives wonder whether Hillary Clinton's embrace of independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' more populist policies will last once she takes office.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b7975e170000ae02c74572.jpeg?cache=JyNY2GGJQb&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Courting Republicans turned off by Donald Trump is an increasingly prominent part of Hillary Clinton’s general election strategy.That has some progressives nervous that Clinton will take them for granted once in office, making their policy priorities disposable as well.Many other veteran liberal insiders and activists, however, are unfazed by Clinton’s electoral strategy and bullish about her presidency. They believe that the candidacy of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) helped solidify a leftward shift in the party’s center of gravity that Clinton recognizes.And while these progressives claim to hold no illusions about Clinton’s personal views or ties to special interests, they have more confidence in their ability to exert pressure on Clinton and other party leaders than they had even four years ago.The argument for progressive skepticism was laid out by former Sanders supporters like economist Robert Reich and ex-NAACP head Benjamin Jealous in a recent New York Times story.In a race against Trump, Clinton’s ideology and agenda matter far less than her non-Trumpness ― or ability to meet a basic threshold of responsibility and sound temperament, according to the skeptics. Clinton, in turn, can make the case for her candidacy based less on progressive policies she would pass than a better-than-him personality argument, weakening her mandate to govern liberally, the Times’ interviewees fear.Other observers ask a separate, but related question: If Clinton is courting Mitt Romney voters, neoconservative thought leaders and Bernie Sanders supporters alike, whose core interests will she fight for once in office? She cannot please all of them at once, and with progressives lacking an alternative in the two-party system, she is more likely to view their priorities as expendable, the theory goes.Progressive optimists respond by noting that Clinton has not actually compromised her domestic policy platform to appeal to these “swing” voters. She still supports expanding Social Security, a public health insurance option, debt-free college and raising the federal minimum wage to at least $12. Most crucially of all, Clinton’s opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the massive trade accord negotiated by President Barack Obama, has only grown stronger over time. She now promises to oppose it before the election, after the election ― a tacit reference to the lame-duck session of Congress ― and as president.The Democratic nominee is not coy about mentioning these plans on the campaign trail. Clinton put them at the center of her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in July, as well as in a key economic policy address in Michigan last week.Progressives observers say Clinton’s shift reflects that of Democratic rank-and-file voters embracing populist economic policies. The electorate is younger, more diverse and decidedly more liberal.And if Clinton had not reconciled herself to that before, then she certainly has after Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, won over 43 percent of the popular vote in the Democratic presidential primary. The only Democrat to rival Sanders in popularity is Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), an irrepressible foe of Wall Street.“The Democratic Party is not the same party it was eight years ago, let alone 20 years ago when Clinton was in the White House with her husband,” said Richard Yeselson, a contributing editor at Dissent magazine and former strategic researcher for multiple labor unions. “It’s better than it was for the left right now. And she saw it, she is no idiot.”But to quote Elizabeth Warren, “personnel is policy.” And one of Clinton’s first hires, the appointment of former Interior Secretary and Democratic Colorado Sen. Ken Salazar, as her transition chair, has spooked these same progressives. Salazar, now a lobbyist at Wilmer Hale, a powerful Washington law firm, is a staunch advocate of fracking and the Trans-Pacific Partnership ― twin progressive bugaboos ― with big business ties to match.Progressives now fear Clinton is already repeating some of the Obama administration’s worst missteps. While liberals were basking in the historic glow of Obama’s presidency, Obama was appointing Department of Justice officials who would fail to indict any senior Wall Street executive for fraud in the wake of the financial crisis. He also allowed a top housing official left over from the Bush administration to hold up much-needed relief for distressed homeowners.Progressive optimists promise they have learned from their own mistakes during the early years of the Obama administration, when they believe they were too acquiescent to the Democratic president.“We recognize that that was some of our failure from 2008 and 2009,” said Shane Larson, legislative director of the Communications Workers of America, one of the few labor unions to back Sanders during the primary. “A lot of progressives sat back and waited for the manna to fall from heaven, not recognizing that the other side’s forces, the corporate side, are always mobilizing and have their tentacles everywhere.”Warren was also not yet a senator when Obama took office, depriving her of the platform in the media that she has used so effectively. One can easily imagine Warren, a higher-profile Sanders and allies like Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) taking their case to cable TV if a Clinton appointment is not to their liking. “Clinton does not want to see multiple Antonio Weiss-style fights,” a senior aide to a progressive House Democrat said, referring to an Obama nominee for a top Treasury post. Weiss withdrew himself from consideration after Warren launched a public campaign against him. As a banker, Weiss had worked at a firm that specialized in tax inversion, a technicality through which companies reincorporate overseas to avoid U.S. corporate taxes. (Obama has since named Weiss to a role that did not require Senate confirmation, where he supervises White House policy for the Puerto Rican debt crisis.)A key test for Clinton will be whether she re-nominates to the Supreme Court Merrick Garland, Obama’s centrist nominee who is stuck in limbo due to Republicans’ refusal to grant him nomination hearings.The aide to a progressive house Democrat said Clinton is “even cool on Senate Democrats’ push to get her to renominate Garland,” indicating she is acutely aware of progressive trepidation about Garland.The greatest hope of business-friendly Democratic groups may lie in Congress, where the party’s gains are likely to be limited enough to circumscribe the power of the Sanders-Warren wing. Even if Democrats retake the Senate, which looks eminently possible today, little of Clinton’s agenda will be achievable without control of the House, a prospect that remains all but impossible.Jim Kessler, senior vice president for policy at Third Way, one such business-friendly Democratic group, told HuffPost in an April interview that divided government will give new attention to the kinds of policies his organization prefers.“If we want things to get done, we will have to find ways to get progressive policy ideas through but understand we need to get votes from the center and from the right,” he said.Of course, foreign policy is a different story entirely. It is both an area where progressive suspicion of Clinton is greatest thanks to her support for the Iraq War and Libya intervention, and one where progressives have the least leverage. The president is, after all, the commander in chief and requires far less approval from Congress to make pivotal decisions in the international arena.“There is much less scrutiny on foreign policy appointments,” the senior House aide concluded. “The left is not well-organized on that issue, Bernie didn’t talk about it, there aren’t big left-flank pressure groups on foreign policy the way there are for domestic matters.” "
19,POLITICS,U.S. Olympians Make Their Case For Preserving Public Lands,Kate Sheppard,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/olympic-athletes-public-lands_us_57b77b93e4b0b51733a3911a,World-class athletes train in these open spaces.,2016-08-20,Triathlete Katie Zaferes trains on public lands in California and Colorado.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b77c5a1700001108c74530.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Olympians who train on U.S. public lands are speaking out on why they want and need these open spaces preserved. The initiative, dubbed Olympians for Public Lands, came together in response to athletes’ concerns about a rising political threat to federally protected lands.“As an Olympic athlete and an American, I feel passionately about preserving the integrity of public lands,” wrote pentathlete Margaux Isaksen in the Colorado Springs Gazette on Aug. 9, before her event began.Isakson finished fourth in the London Games in 2012 and also competed in Beijing in 2008. With her appearance in the Rio Olympics, she became the first American woman to compete in three Olympic pentathlons. Isakson’s childhood on a farm in northwest Arkansas near the Ozark National Forest shaped her love for public lands. “As kids, we ran all the trails and swam in all of the protected streams and rivers,” she wrote. “Growing up next to the Ozark National Forest shaped me as an athlete and pushed me to become an Olympian.”Katie Zaferes, a triathlete competing in Rio, said it was the opposite experience that inspired her. “I grew up in Maryland, in a community that lacked access to public land. As a teenager, I ran on roads without shoulders and swam largely in pools,” she wrote in the Santa Cruz Sentinel on Aug. 13. “Now I have the opportunity to train in these larger-than-life landscapes that afford me the luxury to run on miles of single track and swim in pristine bodies of water.”“As an athlete and as someone who is lucky enough to spend much of life in public lands, I urge others to add their voice in support for public lands. They create not just Olympians but also communities,” wrote Zaferes, who will compete in the triathlon final on Saturday.In recent years, some congressional Republicans have sought to limit protections for public lands, even proposing to sell off some areas. The 2016 Republican Party platform calls for turning over certain federally protected lands to state control.That’s why Olympians for Public Lands, with support from public lands advocates in Washington, seeks to seize this moment of public attention. Melissa Schwartz, a consultant working with the initiative, said it is “an effort to give Olympians a voice in the ongoing discussion about the value of public lands as a small community in Congress attempts to undermine protections.”Other Rio Olympians also plan to post their views, Schwartz said, including archers, runners, bikers, rowers and canoeists."

Once Americans grasp that, the voters will start looking elsewhere.“I predict that this will burn out, the Trump strongman promise of a savior will fail, and adherents will come to the realization that he is a false savior,” said former Rep. Bob Inglis (R-S.C.), who lost his re-election bid in 2010 after he embraced the truth of climate change.“They’ll be looking for, I hope, a more serious conversation after that,” Inglis said.Hillary Clinton’s emails? They’re a sideshow. Trump’s bankruptcies? Immaterial. Democrat or Republican? Also, mostly irrelevant. Too much attention focuses on the presidential race as entertainment and sport.“It’s the horse-race politics, and it’s not the policy. It’s politics and personality,” said Krist Novoselic, the Nirvana and sometimes Foo Fighters bassist, who spends much of his time these days reading legal decisions and policy papers, as well as pushing his own voter system reforms.The three issues that Inglis, Novoselic and former Rep. Brian Baird (D-Wash.) think really matter are climate change, the federal debt and a dysfunctional political system corrupted by money.These are the three questions:“What specific actions will you take, and what will you ask the American people to do to reverse global climate change and ocean acidification?”“What specific actions will you take, and what will you ask the American people to do to fix the growing debt of the United States?”“What specific actions will you take during your campaign and your time in office, and what will you ask the American people to do to help restore the respect and confidence of the American people in their elected government?” There is no one correct answer to each question. The idea is to force politicians to provide thoughtful answers ― and to make them prove they’re not pandering by also laying out the sacrifices the voters will need to make.“No candidate should get away with these really facile platitudes of ‘Oh, I’ll fix it, believe me, I’ll fix it.’ Tell me how,” said Baird, who is the primary force behind the initiative.To finance it, Baird has tapped the few hundred thousand dollars he had left in his campaign coffers when he decided not to seek re-election in 2010. He started with a social media campaign in New Hampshire, a state that is politically savvy but that receives little attention after the presidential primaries move on.This year there’s also a bellwether Senate contest in New Hampshire, featuring Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte and Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan. Baird’s social media effort is pushing voters to call on both candidates to answer the three questions.It’s not entirely clear how successful he has been, but The Huffington Post reached out to the candidates’ campaigns to see if the main points were at least on their radar. For the most part, they are in the Granite State.Hassan’s campaign pointed to positions she has on climate change, debt and reforming the political system. Similarly, Ayotte’s campaign pointed to her stances on the environment and debt, although it did not have much to say about government dysfunction and money in politics.Inglis suggested that embracing all three questions could be a way for Ayotte — or any other Republican — to inoculate herself against Trump’s downward pull on the polls.“This one, I hope, has the DNA of if you’re someone as good as Kelly Ayotte, you’re sort of welcoming the questions — yeah, let’s talk about that,” Inglis said. “The first two really set up the third. If you’re going to talk to people straight about the deficit, if you are going to talk to people straight about climate change, then you are restoring faith in the process.”And doing that tells voters you’re no Donald Trump ― even if, like Ayotte, you plan to vote for him.“We’re calling on candidates to be responsible,” Novoselic said, “and we’re calling on voters to hold the candidates responsible.”None of the three men see their project as a magical cure for political dysfunction, but they hope it’s something that will gain traction and recognition. Baird has even come up with a hand symbol for the three questions that looks a lot like an OK sign.“Gradually, the ship turns. Gradually, voters are going to say, ‘Wait a second, he may be entertaining, he may be funny, he may tap into my anger, but that’s not going to solve the problem,’” said Baird.“We have to do two things: tap into younger people who say, ‘That’s my future on the line,’ and [reach] adults, grownups, who say, ‘I don’t want to leave an overheating planet, I don’t want to leave a crushing debt, and I won’t vote for somebody who won’t say what they’re going to do about it. Period,’” Baird said.None of that is to suggest that prying people away from Trump will be easy because millions are drawn to him for misguided reasons, said Inglis.“Challenges are globalization, automation, the decline of the suburbs, and the basic cultural change — that’s what has people upset,” Inglis said. “And add the subtext of all that is the loss of the prerogative of defining normality. Particularly if you’re a white male, you’ve had the prerogative of defining normality.”He also admits that instead of letting go of the angry rhetoric, former Trump supporters might grow even angrier at losing the promise of salvation.“What happens once your savior is found out to be a false savior? Do you then look for an adult in the room? Or do you leave the room? Or do you burn down the room?” Inglis said. “And that’s an open question, really, about what happens once people are disappointed in this showman-strongman.”Novoselic hopes their project at least offers people a way to step back, reflect and maybe take a more constructive approach.“You do what you can do. You hug your wife. You can’t crusade — there’s enough of that, people just crusading,” Novoselic said. “You just do what you do and say, ‘Hey, everybody, here it is. There’s just three questions.’”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Or do you burn down the room?” Inglis said. “And that’s an open question, really, about what happens once people are disappointed in this showman-strongman.”Novoselic hopes their project at least offers people a way to step back, reflect and maybe take a more constructive approach.“You do what you can do. You hug your wife. You can’t crusade — there’s enough of that, people just crusading,” Novoselic said. “You just do what you do and say, ‘Hey, everybody, here it is. There’s just three questions.’”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
22,POLITICS,Donald Trump's Campaign Manager Rose Quickly By Playing To His Ego,"Christina Wilkie, Elise Foley, and Ryan Grim",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-campaign-manager-kellyanne-conway_us_57b75ad1e4b0b51733a372bc,"Kellyanne Conway is ""telling Trump what he wants to hear,"" a source said.",2016-08-20,Donald Trump promoted Kellyanne Conway to campaign manager on August 17. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There’s a secret to newly appointed campaign manager Kellyanne Conway’s success with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump: she knows how to play to his ego. The notoriously thin-skinned businessman promoted Conway over fellow campaign pollster Tony Fabrizio, in part, because he didn’t like it when Fabrizio told him about his poor poll numbers and how he needed to do better, a source close to the campaign told The Huffington Post. Conway is better at massaging the truth ― she tells him that there are hidden Trump voters lurking in swing states, the source said ― and her words.“Kelly’s telling Trump what he wants to hear,” the source said. “She has a whole vocabulary of diplomatic words. That’s the kind of woman he likes around, who can tell him the soft way ― encourage him, guide him but not criticize him,” said a second source close to Trump.The Republican pollster doesn’t tell Trump not to say something, she says it would be “unpleasant” or “awkward,” the second source said. She doesn’t say something Trump wants to say is a lie, she says it’s “open to so many interpretations, I want to tighten it up so there’s no room for misinterpretations,” the second source said. “She’s a genius,” the second source close to Trump told HuffPost. “I get much further telling people what they want to hear. That’s a good way to handle Donald, you reinforce what he wants to do. She is so diplomatic it’s unbelievable.”But diplomacy, while a useful trait in politics, can be disastrous for a campaign pollster. They are often the campaign’s truth-teller, the one person who will tell the candidate when he or she is failing to connect with voters and should switch tactics. So while an impossibly cheerful spokesperson can help a campaign thrive, an impossibly cheerful pollster presents a unique danger to the candidate. Going forward, however, Conway will do more than interpret public opinion for Trump. She will help the candidate craft messages designed to appeal to women and independent voters, two groups without which Trump has little chance at making it to the White House.Neither Conway nor Trump campaign spokeswomen responded to a request for comment.Conway has experience working for male politicians who put their feet in their mouths ― she previously worked for failed Senate candidate Todd Akin, a Republican who infamously said that women could not get pregnant from rape if it was a “legitimate rape.”“She’s used to dealing with certifiable people ... as long as you follow the crazy rules you can get along perfectly,” the second source said.She has also worked for former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and ran a super PAC aligned with former Trump presidential opponent Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). Conservative donors Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah Mercer financed the super PAC. They reportedly also helped with Conway’s ascension within the Trump campaign. Trump hired Conway in July as a polling strategist, set to work with Fabrizio and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who resigned on Friday. She was hired after a June meeting with Rebekah Mercer, who also had a six-figure check, according to the first source. The campaign is now “Mercer central,” the source said. Conway is known for advising politicians on how to win over women voters, and has said she does not like Trump’s name-calling.She laid out her strategy with Trump to The Washington Post in July: to present options, not commands, lest she insult him. She offered an example of the method by talking about convincing her 11-year-old daughter to change from a turquoise outfit to an American flag shade of blue by presenting her with three alternative outfits. Apparently she takes the same tack with her 70-year-old boss.

The person, who said he was an associate of Manafort and who gave his name only as David, referred queries to a lawyer in Washington, who did not immediately respond to a phone call and an email.In response to a report in the New York Times on Monday, Manafort denied any impropriety in a statement. “I have never received a single ‘off-the-books cash payment’ as falsely ‘reported’ by The New York Times, nor have I ever done work for the governments of Ukraine or Russia,” he said.The New York Times reported that he had received cash payments worth more than $12 million over five years that were itemized on secret ledgers belonging to Yanukovich’s Party of Regions.Manafort, who resigned as chairman of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s campaign on Friday, had not been the focus of the probe, CNN said, citing the officials.The probe was looking at the work of other firms linked to the former Ukrainian government, including the Podesta Group, a lobbying and public relations company headed by Tony Podesta, whose brother John Podesta is chairman of the campaign to elect Democratic Party presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.Manafort’s attorney Richard Hibey did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The FBI declined to comment, CNN reported.The Podesta Group has hired an independent legal firm to investigate whether it had been misled by the Centre for a Modern Ukraine, a not-for-profit group linked to the ousted Ukrainian government, a spokeswoman for the group said in a statement.The Justice Department, asked to comment on the report, said it remained “committed to helping recover stolen assets on behalf of the people of Ukraine.”Investigators in Ukraine have said Yanukovych and his party engaged in widespread corruption.

25,SPORTS,Ryan Lochte Admits He 'Over-Exaggerated' Rio Robbery Story,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ryan-lochte-robbery-exaggerated_us_57b8cf31e4b03d513688d013,The gold-medal Olympic swimmer has been accused of fabricating an account of being robbed at gunpoint.,2016-08-20,U.S. Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte faces criticism -- and potential criminal charges in Brazil -- for falsely reporting a crime in Rio de Janeiro.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b8d8b21700001108c74736.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Ryan Lochte on Saturday said he exaggerated a story about being robbed at gunpoint in Rio de Janeiro, speaking in his first televised interview since large portions of his initial account were debunked.“I over-exaggerated that story and if I never did that we wouldn’t be in this mess,” a newly brown-haired Lochte told Matt Lauer, a co-anchor of NBC’s “Today Show.” “It was my immature behavior.”Excerpts of the interview aired during “NBC Nightly News” on Saturday evening and then later in the evening during the network’s Olympics coverage, but the full interview will appear Monday morning on the “Today Show.” In a longer excerpt of the Lauer interview released later on Saturday, Lochte apologized profusely to the three swimmers out with him that night for returning to the United States and leaving them to face the consequences for his actions.“I let my team down,” Lochte said. “I wanted to be there.”He went on to extend his apologies to spectators, as well as his fellow U.S. swimmers and all athletes competing in the games for drawing attention away from their accomplishments.“I made a mistake and I definitely learned from this,” Lochte said, fighting back tears. “I’m just really sorry.”In addition, Lochte said he was “really sorry” to the Olympic Games’ host city and country for tarnishing their reputation with a story that conjured up hurtful stereotypes.“The people of Rio, of Brazil, the authorities, everyone there, they put on a great games,” he said. Asked why he made up aspects of the story in the first place, Lochte suggested he had still been feeling the effects of alcohol from the night before.“I don’t know why,” Lochte said. “It was still hours after it happened and I was still intoxicated. I was still under that influence.”But, he added, “I’m not making me being intoxicated like an excuse ― I’m not doing that at all. It was my fault.”The remarks are Lochte’s frankest admission yet that he essentially fabricated a story about paying for vandalizing a gas station last weekend after first saying he was robbed at gunpoint. An apology posted to Twitter on Friday conceded that he was not as “candid” as he could have been about what occurred, but stopped short of a clearer adoption of responsibility.The incident has angered many Brazilians sensitive to their country’s reputation for crime and created an international embarrassment for the United States that could yet upend Lochte’s swimming career.Brazilian authorities recommended on Friday that Lochte and fellow swimmer James Feigen face charges of false reporting of a crime.The Olympic host country’s law enforcement claims that Lochte and three teammates vandalized a bathroom at a gas station and fought with a security guard. The players, including Lochte, have admitted that they paid security guards for the damage. The gas station owner told a Brazilian news outlet that at least one of the swimmers urinated on a wall. Swimmer Gunnar Bentz later said they all did. (Bentz released a lengthy statement claiming that Lochte had pulled a sign from a wall near the bathroom and yelled at the security guards once their guns were out.) Video from the gas station released by Brazilian authorities indeed appears to show the athletes exhibiting boorish, drunken behavior.Lochte’s original account of the incident cast him as something of a hero. The 32-year-old told NBC’s Billy Bush last Sunday that he and teammates Bentz, Feigen and Jack Conger were robbed at gunpoint early Sunday morning on their way to their Olympic village lodgings from a night out.Lochte even claimed to have confronted the gunman and refused to get down on the ground while the man held a gun to his head. This initial account claimed he was forced to hand over his money and wallet but not other valuables.The swimmer, beloved as a colorful runner-up to superstar Michael Phelps, then changed his story in a Wednesday interview with Lauer, clarifying, among other things, that the gun was not at his head but pointed in his general direction.Brazilian officials suspicious of Lochte’s account pulled Bentz and Conger from their return flight to the U.S. on Wednesday for questioning. A Brazilian judge also ordered police to seize Lochte and Feigen’s passports so they could be questioned, but Lochte had already returned to the U.S. on a commercial flight.Feigen has since agreed to give $11,000 to a Brazilian charity in order to retrieve his passport.Lochte apologized for his behavior in a statement posted to Twitter on Friday without explicitly admitting to fabricating the details of what occurred.“I want to apologize for my behavior last weekend ― for not being more careful and candid in how I described the events of that early morning and for my role in taking the focus away from the many athletes fulfilling their dreams of participating in the Olympics,” Lochte said.In the Saturday interview with Lauer, however, Lochte maintained that the gas station guards’ drawn guns made the event confusing and scary. He was not completely certain at the time, he claims, that the money they were being asked to hand over was for the damage they had caused through their drunken antics.“We just wanted to get out of there,” he said. “There was a gun pointed in our direction. We were all frightened.”This story has been updated to include comments Ryan Lochte made in an excerpt of his interview with Matt Lauer released later on Saturday evening."

Friday’s celebrity show of support for efforts to aid refugees around the world came ahead of next month’s U.N. summit there to address the dire global crisis. “I just hope that people will be reminded of our common humanity,” writer and keynote speaker Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie told The Huffington Post before the event, themed around the motto “One Humanity.”“I’ve generally been troubled by the ways in which refugees and immigrants are talked about as though they are not fully human.” “Game of Thrones” actress Natalie Dormer, “The Voice” winner Alisan Porter, former “Hamilton” actor Leslie Odom Jr. were among the artists onstage at the event, which fell on the anniversary of the 2003 bombing of the U.N. headquarters in Baghdad, Iraq, which killed 22 people. Each celebrity spoke with heartfelt messages for humanitarian support in between clips from a 2016 PBS Frontline documentary, “Children of Syria,” telling the story of the Kamil family’s life in Aleppo, Syria, and migration to Germany. Dormer specifically called on the international community to protect women and girls from sexual violence and “engage men and boys in the conversation,” echoing U.N. Women Goodwill Ambassador Emma Watson’s words as the British actress kicked off the feminist HeForShe campaign in 2014. “In most of the conflicts around the world, rape has become a weapon of war, with women directly targeted by fighting parties,” Dormer said.After performances that included the vocal stylings of an “Arab Idol” winner from Palestine, the audience of press, nongovernmental organization workers and members of the public heard from Hala Kamil, who spoke passionately against the violence in her home country. Soldiers took her husband in Aleppo and she’s not heard from him since.A message appeared on screens behind the stage: “tweet your leader” with a designated hashtag, #ShareHumanity. The New York City event comes three months after the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul, Turkey, where 55 heads of state and government gathered along with representatives from 173 member nations. However, President Barack Obama did not attend, nor did Secretary of State John Kerry. Also absent were Russian leader Vladimir Putin, Canada’s Justin Trudeau, France’s Francois Hollande and Britain’s then-Prime Minister David Cameron. In fact, Germany’s Angela Merkel was the only leader from the largest global powers to attend the Istanbul summit. (Aid group Doctors Without Borders boycotted the summit, which it dismissed as a “fig leaf of good intentions.”) U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said in a statement that he considered the turnout from the world’s richest countries “disappointing.”Conflict in Syria alone has led 12 million people to flee, according to leader of the U.N., which stated in January that humanitarian efforts would require an additional $15 billion in funding. However, “Quantico” actress Yasmine Al Massri stressed before the New York City event the small actions ordinary people could take to help refugees abroad.“You don’t have to belong to an organization. Your government does not have to have a plan or a budget to help refugees. You and your neighbors can buy three suitcases, put some clothes [in] them, put some coats, put some baby things, and find somewhere to send them,” she told HuffPost. “Go online. Go on the United Nations website.”The U.N. will hold its summit to address issues related to refugees and migrants on September 19 in New York City."
27,THE WORLDPOST,Who Is ISIS Executing And Why?

My analysis of 6,019 executions (gathered in an original dataset based",2016-08-20,Comparison of numbers killed by ISIS executions and suicide bombings between June 2014 and October 2015 in Iraq.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b790951700002e00d1ff36.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Who is the Islamic State (ISIS) executing, and why? My analysis of 6,019 executions (gathered in an original dataset based on United Nations data) perpetrated by ISIS in Iraq indicates that the vast majority of these killings are done with a clear goal in mind: to consolidate rule in their “state.”ISIS mainly executes civilians that pose a threat to the group’s ability to monopolize the use of coercive force necessary to police territory under their control. Numerous factors contribute to the overall success of ISIS. However, in order to understand ISIS’s most threatening feature—the ability to control territory—it is vital to answer who they execute and why.Of course, suicide bombing is also an important tool for controlling territory. Suicide bombing is largely intended to force the Iraqi government to concentrate its military towards guarding Baghdad—where the vast majority of suicide bombings take place—and away from retaking ISIS-held territory. Considering the Iraqi government’s recent recapture of Fallujah, this tactic seems to be failing.Executions also account for a larger number of civilian deaths than suicide bombings—6019 to 1596 respectively in Iraq between June 2014 and October 2015. Further, executions include some of the most egregious crimes of the group, including beheadings, burning victims alive, and mass drowning. Gathering reliable data on civilians killed in war zones is notoriously difficult. However, five recent reports from the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) provides strong evidence on the who, what, where, when, and why of 6,019 executions perpetrated by ISIS in Iraq between June 2014 and October 2015. Of course, this is not every execution that was carried out by ISIS. But UNAMI makes clear that the data does represent a discernable pattern. One of the most astounding findings revealed by the data is that 58% of the “noncombatants” that ISIS executes are actually captured enemy combatants. This group includes Iraqi Security Forces, police, Kurdish Peshmerga, and Shia, Sunni, and Yezidi militia fighters. In fact, the U.N. even defines a small number of ISIS fighters executed for fleeing the battlefield as “noncombatants.” Defining captured fighters as “noncombatants” may raise some eyebrows among the general public. Most people likely picture women and children when hearing of civilian deaths in war zones, not Shia militiamen or insubordinate ISIS fighters. However, when captured, these fighters are technically considered “noncombatants” under relevant international law.When coding the data I distinguished between “captured combatants”, and “civilians” that never took part in hostilities. The dataset features 2,519 “civilians” executed between 2014 and 2015. Interestingly, the evidence reveals that four groups account for the vast majority of executed civilians.Yezidi civilians account for the majority of the killings at 1,209. Government employees, politicians, and other professionals make up the second largest group at 381. Third, 229 civilians were killed for familial ties to tribes fighting ISIS. And the fourth largest group—at 193—are suspected collaborators with ISIS’s enemies.How does executing these civilians help ISIS control territory?First, the UNAMI reports note that Yezidis are killed for their religious practices. Although Christians are legally allowed to live in ISIS territory—”as long as they pay a special tax”—the Yezidi faith is seen as incompatible with ISIS’s legal rules that govern their “state.”However, anecdotal evidence suggests that the mass killing of Yezidis is more strongly correlated with ISIS’s concern for security rather than than proper legal administration.For instance, my dataset shows that Yezidi militias have fought ISIS in many of the areas that these massacres take place. Further, Yezidi men make up 87% of these killings, and the UNAMI reports are unclear if these men are actually captured fighters. Finally, as the UNAMI reports note, ISIS has allowed Yezidis to live after converting to Islam. This calls into question whether those killed are associated with the Yezidi militia, or refused conversion. However, more research is needed to evaluate the accuracy of my analysis. The second most executed group—government employees, politicians, and other professionals—are likely killed to replace previous regimes and institutions for ISIS’s own. Interestingly, since it is clear that ISIS is not attempting to wipe out every one of these elites, those killed are likely done so when deemed threatening.The family members of tribes fighting ISIS—the third most executed group—have the weakest connection to actual military resistance against ISIS. Unfortunately, this tactic is all too common in warfare, so the logic is quite clear: to deter continued resistance by tribal fighters.The last group—suspected enemy collaborators—are executed to cut off the intelligence supply to ISIS’s many enemies.When compared to other insurgents, the patterns of ISIS’s executions are truly disturbing—but not for the reasons one might think. Many insurgent groups, such as the RUF in Sierra Leone, kill civilians with seemingly no goal in mind. In contrast, ISIS seems to only execute those with some connection to their enemies.In fact, 133 civilians even received a trial—though unfair by the U.N.’s standards—before being executed. This, on top of the evidence already presented, shows that ISIS is attempting to communicate to its public that “law-abiding” citizens will not be executed.According to one of the most authoritative studies on how insurgents control territory—Stathis N. Kalyvas’ The Logic of Violence in Civil War—when insurgents selectively kill associates of their enemies, the majority of the population believes they will not be killed if they abide by the rules of their occupier. However, when insurgents kill at random, everyone feels under threat.According to Kalyvas, when a population has nothing to lose they are likely to welcome any opportunity to resist. But when the majority understands they can survive by following the “law,” they submit to their occupiers.Explaining ISIS’s success in Iraq requires more than just a survey of the patterns of executions by the extremist group. However, the ability to monopolize the use of force in their “state”—to paraphrase the eminent sociologist Max Weber—goes a long way toward explaining why ISIS has been able to control territory. "

But when these buffoonish figures take power, they become extremely frightening.”“They are frightening,” Scheer replied. But “what you’re saying is they didn’t come from nowhere.”“Right,” said Hedges. “The Nazis came out of the collapse of Weimar. And Radovan Karadžic came out of the economic collapse of Yugoslavia.”“And Donald Trump came out of the collapse of the American economy,” added Scheer.“There you go,” said Hedges. “That’s how fascism—and voting for Hillary Clinton’s not going to make it better. We may get rid of Trump; we’re not getting rid of the phenomenon. Trump is not the phenomenon. Trump is responding to the phenomenon. Unless we radically change that phenomenon, we’re finished.”What is the phenomenon? Neoliberalism, a regime of economic policies supported and embodied by the Clintons that destroy the supply of jobs and good wages that ensures social order by satisfying a public’s basic needs.Listen to the interview below: Adapted from Truthdig.comRobert Scheer: Hi, this is Robert Scheer with another edition of Scheer Intelligence, where the intelligence comes from my guests. And I certainly have an intelligent one now, and it’s part of a series I call “American originals”―people that have somehow come out of our crazy-quilt of a culture and actually have integrity, have an interesting point of view. And Chris Hedges is certainly such a person. We’re going to talk about events of―we’re doing this in Philadelphia at the time of the Democratic Convention. Chris has been leading demonstrations, as well as writing about it. I’ve been covering this for Truthdig. And we’re going to get to that. But I’d like to pick up on the theme of the American original, and basically address one question, is: why didn’t you sell out? The culture leads people to have careerism trump everything. You certainly were the good student, you ended up at Harvard Divinity School. The other day, in one of these demonstrations, you wore your clerical collar―Chris Hedges: They asked me to; I don’t usually wear it.RS: OK, but you actually―and as I understand it, in order to be in the prisons, teaching prisoners, it’s convenient for you to have finished your degree. But you did finish; you’re a Presbyterian minister. And you’ve certainly written bestselling books; you’ve been enormously successful. I remember going to see The Hurt Locker movie, and it begins with a quote from you, from the book War [Is a Force That] Gives Us Meaning. And you know, you have it all, and yet you have―I don’t want to get too mushy here, but you have a heavy dose of integrity. And I want to begin with something I know about you and your relation to your father. So let’s begin there: I mean, the making of Chris Hedges.CH: Well, I think it is kind of reduced to, in many ways, to that relationship. Because my father was a veteran from World War II; he’d been a sergeant in North Africa, was very involved in the antiwar movement. He was involved in the Civil Rights Movement. We lived in a small, rural farm town in upstate New York at a time when Martin Luther King was one of the most hated men in America. And finally, my father was―and this would have been in the 1970s―involved in the gay rights movement, largely, or I think mostly, because his youngest brother was gay. Lived with his partner in Greenwich Village and had been disowned by the members of my father’s family. And so Jamie, my uncle, and his partner were the only family that my uncle had left. And my father took a lot of heat for those positions, in particular standing up for GBLT rights within the church. And he was admonished and told to stop, and he didn’t, and eventually [he was] pushed out of the institution. So I grew up with an example―and it was a great gift―of what it means to take a moral stance, and I was never naive about the cost. I didn’t believe that people were rewarded for virtue; I saw that they were not. And I remember when I was ordained, I went before the committee and they said, are you willing to abide by the rules of the church? And my answer, which probably should have disqualified me, was: When the church is right. Because on the issue of gay rights, my father was right and the church was wrong. And when you have someone you care for―I was very close to my dad―with that kind of integrity. And the last time I saw him, I was the Balkan bureau chief for the New York Times; he was making $26,000 a year as a chaplain in a juvenile detention home, because he couldn’t get a church, in a windowless office in the basement with files on young men, boys, who had, you know, terrible―and he was deeply committed to them. And I remember walking down the halls, the last time I saw him, and I certainly understood who the greater person was. And I think that in that sense, I was never a careerist; I went to El Salvador in the 1980s to fight fascism; to give a voice to, at that time―RS: When you say you went, in what capacity?CH: As a reporter, as a freelance reporter. I mean, when I went to El Salvador, I only had enough money for a one-way ticket. This was a time when half of the country was landless; they had risen up against the oligarchs; the death squads were killing between 700 and 1,000 people a month, backed by the Reagan administration. And so, yes, I did well; but I was never a careerist, in the sense that my career was never the point. When I was covering, I covered the war in El Salvador for five years, and during that time the Washington Post offered me a job. But they said I had to come back and work in the Metro section in Maryland. And I said, no; I came here to cover the war. I mean, that wasn’t a good career move. I was eventually hired by the foreign desk of the Times; this was actually quite rare, by the time I got into the Middle East. But I looked for reporting assignments where I could put myself in places, often, of extreme danger, but certainly where people were suffering horrific oppression, and give them a voice. And of course, eventually ended up in Sarajevo during the war in Yugoslavia. Now, these were not reporting positions that other New York Times reporters wanted; in fact, the executive editor at the time of the New York Times, Joe Lelyveld, said when I asked to go to Bosnia, he said “The line starts and ends with you.” And so I was freed from that careerism, which is rampant and has a kind of sickness at the New York Times. And eventually, of course, led to my split [with] the Times. But I think a lot of it has to do with the example that my father set.RS: Well, let’s dispose of that―your split with the New York Times. You were there for 15 years, you were a bureau chief at one point―CH: I was the Middle East bureau chief and the Balkan bureau chief.RS: Yeah, and you were at one point part of a Pulitzer-prize winning―CH: Covering Al-Qaeda, based in Paris.RS: Yeah. And, ah, and then what was the falling out about?CH: Well, I stood up and denounced Bush’s call to invade Iraq.RS: This was at a college speech?CH: Well, I’d been doing it on Charlie Rose and all sorts of places. But I gave a commencement address that they got, you know, the home―I was booed, it was quite an event because I was roundly booed by most all of the 1,000 people in the crowd. They got up at one point and began singing “God Bless America”; they cut my microphone―RS: Where was, what school―CH: Rockford College, Rockford, Illinois.RS: And you were there, just invited to speak―CH: To give the commencement address.RS: Oh, commencement address, yeah.CH: And so the cable news channel―RS: Well, when was that?CH: 2003. Right after the invasion.RS: Ah.CH: And so, because there was footage of it, this was just looped. I was lynched. You know, the same way they lynched Jeremiah Wright, where actually if you listen to Jeremiah Wright’s talk at the National Press Club, it’s an incredibly thoughtful, one-hour talk on the history of white supremacy and how it works, and they―RS: We should mention, Jeremiah Wright was the minister of the congregation―CH: Obama’s pastor, who he threw under the bus.RS: ―he threw under the bus. And I did what you―you know, the good thing about the internet, you can get smeared [laughs] very effectively by things taken out of quote. But if people are the least bit curious, they can generally get the original document. And I remember when he was being smeared, I was able to get not only his speech at the press club, but his sermons.CH: Yeah, which are great.RS: They’re marvelous.CH: They’re marvelous.RS: And they were unifying, and really devoid of any kind of―CH: Well, and also, coming out of divinity school, I can tell you, theologically honest in a way that most preachers are not. So I got―so then the New York Times had to respond. They issued me a written reprimand, which under guild rules, you give the employee a written reprimand and then, if they continue in that behavior, you can fire them. So that was the first step to being fired; I was not fired, as the executive editor of the New York Times, Dean Baquet, who I saw recently, reminded me. But I knew my time was terminal. So I arranged to go to The Nation Institute; once, soon as that was set up, I left the paper.RS: Going back to this question of how do we get a “other” Chris Hedges―which is kind of the whole point of this series; I like to figure out, there are these interesting people I can talk to, and then how do I help mint more of them or encourage other people to be like that. And you know, sometimes when I talk to people they say, you know, Chris Hedges, he’s so negative and he’s so down, and everything, and what kind of guy is he like, and everything? But actually, you’re not really like that, right? You have an incredibly strong life force, right?CH: Yeah.RS: As a parent, as―even when you eat [laughs] and so forth. And so you must hear the same thing, right? That you’re on the heavy-duty side of things.CH: Yeah, that’s the public perception. But you know, I’m, the older I get the more reclusive I become; I don’t, really don’t socialize at all. I don’t have a Twitter account, I don’t have a Facebook page, I don’t―so I’m kind of cut off on purpose. But I think you’re right, that is the perception.RS: I want to talk to you about your habits of work, because they really impress me, and then we’ll get to other political issues. But you actually, first of all, still read.CH: Oh, I read two to three hours a day, at least.RS: Right. And you and your wife read together, and―CH: Right, we don’t have a TV.RS: In fact you’re about, next week I think you’re going off for a month of―why don’t you describe what you and your wife are going to do for the next month? [Laughter] Because it’s a side of you that I don’t think people really know.CH: Yeah, we go off to an island off the coast of Maine where there’s no cell phone and Internet service, and we always take a book to read. Last summer it was Paradise Lost. We read other books, too, but we kind of centered around that one book. And we’re, you know, completely cut off by choice on that island; half of the island is national park, there’s only fifty houses, there’s a little grocery store, that’s it. So every day we’re outside with our kids, we pack a lunch. I mean, I grew up in the country, and even when I was overseas I would come back―at the time I had a house in Maine, and hike for five weeks. So I mean, the outdoors has always been―for many reasons; one, I could never meditate. I can’t sit still, so I need the physical movement. But also, just because when you’re out at 5,000 feet under a canopy of stars, you’re reminded of your place in the universe and the enormity of time, and it puts life in perspective. And it also―you have to grasp the beauty, but also the fury, and the destructive force of nature, having been caught on these peaks in lightning storms. You, it’s―and that’s something that I worry about, and have been, worked very hard to instill in my own children, by taking them into the outdoors; that they don’t lose that contact with the natural world.RS: So let me ask you, as a minister ,about our place in the world. And here we’re at a convention, not so bad as the Republican convention, but this constant invocation of a notion of God to endorse, you know, sometimes reasonable positions, often godless positions; certainly not very sensitive to human life, when we talk about war and peace. And what is it about religion that you still hold on to?CH: Well, I should preface that by saying that I have no love for institutional religion, which the theologian Paul Tillich correctly called “inherently demonic.” He said, “All institutions are inherently demonic, including the Church.” And that’s correct. By that he means that institutions seek to perpetuate themselves at the cost of morality, and the Church is no different; we’ve seen it recently with the Catholic Church and the pedophilia scandals. So I, like my father, have a very antagonistic relationship with the institution. But the religious impulse―and I should be clear that I don’t, there’s no evidence that Jesus ever existed as a historical figure, or God as a human concept; I don’t believe in heaven and hell, I don’t think good people are blessed. I mean, I was in Sarajevo when 2,000 children were murdered by snipers and shell fire; I hardly believe that God saved me because somehow my life was more precious than theirs. But I think that religion, like art, struggles with the transcendent forces in human life―these non-reality elements: beauty, truth, justice, a search for meaning, the struggle with our own mortality―and that we can’t be complete human beings unless all of that search and discovery into issues like beauty or truth, or a life of meaning, are examined constantly. The Buddhists have a saying, they say you can memorize as many sutras as you want; it will never make you wise. And I think that also, religion at its best―and one doesn’t have to come out of a religious tradition to have this sentiment; I mean, Albert Camus had it―grasps that happiness is not achieved through the acquisition of things, or the amassing of power or wealth. But happiness, or happiness that has any kind of sustainability, comes with the capacity to be vulnerable, the capacity to love, the capacity to sacrifice for the other. Yes, it’s bittersweet, because when you reach out to the oppressed―and I have, in the developing world, throughout my life―you are hurt because of the suffering they endure. And yet it does give you a life of purpose, a life of meaning. And those bonds of solidarity, I think, give you a happiness, if that’s the right word, that is very different from the kind of emotional highs, or adrenaline-fueled highs, that take the place of happiness in a consumer, capitalist society.RS: Let me ask you about your role as a minister, because I know you didn’t do it just as a convenience to gain entry to prison. You’re coming in as a minister, right?CH: Well, I was―I was, I am, I’ve been teaching for many years in a prison. And I had health insurance through the Presbyterian Church, and then there was some discussion that it should be revoked because I wasn’t ordained. And so I took the five ordination exams, including Biblical Greek―they’re all three hours long―and passed them. And then I had the thorny problem of ordination, which I dreaded, in some suburban church with a bunch of white Presbyterians. So I did it in a friend of mine’s church in the inner city; I threw out the Presbyterian [hymnal], I hired a blues band; it’s all on YouTube, if you type in my name and “ordination.” Cornel West came and spoke; James Cone, the father of black liberation theology, preached. And we geared it towards the families of my students in prison, so it was all really built around the monstrosity of mass incarceration. I rewrote the Prayer of Confession to say, you know, where were you when they crucified Sitting Bull? We were not there. Where were you when they crucified Matthew Shepard on the cross? We were not there. Where were you when they crucified Malcolm and Martin? Where were you when they crucified three million Vietnamese? Where were you―you know, so that it had, for me, it was theologically real. And moving.RS: You’re constantly bearing witness to “where were you.” And your most recent piece―as we are at the Democratic convention, I happened to read the other morning―was about your visit to Poland.CH: Right.RS: And you raised the question―not you, really, more people in Poland who are worried about the rise of neofascism and what has happened to the Polish movement―CH: Solidarity.RS: Solidarity, after Communism was defeated. I found that an incredibly depressing and alarming article. And I don’t know if you meant it that way, but I would recommend that everyone read it, because you raise the most fundamental question about barbarism in the modern era. Which is that the major barbarism did not come from people of so-called primitive culture.CH: Yeah.RS: Or uneducated, or given to all sorts of ritualistic tendencies that might be destructive; it came, beginning in Germany, in the most civilized, well-educated society, people who respect―CH: Yes, although we should be clear that after [1933], the Nazis destroyed culture in the same way that neoliberalism has destroyed culture.RS: Ninety―CH: After 1933.RS: Thirty-three, yeah.CH: So that if you were ten years old, you were pretty much yanked out of your family into the [Hitler] Youth and indoctrinated.RS: OK. And in your article, you actually have one of the people you interview questioning what is human nature, and that human nature is not necessarily some enduring, innate quality; it’s something that is learned and taught. But the fact of the matter is―and I’m half Jewish and half German, so I’ve wrestled with this ever since I was born, in the beginning of all this, back in ‘36. I’ve been back to Germany, I’ve visited my relatives. My father’s brother, my half brother was in the U.S. Air Force bombing our hometown in Germany, and my father’s brother was one of the people being bombed, and he was in the German army, wounded at Stalingrad. So I’ve wrestled with this, and yes, there was a gap in the workings of German education. But the fact is, they still had the best music, and they had the best science, and they had all of this in Germany. And it didn’t save them at all, it didn’t help them at all. And I have always found that very depressing when I apply it to the United States.CH: Well, because I think that the problem was that―I mean, just as under Stalinism, there was a war against culture, replaced with faux culture. You know, the whole attack on Jewish science was part of Nazism and Stalinism. So you’re right, except that it shows how swiftly a society that reaches those cultural heights can be reoriented towards barbarism. And I would argue that that is one of the fundamental dangers in the United States, is the war we’ve made on our own culture. The Nazis made, had a huge movie industry, and they didn’t make―they made some horrible propaganda films. But most of it was fluff, was garbage, was Hollywood-type entertainment. And you know, mindless entertainment; spectacle. Spectacle―fascists do spectacle very well. Stalin did spectacle very well. And that creates a kind of cultural milieu where people lose the capacity to think critically and self-reflect, which is what authentic culture is about; that capacity to get you to look within yourself, look within your society. And it’s replaced with this collective narcissism, which has been on display at this convention. And that’s very dangerous. And we’ve seen Trump ride that collective narcissism, and exploit it through right-wing populism, and do what proto-fascist movements always do, which is direct a legitimate rage and a cultural narcissism towards the vulnerable. Undocumented workers, Muslims, homosexuals, you know, on and on and on. So the destruction of culture is a key component―actually, my first book, War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning, and the wars that I covered, noted that a culture that goes to war destroys its own culture before it destroys the culture of the enemy.RS: But basic to that manipulative concept, obscuring your own responsibility―the denial of, say, Jesus, who may not have existed but it was attributed to him in Luke, of the Good Samaritan―trying to understand the other, and that the other also has a soul, and so forth. Obliterating that, making people throwaway people, whether they’re the people you deal with in jail, or the people we’re bombing. As the Democratic Convention is going on, a democratic president is randomly killing people with drones and what have you. And you even had Madeleine Albright get up there to a standing ovation―I was stunned―and she’s a woman who at one point defended the bombing, starvation, actually, in Iraq, and you know, this is the price you pay. And I was thinking about that; essential to this whole narrative is that idea that Reagan pushed―he wasn’t the first, but the Germans had it too―that you are the city on the hill. You are the place that God is watching.CH: Right. Well, that’s what the collective narcissism is about. And with collective narcissism, means you externalize evil. So every moralist―I mean, having covered war, I know how thin that line is between victim and victimizer. I know how easily people can be seduced into carrying out atrocity; I’ve seen it in every war I’ve covered. And I think the best break against that is understanding those dark forces within all of us, and the capacity we all have for evil. That’s what makes Primo Levy such a great writer about the Holocaust. And so collective narcissism essentially says we―it creates a binary world, as you correctly point out, where other human beings embody evil, and when we eradicate them, we have eradicated evil. And that, of course, propels a society into committing atrocious acts of evil in the name of good. And that’s what the Nazis did, and I would argue that’s what we do in the Middle East; that’s what we do in this vast system of mass incarceration; that’s what we do in our internal colonies; that’s what we do to our poor.RS: And that’s what we do in our foreign policy. And there is a common theme that we saw at both the Republican and Democratic conventions. And it was surprising to me how much they had in common in this respect: that we are the aggrieved. It’s like the people in Germany after World War I, who became convinced that they had been victimized by the rest of the world. Right, whether it was Jewish bankers in New York, or it was the French, or the Allies, or what have you. And it was interesting, we’re recording this at the point when Barack Obama’s going to speak at the convention tonight. But last night, listening to the speeches, they had you know, first responders; 9/11 was a big theme, because after all, Hillary Clinton, senator from New York, and she had the credentials of having been around during 9/11 and so forth. And it was all about, you know, this―first of all, sort of a continuation of the idea that no other people in the world have ever been attacked in this way. Right? You know, we are a nation―CH: Well, it’s the―you know, all of these societies that descend into this, I think what you correctly called barbarism, sanctify their own victimhood. This is what’s killed Israel. And you sanctify your―once you sanctify your victimhood, it’s beyond understanding. And it gives you a license, or you believe it gives you a license, to do anything.RS: OK. So I want to end this by raising one last subject, and indulge the listeners to listen a bit longer. And that has to do with, where are we at this moment in history? And when I read your article about your visit to Poland―you were invited there to give a talk?CH: It was actually in the Czech Republic, but it was on the―it was a huge, 50,000 people came to a big arts festival right over the border in Ostrava in the Czech Republic from, right on the border with Poland.RS: OK. And you raised a very fundamental question about the rise of neofascism in Poland, but by inference, in the rest of the world. And not everybody agrees with me; I’ve called Trump a neofascist precisely because of the scapegoating of the victims of undocumented and Muslims, to avoid paying attention to the damage that people like Trump, and Goldman Sachs, have done to our society. So I think there’s a certain logic to using, an accuracy to using that word. And in your article, you raise this very troubling notion that this didn’t just come because we have a particularly devious, charismatic personality in the form of Donald Trump, which is the way the mass media is basically treating it. A guy appears, and he’s a great snake-oil salesman, and he’s conning everything, but he’s really ruthless. He has no movement, he doesn’t really represent any ideological force; he’s just out for himself and blah, blah, blah. OK. But that didn’t happen with neofasicm in Poland. It happened because of something called neoliberalism.CH: That’s right.RS: And maybe you could spell that out, because I think the analogy―CH: Well, you know, it was interesting reporting from Poland, because I certainly understood the American landscape, but it’s as if when you go to the eye doctor’s and he flicks the lens, and suddenly it’s a little clearer―it was like that going to Poland. Because here you had the overthrow of communism, the rise of this courageous democratic movement “Solidarity,” this opening up of the society. Then the shock therapy, [Jeffrey] Sachs and others, descended upon Poland, destroyed the economy, threw massive numbers of workers out of jobs, deindustrialized state institutions that had once provided jobs. Then in the name of austerity destroyed public broadcasting, destroyed the school system, destroyed subsidy for the arts. When I lived in Zagórów I used to go to the opera, which was a great opera, because everybody was a state employee, for five dollars a night. And then you got the distortions within the political process. And now Poland is on the verge of building a party militia; thirty to forty thousand armed. They have an army; it’s not to be an army, it’s internal control. And that’s what neoliberalism does, ultimately.RS: And the people the neoliberals used to claim to support, the Solidarity folks, the Lech Wałęsas, you say basically they’re finished.CH: They’re―Lech Wałęsa is demonized every night as a Soviet agent on state television.RS: And you say in your article that the young people in Poland, according to the people you were interviewing, are all more with the neofascists―CH: Yes, because―well, two million of them are trying to find jobs abroad. You had the same thing, a Clinton-like liberal center that pushed through these neoliberal economic policies, which were devastating the Polish working class. It was exactly the same. And so people have turned against that establishment. This was the mistake of the inheritors of Solidarity, is that they allowed these economic policies to go through, as did Nelson Mandela and others. And there are political consequences to that, and I think they’re very far advanced in Poland, but we’re not far behind.RS: So the compelling part of this narrative is that we may be revisiting history, and unfortunately, not as―what was the expression? First time is tragedy―CH: And the second time is farce. That’s Nietzsche.RS: You know, maybe Trump is farce, but he’s also dangerous.CH: Well, but the Nazis before 1933 were buffoonish figures, as were Radovan Karadžić and Slobodan Milošević in Yugoslavia. And as Trump is. But when these buffoonish figures take power, they become extremely frightening.RS: They are frightening. On the other hand, what you’re saying is they didn’t come from nowhere.CH: Right. Well, but the Nazis came out of the collapse of Weimar. And Radovan Karadžić came out of the economic collapse of Yugoslavia.RS: OK. And Donald Trump came out of the collapse of the American economy.CH: There you go. That’s how fascism―and voting for Hillary Clinton’s not going to make it better. We may get rid of Trump; we’re not getting rid of the phenomena. Trump is not the phenomena. Trump is responding to the phenomena. Unless we radically change that phenomena, we’re finished.RS: So this is a very difficult message to get across, because it puts pressure on people in terms of their careerism, their comfort zone, and so forth. And you know, sitting at the Democratic Convention last night, I got enormously depressed. Because first of all, it was a parade of people who have been hurt by the society, and somehow out of that hurt, support Hillary Clinton. I don’t know why, why she―but somehow they found a whole collection of people who have real problems, health problems and so forth. And somehow, it’s almost like she has the―she can put hands on and heal. You almost had that feeling that the Democratic Party can heal you; just come in your wheelchair and we’ll heal and you’ll walk again. It almost had that feeling of a revival church. And no sense at all of responsibility. Because once Sanders went over, as you point out, once he embraced Hillary Clinton, people then became, you use the expression of useful idiots. They stopped thinking, and two things happened: we’re going to have the first woman president, and we got this barbarian at the gates in Donald Trump. And this is now a time to stop thinking.CH: Well, it’s political infantilism. I mean, you ignore the structures of power, which is just what they want you to do. Both campaigns are just fear-based campaigns. Trump plays on fear; the democrats play on fear. And until we develop some political maturity and understand how what Sheldon Wolin calls “inverted totalitarianism,” or the corporate state, works, we’re spun and manipulated by it. Which is what this convention is doing.RS: So what are we to do? What are we to do in this election? Do we sit it out?CH: Well, third party. I mean, we have to―you know, like, Syriza ten years ago was pulling at four percent, and now controls Greece. We have to walk into the political wilderness and try and build an alternative movement. That’s our only hope. I mean, you know, the climate is disintegrating at such a rapid rate, we don’t have any time left. But that’s it; that’s our only hope. And mass acts of civil disobedience, the capacity to say no, the capacity to refuse to cooperate; you know, very effective campaign that brought down the apartheid regime in South Africa. That’s where we have to go.RS: Well, thank you, Chris Hedges, certainly a heavy dose of intelligence. That’s it for Scheer Intelligence. My producers are Josh Scheer and Rebecca Mooney. Special thanks to our engineers at KCRW, Mario Diaz and Kat Yore. And this was recorded at Baker Studios in Philadelphia. See you next week. "
29,BLACK VOICES,Hurricane Katrina Survivors Relive Familiar Nightmare In Baton Rouge,David Lohr,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hurricane-katrina-baton-rouge_us_57b7a061e4b00d9c3a17dd39,The recent flooding in southern Louisiana has brought back horrific memories for some residents.,2016-08-20,"Linda Chase inside the Celtic Studios, which has been turned into a makeshift shelter amid massive floods in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b7a3fa1700002c00d1ff7d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BATON ROUGE, La. — When cataclysmic flooding in New Orleans swallowed her home and stole her belongings, Hurricane Katrina survivor Linda Chase left the city she once loved and began life anew here. For more than a decade, she kept her painful memories buried. That pain, however, resurfaced last week when deadly, historic flooding began to engulf parishes throughout southern Louisiana.It was then, the 60-year-old said, that she found herself experiencing a dark, watery déjà vu.Her painful reliving of the tragic events began to unfold early last Friday, when she looked outside her home and saw water fast approaching her front door.“By the time I made it to my bedroom, the water was coming in,” Chase told The Huffington Post. “I started getting big towels, but it was no use. Before I knew it, the water was up to the electric sockets. I called 911, and nobody was answering.”Chase managed to get in touch with the mayor, who assured her help was coming. While she waited, she sat on her bed and tried to stay calm as rising waters lifted her bed off the floor.“I could see my walls were separating, and the floor planks were coming up,” Chase said. “I could feel them hitting my legs, and I saw my clothes floating in the water. I was getting hysterical [because] it reminded me of seeing the bodies floating in the water around us in New Orleans. ... I was thinking the house was coming down.In the 30 minutes it took the rescue party to arrive, the water had risen to Chase’s chest. Rescuers took her to a Baton Rouge shelter, where a cot, one among countless others assigned to other displaced citizens, is now her temporary home.“I broke down crying on Wednesday,” she said. “That’s when it hit me ... I’ve lost everything again. I had one picture of my mommy and daddy who are deceased. That was all I had of them – their photo in a frame, and it’s gone ... I had to work hard for everything [after Katrina]. I had to work hard to start all over again, and now it’s all gone again.”The devastating mid-August flooding continues to weave a path of destruction as it makes its way south toward the gulf, overflowing rivers and swallowing up homes.As of Friday, 13 people have died, and some 30,000 people have been rescued. Rainfall that choked rivers and streams was so heavy leading up to the flood that it could qualify “as a 1-in-1,000-year rainfall event,” according to Dr. Jeff Masters, director of meteorology for Weather Underground.While the widespread flooding was not caused by a hurricane, it still drenched more than 20 parishes in much the same way that Katrina demolished New Orleans, converting commercial and residential areas alike into great inland lakes.When Katrina struck New Orleans on Aug. 29, 2005, the storm surge toppled levees that protected the city, leaving 80 percent of it flooded. Floyd Norman stayed for the storm and was plucked off the roof of his flooded downtown home by a Coast Guard helicopter. He had no inclination to ride out another hurricane, and left New Orleans without looking back.“I lost everything, [and] I didn’t want to be back in New Orleans,” he said. But he found life repeating itself last Saturday, when flood waters engulfed his Baton Rouge home.“When the water started coming up, I said, ‘Really, again? No, not again. I don’t feel like going through all this over again,’” he said.The water was waist deep in Norman’s house when, for the second time in his 59 years, he found himself being rescued by emergency responders.“It was like a flashback,” he said. “I had just got everything back – everything I’d lost and wanted replaced – and I just lost everything again.”Another double-victim is Anthony Bazile, a 52-year-old retired merchant seaman who lost his mother to Hurricane Katrina. He survived that storm and fled to Houston, Texas. He remained there until recently, when he returned to Louisiana. When the floodwaters rose again last week, he was forced to flee his Baton Rouge home on foot in waist-deep waters.“One guy lost his life because he couldn’t swim,” said Bazile. “All my stuff washed away. I never thought it was going to be that bad.”With the waters came a sea of memories, Bazile said, of the death and destruction he saw during the five days he spent in New Orleans after Katrina made landfall.“I saw bodies floating in the streets when I walked from my house to the French Quarter,” he said. “One lady’s body was tied to a post so it wouldn’t float away. I still visualize that.”Bazile’s roommate, 55-year-old Jean Pace, is staying with him at a shelter in Baton Rouge. She has had three strokes since 2005 and, like Bazile, lost all of her possessions to Katrina. She said she is overwhelmed by the latest catastrophe.“This has brought back a lot of bad memories,” she said. “Even the smell of the water – it smells just like Katrina.”Doris Simon, 56, is another dual survivor. A mother of four who is still trying to determine the amount of damage to her flooded Baton Rouge home, Simon moved to the area after losing everything she owned to Katrina. Today, she finds herself homeless again, with all the possessions she had accumulated since the 2005 storm destroyed.“I’m a fighter and a survivor, but this time it’s taking a toll on me,” she said. “It’s beginning to be too much for me. … I’m really to the point where I just don’t want to do this no more. It’s almost like I wish I wasn’t here. It’s not about the furniture or nothing like that. It’s just psychological. I’m at the point where I don’t want to start over again. I worked hard to replace everything after Katrina, and now I have to do it all over again.”Calvin John, a 47-year-old resident of Denham Springs, said he too is a victim of a “double whammy,” having spent three days awaiting rescue during Katrina. Now a second-time victim of flooding, he is staying in a Baton Rouge shelter as he awaits FEMA assessments of the damage.“[This is] Katrina all over again,” John said. “Now I got to start at the bottom again. I think I got to get out of Louisiana, but I can’t. It’s home. It makes you think that though.”Like several other flood victims interviewed by HuffPost, John believes that despite the fact that the flood waters are continuing to cause widespread devastation, the people in Baton Rouge are already being forgotten.“This hasn’t received enough attention,” said John, who believes the flooding has been largely overshadowed in the press by the presidential election and Olympic Games. “People outside [the area] don’t know how bad it is. I blame that on media.”The media has been heavily criticized in recent days for not devoting enough coverage to the floods, which have left more than 110,000 homes damaged and nearly 100,000 people applying for federal disaster aid. According to The New Orleans Advocate, the first analysis of property loss totals more than $20 billion.While it’s still not clear how much monetary aid people in the area will receive, Jimmy Purvis, chairman of the Board of Directors of Parks and Recreation in Denham Springs, said little thanks is due to FEMA and the Red Cross, which has said it is undertaking the largest relief effort since Hurricane Sandy. Both organizations, Purvis said, were absent when Livingston Parish was in the direst straits.“For over a week we have taken care of people, and now all of a sudden – a week later – the Red Cross wants to ride in on white horses and save us from ourselves,” Purvis said. “My argument is we don’t need their help. And FEMA, they showed up today with boats to rescue people. Where the hell were they a week ago? Last Friday, when the water was coming up, Louisiana people were here. People around here that had boats – those boats became rescue vehicles. ... That’s what we do in south Louisiana.”“I understand rules. I understand security, but they’re saying to throw unopened water away because we don’t know who donated it ― and food, too,” Purvis said.President Barack Obama has also been criticized for not visiting the state or making a statement about the flooding.On the eve of Hurricane Katrina’s 11-year anniversary, as flood waters in most areas recede and the pungent aroma of raw sewage, mold and mildew takes hold, those who have survived this great tragedy are a testament to the resilience of the human spirit.“I love Louisiana,” Pace said. “It’s home. God’s going to work it out. Material things we lost, but we’re grateful we got our life and we can tell a story about it.”Bazile added, “We are going to have tragedies as long as the sky turns blue and the moon sets. It’s just the way of the world. It’s about picking yourself up. Life is important. I can get a lot of these things back again, but I can’t buy another life.”Check out ways to help those affected by the floods here. "
30,BLACK VOICES,Hurricane Katrina Survivors Relive Familiar Nightmare In Baton Rouge,David Lohr,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hurricane-katrina-baton-rouge_us_57b7a061e4b00d9c3a17dd39,The recent flooding in southern Louisiana has brought back horrific memories for some residents.,2016-08-20,Tens of thousands of people have fled their homes due to flooding in Louisiana. The death toll had risen to 13 as of Friday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57b7a9951700002c00d1ff87.jpeg?ops=crop_219_0_3850_2848%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"BATON ROUGE, La. — When cataclysmic flooding in New Orleans swallowed her home and stole her belongings, Hurricane Katrina survivor Linda Chase left the city she once loved and began life anew here. For more than a decade, she kept her painful memories buried. That pain, however, resurfaced last week when deadly, historic flooding began to engulf parishes throughout southern Louisiana.It was then, the 60-year-old said, that she found herself experiencing a dark, watery déjà vu.Her painful reliving of the tragic events began to unfold early last Friday, when she looked outside her home and saw water fast approaching her front door.“By the time I made it to my bedroom, the water was coming in,” Chase told The Huffington Post. “I started getting big towels, but it was no use. Before I knew it, the water was up to the electric sockets. I called 911, and nobody was answering.”Chase managed to get in touch with the mayor, who assured her help was coming. While she waited, she sat on her bed and tried to stay calm as rising waters lifted her bed off the floor.“I could see my walls were separating, and the floor planks were coming up,” Chase said. “I could feel them hitting my legs, and I saw my clothes floating in the water. I was getting hysterical [because] it reminded me of seeing the bodies floating in the water around us in New Orleans. ... I was thinking the house was coming down.In the 30 minutes it took the rescue party to arrive, the water had risen to Chase’s chest. Rescuers took her to a Baton Rouge shelter, where a cot, one among countless others assigned to other displaced citizens, is now her temporary home.“I broke down crying on Wednesday,” she said. “That’s when it hit me ... I’ve lost everything again. I had one picture of my mommy and daddy who are deceased. That was all I had of them – their photo in a frame, and it’s gone ... I had to work hard for everything [after Katrina]. I had to work hard to start all over again, and now it’s all gone again.”The devastating mid-August flooding continues to weave a path of destruction as it makes its way south toward the gulf, overflowing rivers and swallowing up homes.As of Friday, 13 people have died, and some 30,000 people have been rescued. Rainfall that choked rivers and streams was so heavy leading up to the flood that it could qualify “as a 1-in-1,000-year rainfall event,” according to Dr. Jeff Masters, director of meteorology for Weather Underground.While the widespread flooding was not caused by a hurricane, it still drenched more than 20 parishes in much the same way that Katrina demolished New Orleans, converting commercial and residential areas alike into great inland lakes.When Katrina struck New Orleans on Aug. 29, 2005, the storm surge toppled levees that protected the city, leaving 80 percent of it flooded. Floyd Norman stayed for the storm and was plucked off the roof of his flooded downtown home by a Coast Guard helicopter. He had no inclination to ride out another hurricane, and left New Orleans without looking back.“I lost everything, [and] I didn’t want to be back in New Orleans,” he said. But he found life repeating itself last Saturday, when flood waters engulfed his Baton Rouge home.“When the water started coming up, I said, ‘Really, again? No, not again. I don’t feel like going through all this over again,’” he said.The water was waist deep in Norman’s house when, for the second time in his 59 years, he found himself being rescued by emergency responders.“It was like a flashback,” he said. “I had just got everything back – everything I’d lost and wanted replaced – and I just lost everything again.”Another double-victim is Anthony Bazile, a 52-year-old retired merchant seaman who lost his mother to Hurricane Katrina. He survived that storm and fled to Houston, Texas. He remained there until recently, when he returned to Louisiana. When the floodwaters rose again last week, he was forced to flee his Baton Rouge home on foot in waist-deep waters.“One guy lost his life because he couldn’t swim,” said Bazile. “All my stuff washed away. I never thought it was going to be that bad.”With the waters came a sea of memories, Bazile said, of the death and destruction he saw during the five days he spent in New Orleans after Katrina made landfall.“I saw bodies floating in the streets when I walked from my house to the French Quarter,” he said. “One lady’s body was tied to a post so it wouldn’t float away. I still visualize that.”Bazile’s roommate, 55-year-old Jean Pace, is staying with him at a shelter in Baton Rouge. She has had three strokes since 2005 and, like Bazile, lost all of her possessions to Katrina. She said she is overwhelmed by the latest catastrophe.“This has brought back a lot of bad memories,” she said. “Even the smell of the water – it smells just like Katrina.”Doris Simon, 56, is another dual survivor. A mother of four who is still trying to determine the amount of damage to her flooded Baton Rouge home, Simon moved to the area after losing everything she owned to Katrina. Today, she finds herself homeless again, with all the possessions she had accumulated since the 2005 storm destroyed.“I’m a fighter and a survivor, but this time it’s taking a toll on me,” she said. “It’s beginning to be too much for me. … I’m really to the point where I just don’t want to do this no more. It’s almost like I wish I wasn’t here. It’s not about the furniture or nothing like that. It’s just psychological. I’m at the point where I don’t want to start over again. I worked hard to replace everything after Katrina, and now I have to do it all over again.”Calvin John, a 47-year-old resident of Denham Springs, said he too is a victim of a “double whammy,” having spent three days awaiting rescue during Katrina. Now a second-time victim of flooding, he is staying in a Baton Rouge shelter as he awaits FEMA assessments of the damage.“[This is] Katrina all over again,” John said. “Now I got to start at the bottom again. I think I got to get out of Louisiana, but I can’t. It’s home. It makes you think that though.”Like several other flood victims interviewed by HuffPost, John believes that despite the fact that the flood waters are continuing to cause widespread devastation, the people in Baton Rouge are already being forgotten.“This hasn’t received enough attention,” said John, who believes the flooding has been largely overshadowed in the press by the presidential election and Olympic Games. “People outside [the area] don’t know how bad it is.

It’s hard to fully understand what they’re talking about. Taking care of yourself is all you’ve ever really known, after all. Sure, you have people that you care about and love and even worry about on a daily basis, but it’s not the same as having kids.Motherhood is so heavy.From the moment you find out you’re expecting, you literally begin to carry the weight of that child. They place that squirming, squished-up infant on your chest for the first time, and in that instant, your life is changed, forever. The feeling is permanently ingrained in my memory. The moment my firstborn entered this world, I felt the heaviness. The connection, the responsibility, and the weight was overwhelming. Despite all the books I had read, forums I had browsed, and blogs I had bookmarked, I felt utterly unequipped, unprepared and totally undeserving of the perfect little human placed in my hands.It’s like God literally takes a piece of your heart, gives it chubby hands and scrunchy lips, and places it outside your body, for you to care for. It’s extraordinarily wonderful and indescribably terrifying. No matter what situation is thrown your way from that moment on, you’re suddenly expected to know how to deal with it, as if birthing a child gives you magical insight into how to raise one. It’s a lot of responsibility, and it’s hard, so hard. SO hard. You love that little piece of your heart, so much, but you almost can’t bear the weight of knowing you can’t undo this, that it will never stop ― not on the weekends, not on vacation days, and not even on sick days. There are no breaks.You think back to the freedom of your child-free life and suddenly understand why people called it “freedom.”Once you become a mother, things that used to seem so easy become so much work, like trying to leave the house on time or running a few “quick” errands. Things that used to feel like basic everyday tasks now feel like luxuries, like having more than 5 minutes to make dinner, folding and putting away the laundry, or sleeping from night until morning. Things are different when the responsibility of another human being lies on your shoulders, when someone else’s needs come before your own, when the world you once knew suddenly ceases to exist, permanently.It’s almost like there’s a timer in your head, ticking, ticking, ticking. Every time you try to “get away” or “take a break” from mothering, it taunts you. You can’t escape it. You try to take a day to yourself, go away for a week, or even just a few hours, but the ticking never stops. You can’t even leave your child with a babysitter without hearing it. When the party starts going longer than expected, it gets louder. You watch the clock, wondering if your kids are still okay, if you can sneak out without being noticed, pushing yourself to stay cool for just 10 more minutes. Or 5 more minutes. Or, ok, now, you have to leave NOW. They probably need you, your kids need you. You can feel the weight, pulling you back, pulling you home to them. The longer you try to get away or ignore it, the louder it gets. You look at the people around you who don’t have kids, remembering what it felt like to be them, to have the freedom to stay late after the party or to make last-minute plans.The weight of being a mother is heavy, indeed. Somedays, it feels like it’s squashing you, requiring more strength and energy than you possess. The constant and unending responsibility seems like more than you can bear. It’s a lot to carry.But that’s the thing about lifting weights, it leads to change. The change doesn’t happen overnight, it’s not instantaneous. But slowly, over time, you begin to transform. Each day you get a little stronger, until one day, you wake up and realize you hardly feel the weight at all. The weight has become easier to carry. It becomes second nature, a part of who you are. You carry it with you without even noticing it’s there. You have transformed into a stronger, more capable, more selfless version of yourself without even noticing.Motherhood is so heavy, but you’re strong enough to carry it.――――-(See original article published here)Oh, what’s that, you say?
