She died on April 12, 2010, but in my head, today was that day. My daughter pointed my error out to me on the phone. I was astonished that I had mistaken the day. Letting Mom go was excruciating, but one of my daughters and I were there with her, as was my sister and her daughters. While we wept, there was joy, too, and reminiscing and release from the pain and frustration that gripped her. It was too soon, but she couldn't speak, and we all understood that a life without the ability to communicate would have driven her crazy. Out the windows of the rehab center to which she had been admitted to recover from some sort of stroke, there were daffodils, shivering in the chilly spring temperature.It is T.S. Eliot who reminds us that April is the cruelest month: memory and desire, days full of promise and regret. The brave daffodils open, but the sun is not yet warm. And today feels full of longing and sorrow, all mixed together, loamy. Perhaps the day got mixed up for me because all week I've been thinking about a beloved student in our school who died three years ago. She would have turned 20 this week. I remember so well her birthday party sophomore year -- it was at the Viking cooking store. I can tell you exactly what my daughter, her good friend, wore that evening. Strange that that particular night is lodged in my memory. What sticks and what doesn't? What do we wish we could forget and what moments do we hope to remember? Other bits about her kept swimming up today -- the way she tossed her gorgeous mane of hair, her laugh, her friendship with my daughter, her knee surgery, her sass and class, the black feather mask she wore at our daughter's bat mitzvah. There are times, at school, when I see her in my mind's eye, turning the corner, appearing at my office door for candy. She loved Swedish Fish.Some months after she died, one of her classmates sat with me and said, ""I think I'm going crazy, Ms. Klotz. Sometimes, I think she is just away, that she'll be back."" And I remember thinking, ""Me, too."" We can only take sips of sorrow -- at the start. We made a garden at school in her honor, and the other day I told the upper school girls about her, about why we have the garden. I explained that I hope, while I am Head, it will always be a contemplative space -- more like a church or temple than a spot for selfies or tanning. The only girls who really knew her are seniors now. Time passes fast in school. Soon, there will come a time when only adults remember her. I was glad to speak about her, though my throat got thick with tears. I didn't want the girls to worry about me, just to understand that grief spools out, that it's a rare day that I do not think about this young woman so many people loved and feel an ache. I want them to know that we are allowed to be sad, that feelings ebb and flow forever.And to mix it up some more, it was just National Sibling Day, a day I did not know existed until, wasting time, I began to scroll through Facebook and discovered it's a thing. So, that made me melancholy because a long time ago, my brother died. That's an old grief that doesn't come up so often any more. Occasionally, I catch a whiff of memory, a moment -- not so much about him as about the anguish his death caused in our family, for all of us. But a few weeks ago, our first cousin died, a person I did not see often, but who was a constant in the landscape of my life. His unexpected death reminded me of earlier griefs, of all the people who go missing from our daily lives, who live on only in the stories that we tell, the pictures that we discover in envelopes tucked in drawers. I knew my cousin much longer than I knew my brother. I knew the child who died in my school better than I knew my cousin. I loved my mother longest. That's not a real equation, just a feeling.So, death happens. And the days continue to turn. And we learn how to grieve, or how to endure loss. But when my sister posted a picture of herself at the Opening Game for the Phillies, last night, all I could see was my dad in her face. He loved going to Phillies games with my sister. And I missed him, too. He died three months to the day before our mother.I went to Jessica's garden Wednesday, stood in the wet. On one of the benches is carved this quotation: ""Your absence runs through me like thread through a needle; everything I do is stitched with its color."" Thank you, W.S. Merwin. For me, grief often feels solitary. Lonesome. Trembling. It is good to have memories. How terrible it would be if people we loved died and we did not miss them. The pain reminds me of the love. Death changes love, but it doesn't erase it. We've planted pansies in the garden -- flowers with tiny faces, brave enough for April.  "

It was a white Ford Explorer tricked out with orange stripes like an emergency vehicle. And it also had round reflectors built into the tail gate. Or were they flashing lights? Above the license plate, there was a very official looking sign, where EMT or POLICE might otherwise be. It said CHAPLAIN.I couldn't help but be jealous. If I could just have one like that but with the sign instead saying PHILOSOPHER. Can you imagine? I sure could. I'd be driving down the road and the radio would squawk. ""Logic Emergency on Front Street. All Philosophers Respond."" I'd hit the lights, and of course the siren, and the gas. Out of the way, everybody. Sage coming through. I'd screech up to the address and dash out of the car. City police would be holding the door open for me. I'd run up the stairs two at a time, and there it would be: a guy splayed out across his desk, with his computer flashing some sort of error message. A detective would be standing there, and he'd look up at me and say, ""It's a conceptual catastrophe.""I'd say, ""What have we got?""The gumshoe would reply. ""I think we need some Aristotle.""I'd look more closely and say, ""No! It's too late for that! Only Kierkegaard will do!"" And, with a Leap of Faith, I'd use just the right aphorism and summon the guy back to life, and conceptual clarity. A gasp would go through the room, and I'd suddenly notice all the other people huddled over at the side. They'd start cheering and clapping. Someone would run up to me and gush appreciation and words of praise for what I had just accomplished.""No Ma'am. No need to thank me. Just another day for a hard working philosopher.""As I came out of my stoplight reverie, I realized why things don't work like this. Oddly, most people go in search of wisdom only when they confront a catastrophe, or disaster that has arisen from unwise decisions. Wanting to avoid the flames of irrational self immolation, they desperately look for insight. And they might find a piece of wisdom here or there that can save them. But philosophy is much better as a powerful preventative medicine than as last minute emergency treatment. It's better applied in small doses throughout our days and decisions. Then, we can most likely avoid cataclysmic personal disasters, at least of the existential sort.So: Don't wait for trouble. Seek wisdom now. Remember, I don't really have the flashing lights and siren. It was just in my imagination. Then again, if things get bad enough, at least chaplain apparently does."

Aided by fighters from the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, it has seized large parts of the camp from other insurgents based there.Krahenbuhl visited a Damascus school where he met several dozen evacuees from Yarmouk.

The court postponed to July 5 the verdict in the trial of Badie and 37 others for inciting violence that killed two people last summer. But it sentenced to death 10 defendants who are on the run, and a final ruling on their cases is expected the same day once they are reviewed.

The group says it is committed to peaceful activism and had nothing to do with Islamist militant violence in Egypt since Mursi's fall following mass protests against his rule.Egypt's mass trials of Brotherhood members and people accused of links to the group, as well as its tough crackdown on Islamist and liberal opposition alike, have drawn international criticism of its judicial system and human rights record.The sentences, pronounced at a televised court session on Saturday, can be appealed before Egypt's highest civilian court in a process that could take years to reach a final verdict.U.S.-Egyptian citizen Mohamed Soltan was sentenced to life in jail for supporting the veteran Islamist movement and transmitting false news. He is the son of Brotherhood preacher Salah Soltan, who was among those sentenced to death.The White House condemned the sentencing, calling for Soltan's immediate release and citing concerns for his health. It added that he would continue to receive U.S. diplomatic support ""until he can return safely to the United States.""Mohamed Abdel-Mawgod, one of the defense lawyers, also condemned the verdicts. ""The court did not differentiate between the defendants and put them all in the same basket,"" he told reporters at the courthouse. None of the defendants were present during the hearing.Badie is the Brotherhood's General Guide and has already been sentenced to several death and life sentences. The son of his deputy Khairat El-Shater was given a life sentence on Saturday. ""OPERATIONS ROOM"" TRIALRights groups say Egypt, where a popular uprising toppled veteran autocrat Hosni Mubarak in 2011 and started years of political turmoil, is now cracking down on all dissent. Sisi says stability is needed to revive the shattered economy.Rights advocates have criticized a U.S. decision to end a freeze on military aid to Cairo, saying Washington is putting human rights on the back burner. The United States has said the decision to end the freeze was in the interest of national security.Mohamed Soltan, 27, arrested in August 2013, had been on hunger strike while in prison.""He deserves the punishment because of the money and instructions from the Brotherhood which were found with him, and for spreading chaos and horror in society,"" presiding Judge Mohamed Nagi Shehata told reporters.Sara Mohamed, a relative of the Soltan family, said they would appeal the verdict. ""It was a farce trial of the first class ... None of the defendants attended the session,"" she told Reuters by phone.A website calling for Mohamed Soltan's release says he was not a member of the Brotherhood, describing him as a U.S.-educated peace activist who was involved in youth events and charities. The website shows pictures of him lying emaciated on a stretcher while in detention.Saturday's case was known in local media as ""The Rabaa Operations Room"" trial. This is in reference to a sit-in at Rabaa square in 2013 in which hundreds of people protesting at the overthrow of Mursi were killed when security forces tried to clear the area by force.Cairo has defended its actions, saying it had given protesters the opportunity to leave peacefully and that armed elements within the Brotherhood initiated the violence.Saturday's session sentenced 51 people. Those who were not sentenced to death were given a life term. The long list of charges included leading and funding an outlawed group, overturning the constitution and planning to spread chaos, a court source said.

But love her or hate her, she's now a two-time Presidential candidate. Perhaps some of her divisiveness comes from the struggle many ambitious women experience: The complex push-and-pull between who she is, who she wants to be and what society expects her to be. (I should caveat this by saying that I am not a psychologist or trained to analyze people I have never met. What follows is purely my interpretation of what I see.)Clinton has traveled a long way to get to this point, and the path still seems unsteady. She seems to have an ""authenticity problem."" She is often perceived as aloof, perhaps hiding something and closed-off. I think maybe she comes off this way because she's navigating a strange road between being the politician she is and being a woman as society and her advisers (and possibly she, herself) expect her to be. She has sometimes struggled with her image as a ""woman in politics,"" but it's what she is, complete with all the baggage that comes with it.Clinton was going to be a divisive figure from the start. Despite a successful law career, she was introduced to the world in the context of a potential First Lady. Let's be real: In 1992, people had expectations about what a First Lady was supposed to look like and do, and it was a very feminine role filled with serving tea and wearing designer ball gowns. Decorate the White House for Christmas. Talk to the wives of diplomats, not the diplomats themselves. Clinton was not one to sit back and do what was expected, though. Her foray into healthcare reform was highly criticized. She was trying to get into real policy work, which was not typically part of the First Lady's portfolio. She did it anyway. Meanwhile, a lot of the country discussed her clothes and haircut.A few years later, she shifted gears. The idea of the Hillary Clinton we know now writing It Takes a Village seems incredibly strange to me. In my mind, it's indicative of her trying to fit into the expectations of First Lady while still having a voice. Shouldn't she have been writing policy or legal briefs about issues on which she had incredible expertise? Instead, it feels like a forced attempt to remake her image as a more motherly First Lady. Fast-forward to 2015, and almost no one questions that she has the experience necessary to run for President. But she's still an incredibly divisive person. She has a contentious relationship with the media. There are constant rumors of discord in her campaigns and paranoia in her actions. She has trouble balancing ""tough"" and ""shrill"". (I'm pretty sure male politicians wouldn't be referred to as ""shrill."") People still talk about her haircut and her clothes.I find myself sympathetic to Clinton -- not because I agree with her political views -- but because I identify with the battles I imagine she's fought externally and internally as a career-minded woman. I see the pull between who I am, who I want to be and what I think society wants from women. My career has determined where my husband and I go, and in nine years together, that's been from Texas to Oklahoma to North Carolina to New York. Oh, and I'm 30 and don't have children, and I have no plans for them. I have all kinds of career plans, though. I can see the disapproval on some people's faces when they learn that. It's easy to imagine how Hillary Clinton faced similar attitudes. She may not have been determining where they lived, and she did have a child, but I think she had to feel the pressure to be a classic southern wife and mother in 1980s Arkansas. Instead, she was a wife and mother with a pretty successful law career. And, certainly, there was pressure to be a more traditional First Lady when she moved into the White House. I can see how she might get defensive about her choices -- I know I get that way if I think someone is questioning mine. Feminism was a few decades behind where I grew up in rural Texas, and that stuck with me, so sometimes I still think something is wrong with me for not being happy following a more ""traditional"" path. If others validate that inner struggle by raising an eyebrow at my choices, it makes me angry and frustrated. Perhaps this is part of what we've seen from Clinton over the last 20-plus years.So, Hillary, I'm going to have a pretend conversation with you, like you once said you did with Eleanor Roosevelt. As you embark on this campaign, please unapologetically and completely be yourself. If that is a tough, ruthless politician, just do it instead of trying to balance external (or internal) standards of what women should do. But, let us see you as human, too -- if you struggle, don't hide it. Everyone needs to see that it's not easy. No hiding behind email servers or campaign spokespeople when something comes out wrong. Trust me, the people who won't vote for you aren't changing their minds, regardless of what you do, so you might as well be who you are.I'm not sure what I think you'd say back to me, but I really hope it would be that your conversations with Eleanor have helped you develop a thick enough skin to be yourself on this campaign regardless of what you think Americans want or what anyone tells you."
12,POLITICS,The Changing Face of China's Military: Changes in PLA Military Diplomacy Under Xi Jinping,"China Hands, ContributorFor Future Leaders in US-China Relations",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-changing-face-of-chin_b_7050956.html,The PLA's increasing willingness to participate in joint exercises with other nations allows the PLA to showcase the new capabilities that have resulted from its modernization and helps the PLA maintain its security interests in the region and around the world.,2015-04-12,2015-04-12-1428873821-1150817-0023ae9885da136c2655271375857887457.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-12-1428873821-1150817-0023ae9885da136c2655271375857887457-thumb.jpg,"At a meeting that took place in Beijing in January 2015, Chinese President and Chairman of the Central Military Commission Xi Jinping called upon People's Liberation Army (PLA) officers to start ""a new phase of military diplomacy."" During the meeting, Xi explained the crucial role of PLA foreign relations in China's foreign policy by describing how ""diplomacy through military exchanges"" promotes China's overall diplomatic work to the international community, and stressing that such exchanges play a significant role in maintaining China's national security. Yet while Xi called for this ""new phase"" earlier this year, China's emphasis on greater PLA foreign relations has already been clearly evidenced by the PLA's greater willingness to participate in joint exercises and training sessions with foreign militaries over the last few years. The PLA has increased its number of exercises with foreign militaries significantly over the past 3 years.The effects of this emphasis are first noticeable when comparing the number of bilateral and multilateral military exchanges during former Chinese president Hu Jintao's rule and that of current president Xi Jinping. Under Hu, the annual number of exercises hovered around zero or one exercise per year until 2006, grew to five exercises in 2007, dropped to two exercises in 2008, and eventually reached nine exercises at the end of his rule in 2012.Yet the increased emphasis on PLA foreign relations is especially evident in 2014, when the number of PLA joint exercises with foreign militaries grew from seven in 2013 to sixteen in 2014.During a press conference at the end of 2014, Defense Ministry spokesman Yang Yujun described how the PLA conducted more military exercises with other countries, and how such exercises enhanced the PLA's capabilities to carry out diverse missions. While Yang explained how the PLA's missions' focuses ""expanded from non-traditional security to traditional security"", he stressed that they also ""boosted mutual trust [and] deepened cooperation"" between countries, and ""demonstrated [the PLA's] fine image on the international stage.""Last year, most of the PLA's joint exercises focused on humanitarian aid and disaster response (HA/DR) and military operations other than war (MOOTW). This includes unprecedented PLA Army and Air Force efforts in searching for the missing Malaysian airliner (MH370). Most of the HA/DR exercises were performed multilaterally or bilaterally with ASEAN member states, Russia, and New Zealand.The PLA also took part in other joint exercises for the first time. In addition to China participating in the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise after being an observer for several years, China sent its first PLA Army infantry unit to a United Nations peacekeeping operation and deployed medical troops to aid West Africa in fighting Ebola.  In 2014, approximately sixty-five percent of China's exercises were with countries in Asia, with a majority of those being Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states. China also exercises with European militaries and works closely with members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), especially Russia. This is seen in the annual ""Peace Mission"" Joint Counter-terrorism Exercises the PLA conducts with the other SCO members. On the other hand, China has no record of participating in military exercises with Japan.The PLA's increasing willingness to participate in joint exercises with other nations allows the PLA to showcase the new capabilities that have resulted from its modernization and helps the PLA maintain its security interests in the region and around the world. Given Xi's exhortation for greater PLA foreign relations to realize the ""Chinese Dream"" that includes making China ""a stronger nation with a strong military"", we can expect to see the PLA continue participating in bilateral and multilateral joint exercises with foreign militaries in the future._________Alexis Dale-Huang is a research intern at the Center for the Study of Chinese Military Affairs, part of National Defense University's Institute for National Strategic Studies, and an undergraduate student at the University of Southern California.

So much scandal these days! This week opened with a very Good Wife-y montage of Alicia being interviewed by an evil journalist who wants to take her down. The email leak breaks and we see that it won't be an easy ride for Saint Alicia. Especially because there are some steamy emails between her and Will in the dump. Eli enlists Peter's help to clear her name and two very good things come from this. The first is about those steamy emails. We always knew it was hot and heavy between those two and that it was an intense emotional and physical affair. But we never got the romance. In the (sort of) cheesy emails between them, you have them admitting their desires and all the good stuff. It's funny how a year after his death on the show, we finally get a full picture of who he was to Alicia and how he felt about her. Same goes for Peter. He and Alicia share oversized glasses of wine in the kitchen to strategize and catch up. He's no rookie and gives her advice. They laugh. The moment comes when Alicia wonders outloud of they've finally made it to the other side -- where they can be ex-husband and wife and not hate each other. She tells him he's disgusted her and speaks for all of us (or at least me) when she laughs off his come hither eyes. ""It's always about where you can stick it,"" she tells him. And it is. Peter's always been a jerk and maybe I was always so biased by the fact that he's also Chris Noth. Peter Florrick is no Big. The other shoe drops in the cliffhanger. They clear the sexy stuff with the television station in an Ocean's Eleven like little plot where everyone has a role, a line, and a cue. But then they allege voter fraud. It's big time trouble now. Meanwhile, Kalinda is on the hook for falsifying that meta data. Her lies are catching up to her and if you were wondering how they were going to do her character's farewell, now we know. She could be going to prison. Maybe Bishop disappears her like he offered Cary earlier this season. It's all coming together. One big question, though. Diane was consulting on a case based on the recent ""religious freedom"" laws passed in Indiana. But the episode was probably filmed long before that. How'd you do it, guys?

16,POLITICS,"History Now Made, The U.S. And Cuba Face A Bumpy Road Ahead",,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/us-cuba-relations_n_7051080.html,,2015-04-12,"US President Barack Obama (R) shakes hands with Cuba's President Raul Castro (L) on the sidelines of the Summit of the Americas at the ATLAPA Convention Center on April 11, 2015 in Panama City. AFP PHOTO/MANDEL NGAN (Photo credit should read MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f2481f00003d02257d15.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Daniel Trotta and Matt SpetalnickPANAMA CITY, April 12 (Reuters) - Cuba and the United States just made history. Now comes the hard part.In the first meeting of its kind in nearly 60 years, U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban leader Raul Castro sat down together for over an hour on Saturday at a regional summit in Panama, moving a step closer to restoring diplomatic ties.It was the result of nearly two years of secret talks and quiet diplomacy and the mood was positive, both inside the room and out, where Latin American leaders praised Obama for ending decades of U.S. hostility toward the communist-ruled island.Obama clearly sees Cuba as a possible success story for his policy of engaging U.S. foes.At a time of multiple risks to his foreign policy record - from Iran's nuclear program and the war in Syria to Russian involvement in Ukraine and the violence of Islamic State - getting on well with Cuba looks relatively easy.""The Cold War is over,"" Obama said. ""I think there is a strong majority both in the United States and in Cuba that says our ability to engage, to open up commerce and travel and people-to-people exchanges is ultimately going to be good for the Cuban people.""Yet the gulf between the two sides remains wide, illustrated by the absence of U.S. and Cuban flags at the carefully orchestrated meeting on Saturday in a sparsely furnished conference room.The U.S. economic embargo, which has blocked nearly all trade between the two nations for the last five decades, is firmly in place. Cuba's human rights record stills draw scorn from Washington, as does U.S. foreign policy from Havana.""Let's not fool ourselves. We have a lot of differences,"" said Castro, 83, who has been an enemy of the United States for most of his life and still railed passionately against its past policies even as he praised Obama as ""an honest man.""""In other words, we're willing to talk about everything with patience, with a lot of patience,"" added the army general and younger brother of revolutionary leader Fidel Castro.Obama and Castro announced in December they would work to re-establish full diplomatic ties severed in 1961, reopen embassies in each other's capitals and free up trade and travel.Restoring diplomatic relations is easy enough, requiring little more than the presidents' agreement. But normalizing overall relations could take years.Cuba has shown no signs that it is willing to allow wider political rights. The government dismisses dissidents as mercenaries, moves quickly to stifle dissent, and Castro has made clear he does not intend to allow any relaxation of Communist Party rule.And while Cuba is looking to draw in foreign investment, any U.S. businesses seeking to set up there need the government's blessing. Castro's government moves cautiously, as it has shown with its own market-style economic reforms in recent years. TERRORISM LISTIn the short term, Cuba is still waiting to be removed from the U.S. State Department's list of state sponsors of terrorism, a unilateral designation that Cuba rejects as unjust.Obama is expected to inform Congress within a few days he is taking Cuba off the list, which would free the island from some economic sanctions.There had been some expectations that Obama would announce his intention to remove the terrorism designation and move forward on restoring diplomatic relations at the summit.Though there is little doubt that Havana will be taken off the blacklist, U.S. officials privately have made clear that they have sought to use the timing of the move as leverage in broader normalization negotiations.A number of unresolved issues have slowed down the process, including Washington's wish that Cuba allow U.S. diplomats to travel around the island and relax the police presence around the diplomatic mission in Havana, where visiting Cubans are closely watched.""They're building a road, and when you're building a road you don't expect to finish right away,"" Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, speaking in Panama, said of the U.S.-Cuba relationship.Obama wants the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress to dismantle the embargo and some allies believe a coalition of Democrats and Republican free-marketeers may succeed.It could be a long battle.The U.S. president has already used his executive powers to ease travel restrictions to Cuba, and allow U.S. importers to buy goods from independent Cuban contractors and exporters to ship building materials to private Cuban companies.He has so far used those powers sparingly, however, and Cuba would like him to go further.""President Obama retains ample executive authority ... to eliminate the embargo,"" said Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez.U.S. officials acknowledge Obama can ease more restrictions on his own, within limits, but they are waiting to see the results of the latest changes before deciding future measures.While Cuba is keen to reopen embassies and see more U.S. sanctions lifted, U.S. officials say the communist government appears intent on moving slowly toward full normalization, fearful that a quick opening in areas like travel, trade and Internet access might loosen its grip on Cuban society.The meeting between Obama and Castro was marked by what one U.S. official described as a spirited back-and-forth over issues that divide them, including human rights and press freedoms.""There wasn't tension,"" the official said, adding that there were also ""lighter moments"" when the leaders marveled at how unimaginable such a meeting would have been not long ago.

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f2122100002501c96dcf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every election cycle can be considered, first and foremost, a monument to hype. With every passing week, the political world is a blizzard of brash predictions, bold pronouncements, and bad advice. This year, your Speculatroners shall convene every Sunday and attempt to decode and defang in a way that will hopefully leave you feeling unharmed and less confused. We hope this helps, but as always, we make no guarantees!***Former senator and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is set to finally make official her intentions of running for president this Sunday, and on this occasion, we'll note -- as we and everyone else have noted many times before -- that her past will hang over the entire proceedings. By now, we're familiar with the story. Clinton is part of a ""political dynasty,"" and she'll carry that baggage whether she likes it or not. Her long career, while providing her with plenty of political experience, will nevertheless challenge her to find ways to be ""new"" at a moment when, we are told, the ""people"" are ready for ""change."" And of course, there is Clinton's long and rocky relationship with the media, a tale that's been told and retold in so many different ways that we're genuinely surprised DC Comics hasn't optioned it for a gritty reboot.This week, New York magazine's Jason Zengerle replowed another one of these old rows in a piece titled ""Is Hillary Clinton Any Good At Running For President? (And How Much Does It Matter, Anyway?)"" Once again, the past puts the first stamp on the present. After all, Clinton did once do this thing (running for president), and we remember how that thing went (doubleplusungood), and damned if this new thing (running for president again) doesn't remind us of that other thing that previously happened.There was a little sparring on the Internets over this piece. Gawker's Hamilton Nolan referred to it as ""The Platonic Ideal Of Horse Race Journalism,"" and in case you aren't getting the irony, it's that the Platonic Ideal of horse race journalism is actually something much less than the Platonic Ideal of journalism itself. Trivial nonsense tends to rise up in the news cycle at these times, creating opportunity costs for more substantive explorations of important issues. Per Nolan:Team A has a new strategy! Team B made a mistake! Team C has a new manager! This style of ""horse race journalism"" has the effect of completely obscuring the issues underlying these political campaigns. So why do reporters do this? Because it is easy. It is easier to cover campaigns like this, and it requires less thought, and it leaves journalists less prone to being attacked by one side or another, and it is, in general, purely speculative rubbish which cannot be truly refuted. So it is what we get.Zengerle raised mild objections on Twitter, saying that while he agrees ""that horserace journalism is a scourge,"" it's also ""reality"" and thus ""important to try to understand the ways it does -- and does not -- effect elections [sic]."" And in fact, Zengerle's piece makes an honest attempt to explore this, at times reading like it was written to arm its author against the tendencies Nolan reviles. The truth is that not all horse race journalism is created alike. Some of it is alive in the present moment and displays an understanding, on the author's part, of which things matter and which things do not. And some of it is empty-headed doggerel completely free of any signs of self-awareness. We can recognize the latter version when we see it -- like when 20 reporters assign themselves the task of ""guessing"" when Clinton's launch date will be, or when the news of Clinton's having procured office space leads journalists to treat Brooklyn as some kind of previously undiscovered Xanadu.Andrew Gelman at The Washington Post recently pointed out one particular ""tell"" of bad horse race journalism: Its ""wheels"" are ""greased"" with ""empty platitudes."" Gelman cites a recent New Yorker piece in which David Remnick wrote: ""The 2008 Democratic race was not just good sport; it also made Obama and Clinton better.""Gelman's response:Huh? Where did that come from?Similar platitudes show up in Zengerle's piece. The 2008 race was ""the campaign as soap opera""! The 2012 election was ""Nate Silver's world."" It's possible that Zengerle is offering these fact-free assertions as a way of critiquing them, but it's hard to tell, because these are the kind of sad, lightweight ideas that show up in political reporting like nitrogen shows up in the planet's atmosphere. There's a sort of truth to these assertions, sure, but they tend to feel like placeholder sentences, something that a pundit or a reporter ended up including because they felt like the paragraph had to be a certain length. Rarely do these declarations feel like the product of an engaged, analytical mind.Moreover, this lorem-ipsum style of political journalism tends to be shaped by the peculiar media obsessions of the moment, rather than by how people are living their actual lives and making actual political choices. This is how Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who will not be running for president, nevertheless gets cast as Clinton's foil. The media believes that ""foils"" make ""candidates"" better, and in this case, one needed to be invented. From there, the story runs away with itself -- and it escapes so quickly that no one takes the time to explore why the differences between Clinton and Warren may actually be significant. It's enough for most political reporters to note that Warren is ""against the banks"" and would ""challenge Clinton from the left"" and leave it there.Just because I've centered this discussion on Hillary Clinton doesn't mean that this stuff only happens when she's involved. It happens everywhere and to everybody. Clinton is important here, though, for two reasons. One is, let's face it, trivial: She's newsy at the moment. (See, I'm not immune from this either.) But what's really unique about Clinton is that she, like no other political figure, seems to be particularly locked in an embrace with the political press, somewhere deep inside Plato's cave, informed only by the lights and shadows that each is casting at the other. (The New York Times, probably unintentionally, illustrated this on its most recent Clinton campaign piece by using a photograph, seen here and above, that depicts Clinton encased in dark, amorphous shadows.)Over at The New Republic, Elspeth Reeve has written an utterly wonderful exploration of this, noting that the media's perennial demand for Hillary Clinton to be more ""authentic"" always backfires on everyone, because the media doesn't really understand what ""authenticity"" is, and whenever Clinton actually evinces any of it, the media recoils in disgust and confusion. I fear that this whole ""Hillary has got to be new!"" thing is the same soup, just reheated. What evidence is there, after all, that political reporters understand ""new""? How do they define what is and what isn't a cutting-edge policy idea? When President Barack Obama talked at great length about climate change during his second inaugural address, political pundits called it ""bold."" But for people who'd already been involved in the science of climate change and the policy prescriptions to combat it, talking about climate change was anything but ""bold."" It just seemed bold to the media, because it hadn't been what they expected. Reeve lists a number of occasions when Clinton's expressions of authenticity caused a backlash, but the one that sticks out in my mind is what Reeve refers to as Clinton's ""most famous feminist moment,"" this sound bite from 1992: ""I suppose I could've stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided to do was to fulfill my profession, which I entered before my husband was in public life.""As Reeve notes, ""history has mostly forgotten that Clinton was responding to Jerry Brown’s claim that her law firm benefited from Arkansas state business, and not speaking about stay-at-home moms."" That's probably because Clinton got pilloried for saying this. It was authentically her, speaking a truth that was authentically felt by an untold number of women, but the media treated it as if she'd leached something radioactive into the groundwater. As The Boston Globe's Joan Wickersham recalled back in January 2013:She got slammed. The cookie-baking reference was seized upon as evidence not just that Hillary wasn’t a stay-at-home mom, but that she had contempt for women who had made this choice. (What she really had contempt for was the assumption that, for a politician’s wife, this was the only choice.)This is an actual, objectively crazy thing that really happened. And there's no guarantee that minds won't be similarly lost in this election cycle. That's why Reeve offers this advice:To become more “authentic,” Hillary must become even more fake, set us at ease by playing to all the dumb tropes of the popular portrait of the everywoman -- one who is devoted to slopwave food (premium juice, premium oatmeal, kale slurry) but is a little embarrassed about it. A wacky career gal who is unlucky in ... something. Clinton should consider tripping publicly, perhaps while eating yogurt. Then laugh really loud, but not inauthentically loud. The only thing worse than being fake in politics is being real.That is 100 percent correct. But I can't just beat the media about the head, here. This cuts both ways. Clinton and her camp have nurtured their own grievances with the media to such a degree that their every move now seems to be hyper-informed by the cameras. They're like a jumpy cat that's convinced itself that any minute now, someone's going to tromp on its tail because they love to watch it yelp. Take, for example, all of the news leading up to Clinton's announcement. It's been prefaced by breaking stories of new staff hires, the fundamental message being that there will be a more sunny, optimistic campaign disposition and a complete image makeover coming down the pike. We're also told that the launch will be noteworthy in its intimate approach to voters, and that it will intentionally de-emphasize the woman at the center. As CNN's Jeff Zeleny and Dan Merica describe it:As she and a coterie of advisers prepare to launch her presidential campaign, their work is guided by a new set of humble principles: No big crowds. Few soaring rallies. Less mention of her own ambitions. And extinguish the air of inevitability propelling her candidacy.That's all fine and dandy, but you have to understand that this story only exists because the Clinton campaign took pains to provide it. So mindful of their old story, they are now telling the story about how they intend to tell a new story. Every campaign puts a lot of effort into spin, of course. But it seems like in Clinton's case, there's a great deal of fear that the media is so informed by everything that's come before that this current moment will go unremarked upon if Clinton's team doesn't intercede.Clinton can't possibly run for president if she's constantly looking over her shoulder, watching for the gremlins of the past. She will face a lot of tough questions from people focused on the present, who will be trying to do right by the public they serve. It's going to be important for Clinton to be able to distinguish what matters now, and not to reflexively assume that every difficult moment that arises is steeped in some ancient enmity. Clinton's history, her successes and her failures are, of course, fair game for anyone seeking to assay her chances of winning this election, and what sort of president she might be. All of the changes to her campaign staff, and the themes she's targeting as she formally enters the race, demonstrate that she's as aware as everyone else that it has to be this way. The thing that needs to happen, if we're going to avoid an onslaught of the thoughtless ""rubbish"" Nolan warned about, is not for the parties involved here to give passes to one another, but rather for them to make a game effort to stay focused on what matters to people right now. It's time for everyone to step away from the shadowplay in the cavern's depths and ascend back into the world.Would you like to follow me on Twitter? Because why not?"

We raised concerns about weak rule of law states, absence of independent judiciaries and rampant corruption in most of Eastern Europe's former communist countries. There are a few bright spots including Estonia whose transition to market economy was led by principled reform leader Mart Laar. Estonia is ranked 2nd freest in Europe region and among top ten in the world in 2015 Index. In defining the significance of economic freedom, one must look at the critical relationship between individuals and the government. The authors of the 2015 Index of Economic Freedom, published by the Heritage Foundation in partnership with the Wall Street Journal, states, ""The highest forms of economic freedom should provide an absolute right of property ownership, full freedom of movement for labor, capital and goods; and an absolute absence of coercion or constraint of economic activity beyond that which is necessary for the protection and maintenance of liberty itself."" The Index of Economic Freedom demonstrates that higher levels of economic freedom lead to higher GDP per capita, higher standard of living, reduced poverty, more education opportunities, better health care, improved environmental performance and effective and democratic governance. Decades of experience and research in economic development and transition economies provide a clear template of principles needed to achieve higher levels of economic growth. The Heritage Foundation/The Wall Street Journal's Index of Economic Freedom classifies these principles in four broad categories over which governments typically exercise some policy control: rule of law, government size, regulatory efficiency and open markets.

In contrast with the narrative on reform preferred by the EU, which focuses mostly on governmental compatibility with EU norms -- which in some cases actually hinder economic freedom rather than enabling it -- this index seeks to answer the questions of essential interest to the average person. Does the government let me keep my money, or does it confiscate a lot of it as taxes? Is private property protected in general? Can I get a job easily? If I run a business, can I hire and fire easily when I need to? Can I buy and sell easily within the country, and across its borders? Does the government compete against private businesses, or does it want them to thrive? Shall I be able to enforce my contract? How important is corruption in this picture? The index grades countries on questions like these. It is along such lines that its authors have once again, as in years past, graded as ""repressed"" the category of the rule of law, which encompasses property rights and freedom from corruption, in all the countries in southeast Europe including Romania. Milton Friedman, Nobel Laureate in Economics, affirmed the importance of property rights by stating that it was ""the most basic of human rights and an essential foundation for other human rights.""Romania'e economic freedom score is 66.6 in 2015 Index, making it a moderately free economy. As a result of Romania's overall economic freedom score increasing by 1.1 point year-on-year, Romania jumped from 29th to 27th place, out of 43 rated countries in the Europe region and from 62nd to 57th place out of 178 rated countries in the world ranking of the 2015 Index of Economic Freedom. The largest increase in 2015 Index of Economic Freedom year-on-year, Romania experienced in freedom from corruption (+5.3), labor freedom (+3.4), government spending (+3.1), monetary (+0.2) and trade freedom (+0.2). During the same time, business freedom (-1.2) decreased, due to the fact that efficient bankruptcy procedures and rules have not been fully implemented, according to the 2015 Index. Romania's major weaknesses in the 2015 Index persisted in the area of rule of law, encompassing property rights and freedom from corruption which are both rated as ""repressed."" 2015 Index included the country data by June 30, 2014 which partly reflected Romania's improvements in combatting corruption. In the meantime, one thing is becoming clear -- by making major strides in combatting corruption and organized crime, Romania is becoming a regional leader. As reported by BBC, Romania's National Anti-Corruption Directorate convicted 1,138 leading public figures, including top politicians, businessmen, judges and prosecutors in just one year. The most recent Cooperation and Verification Mechanism (CVM) report by the European Commission in January 2015 commended Romania's efforts: The action taken by the key judicial and integrity institutions to address high-level corruption has maintained an impressive momentum, and has carried through into increased confidence amongst Romanians about the judiciary in general, and the anti-corruption prosecution in particular. Out of ten categories of economic freedom, Romania is rated as economically ""free"" in three areas: fiscal freedom, trade freedom and investment freedom. In order to increase economic freedom for its citizens and enable them to achieve higher standards of living, Romania needs to continue its efforts to eradicate corruption and establish an independent and efficient judicial system. These reforms need to become irreversible. Romania also needs to reduce government spending, further increase flexibility of the labor market and end distorting government subsidies. All 10 categories of economic freedom are in government policy domain and the combination of legislative framework and government policies can be pursued to increase economic freedom of country's citizens:1) Raise and support political leaders committed to integrity, combatting corruption, and establishing the rule of law, by setting up clear ethics rules for those acceding to power. 2) Shine a bright light on corrupt practices and then eliminate them. 3) Reduce the tax burden. 4) Cut government spending. 5) Simplify the process to register, operate and close a business. 6) Enable employers and employees to freely contract the terms of employment. 7) Maintain price stability through low inflation and allow market pricing to prevail. 8) Eliminate tariffs and non-tariff barriers. 9) Enable investment in all sectors to domestic and foreign investors without barriers. 10) Enable greater competition of the financial sector and encourage capital market development.The necessary prerequisite for the implementation of each of these measures is the rule of law. In each of these measures, the same laws apply to all citizens and no individual is above the law. No individual, an organization or an owner(s) of a company can be favored -- no special interest should be allowed. Corruption is to be severely punished. Romania needs to provide conditions to advance economic freedom based on the rule of law. Only then can its leaders create opportunity for all and favoritism for none."

We raised concerns about weak rule of law states, absence of independent judiciaries and rampant corruption in most of Eastern Europe's former communist countries. There are a few bright spots including Estonia whose transition to market economy was led by principled reform leader Mart Laar. Estonia is ranked 2nd freest in Europe region and among top ten in the world in 2015 Index. In defining the significance of economic freedom, one must look at the critical relationship between individuals and the government. The authors of the 2015 Index of Economic Freedom, published by the Heritage Foundation in partnership with the Wall Street Journal, states, ""The highest forms of economic freedom should provide an absolute right of property ownership, full freedom of movement for labor, capital and goods; and an absolute absence of coercion or constraint of economic activity beyond that which is necessary for the protection and maintenance of liberty itself."" The Index of Economic Freedom demonstrates that higher levels of economic freedom lead to higher GDP per capita, higher standard of living, reduced poverty, more education opportunities, better health care, improved environmental performance and effective and democratic governance. Decades of experience and research in economic development and transition economies provide a clear template of principles needed to achieve higher levels of economic growth. The Heritage Foundation/The Wall Street Journal's Index of Economic Freedom classifies these principles in four broad categories over which governments typically exercise some policy control: rule of law, government size, regulatory efficiency and open markets. These categories incorporate 10 specific components of economic freedom. Each economy receives an overall economic freedom score based on the weighted average of 10 economic freedoms, each graded on a scale from 0 to 100, with 100 being the best. In contrast with the narrative on reform preferred by the EU, which focuses mostly on governmental compatibility with EU norms -- which in some cases actually hinder economic freedom rather than enabling it -- this index seeks to answer the questions of essential interest to the average person.

Photo courtesy FARS News AgencyThe second battle of Tikrit is now over. It began on March 2 and lasted until April 4, when Iraqi commanders confirmed that the last pocket of Islamic State militants in the city had been eliminated. The battle pitted a combined force of approximately 30,000 Iraqi soldiers consisting of approximately 1,000 to 3,000 fighters from assorted local Sunni militias, roughly 3,000 to 4,000 men from the Iraqi army and about 20,000 members of various Shiite paramilitary militias. About 9,000 men were directly involved in the assault on the city while the remaining were either held in reserve or were deployed in defensive positions surrounding the city. In addition, 40 officers from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force, including Quds Force General Qasem Soleimani, were on the scene to direct the fighting. Iranian operated drones were deployed over Tikrit. There were also unsubstantiated reports of limited Iranian air strikes in support of the initial offensive. The United States initially was not involved in the operation. Later, at the request of the Iraqi government, in conjunction with British and Dutch air forces, the U.S. provided air support during the push into Tikrit's city center in the second half of the campaign. It is not clear whether the U.S. had any personnel on the ground directing the air attacks.The strength of Islamic State militants in the city has been estimated as being in a range from under 1,000 militants to as many as 13,000. The latter number seems too high as it would have represented a significant portion of the total strength of Islamic State. To date only about a 1,000 IS fighters have been accounted for, with 80 captured and between 700 and 1,000 killed. While it is likely that a few militants did escape through the Iraqi lines, it is unlikely that a force that large would have made it through the security cordon surrounding the city without being noticed or being engaged. A loss of that magnitude would have been a crippling blow to Islamic State. A more likely estimate is that the number of IS militants in the city was approximately 2,000 to 3,000 or so and that the number was reduced to around a 1,000 as the city was surrounded. Badr Militia During the Second Battle of Tikrit. Photo courtesy FARS news agency.This was the first major city in the Sunni Triangle to be recaptured by Iraqi forces. It was the third time the Iraqi government forces had attempted to oust Islamic State militants from the city. Although the Baghdad government has had a number of successes against Islamic State militants since the start of the year, this was by far its most significant military victory.The Second Battle of Tikrit tells us a great deal about the difficulties that Iraqi forces will encounter in the campaign to roll back the Islamic State in Iraq, how that campaign will unfold and the likelihood of its success.1. Iraqi forces initially made rapid progress in capturing outlying areas and encircling the city. The only significant engagement was the battle, on March 9, to capture the town of Al-Alam in the northeast of Tikrit. Islamic State forces had dug a tunnel connecting Tikrit to Al-Alam. The town represented the only avenue of escape for the IS militants. When it fell, it completed the encirclement of Tikrit. The terrain surrounding Tikrit was relatively flat, easy terrain and lacked any kind of defense in depth. Such terrain is particularly vulnerable to air power. Moreover, the significant superiority in manpower and the Iranian practice of using ""swarm tactics"" to overwhelm an entrenched enemy with masses of mobile, lightly armed infantry units, proved effective in surrounding Islamic State positions and cutting them off from further reinforcement.Given the overwhelming numerical superiority in Iraqi forces, Islamic State militants had little interest in fighting a pitched battle and largely took defensive positions in anticipation of the Iraqi attack. Significantly in the summer of 2014, IS militants had successfully attacked Iraqi army forces with far worse odds than they faced at Tikrit. Going forward, it is likely that Islamic State will adopt a defensive posture intent on holding, heavily booby-trapped urban environments in a protracted war of attrition. 2. Once the outlying areas were secured, Iraqi forces made little headway in pushing back IS militants in Tikrit. Faced with a combination of large amounts of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) on the roads leading into the city and surrounding buildings and heavily defended ""bunkers,"" the offensive stalled. Iranian ""swarm tactics"" were less effective in the cramped, street by street battle zone of an urban environment. Moreover, the Iraqi forces lacked practical training in urban warfare.Air power proved to be the key in reducing resistance from Islamic State militants. Historically, air power has had limited effectiveness in supporting ground troops in an urban environment. Helicopters were usually far more effective but they were vulnerable to ground fire and portable surface-to-air missiles like the FIM-92 Stinger. Precision-guided munitions, however, have revolutionized the role of air power in providing close ground support in an urban environment. They allowed American and coalition air forces to specifically target Islamic State strong points in the city and opened up the way for Iraqi forces to advance and take control of Tikrit. Going forward, Iraqi forces will make only slow headway unless their advance is supported by American air power. Shiite Militias at the Second Battle of Tikrit. Photo courtesy FARS news agency.3. The current coalition between the air forces of the United States and its coalition partners, the Iraqi Army, the remnants of the Sunni militias, and the Iranian directed Shia Militias is a highly tenuous one. Following the request of the Baghdad government for American air support, the Kataib Hizbollah (Hezbollah Battalions) and the Asaib Ahl al-Haq (League of the Righteous) militias suspended their participation in the operation in protest. Both militias are controlled by Tehran and it is highly unlikely that they would have withdrawn unless ordered to do so by Iran. It's unclear whether Tehran was sending the Baghdad government a thinly veiled message that it would have to choose between American or Iranian support in the battle against Islamic State or whether the militias in question truly objected to the involvement of the United States. There have been other instances in the past where both militias found themselves in military operations that included American air forces. In those instances they did not hesitate to take advantage of the benefits afforded by U.S. air power. Given the fact that neither the Iranian or the Iraqi air forces have the ability to conduct close ground support with precision-guided munitions, it's hard to see how future operations to take other cities controlled by Islamic State cannot involve American air power. At the very least, it is hard to imagine that an attack on Mosul could take place without the benefit of American air forces providing close ground support.Until newly trained Iraqi army units are deployed, keeping a coalition of such disparate elements together will be a formidable challenge for Baghdad. Moreover, it's not clear if once they are no longer needed, the Shia militias can simply be dismissed and told to return home. Effectively, these militias are a quasi-Iranian proxy army. Tehran may insist on keeping them engaged. 4. According to Iraqi government sources civilian casualties were limited to just two dead. The city had been largely abandoned by its inhabitants. Approximately 30,000 people in Tikrit were displaced by the fighting. The extent of the damage to the city is unclear, but at the very least the fighting destroyed large portions of Tikrit. Moreover, the process of identifying and removing the remaining IEDs, estimated at between 5,000 and 10,000, and making the city habitable, will take many months. Shiite Militiaman Holding Defensive Position Inside Tikrit. Photo courtesy FARS news agency.The larger cities in Anbar controlled by Islamic State, Ramadi and Fallujah, have significant populations. Mosul's population is several million. It's unlikely that these cities will be abandoned the way Tikrit was. Either way, the Iraqi government will either find itself dealing with a large number of displaced refugees or face an urban war zone with a considerable number of civilians present. 5. Large quantities of munitions were expended in the campaign to take Tikrit. Urban warfare, as a general rule, consumes a lot of ammunition. Iranian ""swarm tactics"" coupled with the indiscriminate firing by Shia militias further aggravated the rate of consumption. At this point it's not clear whether resupply of munitions may become a factor as the campaign against Islamic State continues. Most of the militias are armed with Soviet era weapons. 6. Finally, following the capture of the city there were widespread reports of Shia militias engaging in looting and revenge killings against the Sunni inhabitants. For the Sunni inhabitants of Islamic State, liberation is likely to represent a mixed blessing. There was a token force of Sunni militias that participated in the operation, but what role they played after the capture of the city is unclear. Under these conditions, recruiting a significant number of Sunnis to participate in the campaign against Islamic State may prove difficult. With the fall of Tikrit, Baghdad will have to choose whether to proceed northward up the Tigris Valley towards Mosul or to proceed west and secure the balance of Anbar province. Both targets have their advantage.Mosul is the Islamic State's largest city. Retaking Mosul would cripple the Islamic State and leave the remainder of its territories in Iraq linked very tenuously with the balance of its forces in Syria. On the other hand, an attack to the north might prompt Islamic State to mount an offensive against Baghdad from Anbar province as a way of deflecting the campaign to retake Mosul.As of April 11, Baghdad was indicating that it intended to focus first on clearing Anbar province of Islamic State militants and eliminating the threat of an Islamic State attack on Iraq's capital. This might all be subterfuge of course to confuse Islamic State of the true target. Clearing Anbar first, however, is a more prudent strategy and it also defers, for the time being, having to come to an agreement with the Kurdish Regional Government on what role Peshmerga forces will play in the Mosul campaign. If the Iraqi government does in fact decide to clear Anbar province first, then it is going to be very hard to see how the campaign to liberate Mosul can occur before 2016. Tikrit may have been a military victory for the Baghdad government, but its record in fighting the battle underscores the point that Islamic State will not be rolled back without the participation of American air power and that even with U.S. military support, the campaign to roll back Islamic State will be long and hard and will likely extend well into 2016, and possibly beyond. The more protracted the campaign the more jihadist militants will be recruited by Islamic State and the harder it will be to keep the Iraqi coalition together."

Clearing Anbar first, however, is a more prudent strategy and it also defers, for the time being, having to come to an agreement with the Kurdish Regional Government on what role Peshmerga forces will play in the Mosul campaign. If the Iraqi government does in fact decide to clear Anbar province first, then it is going to be very hard to see how the campaign to liberate Mosul can occur before 2016. Tikrit may have been a military victory for the Baghdad government, but its record in fighting the battle underscores the point that Islamic State will not be rolled back without the participation of American air power and that even with U.S. military support, the campaign to roll back Islamic State will be long and hard and will likely extend well into 2016, and possibly beyond. The more protracted the campaign the more jihadist militants will be recruited by Islamic State and the harder it will be to keep the Iraqi coalition together."

Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal said in the Saudi capital Riyadh at a news conference with his French counterpart Laurent Fabius. ""We came to Yemen to help the legitimate authority, and Iran is not in charge of Yemen.""Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Thursday that the air strikes were a ""crime and genocide"" and Iran's president Hassan Rouhani called for a ceasefire and dialog among Yemen's factions.Saudi Arabia and its Sunni Arab allies bombing Yemen fear that Shi'ite Iran seeks hegemony by backing armed Shi'ite groups in the region, a charge the Islamic Republic denies.Former president Saleh was forced to give up power in 2012 after mass protests against his rule, but his loyalists in the military remained in place and now fight alongside the Houthis.The campaign has raised fears that a sectarian proxy war between rivals Riyadh and Tehran will further destabilize the Middle East and potentially destroy the Yemeni state. DRONE STRIKEIn a sign of the military's weakening control, suspected Al Qaeda militants killed an army colonel in the central Shabwa province on Sunday, a local official said.Separately, an al Qaeda leader was killed in an apparent U.S. drone strike on a group of militants west of the port city of Mukalla on the Arabian Sea, residents told Reuters.It was the first reported drone strike against the powerful Yemeni branch of the global militant group since the U.S. evacuated about 100 special forces troops advising Yemeni forces last month.While the United States and its Sunni Gulf allies are worried about the threat from Sunni radicals such as al Qaeda, they also fear the war will increase Iran's influence.Saudi Arabia is concerned its war on the Houthis could spill over the border, but Iran has denied Saudi allegations that it has provided military support to the group.The Houthis also deny getting help from Iran and say their armed campaign is designed to stamp out corruption and Sunni al Qaeda militants.According to the United Nations, the conflict, in which the Houthis seized the capital Sanaa in the north in September, has killed 600 people, wounded 2,200 and displaced 100,000 others.Saudi Arabia's Defense Ministry said on Sunday that the coalition has flown more than 1,200 air sorties over Yemen since the operation began. It added that more than 500 Houthis have also been killed in fighting on Yemen's border, but it was not clear how it arrived at that figure.

He also noted that Republican critics had earlier warned that an interim agreement for negotiations with Iran was fallible, only to be proven wrong. “I would remind you that people have the same dueling narratives, discrepancies, spin -- whatever you want to call it -- with respect to the interim agreement, Bob,” said Kerry. “But in the end, an interim agreement came out exactly as we had described, and what’s important is Iran has not only signed it but has lived up to it in every respect.”Kerry didn’t take the bait to lash back at Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) after the Arizona Republican called him “delusional” for trusting Iran. Instead, he referred viewers to the comments made Sunday by President Barack Obama, who sharply criticized McCain and others for seeming to value the description of the deal being offered by Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei over the assurances of American officials.“That’s not how we’re supposed to run foreign policy, regardless of who’s president or secretary of state,” Obama said. “When you start getting to the point where you are actively communicating that the United States government and our secretary of state is somehow spinning presentations in a negotiation with a foreign power, particularly one that you say is your enemy, that’s a problem.” "

""Everyday Americans need a champion. And I want to be that champion,"" Mrs. Clinton said. ""So I'm hitting the road to earn your vote -- because it's your time. And I hope you'll join me on this journey."" Clinton's highly anticipated announcement video, called ""Getting Started,"" at first features appearances from a diverse cross section of working class Americans. It is positive, hopeful and family-oriented. Clinton, who first appears 90 seconds into the two-minute and eighteen second video, is warm, confident and upbeat. But her message is clearly targeted, ""Americans have fought their way back from tough economic times, but the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top. "" Clinton offered no specific plans on how she will champion everyday Americans. But Clinton is expected to focus her campaign on stagnant wages and income inequality. The U.S. economy has improved greatly since the recession of 2008, but many Americans have not benefited from the progress. And, while likely and declared Republican candidates have forwarded the argument for income equality, their proposed solutions are viewed with suspicion. However, Clinton will have to more clearly articulate her plans for growing the economy in order to connect with lower and middle class voters. While Clinton is not likely to face serious opposition for her own party's nomination, she, nonetheless, faces a serious challenge in differentiating herself from her predecessor. Democrats have failed four of the last five times to win three consecutive terms as president. And more Americans disapprove President Barack Obama's performance than approve it according to most recent polls. President Obama does poorest among those polled on foreign policy. Clinton will have to navigate the tricky shoals of separating herself from President Obama while not alienating his many supporters, especially African Americans. And she has to hope that President Obama does not have a serious enough foreign policy setback during the remainder of his term to hurt her candidacy.Even though her service as Secretary of State would seem to be a strength, Republican candidates will do all they can to diminish this advantage. They will pair her with the president on policy problems in Syria, Libya, Iraq, Iran and Ukraine. They will describe her stint at the State Department as a failure. They will say she achieved nothing while in office except frequent flyer miles. Clinton will need a stronger answer for these kinds of questions than she had for ABC New's Diane Sawyer last year when she did not cite a single accomplishment during her term at State. Perhaps no other presidential candidate is as well known to voters as is Hillary Clinton. She is viewed favorably by almost half those recently polled. But her unfavorable numbers are also very high. Hillary Clinton is a polarizing figure in American politics. Maybe that is why she frequently references her identity as a woman, and better yet, a grandmother. Nonetheless, she will need to make it clear she can accomplish her goals despite a recalcitrant Congress. Americans are tired and frustrated with the Congressional gridlock that has characterized the previous six years on Capitol Hill. But Congressional Republicans have been attacking Clinton for years, and, with her announcement, those attacks will be more amplified. From Whitewater to Benghazi, Clinton continues to be a lightening rod for a litany of charges that galvanize GOP party members and donors against her. Just last week Republican Senator Rand Paul, who announced his candidacy for president, dropped hints in a campaign appearance of a scandal with the Clinton Foundation. While none of these scandals have panned out, Republicans will continue their barrage of attacks. But the more they attack her for these so-called scandals, the more they risk angering and energizing uncommitted Democrat and independent voters to support her. Clinton's challenge will not be fighting off Republican attacks. Rather, it will be to connect with America's working class by clearly laying out what she will do as president to make their lives better. Yes, if elected, she would be the first woman president. Yes, she has no challengers for her party's nomination. But if she campaigns as a front-runner, or as someone who is entitled to the presidency, she will falter.Her unconventional announcement video indicates that this time will be different. But with about 18 months to go before the 2016 elections, a loaded field of Republican candidates attacking her, and record amounts of campaign money being spent, this campaign will no doubt be most unconventional.And it is only just getting started!"
