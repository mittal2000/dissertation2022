0,POLITICS,"You Can Pollute Drinking Water For 300,000 People And Get Just One Month In Prison",Kate Sheppard,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/west-virginia-chemical-spill-sentencing_us_56cf3ecbe4b0bf0dab311a4b,"But, hey, the judge said it was only negligence.",2016-02-25,"Gary Southern, the chemical company's former president, will not exactly do hard time.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_0_0_3520_2490%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"In January 2014, 10,000 gallons of chemicals leaked from a storage facility into the Elk River, a mile and a half upstream from the drinking water intake for 300,000 West Virginians. People lined up for bottled water amid fear and confusion over the long-term health risks.The company that owned the facility, Freedom Industries, was blamed for rusty, poorly maintained tanks that allowed the coal-cleaning chemical 4-methylcyclohexane methanol (MCHM) to seep into the waterway. Freedom Industries filed for bankruptcy within days of the spill.Six company employees were eventually indicted for violating the federal Clean Water Act, after prosecutors argued that they had ""put an entire population needlessly at risk"" and that the spill was ""completely preventable."" Last year, the company's top executive, Gary Southern, pleaded guilty to environmental violations.On Feb. 17, more than two years after the chemical spill, a federal judge handed down Southern's sentence: a month in prison and a mere $20,000 fine.Many West Virginians are calling that punishment inadequate, considering the damage his company did to the region's drinking water. The maximum penalty Southern faced was three years in prison and up to $300,000 in fines. As he handed down the sentence last week, Judge Thomas Johnston of the U.S. District Court in Charleston said he believed this was an issue of negligence, not of criminal action on Southern's part. Charleston Gazette reporter Ken Ward posted the full transcript online.""This event, now two years past, clearly had a disruptive effect on people's lives and, perhaps worst yet, on their trust and safety of the water coming from their pipes,"" said Johnston. ""But the crisis passed. We have no reason to believe that problems related to the water crisis linger in our taps, and I have no evidence -- no evidence before me -- that MCHM, while perhaps an immediate irritant, represents a long-term health threat to anyone."" ""The defendant is hardly a criminal,"" Johnston continued. ""He has no criminal history and has been a businessman most of his life. His crimes are those of careless omission.""Ward also reported that the judge allowed Southern to fly back to his $1.2 million home in Florida on a friend's private plane following the sentencing, but that his Bentley, which the government seized, had not yet been returned to him. Southern will also get credit for time served for the one night he spent in a Florida jail following his December 2014 arrest. Southern's light punishment has left some in the region furious. ""This was not a victimless crime, but the laws were not written to protect the victims,"" said Maya Nye, who served as spokesperson for West Virginia-based People Concerned About Chemical Safety at the time of the spill. Nye is now a graduate student at West Virginia University's School of Public Health.Like others in the region, Nye said she was surprised that charges were even brought against the Freedom Industries employees. That most likely happened, she said, because the spill directly affected so many people in the state's capitol.""That shows you the difference between when poor communities or communities of color are affected and when communities with more wealth and more political clout are affected,"" Nye said.Angie Rosser, executive director of the West Virginia Rivers Coalition, said locals are reacting to Southern's sentencing with a mix of anger and cynicism. ""I think from the get-go, when the company filed bankruptcy, people felt the writing was on the wall that there wouldn't be accountability that equates to the suffering and the damage done,"" said Rosser.Some are also frustrated that the state legislature has rolled back some of the progress made on oversight of chemical storage in the immediate wake of the spill. The legislature had passed a new law shortly after the spill that required more monitoring and enforcement for above-ground storage tanks. But in March 2015, the legislature passed another bill exempting the majority of tanks from that oversight.Now, West Virginia lawmakers are considering legislation that opponents say could further undermine water protections. This week, the state Senate advanced the Regulatory Reform Act of 2016, which seeks to root out regulations that might be ""overly burdensome"" to businesses, potentially including water protections.""The travesty here is that the governor and many state legislators have not learned from what has happened,"" said Mary Anne Hitt, the director of the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign and a West Virginia resident, via email. ""Hundreds of thousands of West Virginia families went weeks without safe water, but too many West Virginia officials are continuing to put polluters ahead of people with light sentencing that lets them off the hook. … We need all of our state leaders and lawmakers to do better and stand up for those who are forced to live with this devastating pollution.""Rosser has been in the state capitol this week lobbying to block the proposed legislation. She said she hopes West Virginians will remember how empowered they felt right after the spill, when they came together to demand accountability. ""We saw immediate change,"" she said.But now, ""the question remains: Have we learned anything? Has anything changed?""""I think the general sentiment is no,"" Rosser said. ""We're kind of in the same place -- back to the status quo, waiting for the next disaster to happen."""
1,POLITICS,Here's How Obamacare Is Keeping People Out Of The Hospital,Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obamacare-hospital-readmission_us_56ce20b2e4b03260bf755a2f,New penalties for hospitals seem to have dramatically reduced the number of people readmitted with complications.,2016-02-25,"Improving the quality of health care is difficult, but it's not exactly brain surgery.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56ce211c1e00002200702b86.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Affordable Care Act was supposed to keep hospital patients from returning after discharge because of medical complications and poor follow-up care.For something like a half-million people over the last five years, the law appears to have done just that -- although the evidence, as usual, isn't quite definitive.The Department of Health and Human Services on Wednesday announced that the rate of hospital readmission -- that is, the number of patients returning to the hospital within 30 days of discharge -- has dropped dramatically since 2010, when President Barack Obama signed the health care law. That’s a big deal, because reducing readmissions is one of Obamacare’s explicit goals. As the theory goes, readmission is usually a marker for poor quality medical care. It can mean that patients aren’t getting the right instructions about taking their medications, for example, or that they aren’t receiving the proper recovery and rehabilitation services. That’s bad for the patients, obviously. It’s also bad for the health care system -- since every return visit to the hospital strains resources and drives up the nation’s health care bill.Previously, hospitals had little financial incentive to avoid readmissions, since return visits meant more services and more income. The Affordable Care Act sought to change that, by modestly reducing Medicare payments to hospitals with high rates of readmission for three key conditions: acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), heart failure, and pneumonia. (Recently, the penalties expanded to include two other conditions.) At the same time, the health care law created programs like the Partnership for Patients, which provides extra financial support to hospitals that develop new ways of improving the quality of care.Sure enough, the readmission rate began to drop following the law’s enactment, with a sharper decline among the three conditions that the penalties targeted. And in the five years that followed, HHS announced on Wednesday, there were 565,000 fewer admissions overall. “That’s 565,000 times that a patient didn’t have to experience an extra hospital stay,” Rachel Zuckerman, an HHS economist, wrote in a blog post that appeared on the agency’s website Wednesday.By itself, the decline doesn’t prove that patients are getting better care -- or even avoiding the hospital. Many experts have speculated that hospitals are simply giving “observation” status to many returning patients. Observation status is basically a form of accounting limbo in which patients stay in hospital beds, getting hospital treatments, but don’t officially count toward hospital admission tallies. In theory, a hospital could use observation status more frequently in order to avoid incurring the new penalties, but without improving patient care.HHS economists decided to examine this possibility by studying the increase in observation status and seeing whether it could account for all or even most of the readmissions decline. The answer appears to be no. In a new paper, which the New England Journal of Medicine published on Wednesday, the HHS researchers concluded that readmissions came down substantially, even after accounting for patients returning via observation status. Hospitals may still be gaming the system, of course. (Some almost surely are.) But the data implies strongly that hospitals are taking other actions to reduce readmissions. And that would be consistent with anecdotes of hospitals trying innovative techniques for follow-up care -- like assigning social workers to the patients at higher risk of readmission, or sending visiting nurses to patients following discharge. Don Berwick, founder of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement and former administrator for Medicare and Medicaid, told The Huffington Post he thought the study was ""well-designed and well-analyzed."" It ""weakens the assertion that hospitals reduced ... readmission rates by reclassifying patients as in observation status,"" Berwick said.But Berwick, a pioneer in the movement to reduce medical errors and provide better treatment, also cautioned that ""the paper sheds no light on the question as to whether reducing readmissions was favorable or unfavorable for overall quality of care, and for whom."" Critics of the new incentives have worried that they may penalize hospitals that happen to have patients who are in worse health or who, because of socio-economic factors, are less likely to have the supports necessary for successful recovery and rehabilitation. Berwick said one remedy is to provide extra financial support for safety-net hospitals, the ones that treat the poorest and sometimes neediest patients, so that they still have incentive to hold down readmissions -- along with the resources to do something about it."

Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) said she had to ""go vote,"" even though she could have talked as she walked to an elevator down the hall. Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) didn't even let HuffPost get the full question out before saying, ""I don't do hallway interviews."" Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) said he had to ""run to a meeting"" and disappeared into an elevator. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) listened to the question and, with a blank look, said, ""I'm not doing any interviews.""Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) -- chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, where majority support is needed to advance the nomination -- attempted to shield himself from cameras by raising ""a binder to cover his face"" while exiting the Senate chamber on Wednesday. He opposes the prospect of even meeting Obama's potential nominee, a hard-line stance Democrats hope to exploit during Grassley's re-election fight later this year.Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) dodged questions about a potential backlash toward Republicans for vowing to block Obama's Supreme Court pick before the president has even named one.""I'll let Sen. Grassley talk about it,"" Flake said.Asked about his signature on a letter stating that Obama's nominee shouldn't get a hearing or a vote, Flake reiterated he did not wish to discuss the subject. ""Yeah, but I want to let him talk about it,"" he said of Grassley.Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, a vulnerable GOP senator who has also pledged to keep the Supreme Court seat vacant until the next president enters the White House, told a reporter to ""move back so that my elevator can go down."" Reporters are sometimes invited inside members-only Senate elevators to conduct interviews.Asked by a Politico reporter whether he supported holding hearings on a Supreme Court nominee, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) gave a reasonable -- if not entirely true -- excuse:And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who drew the line in the sand on potential Obama nominees within hours of Scalia's death, put an exclamation point on his party's opposition. He skipped town on Thursday afternoon, even though the White House had attempted to arrange a meeting between the president, McConnell and Grassley that day."

Al Sharpton still hasn't endorsed a candidate in the presidential election. But on Thursday, he was very clear whom he doesn't want sitting in the White House next year. ""If Donald Trump is the nominee ... I'm also reserving my ticket to get out of here if he wins. Only because he’d probably have me deported anyhow,"" Sharpton said to laughs and applause at a Center for American Progress Action Fund event.The famed civil rights leader, and president and founder of the National Action Network, a non-profit civil rights organization, discussed the importance of communities of color in the 2016 elections.Sharpton also commented on a Hillary Clinton protest late Wednesday night by two Black Lives Matter activists who disrupted a private Clinton fundraiser, holding signs referencing Clinton’s comments on race and crime in 1996.Activist Ashley Williams, one of the individuals, demanded that the Democratic presidential candidate account for the inconsistencies on her record on race, specifically comments about black people being “super predators.” They were eventually escorted out by Secret Service. Sharpton said he has spoken with Clinton about her comments and actions in the 1990s, while her husband was president, but admitted she still needs more transparency when it comes to dealing with those questions.""I think that people have the right to raise that because it’s an issue that’s disturbing,"" Sharpton told The Huffington Post about the protesters confronting Clinton. ""But I think it is something she has to deal with as many times as it’s raised, as we raised it. It’s a legitimate question.""Sharpton has met with Clinton many times leading up to the 2016 presidential election, though he hasn't endorsed her. He has, however, mocked Clinton and fellow Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for pandering to black voters.And on Thursday, Sharpton said he still wants to hear more from both of them on what they will do to help communities of color. “It’s good for them to say ‘yes, the country has an illness.’ Now, how are we going to heal it? Specifically, not slogans,"" Sharpton said. ""I don’t need people to tell me ‘yep, you are right, it’s unfair.’ Tell me what you are going to do about it.”""We hear [Hillary Clinton] say that you disagree with some of the things done in the 90s under your husband with the omnibus crime bill, which I opposed at that time ... But then what would you do with the Justice Department?"" he asked during the discussion. ""What kind of Attorney General would you have? I want more [solutions].""Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

5,POLITICS,Ted Cruz Drops His Hold On Flint Water Deal,Laura Barrón-López and Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ted-cruz-flint_us_56cf58d1e4b0bf0dab3141a2,But other senators could still be holding up the legislation.,2016-02-25,Sen. Ted Cruz is one senator who was holding up legislation that would help Flint upgrade its water infrastructure.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_0_267_5184_2933%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- After initially placing a hold on bipartisan legislation to help cities like Flint, Michigan, upgrade their water infrastructure, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said he would not stop the measure from moving forward.""He has reviewed the bill now and will not prevent it from moving forward,"" Cruz spokesman Phil Novack said in an email Thursday evening.But it remains to be seen if the other senators potentially holding up the Flint legislation -- and an energy bill its fate is linked to -- will stop blocking the package.Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters through a grin earlier Thursday that “a presidential candidate, not to name names,” was holding up the legislation, which was fast-tracked Wednesday using a procedural tool in the Senate. A single senator has the ability to stop that process. A Democratic aide said at the time that Cruz was one of the senators holding up the legislation, and a Cruz spokesman said his office was reviewing the legislation, which is part of a larger deal that includes an unrelated energy bill.A few hours after news of the hold, Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), one of the chief Democratic architects of the measure, said on Twitter that she's ""hearing good things, adding Republican support."" She also tweeted that she's working with Republicans to clear up any issues. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), one of the architects of the Flint measure, didn’t want to name names either, but did say the bill was being held.“It is multiple,” Inhofe said, but didn’t elaborate on why those senators were holding up the bill.Inhofe remained confident that the hold would not last long and would be easily resolved. “It won’t change very much at all,” he said of the text of the bill. The legislation would give states access to $100 million for loans to deal with drinking water emergencies, $70 million worth of credit subsidies for water infrastructure upgrades and $50 million for public health efforts. Inhofe and other Republicans insisted the measure be paid for by reprogramming $250 million in credit subsidies for fuel-efficient vehicle development. The Flint water crisis started in 2014 when the state of Michigan failed to make sure Flint's water was treated correctly following a state-approved switch to the Flint River as its water source. The water caused lead to leach from Flint's aging pipes, resulting in higher amounts of lead in the blood of Flint children. Senate Democrats first proposed Flint legislation at the end of January. They originally sought $400 million in federal spending to help the city fix and replace its lead pipes, plus $200 million to establish a center for Flint kids who had been poisoned by lead.Lead is a deadly neurotoxin that is especially dangerous to young children, who can suffer permanent brain damage and behavioral problems later in life.This post has been updated to note that Cruz has dropped his hold on the legislation."

7,POLITICS,"Seriously, Stop Saying Marco Rubio Is The Moderate Candidate",Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rubio-moderate-conservative_us_56cf3f46e4b0871f60ea66cb,He's more conservative than most Republican senators.,2016-02-25,"If Rubio somehow got the nomination, he'd probably be the most conservative GOP candidate in modern history.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Five candidates will be onstage in Texas for Thursday’s Republican presidential debate. But only three of them still have a plausible path to the nomination. And while real estate mogul Donald Trump is the clear front-runner, many political observers think Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) remains the most likely to overtake him.One reason is that these political professionals and analysts still think of Rubio as something of a kinder, gentler alternative to either Trump or Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). Sometimes they call Rubio “mainstream,” as MSNBC’s Nicole Wallace did the other night. Sometimes they call him “moderate,” as Commentary’s Noah Rothman did last month. As the theory goes, Rubio's ability to win over less conservative voters could allow him to pick up the votes he needs to stop Trump -- and claim the nomination for himself. Maybe he could. But calling Rubio a moderate is just plain crazy. By any reasonable definition, Rubio is not just conservative. He is very, very conservative. You can even prove it with numbers, thanks to a widely used statistical method for measuring ideology.It’s called DW-NOMINATE, which is an acronym for “Dynamic and Weighted Nominal Three-Step Estimation.” Two political scientists, Keith Poole and Howard Rosenthal, developed the first version in the 1980s and have been tinkering with it ever since.DW-NOMINATE produces a numerical score for members of Congress based on their voting records. Efforts to measure political feelings statistically are always crude and the DW-NOMINATE scores are no exception. But they give a pretty good sense of where on the political spectrum elected officials lie, particularly relative to one another.HuffPost Infographic by Alissa SchellerAnd Rubio’s score is awfully telling. Zero in DW-NOMINATE signifies the rough ideological center of American politics. Lawmakers with more liberal voting records have scores less than zero, while lawmakers with more conservative voting records have scores greater than zero. As of the most recent Congress, Rubio’s lifetime voting record is 0.579, which places him firmly on the right end of the Republican caucus. Just nine senators have more conservative voting records than he does.That makes sense, given that Rubio has been among the reliably conservative votes in the Senate on everything from taxes to the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay. And while Cruz is among those nine senators who are even more conservative, the DW-NOMINATE scores, which are based on voting records, don’t take into account the extreme positions that Rubio has taken up in the campaign -- like promising to rescind President Barack Obama’s executive orders on immigration on “day one,” or opposing abortion even in cases of incest or rape. The gap between Cruz and Rubio still exists, but it’s getting smaller.As for Trump, his lack of government service means he has no record on which to base a DW-NOMINATE score. But while Trump is by all appearances the most racist, sexist and xenophobic candidate in the race, he’s also taken up several positions -- like support of government negotiation of prescription drug prices -- that are sharply at odds with conservative orthodoxy.In other words, Trump may be more offensive than Rubio, but he’s probably not more conservative.Rubio himself is trying to make this argument right now, in the hopes it undercuts Trump’s support before it’s too late to stop him. Rubio hasn’t always been the most candid of politicians. But, in this case, he’s right.In fact, while comparisons across historical eras are difficult, a candidate with Rubio’s record would probably be the most conservative Republican nominee for president in modern history.It’s one more sign of just how far the Republican Party has lurched to the extreme fringes of American politics, no matter whom their nominee for president turns out to be."
8,SPORTS,Don't Believe The Derrick Rose Hype,Jordan Schultz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dont-believe-the-derrick-rose-hype_us_56cdffa3e4b0ec6725e4d164,"The former NBA MVP has played very well of late, but it's an aberration more than anything else.",2016-02-25,Bulls point guard Derrick Rose has played much better basketball in the 2016 calendar year.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56ce10341500002a000b0a0e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"No sooner had Derrick Rose declared he was back, than he was sidelined with hamstring tendinitis.The 27-year-old Chicago Bulls point guard was playing his best basketball all season, averaging over 19 points in the 2016 calendar year. Rose's steadiness and renewed sense of confidence stems from no longer having to wear a protective face mask. Amid tremendous dysfunction with a first-year head coach in Fred Hoiberg, along with a front office that was expecting a winner this year and instead got a clunky mix of disappointments, Rose's play has been a pleasant surprise. Unfortunately though, the former league MVP has cemented his legacy as an extremely talented, oft injured player of unfulfilled promise. Bulls fans know all too well that when things with Rose seem too good to be true, it's because they usually are. This recent stretch of production should be viewed as no different.After playing 81 games during the 2010-11 campaign, he combined to play in a mere 100 matches over three seasons. And, in that span, Rose was supplanted by fellow backcourt mate Jimmy Butler -- who caught up with The Huffington Post in 2013 on the verge of his breakout success -- as the clear-cut face of the franchise. Interestingly enough, the former No. 1 overall pick is far more productive with Butler (a two-time All-Star) on the bench and vise-versa. According to ESPN, Butler's scoring increases from 19.4 points per 36 minutes to 24.5 when Rose is out. Moreover, when Butler is out, Rose improves his scoring from 16.8 points to 23.4, per 36. Despite the immense combined talent of both guards, they cannot co-exist at an elite clip together.Rose has proven to be too ball dominant. Furthermore, with Butler recently sidelined with a knee injury, Rose has played some of his best ball yet.Rose's recent surge is not sustainable because he still struggles to shoot the ball proficiently, nor does he get to the rim frequently enough to augment such long-range deficiencies. He has never shot fewer free-throws in his career (3), and his sub-27 percent shooting from 3 is the worst of any starting point guard in the NBA. But even if we can overlook those issues, Rose's key problem -- even with his improved play -- is a lack of overall efficiency. Of the 25 players with a usage rate (the number of possessions a player uses per 40 minutes) of 26 or more, Rose's 13.54 player efficiency rating is the lowest clip.Kobe Bryant offered insight last week into how Chicago's prodigal son can maximize his ability without the top notch athleticism and speed he once possessed.""Derrick is at a position in his career where he'll have to adjust his game,"" Bryant told ESPN. ""And what I mean by that is start using his size a lot more instead of his speed and quickness and start going to the post a little bit more.""While Rose is certainly not at fault for his slew of injuries and diminished athletic ability, adjusting his style to highlight what plus attributes he still has is a necessity. Whether or not he has done so depends on who you ask.And Rose hasn't been shy to voice his opinion either: ""I think I'm a little bit more efficient,"" he said. ""I feel like I'm getting to spots, my spots that I want to get to on the floor, instead of settling.""Perhaps we can attribute his improved production to such a philosophy or maybe new-found confidence. And perhaps it will continue. Then again, when it comes to Derrick Rose, the injury questions always persist, and so too does the reality that he is completely removed from the NBA elite.Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com or ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram at @Schultz_Report.

Amid tremendous dysfunction with a first-year head coach in Fred Hoiberg, along with a front office that was expecting a winner this year and instead got a clunky mix of disappointments, Rose's play has been a pleasant surprise. Unfortunately though, the former league MVP has cemented his legacy as an extremely talented, oft injured player of unfulfilled promise. Bulls fans know all too well that when things with Rose seem too good to be true, it's because they usually are. This recent stretch of production should be viewed as no different.After playing 81 games during the 2010-11 campaign, he combined to play in a mere 100 matches over three seasons. And, in that span, Rose was supplanted by fellow backcourt mate Jimmy Butler -- who caught up with The Huffington Post in 2013 on the verge of his breakout success -- as the clear-cut face of the franchise. Interestingly enough, the former No. 1 overall pick is far more productive with Butler (a two-time All-Star) on the bench and vise-versa. According to ESPN, Butler's scoring increases from 19.4 points per 36 minutes to 24.5 when Rose is out. Moreover, when Butler is out, Rose improves his scoring from 16.8 points to 23.4, per 36. Despite the immense combined talent of both guards, they cannot co-exist at an elite clip together.Rose has proven to be too ball dominant. Furthermore, with Butler recently sidelined with a knee injury, Rose has played some of his best ball yet.Rose's recent surge is not sustainable because he still struggles to shoot the ball proficiently, nor does he get to the rim frequently enough to augment such long-range deficiencies. He has never shot fewer free-throws in his career (3), and his sub-27 percent shooting from 3 is the worst of any starting point guard in the NBA. But even if we can overlook those issues, Rose's key problem -- even with his improved play -- is a lack of overall efficiency. Of the 25 players with a usage rate (the number of possessions a player uses per 40 minutes) of 26 or more, Rose's 13.54 player efficiency rating is the lowest clip.Kobe Bryant offered insight last week into how Chicago's prodigal son can maximize his ability without the top notch athleticism and speed he once possessed.""Derrick is at a position in his career where he'll have to adjust his game,"" Bryant told ESPN. ""And what I mean by that is start using his size a lot more instead of his speed and quickness and start going to the post a little bit more.""While Rose is certainly not at fault for his slew of injuries and diminished athletic ability, adjusting his style to highlight what plus attributes he still has is a necessity. Whether or not he has done so depends on who you ask.And Rose hasn't been shy to voice his opinion either: ""I think I'm a little bit more efficient,"" he said. ""I feel like I'm getting to spots, my spots that I want to get to on the floor, instead of settling.""Perhaps we can attribute his improved production to such a philosophy or maybe new-found confidence. And perhaps it will continue. Then again, when it comes to Derrick Rose, the injury questions always persist, and so too does the reality that he is completely removed from the NBA elite.Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com or ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram at @Schultz_Report.

10,POLITICS,Senate Honors Antonin Scalia With Pointless Resolution Versus Replacing Him,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/antonin-scalia-senate-supreme-court-nominee_us_56cf4600e4b03260bf75d827,Scalia once lamented that politics were ruining the judicial confirmation process.

That's a first.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586d6fb6190000ab060e307a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The Senate voted unanimously Thursday to pass a resolution honoring the late Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia, even as dozens of them are refusing to honor his legacy by filling his empty seat.All 100 senators cosponsored the resolution, which was introduced by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) -- the same person who says he won't even meet with whoever President Barack Obama picks to fill Scalia's vacancy, never mind vote on that nominee. Nearly all Republicans are saying it's not fair to let Obama nominate Scalia's replacement since he's in his last year in office, so they won't hold any hearings or votes this year.The resolution commends Scalia for his 29 years on the court and celebrates his love of hunting, the opera, and, ironically, his enforcement of ""the separation of powers contained in the Constitution as a bulwark for individual freedom."" The Constitution requires the president to nominate people to the Supreme Court, and requires the Senate to vote on those nominees, either for or against.If Scalia were around to see how the Senate is responding to his vacancy, based on his previous statements on Supreme Court confirmations, he wouldn't be amused. He's lamented that the process has become too politicized and said he ""wouldn't want to go through it again.""""I am not happy about the intrusion of politics into the judicial appointment process,"" Scalia said in 2004.Six years later, he aired similar frustrations: ""As long as [the Constitution] is subject to revision, you should get used to controversial and absurd political theater when a person is nominated.""McConnell and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who chairs the Judiciary Committee, are in talks with the White House about meeting with Obama to discuss the Supreme Court vacancy. But they're still holding firm in their position about not holding any hearings on a nominee until he's out of office.""We are working with the White House to schedule a time for a meeting,"" said McConnell spokesman Don Stewart. ""The Leader welcomes the opportunity to reiterate to the President directly that the American people will be heard on this matter, and the nomination will be determined by whoever wins the presidency in the fall."""

They say he then shouted, ""All of you should die,"" before going inside his house to get a weapon and brandishing it at the couple.""This state allows you to carry a gun and shoot you,"" he allegedly said. ""You, your wife and your kids have to die.""An image obtained by local CBS affiliate News 4 appears to show Debello holding a gun while standing outside his home.An officer with the St. Louis County Police Department told The Huffington Post on Tuesday that the case was still under investigation and would be presented to the prosecuting attorney's office, but no action had been taken yet aside from a brief arrest on Sunday. Debello later told News 4 he regretted the incident and had forgotten to take medication for PTSD that day.The St. Louis chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations has called for the act to be prosecuted as a hate crime. Faizan Syed, executive director of the chapter, said the event has stoked fear in the city's Muslim community and prompted the local religious council to hold an emergency meeting. He said the incident wasn't just directed at the Ayoubs, but rather the entire Muslim faith.""That's the nature of hate crimes, they don't just target one specific individual or family,"" Syed said. ""The crime itself has implications for a group and the effects happen to everybody within our community.""Syed said the rhetoric coming from the Republican Party during the presidential primaries, particularly from businessman Donald Trump, has ""definitely mainstreamed Islamophobia,"" and that acts of hate have spiked in the city.The three leading Republican candidates, Trump, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, have all stood by increasingly frightening anti-Muslim campaigns.""We now feel and we now see that it's almost an OK reality to target Muslims, to bully Muslim kids,"" Syed said, while noting this isn't just about Islamophobia. ""In America there is an issue of greater acceptance of intolerance to other people.""During a press conference on Tuesday, Rabie Ayoub said he now feared for his children's safety, as the family currently lives just a few blocks from Debello.“He wasn’t sorry when he pulled the gun, he wasn’t thinking about it. He was ready to shoot. If he shot me, my wife or kids, what’s his apology going to do,” he said.The Huffington Post is documenting this wave of Islamophobic hate for all of 2016.

Ted Cruz (Texas) and Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) in Tuesday's Nevada GOP caucus, setting up a particularly difficult road ahead for Cruz.Trump has now won three straight state contests and appears to be barreling toward the Republican presidential nomination, while Cruz has only won one state, Iowa. Cruz's campaign had hoped to eke out a win in Nevada based on the strength of his political organization and ground game, which helped lead him to a similar victory in the Iowa caucus earlier this month. The caucus format relies on turning out voters who are engaged enough to spend several hours participating in the political process.By contrast, Trump has lagged behind Cruz and Rubio in his organizing efforts, and political observers expressed doubt that the businessman and former reality television star could turn out enough of his ardent supporters to the caucus sites.In addition to his strong ground game, Cruz relied on help from anti-government voters who may have supported Cliven Bundy, the Nevada rancher who held a standoff with federal authorities. In an ad released last week, Cruz vowed to privatize all the state’s public lands -- including its national parks, forests and monuments.Nevada's results set up an interesting battle in the crucial Super Tuesday states next week. These events will test whether Cruz can rein in Trump's dominance and plot a successful long-term strategy to win the nomination.The Texas senator, a conservative firebrand seen as an anti-establishment and evangelical alternative in the race, has seen some of his support base usurped by Trump. Exit polls in Nevada showed Trump defeating Cruz among voters who identified as conservative or evangelical.Across the country, Trump has proven formidable among voters who favor a smaller government and socially conservative values and above all, blame Washington for what they perceive as American weakness and failure. Trump has promoted a message of economic populism, promising to bring jobs and economic growth, which appeals to many lower-income GOP voters.Cruz has also had trouble courting party loyalists and establishment types, who will become essential to a general election victory if he manages to blunt Trump's dominance and win the GOP nomination. Rubio has scored a number of endorsements among members of Congress and state GOP leaders, including South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (R) and Nevada Sen. Dean Heller (R). And establishment types who fear Trump's dominance may continue to rally around Rubio rather than Cruz.Cruz's campaign continues to face criticism for mudslinging and ""dirty tricks"" against his rivals. Cruz fired senior aide Rick Tyler on Monday, after Tyler released a video that falsely claimed Rubio was dismissive of the Bible. Trump has also called Cruz's tactics ""sleazy.""The Texas senator now pins his hopes on his home state, whose voters will head to the polls on Super Tuesday. He will have to win big and pick up the state's 155 delegates if he wants to change the dynamics of a race that continues to favor Trump. Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

""For months everyone said someone else will catch on, but it seems that they better start catching because he's moving down the road,"" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said at a roundtable with reporters, most from Hispanic media outlets. ""For me it's kind of scary what he talks about,"" he continued, adding that he thinks Trump will be the GOP nominee. Reid endorsed Democrat and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.Trump won the Republican caucuses in Reid's home state on Tuesday, his third consecutive victory after the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries. Trump came in second to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in the Iowa caucuses. Those victories came in spite of Trump's derogatory statements about Mexicans, Muslims, women and plenty more groups and individuals. Pundits and politicians predicted for months that Trump would be unsuccessful and drop out, but his wins indicate large portions of the GOP base support him regardless of his comments.In other words, everyone, including Democrats, has to grapple with the fact that Trump's views aren't necessarily on the fringe, including on immigration.Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), the only Latino Democratic senator, said he's ""never seen a greater confluence of challenges at one time"" for the Latino community. ""When I look at what is happening across the landscape of the political discourse in this country and I hear the language about walls and deportation and no more birthright citizenship and the list goes on and on, I recoil thinking that we are going back to a time and place that none of us want to go to,"" he said.He said he has ""learned over a lifetime that [comments about undocumented immigrants] are not about the undocumented alone, they're about all of us,"" referring to Latinos. The problem isn't just with Trump, it's also with his GOP rivals. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has called for mass deportation, while Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has said he would immediately end the president's relief for undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) noted Wednesday those comments represent a shift for Rubio, since he helped draft and pass a bill through the Senate a comprehensive reform bill that included assistance for the same young people. ""I'm very disappointed,"" said Durbin, who was also part of the so-called ""gang of eight"" that wrote the comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013. There's one potential upside for Democrats: rhetoric on Latinos from Trump and others could inspire more of them to vote, and they largely swing democratic. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who is aiming to be the next Democratic leader in the Senate, said if the party takes control of the upper chamber and the White House, immigration reform will be a top priority.""We would never pull back because our Republican friends get angry at us. ... It's a passion,"" he said of immigration reform. ""We just need our passion to have electoral backing so we can take that passion and move it to reality.""Editor's Note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) criticized former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in South Carolina on Wednesday for her role in welfare reform during the 1990s.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_8_236_3992_1882%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Ahead of a South Carolina Democratic primary election that will hinge on the black vote, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) criticized former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Wednesday for her role in welfare reform during the 1990s. ""I spoke out against so-called welfare reform because I thought it was scapegoating people who were helpless, people who were very, very vulnerable,"" Sanders said Wednesday. ""Secretary Clinton at that time had a very different position on welfare reform. [She] strongly supported it and worked hard to round up votes for its passage.""In response to Sanders' comments, Maya Harris, senior policy adviser for the Clinton campaign, said in a statement that Clinton is ""has long said she would work to address"" the welfare law's shortcomings, ""including the 5-year lifetime limit."" Harris also noted that other reforms signed into law by Clinton's husband, then-President Bill Clinton -- such as an expansion of the earned income tax credit -- have helped the black community.“When it comes to lifting more African-Americans out of poverty,"" Harris said, “it has been Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has put forward bold plans to create good-paying jobs, dismantle the school-to-prison pipeline, and remove barriers to sustainable home ownership.”Welfare reform, officially known as the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, turned means-based cash aid for poor families from an entitlement into a limited block grant with strict work requirements. President Clinton called the law the end of ""welfare as we know it,"" touting it as evidence of Democrats’ willingness to reduce government dependency and work with Republicans.Many Democrats considered welfare reform a betrayal, however, worrying that it would worsen living standards for struggling single women and their children in particular. Peter Edelman, now a backer of Hillary Clinton, resigned from his post as assistant secretary of planning and education in Bill Clinton's administration to protest the law’s passage.The law passed the House of Representatives with just 30 Democratic votes. Sanders, at the time an independent congressman from Vermont, voted against it, as did Rep. James Clyburn (D-S.C.), currently a Hillary Clinton supporter and the most prominent Democrat in South Carolina.As New York Times reporter Jason DeParle wrote in American Dream, his book about the 1996 welfare reform law, ""Opponents [of the bill] had looked to Hillary Clinton to save the day, but the signals weren't reassuring."" The president had already vetoed two prior welfare bills, and Clinton, who at the time held no formal office beyond that of first lady, believed that a third veto would be too politically costly.""I agreed that [Bill Clinton] should sign it and worked hard to round up votes for its passage -- though he and the legislation were roundly criticized by some liberals, advocacy groups for immigrants and most people who worked with the welfare system,"" Clinton wrote in her 2004 memoir.Today, there is an emerging consensus among liberal policy analysts and antipoverty advocates that their worst fears about welfare reform have been realized.The number of Americans on welfare rolls declined precipitously, but not because of a corresponding decline in poverty. In 1996, 68 percent of families with children in poverty received welfare benefits, but in 2013, that figure had fallen to just 26 percent, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The new welfare program has not kept pace with demand for a number of reasons. The federal block grant is not indexed to inflation, so it has declined 30 percent in value since 1996, according to CBPP. And since it's up to the states to determine eligibility for the limited pool of funding, enrollment levels vary widely from state to state.Finally, critics charge that it is hard for people to find the jobs necessary to qualify for aid in the new system. It's just not easy to find a job in today’s economy as it was during the boom years of the late '90s.A debate over welfare reform could have special resonance in South Carolina, where poverty is particularly acute. In that state, as in the rest of the country, poverty rates are disproportionately high in the African-American community.Welfare-bashing has long been understood to be a racial dog whistle to conservative voters. At the time of welfare reform's passage, Bill Clinton told DeParle, he believed the law would help quiet the whistles. ""I really believed that if we passed welfare reform... we could diminish at least a lot of the overt racial stereotypes that I thought were paralyzing American politics,"" the former president said.South Carolina state Rep. Terry Alexander (D), an African-American lawmaker backing Sanders in Saturday’s primary, believes that highlighting the differences between Sanders' and Clinton’s records on welfare reform is “going to have an impact” on whom African-Americans vote for. As it stands, polls show the state's black voters heavily favor Clinton. “It will send a message to have folks look at all of [Hillary Clinton’s] voting patterns on issues relevant to the African-American community,” Alexander said. “It was just eight years ago they came out hard against Barack Obama.” Alexander believes welfare reform was “devastating to the African-American community in an attempt to pacify the right.”“It took so many people off welfare and didn’t do anything with them,” he said."

A poll out Wednesday shows they might be right, at least in Ohio, where former Gov. Ted Strickland (D) is the lead contender to challenge Sen. Rob. Portman (R).The Quinnipiac University survey finds Strickland maintaining a narrow 44 percent to 42 percent lead on Portman, holding onto a consistent edge in recent polling. Aside from Democrats, Strickland's strength comes largely from the support of women and independents. The new warning sign for Portman comes in the question the survey asked on whether the Senate should ""consider a candidate nominated by the president to fill the vacant seat,"" or ""delay action on a Supreme Court nominee until there's a new president.""The poll found that 56 percent of Ohio voters want the Senate to weigh a nominee -- including 58 percent of women and independents. That's against just 41 percent who said they want to delay. Portman has sided with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in saying the Senate should not act.The survey was done from Feb. 16 to 20, calling 1,539 registered voters on cell phones and landlines. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points."

Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) and Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) on Wednesday became the first sitting members of Congress to endorse the presidential bid of real estate mogul Donald Trump.“Donald Trump has clearly demonstrated that he has both the guts and the fortitude to return our nation’s jobs stolen by China, take on our enemies like ISIS, Iran, North Korea and Russia, and most importantly, reestablish the opportunity for our children and grandchildren to attain the American Dream,” Collins said in a statement obtained by The Buffalo News. “That is why I am proud to endorse him as the next President of the United States.”Collins, who'd previously endorsed former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in the GOP race, represents one of the most conservative districts in New York, one that encompasses suburban and rural areas around Buffalo where it's not uncommon to see anti-Obama signs and the occasional Confederate flag.Hunter, meanwhile, told Politico on Wednesday that he is in favor of Trump because ""we don't need a policy wonk as president. We need a leader as president."" He also said he's ""liked Trump since the beginning.""Hunter represents a district in San Diego, and like Trump has spoken about the need for tighter border control. His father, Duncan Hunter Sr., who once represented the district where his son now serves and who ran for president in 2008, made building a border fence one of his signature issues.The nods from Collins and Hunter come in the wake of Trump's resounding victory in the Nevada caucuses, where the businessman trounced rivals Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas by double digits Tuesday. Rubio still maintains an overwhelming lead in congressional endorsements, reflecting his status as the establishment favorite, but the backing of many of the party's elders has yet to translate into any primary-season victories.Collins' endorsement may signal an opening of the floodgates for Trump, who prior to Wednesday hadn't received a single endorsement from any members of Congress or state GOP officials.Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) and Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) on Wednesday became the first sitting members of Congress to endorse the presidential bid of real estate mogul Donald Trump.“Donald Trump has clearly demonstrated that he has both the guts and the fortitude to return our nation’s jobs stolen by China, take on our enemies like ISIS, Iran, North Korea and Russia, and most importantly, reestablish the opportunity for our children and grandchildren to attain the American Dream,” Collins said in a statement obtained by The Buffalo News. “That is why I am proud to endorse him as the next President of the United States.”Collins, who'd previously endorsed former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in the GOP race, represents one of the most conservative districts in New York, one that encompasses suburban and rural areas around Buffalo where it's not uncommon to see anti-Obama signs and the occasional Confederate flag.Hunter, meanwhile, told Politico on Wednesday that he is in favor of Trump because ""we don't need a policy wonk as president. We need a leader as president."" He also said he's ""liked Trump since the beginning.""Hunter represents a district in San Diego, and like Trump has spoken about the need for tighter border control. His father, Duncan Hunter Sr., who once represented the district where his son now serves and who ran for president in 2008, made building a border fence one of his signature issues.The nods from Collins and Hunter come in the wake of Trump's resounding victory in the Nevada caucuses, where the businessman trounced rivals Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas by double digits Tuesday. Rubio still maintains an overwhelming lead in congressional endorsements, reflecting his status as the establishment favorite, but the backing of many of the party's elders has yet to translate into any primary-season victories.Collins' endorsement may signal an opening of the floodgates for Trump, who prior to Wednesday hadn't received a single endorsement from any members of Congress or state GOP officials.Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

Jim Inhofe (R-Okla) says the funding measure will be voted on as a standalone bill. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56cdead31e0000230070ea94.jpeg?cache=uKpwwKtgWO&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Senators reached a deal Wednesday to make money available to cities like Flint, Michigan, which desperately needs to replace lead pipes that have potentially poisoned thousands.After weeks of negotiations, Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) said he and Michigan Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D) and Gary Peters (D) had reached an agreement on how to pay for the money that will be made available to not only Flint but also other cities that have crumbling water infrastructure.The measure was fast-tracked on Wednesday, setting up a possible vote as early as next week to redirect $250 million from the Energy Department's Advanced Vehicle Technology Fund. While it doesn't send money directly to Flint, the city will be able to apply for a loan to receive a chunk of the money. ""This does what we need,"" Stabenow said, adding that the language of the agreement is still being sent back and forth for potential final tweaks. Inhofe said the measure would be voted on as a standalone bill. Stabenow and Peters confirmed they supported the offset, despite having opposed it just weeks earlier. ""That's the important aspect of it is that other communities all around the country will be able to access resources that are part of this -- dealing with not just lead but other toxic contaminants as well,"" Peters said.Asked what changed their mind, Stabenow said the structuring was ""responsible and positive.""Inhofe said ""time"" and urgency brought the two Michigan Democrats around. All expected the agreement to get broad bipartisan support from both parties.The deal unlocks a hold on the broad energy bill, which was derailed this month over the Flint negotiations. If the proposed procedure is agreed on, the bill will move forward as a standalone and then be tethered to House-passed legislation that clarifies the Environmental Protection Agency’s requirements for when it must notify the public of high concentrations of lead in drinking water.Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.) and Richard Burr (R-N.C.) signed onto the deal.In January, Democrats originally proposed legislation that would plow $400 million worth of new federal spending into grants for replacing Flint's water infrastructure, and another $200 million to create a new center to assist kids exposed to high lead levels.Flint Mayor Karen Weaver (D) and Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) have been moving forward with plans of their own to assess and replace the city's water infrastructure. They have said it could cost as much as $1.5 billion to replace the pipes.The Michigan government exposed potentially thousands of Flint children to high levels of lead, a deadly neurotoxin, after they switched the city's water source in 2014 and failed to prevent it from corroding Flint's aging lead pipes.Here's a breakdown of the funds:Arthur Delaney contributed to this report.This post has been updated with the senators who have signed onto the deal as well as details on how it will proceed.

Let's wait for the voters to weigh in this fall, they say.But Obama isn't the only elected official in the last year of his term who has a key role in choosing the next justice, whose party may or may not hold onto his power post, and who generally makes consequential decisions.The GOP logic seems to be that voters may have changed their minds about what sorts of leaders they want over the past three years, so rather than let Obama function for his full four-year term, the Senate should stall him. Beyond the Supreme Court vacancy, Republicans have also refused to hold hearings on Obama's budget, and one senator had himself recorded throwing Obama's final proposal to close the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, prison base into the trash.If after a mere three years, however, Obama has lost his mandate, what about those other elected officials who haven't gone before the voters in five years?There are 34 senators serving the final years of their six-year terms. Ten of them are Democrats, and 24 are Republicans, including at least seven facing difficult re-election fights. One of those going before the voters this fall is Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which in theory holds hearings on Supreme Court nominees.The logic that says a president shouldn't be allowed to make a consequential appointment in his final year would seem to indicate those ""lame duck"" senators shouldn't be allowed to cast consequential votes. One might even suggest that argument is stronger against senators, who are one among one hundred, than against the singular president.""I don't have any idea what that means,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), another member of the Judiciary Committee, when presented with the lame-duck senator scenario. Both Grassley and Graham, who is not currently up for re-election, signed a letter Tuesday vowing that the Judiciary Committee would not hold hearings on an Obama nominee to the Supreme Court.Graham had just left a news conference with Sens. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) denouncing Obama for proposing to close the Gitmo prison camp.""It's a ridiculous analogy, but I appreciate it,"" said Ayotte, who is facing a tough electoral challenge this year from New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan (D).Democrats weren't so sure that the analogy was ridiculous, although one at least didn't think senators should stop doing their jobs voting or evaluating nominees.""I'd not thought about that,"" said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), who is not up for re-election in 2016. ""I haven't thought about that because that would be an extension of their logic. I reject their logic.""Graham insisted that Republicans were taking a principled stand because it was rare in U.S. history for a president to replace a justice in an election year when the Senate is controlled by the opposing party.""All I can tell you is that in the history of the Republic, we had one [Supreme Court] judge confirmed in an election year where you had ... different parties holding the White House and the Senate,"" Graham said, presumably referring to the confirmation of Democratic President Grover Cleveland's nominee by a Republican-led Senate in 1888.There is actually a second example: A Democratic-controlled Senate confirmed Justice Anthony Kennedy in 1988, the last year of President Ronald Reagan's second term. But GOP senators have repeatedly insisted that doesn't count because Kennedy was nominated in late 1987.Graham also insisted that Democrats would do the same in reversed circumstances.""You're never going to convince me that they would do anything different than what we've done,"" he said.Kaine disagreed, suggesting that the blockade on Obama is much more personal than principled.""In some ways, this isn't even about the court -- it's about fundamental disrespect for the president. They wouldn't have a hearing on his budget,"" Kaine said. ""That's never happened before.""While he didn't suggest that the GOP should stop working, Kaine added that the Democrats wouldn't stop pushing the Republicans to relent.""We're not going to drop it,"" Kaine said. ""When the president nominates an individual ... it's going to be somebody highly qualified. There will be a real person on the table -- maybe some person who has received in the past a lot of Republican support -- and we will be able to demonstrate to the American public the outrageous nature of the Senate refusing to do one of the parts of its job description."""

Suzy Cloutier, a 28-year-old who has Down syndrome, spoke at an event for nonprofit STRIVE, which helps individuals with developmental disabilities in South Portland, Maine, last week, according to WGME. After seeing the crowd there, Suzy got a bit nervous and had a tough time moving along in her speech.However, Cloutier's 25-year-old friend Chandler Hawks, who also has Down syndrome, had her back. He walked up to the podium and gave the woman a much-needed hug, giving her the fuel she needed to finish her speech with flying colors. The uplifting gesture, which was caught on camera by local news station WGME, is the definition of pure friendship. Watch as Hawks goes up to the 28-year-old and asks if she's OK, while he wraps his arms around her to comfort the speaker. It's clear that the hug did the trick. ""OK, I can do it now,"" Cloutier says. Hawks returns to the crowd, jumping up and down with excitement for his friend. According to WGME, the event was a celebration for the nonprofit's expansion of its facility. Cloutier, who has participated in the organization's programs since she was a teenager, was delighted when she was asked to speak at the event. However, the crowd of about 200 people was a little shocking for Cloutier, whose speech was about her experiences with STRIVE, according to ABC News.""From the time she started talking, it took her that long to process that she was speaking in front of that many people,"" Cloutier's mother, Peggy, told the outlet. That reaction time is very typical for her.Luckily, Hawks made it all better, and the 28-year-old finished her speech like a pro, and telling the crowd about the fun activities she's done because of the nonprofit, including learning how to cook, dancing and -- most importantly -- making friends, according to WGME.

27,POLITICS,"Obama Has A Plan To Bring Paid Leave To 828,000 Workers",Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-paid-leave_us_56cdf6bbe4b041136f1923c8,Here's how it would work.,2016-02-24,President Barack Obama's executive order on paid leave would guarantee workers under federal contracts could accrue up to a week per year.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56cdf8281500002b000b09e8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"More than 800,000 U.S. workers may be getting more paid sick leave on their jobs, thanks to a federal rule outlined by the Labor Department on Wednesday.The proposal, set in motion by an executive order from President Barack Obama in September, would guarantee that workers under federal contracts could accrue up to a week of paid leave per year. Companies that want to maintain their business with the government would be required to offer the leave as a benefit.For now, the rule remains just a proposal, and it has to go through a period of public comment before it can be finalized and go into effect. Republicans and business groups oppose the plan, so administration officials would want to implement the rule before a Republican potentially takes over the White House next year and undoes it.In a blog post outlining the proposed rule, Labor Secretary Tom Perez said an estimated 828,000 workers would be getting some amount of paid leave that they didn't get before. Roughly 437,000 of those workers currently get no paid leave at all, he added.""I’m looking forward to a day when working moms and dads can afford to stay home with their sick kids, when a younger worker can take paid sick leave to care for an ailing grandparent and a husband can use his earned sick time to care for his wife -- all without fear of losing a day’s pay or their livelihood,"" Perez wrote. ""Today, we’re one step closer to making it happen.""The U.S. is an outlier among wealthy countries in not guaranteeing paid sick days for workers. In lieu of a federal mandate, it's left up to individual businesses to decide whether workers can take paid time off when they or their family members are ill. A handful of states and local governments have implemented their own paid sick leave mandates recently, but the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that some 44 million workers still receive no paid leave. Those without the benefit are more likely to be working in low-wage industries such as restaurants and retail, where many workers can't afford to go without a day's pay.Like raising the minimum wage, expanding paid leave has become a common theme in Obama's speeches about building a fairer economy. As The Huffington Post pointed out early last year, issuing an executive order requiring contractors to provide paid sick days would be one of the easiest ways for the White House to unilaterally bolster paid leave in the U.S.Issuing such a mandate is perfectly within the administration's power. But without additional action from Congress, the rule is inherently limited, only covering work that's done under federal contracts. That's why the rule would impact hundreds of thousands of workers, as opposed to many millions. Still, there's a long history of presidents using the government's contracting power to send a message to private-sector employers and influence working standards in the broader economy. Under the proposed plan, how much paid leave workers are guaranteed depends on how much they work. For every 30 hours they log, they would accrue at least one hour of paid time off. The amount would be capped at 56 hours -- or seven days -- for the year. Workers could use the time to care for themselves or a loved one who's sick or suffered domestic violence or a sexual assault. If employers already have leave plans that meet those minimum requirements, they don't have to change anything.Workers could carry their unused time over into a new year, though employers wouldn't have to allow them to cash out their unused time when they leave the job. And employers could require that workers show proof of the illness -- like a doctor's note or a hospital bill -- in order to use three or more days of their paid time in a row.The rule would apply only to firms who secure new contracts with the government starting next January, and employees would only be guaranteed leave if they're working under those contracts.Elsewhere on HuffPost:"

Marco Rubio's 28 percent and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's 18 percent. That's very close to the 47 percent Trump apparently took among white caucus-goers.The statistic, while striking, needs a few caveats. Entrance polls, like other surveys, aren't an exact science, especially when it comes to very small populations. Just 132 of the caucus-goers surveyed were Latinos, giving the results a margin of error of plus or minus 10 percent.Measuring opinions among Latino voters can be especially tricky. Entrance polls for Nevada's Democratic caucus last weekend showed Sen. Bernie Sanders doing unexpectedly well among those voters, sparking a wave of controversy about their accuracy.Still, even if Tuesday's poll numbers don't exactly match the actual vote, they show Trump carrying significant support from a group he has repeatedly denigrated.""I still think we can be pretty confident that Trump won the Hispanics who caucused last night,"" exit pollster Joe Lenski of Edison Research told HuffPost in an email. ""He won just about every demographic group.""Rubio, who came in second in the Nevada caucus, offered one explanation for Trump's success on Wednesday.""Americans of Hispanic descent ... care about the future of our country. They care about everything else people care about. They care about jobs. They care about terrorism. They're impacted by illegal immigration negatively in communities that are overrun by that,"" Rubio said in a Fox News interview.Trump's supporters, though, aren't a good representation of Nevada Latinos as a whole. Most of them don't vote Republican, as political scientist David Damore highlighted in this chart, based on the entrance polls and an analysis of party identification:Because not all voting-age Americans register to vote or end up caucusing, those who do turn out are likely an even smaller fraction of the population as a whole. Lenski estimates that about 1 percent of all Nevada's voting-age Latinos turned out on Tuesday.And while Nevada's few Latino Republicans might like Trump as much as the state's white Republicans do, the same isn't true for Latinos across the United States. National polls consistently show that most hold deeply negative views of Trump, even in comparison to other Republican candidates."

Sometimes multiple! In fact, upon scrolling through Best Picture rosters of yore, you'll probably land on some that are just one big case of ""Yikes."" So let's talk about it. We're days away from crowning the 88th Best Picture winner, so I decided to rank the past decade's collective nominees. In looking at each year's list, it's pretty easy to deem any given set a victory or a bust. In some ways, it's not even the Academy's fault -- certain years' slates are just superior. And because movies often feel dated even one year after they've opened, it's worth considering how the past 10 years' Hollywood superlatives have fared.I could pretend this list has a semblance of objectivity. (To be fair, I did put a lot of value in these movies' overarching cultural stature when debating their retrospective quality.) But, really, I am one mere movie fan, and these are my opinions. You can argue with them. You should argue with them! But they're pretty accurate, so good luck. In ascending order of quality, here is a ranking of the past 10 years' Best Picture inventories.
