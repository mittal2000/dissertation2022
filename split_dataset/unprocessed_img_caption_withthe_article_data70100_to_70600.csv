Lorella Praeli became a U.S. citizen this year. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- After spending the last several months urging Latinos to vote for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, Lorella Praeli finally will get the chance to do so herself. Praeli, the Latino outreach director for Clinton, was sworn in on Tuesday as a U.S. citizen -- the final step in a years-long process that took the Peruvian-born 27-year-old from undocumented status to legal permanent residency, to a job with a presidential front-runner, to naturalization. She took part with 30 other new citizens in a special naturalization ceremony at National Archives, with a speech from President Barack Obama. When Praeli's name was called, she stood and waved a small American flag. ""There is no better feeling,"" Praeli said afterward. ""It was everything coming together."" Before she was tapped for the Clinton campaign in May, Praeli was one of the most prominent immigrant rights activists in the U.S. She worked for the undocumented youth advocacy group United We Dream, which helped push for immigration reform and for Obama's deferred action policies that could spare millions from deportation. ""Lorella's story, like so many other American stories, remind us of who we are as a people,"" Clinton said on Monday during a speech at the National Immigrant Integration Conference, with Praeli looking on. ""I am so lucky to have her,"" Clinton added. Praeli had lived without authorization in the U.S. starting when she was 10, when she moved here to seek medical treatment for injuries from a car accident as a child. She received a green card in 2012, when she married a U.S. citizen. Her sister is allowed to remain in the country and work on a temporary basis under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. Their mother would be helped by Obama's newer program -- Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA -- but it has been blocked in the courts.Now that she's a citizen, Praeli will finally be able to petition for legal status for her mother. She can petition for her sister as well, but given long wait times, she said continuing the fight for immigration reform is a better bet for her and the other 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S.""My biggest dream, especially on a day like today, is for 11 million people to have the opportunity to feel the way I'm feeling,"" Praeli said.Part of her job is to encourage Latinos to vote, including those with green cards who are eligible to become citizens but haven't yet. Clinton spoke Monday about her plans to help people naturalize, expanding access to English classes and offering additional fee waivers for those who struggle to afford the fees.Obama's remarks on the responsibilities of citizens stood out to Praeli, who said it's important for her and others to vote to protect others who cannot.""You are now American,"" Obama told the group. ""You've got obligations as citizens, and I'm absolutely confident you will meet them. You'll set a good example for all of us because you know how precious this thing is. It's not something to take for granted. It's something to cherish and to fight for.""Also on HuffPost:"

Filmmaker and bartender Stephanie Dorceant, 29, and her ex-girlfriend, Nandi Allman, filed the suit in a Brooklyn federal court Monday afternoon -- two weeks after she was cleared of assaulting the police officer. It claims that early on July 11, 2015, the couple was walking back to their apartment in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn when off-duty NYPD officer Salvator Aquino, who was not in uniform, bumped into Dorceant from behind. “When Ms. Dorceant asked Police Officer Aquino whether he was ‘alright’ he responded in sum and substance ‘mind your own business you fucking dyke,'” the lawsuit states. Dorceant told Aquino not to talk to her that way. She recounted what she alleges happened next to reporters earlier this year: [Aquino] then attacked me, punched me in the face a number of times, choked me and called me several more anti-gay slurs. When he had his hands around my neck I truly thought I was going to die. I could not breathe. The only way I could get him to stop attacking me and my girlfriend was to bite him.At the hospital, Dorceant was treated for ""severe pain"" to her ""head and body,"" including ""bruising to her face and body, cuts and abrasion to numerous areas of her body, burst blood vessels in her eyes,"" the lawsuit states.At Central Booking, in Brooklyn's Criminal Courthouse, the lawsuit alleges that the facility was ""filthy"" and infested with pests. ""The toilets were covered in feces, urine and other types of human discharge and there were no beds or cots for plaintiff and other detainees to sleep on."" Dorceant was arraigned on felony charges of assault as well as charges for menacing, resisting arrest, and harassment. Aquino claimed that it was Dorceant who attacked him, punching him in the face and repeatedly biting him.During her arraignment, Dorceant said that prosecutors read aloud a statement from Aquino saying he was concerned he “might have HIV” from her bites. (Dorceant told HuffPost that she later took an HIV test. The results were negative.)Dorceant was then transferred to jail on Rikers Island, where she spent over a day before Allman was able to pay her $1,000 bail. The couple vehemently denied Aquino's version of events and contacted Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson's office. The DA's office told HuffPost earlier this year that it had launched a hate crime investigation into the incident.Reached for comment Tuesday, Brooklyn DA spokesman Oren Yaniv said he couldn't comment on an ongoing investigation. On Dec. 1, days after Dorceant gave nearly an hour of tearful testimony in court, a Brooklyn grand jury dismissed all the charges against her. Dorceant told Gothamist that Aquino's alleged attack gave her PTSD.""I keep having nightmares that [police are] trying to kill me,"" she said. ""I woke up shaking my heart was tremoring. I had to call my sister to calm me down because I dreamt that I was in jail and a cop tried to molest me and it felt very real. I constantly keep having this fear they’re going to take me, or this is all a dream and I’m actually back in Rikers."" Dorceant added that she only sleeps a few hours a night now, and the stress of the pending criminal charges against had precipitated a breakup between her and Allman.The lawsuit -- which names the city, Aquino, and five unidentified NYPD officers as defendants -- seeks unspecified damages for a host of civil rights violations, including battery, unlawful stop, malicious prosecution, false arrest, and “bias-based profiling.”Dorceant's lawyer, Benjamin Zeman, said in a statement Monday that Dorceant's assault ""contributes to the toxic culture of fear and disenfranchisement that so many of our citizens feel."" He added that the charges against his client should've been dropped much earlier. ""Both the NYPD and the Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office had countless opportunities to do what a grand jury finally did last week -- dismiss this travesty of a case -- but they chose not to,"" Zeman said.""We are gratified the grand jury threw out the case against Ms. Dorceant, but that decision is merely a first step toward obtaining justice for our client, seeing her attacker charged criminally, and sending a message to the Brooklyn District Attorney's office and the NYPD that New Yorkers of all races, religions, genders, ethnicities and sexual persuasions will tolerate nothing less than fair treatment and equal protection under the law.""

7,BLACK VOICES,"Prosecutors In Tamir Rice Case Bizarrely Pointed Toy Gun At Witness, Lawyers Allege",Michael McLaughlin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tamir-rice-family-slams-prosecutors_us_5670572ce4b0e292150f67dc,"The family's lawyers called for a federal investigation into the shooting, saying the current investigation is a ""grave miscarriage of justice.""",2015-12-15,"In a Wednesday, Nov. 26, 2014 file photo, a fake handgun taken from 12-year-old Tamir Rice, who was fatally shot by Cleveland police, is displayed after a news conference in Cleveland.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58616c351500002300915ef4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Lawyers for the family of a 12-year-old boy fatally shot by a Cleveland police officer called for a federal investigation into his death because they say the local prosecutor has been biased in favor of law enforcement. In a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch that was released on Tuesday, the legal team for Tamir Rice's mother and sister complained about the unusual measures taken by the Cuyahoga County prosecutor's office in reviewing the 2014 shooting. ""We write to request that your office launch an independent investigation into Tamir’s death because the local prosecutor has abdicated his responsibility to conduct a fair and impartial investigation and has severely compromised the grand-jury process,"" attorneys for the Rice family wrote. Among a variety of complaints, the letter describes a bizarre moment when a prosecutor allegedly shoved a toy gun in the face of a police expert testifying to the grand jury that the shooting of Tamir was unjustified.The family has long believed that charges should be leveled against Officer Timothy Loehman, who shot Tamir at a Cleveland playground on Nov. 23, 2014. Loehman, who is white, and his partner had received a report that a black male was waving a gun there. In fact, Tamir had a pellet gun that lacked the brightly colored tip that usually distinguishes such toys from real firearms. But the letter to Lynch shows that the family's frustrations have widened under prosecutor Timothy McGinty's oversight. The family's lawyers allege that he has manipulated the investigation and grand jury proceedings to benefit the officers.(Read the full letter below.)This month, McGinty allowed Loehman and Officer Frank Garmback, who drove the squad car to the playground, to read prepared statements to the grand jury, but then allowed them to invoke the Fifth Amendment to avoid questioning by lawyers.An individual cannot selectively use Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination after giving some testimony under oath, the Rice family attorneys said. Joseph Frolik, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office, said, ""Suffice to say that the veteran prosecutors presenting the case understand the Fifth Amendment."" He also pointed out that the lawyers who wrote the letter were not present for anything that happened in front of the grand jury.Normally, grand jury proceedings take place in secrecy. But the Tamir Rice case has been full of unusual developments. Earlier this fall, McGinty was criticized for releasing evidence from experts who wrote the Tamir's shooting was ""tragic"" but ""reasonable."" Those experts have been criticized as being overtly pro-police. The lawyers for Tamir's family acknowledge in their letter that it is often improper to expose the grand jury proceedings, but said the extent of McGinty's misdeeds forced them to speak out. ""It is clear that a grave miscarriage of justice is underway and that federal intervention is called for,"" attorneys Jonathan Abady, Earl Ward and Zoe Salman wrote. In October, another lawyer for Rice's family told HuffPost that Tamir's mother wanted the Department of Justice to intervene, but this letter represents a more formal request for the feds to get involved. The letter also alleges that McGinty's office, in another unusual move, asked Rice's family to gather evidence on its own for the grand jury. Experts rounded up by attorneys for Rice's family were then subjected to perverse questioning by prosecutors last week, the letter alleged.In one instance, a prosecutor removed a toy gun from his pants and pointed it in the face of an expert during his testimony, according to the letter. The letter says the surprise use of a prop in court was an exaggerated reference to the threat Loehman allegedly felt when encountering Tamir. The expert was Roger Clark, a 27-year veteran of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s department. He was one of two experts with law enforcement backgrounds who’d been retained by Tamir’s family and wrote reports that concluded the killing was unjustified. HuffPost has been unable to reach Clark for comment.McGinty, citing the privacy of grand jury hearings, refused to respond directly to allegations that his office mistreated Clark and Jeffrey Noble, the other expert found by Rice’s family.“These plaintiffs attorneys have spent months trying to inflame the media and the public with repeated, often inaccurate statements lobbying for their desired outcome,” McGinty said on Tuesday. “As prosecutors, we are not permitted to discuss the testimony given to any Grand Jury. This means the news media can receive a one-sided version of the story from lawyers who were not there. Any witness who appears before any Grand Jury is treated with respect but should expect thorough questioning from prosecutors and the grand jurors themselves.”In a statement to investigators, Loehman said he opened fire after he and his partner yelled at Tamir to put up his hands. The lawyers for Tamir's family, like other critics, disputed Loehman's account. Tamir could not have heard any commands, because the windows on the patrol car were rolled up, the lawyers wrote.

8,BLACK VOICES,"Prosecutors In Tamir Rice Case Bizarrely Pointed Toy Gun At Witness, Lawyers Allege",Michael McLaughlin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tamir-rice-family-slams-prosecutors_us_5670572ce4b0e292150f67dc,"The family's lawyers called for a federal investigation into the shooting, saying the current investigation is a ""grave miscarriage of justice.""",2015-12-15,"This still image taken from a surveillance video played at a news conference held by Cleveland Police, Wednesday, Nov. 26, 2014, shows Cleveland police officers arriving at Cudell Park on a report of a man with a gun.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58616c671900002b000e19ed.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Lawyers for the family of a 12-year-old boy fatally shot by a Cleveland police officer called for a federal investigation into his death because they say the local prosecutor has been biased in favor of law enforcement. In a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch that was released on Tuesday, the legal team for Tamir Rice's mother and sister complained about the unusual measures taken by the Cuyahoga County prosecutor's office in reviewing the 2014 shooting. ""We write to request that your office launch an independent investigation into Tamir’s death because the local prosecutor has abdicated his responsibility to conduct a fair and impartial investigation and has severely compromised the grand-jury process,"" attorneys for the Rice family wrote. Among a variety of complaints, the letter describes a bizarre moment when a prosecutor allegedly shoved a toy gun in the face of a police expert testifying to the grand jury that the shooting of Tamir was unjustified.The family has long believed that charges should be leveled against Officer Timothy Loehman, who shot Tamir at a Cleveland playground on Nov. 23, 2014. Loehman, who is white, and his partner had received a report that a black male was waving a gun there. In fact, Tamir had a pellet gun that lacked the brightly colored tip that usually distinguishes such toys from real firearms. But the letter to Lynch shows that the family's frustrations have widened under prosecutor Timothy McGinty's oversight. The family's lawyers allege that he has manipulated the investigation and grand jury proceedings to benefit the officers.(Read the full letter below.)This month, McGinty allowed Loehman and Officer Frank Garmback, who drove the squad car to the playground, to read prepared statements to the grand jury, but then allowed them to invoke the Fifth Amendment to avoid questioning by lawyers.An individual cannot selectively use Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination after giving some testimony under oath, the Rice family attorneys said. Joseph Frolik, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office, said, ""Suffice to say that the veteran prosecutors presenting the case understand the Fifth Amendment."" He also pointed out that the lawyers who wrote the letter were not present for anything that happened in front of the grand jury.Normally, grand jury proceedings take place in secrecy. But the Tamir Rice case has been full of unusual developments. Earlier this fall, McGinty was criticized for releasing evidence from experts who wrote the Tamir's shooting was ""tragic"" but ""reasonable."" Those experts have been criticized as being overtly pro-police. The lawyers for Tamir's family acknowledge in their letter that it is often improper to expose the grand jury proceedings, but said the extent of McGinty's misdeeds forced them to speak out. ""It is clear that a grave miscarriage of justice is underway and that federal intervention is called for,"" attorneys Jonathan Abady, Earl Ward and Zoe Salman wrote. In October, another lawyer for Rice's family told HuffPost that Tamir's mother wanted the Department of Justice to intervene, but this letter represents a more formal request for the feds to get involved. The letter also alleges that McGinty's office, in another unusual move, asked Rice's family to gather evidence on its own for the grand jury. Experts rounded up by attorneys for Rice's family were then subjected to perverse questioning by prosecutors last week, the letter alleged.In one instance, a prosecutor removed a toy gun from his pants and pointed it in the face of an expert during his testimony, according to the letter. The letter says the surprise use of a prop in court was an exaggerated reference to the threat Loehman allegedly felt when encountering Tamir. The expert was Roger Clark, a 27-year veteran of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s department. He was one of two experts with law enforcement backgrounds who’d been retained by Tamir’s family and wrote reports that concluded the killing was unjustified. HuffPost has been unable to reach Clark for comment.McGinty, citing the privacy of grand jury hearings, refused to respond directly to allegations that his office mistreated Clark and Jeffrey Noble, the other expert found by Rice’s family.“These plaintiffs attorneys have spent months trying to inflame the media and the public with repeated, often inaccurate statements lobbying for their desired outcome,” McGinty said on Tuesday. “As prosecutors, we are not permitted to discuss the testimony given to any Grand Jury. This means the news media can receive a one-sided version of the story from lawyers who were not there. Any witness who appears before any Grand Jury is treated with respect but should expect thorough questioning from prosecutors and the grand jurors themselves.”In a statement to investigators, Loehman said he opened fire after he and his partner yelled at Tamir to put up his hands. The lawyers for Tamir's family, like other critics, disputed Loehman's account. Tamir could not have heard any commands, because the windows on the patrol car were rolled up, the lawyers wrote. Video showed Loehman open fire within two seconds of exiting the vehicle. Loehman said that Tamir was reaching for his waistband, but the family's lawyers contend that he overreacted because the ""toy gun"" was not visible.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) is trying to deflect Donald Trump with pure kindness.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For the fifth time this cycle and the last of this calendar year, Republican presidential candidates will gather on stage, with millions watching on live TV, and grapple with the vexing question of the election: Just what the hell can they do about the remarkable persistence of Donald Trump? Tuesday night's debate in Las Vegas is, in one main regard, no different than the past ones. Trump comes in demanding -- hell, strangle-holding -- all the attention, with an outlandish, nativist policy proposal, having once again galvanized his followers and tripped up the other campaigns.But with the Iowa caucus now less than 50 days away, the stakes are far higher than when the field first gathered in early August in Cleveland; and the possibility of a Trump win is no longer quite so implausible.And so, a sense of desperation underlines Tuesday night's affair, and a bit of shoulder-shrugging too. Campaigns remain confounded about how confront a candidate so willing to cast aside any moral compunctions that might briefly enter his thoughts, so eager to lash out viciously against any rival who dares gain some traction against him.From this moment of doom, there are small rays of hope for other Republican candidates. While Trump has managed to survive -- and even thrive -- after making dozens of over-the-top pronouncements, he is not as perfectly positioned as he would like you to believe.In fact, Tuesday night's debate could compound a potentially serious problem facing the billionaire. Trump is suddenly losing in the state that will get the first say on whether his frontrunner status is merely a passing diversion after all.The three most recent public surveys of likely Iowa Republican caucus-goers all confirm that Trump is now trailing Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in the nation’s first voting state of Iowa -- including the highly respected Des Moines Register poll, which shows Cruz leading Trump by 10 points.Suddenly, a second question is gaining relevance within the Republican primary -- a question that a psychiatrist with experience in treating Narcissistic Personality Disorder might be better equipped to answer than a political journalist would. How would Trump react if he meets a fate that he most dreads: becoming a loser? A defeat in Iowa, after all, would directly challenge the myth that Trump has created about himself: that he is immune to failure.Trump has already launched what will no doubt remain a concerted effort to knock Cruz off his new pedestal in Iowa -- a familiar tactic of throwing out into the ether a haphazard and explosive brew of character attacks and policy critiques that has worked for him in the past when launched against previous rivals. And Republican operatives expect him to continue the frontal attack during Tuesday night's debate -- if only because the concept of tactical restraint is a foreign one to Trump.But Cruz is a different breed than the candidates whom Trump has mocked in the past -- whether it be Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) for his hair, Gov. John Kasich (R-Ohio) for his poll numbers or former Gov. Jeb Bush (R-Fla.) for his energy.The Texas Republican is a savvy politician. And thus far he has refused to take the bait, laughing off Trump’s predictable missives against him as he declines to trade insults with the man whose supporters he will eventually need in order to make a serious run at the nomination.How Cruz’s strategy of trying to kill Trump with kindness translates on a debate stage in Las Vegas could very well determine the mad sprint to the Feb. 1 caucus. Already, the strategy has been well-suited in Iowa -- a state where nice people are the third-most plentiful crop, after corn and soybeans. Trump, who has spent much of his life fine-tuning the art of the insult, never seemed to be a particularly natural fit for the place.A loss in Iowa could be sustainable for Trump, if he were to solidify his standing in New Hampshire. Though Cruz, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) have risen lately in the polls, all three still trail by significant margins there. Trump's tough-guy shtick -- his business acumen and secular bearing -- has been a particularly potent combination in that first-in-the-nation primary state.Then again, Trump may well be unable to withstand the prospect of failure in Iowa without melting down first."

He then appears to calmly exit his vehicle and walk toward the officer with his hands raised before he’s placed under arrest.According to the police report, Parsley told officers that he did what he did because the hotel’s staff thought his threat was just a bluff.He faces two felony counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and one count of malicious injury to property over $1,000, according to The Enid News & Eagle.Rupal Bhagat Christian, who runs the hotel with her husband, posted several videos of the incident on her Facebook page Sunday. There she also expressed thanks to a higher power for sparing her life.“His intention was to kill me that’s what he had said and attempted twice but failed,” she wrote of her claimed interaction with Parsley.Christian said Parsley thought that he had been charged twice and refused evidence of them having voided the transaction.“I hope this evidence is enough to keep him out of the streets, he is a threat and danger to my life and for community because he is not afraid of going behind bars so if he is out he can attempt to kill/murder me for the third time with any other weapon,” she wrote.Also on HuffPost:"

Murtha said that despite Allan's investigation, the testimonies of multiple witnesses contradicted those findings.Fellow Baltimore City Police Officer Mark Gladhill testified that he saw Gray after the fourth stop and that Gray was holding his head up and kneeling under his own power, which directly challenges Allan's report. Murtha also cited the testimony of Reynolds - an expert in police policy and training - who testified last week that Porter not only acted as a reasonable officer, but that he actually went beyond the call of duty in helping Gray off the floor of the wagon at stop four and inquiring if Gray needed a medic or to go to the hospital.Reynolds said officers have to use discretion as how to implement the general orders, which direct officers to seat-belt prisoners while in transport, when working on the streets. Reynolds also said that sometimes officers have to break with general orders to maintain their own well-being.Officers have to take their own safety into consideration when they interact with detainees, Reynolds told the court during testimony on Friday.The general orders became one of the most important pieces of evidence in the case. Just three days prior to Gray's arrest an email was sent to all officers of the Baltimore Police Department with changes made to the policy dealing with using seat belts for detainees during transportation.The prosecution touted that Porter had failed to abide by the general orders as evidence of a callous disregard for Gray's life, but the defense produced several witnesses that testified that no officers actually seat-belted detainees in the wagons that transported prisoners.Murtha concluded by telling the jury that ""the state failed to provide the evidence or witnesses to prove beyond a doubt that Officer Porter's actions were those of an unreasonable officer.""""Inflaming your passion is not evidence,"" Murtha said.

By this weekend, the few bets that remain are off. Boyega and his co-star Daisy Ridley, both 23, are the faces of a new generation of ""Star Wars"" heroes. After months of magazine covers and television appearances, anyone who doesn't already know their names soon will. And those who have pored over every ounce of minutiae since the first teaser premiered last November have only a handful of blissful days to hold onto their unsullied anticipation. As we well know, expectations for ""The Phantom Menace"" were astronomical in the lead-up to its 1999 release, with fans buying tickets for movies like ""The Waterboy"" and ""Meet Joe Black"" just so they could glimpse the two-minute trailer. That gusto didn't curb the scathing reputation the prequels quickly garnered. The frenzy has been even louder this time around, at least courtesy of an Internet whose influence was far more muted in the late '90s. So, nowadays, how does one prepare to go from little-known actor to global blockbuster superstar? One doesn't, apparently.""I hadn’t thought of that until you just asked,"" the British actor told The Huffington Post a couple of weeks ago with undue modesty, agreeing that it's ""very strange"" to be the subject of popular merchandise and glossy cover stories for something no one has seen. ""It just goes to show the power of 'Star Wars,' doesn’t it? [Fans] don’t know what they’re going to get, and they’re still just like, 'OK, we support this! It’s great!' And that’s always good, but that just means you need to come correct when the film opens.""Assuming ""The Force Awakens"" delivers on J.J. Abrams' promise, the slow decline of Boyega's public anonymity is ideal for the star of what could become the highest-grossing -- and most scrutinized -- movie of all time. He was at a store in London shortly after the Internet exploded in enthusiasm over the first teaser, in which a frenzied Boyega, dressed in a Stormtrooper suit sans helmet, is the first person to appear. He overheard two women in front of him in line ""having a really intense debate"" about whether the movie would be good. Boyega deliberated over whether to clear his throat to catch their attention. He decided to do it.""I literally was just like, 'So funny you guys say that,'"" Boyega recalled. ""And they were like, 'What?' They didn’t know who I was! I literally just walked away because it was very embarrassing.""A year later, Boyega is afforded far less obscurity for his role as Finn, a reformed Stormtrooper who doubles as the Luke Skywalker of ""The Force Awakens."" (Or at least the Luke Skywalker archetype: Mark Hamill is set to reprise his role as the original ""Star Wars"" hero, though his absence from all promotional materials has left fans speculating about what may have become of Darth Vader's son.) Still, the young actor, who appeared in the 2011 British sci-fi comedy ""Attack the Block"" and will next star in the adaptation of Dave Eggers' The Circle, hasn't felt the need to seek advice about how long Finn will live in the shadow of his career (aka forever). He has an easy source, too, in Harrison Ford, who returns to the role of Han Solo after spending three decades ridding himself of the character.""I haven’t really wanted to ask that because that, for me, is a given,"" Boyega said. ""It just depends on how important I make it in my head. For me, it’s not that important because it’s 'Star Wars.' It’s a given that that’s going to be a major question throughout your whole career. I’m looking at Harrison at his young age and people are still asking him about it. And it’s like, 'Cool.' But for me, as long as I get to express art through different films and different stories, I’m fine with people wanting to bring up the 'Star Wars' thing."" Whether or not Boyega comprehends exactly what he's in for come Friday, at which point critics and fans will have begun to opine en masse, he insists there's a reason to be hopeful. Before Monday's Los Angeles premiere, he was one of the few people who could confirm that all those toys snatched up sight-unseen were justified. ""If I was Disney, I’d probably be thinking to myself, 'Well, they better like it,'"" Boyega said. ""And they will. They will. I’ve watched the movie, and it’s safe to say that all the hype is definitely worth it.""""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" opens Dec. 18, in case you didn't already know. Also on HuffPost:"

The weekly series will be a product of an increasingly compressed political news cycle, in which books and documentaries, which once came out long after the final votes were tallied, are dropping in the heat of campaign season. While Halperin and Heilemann's best-selling books on the 2008 and 2012 elections didn't hit shelves until at least a year after those races ended, the first book offering fly-on-the-wall details of several 2016 Republican campaigns was published last month. Similarly, the documentary Caucus, which took viewers inside the 2012 nominating contest in Iowa, wasn't released until late 2013, but some news organizations, including The Huffington Post, are experimenting with documentary-style coverage this cycle as the campaigns unfold. ""Americans are captivated by the 2016 presidential election and a real-time political series of this nature has never been done before,"" said Showtime president David Nevins said in a statement. ""People don't want to wait a year to see how and why things played out and the impact they had. Everything today is immediate, so there's no better time to change the way American politics are covered.""""The Circus,"" which will air from January to November, will track several storylines and follow characters from within the campaigns. While Halperin and Heilemann have long been traversing the country, interviewing candidates for their Bloomberg TV show, McKinnon has been spotted in recent months gathering material for the documentary series.In late October, a reporter tweeted a picture of McKinnon meeting with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a presidential hopeful, in Des Moines. Another reporter spotted McKinnon chatting with Rubio spokesman Alex Conant Monday night in Las Vegas. The Showtime series marks the second time this month that Bloomberg has partnered with another network to broaden the viewership for its political coverage. Last week, MSNBC announced that it would begin re-airing Halperin and Heilemann's daily 5 p.m. Bloomberg TV show, ""With All Due Respect,"" at 6 p.m. in January.The deal gives MSNBC a three-hour politics block -- with Chuck Todd's ""MTP Daily"" at 5 p.m. and Chris Matthews' ""Hardball"" at 7 p.m. -- and allows Bloomberg TV to reach more viewers. The business-focused network has a small viewership and is not rated by Nielsen.Bloomberg Media chief Justin Smith highlighted the need to reach audiences in new ways in a Tuesday memo to staff. ""In the media world of late 2015, companies can't sit back and wait for audiences to discover them -- you have to be prepared to deliver your content to audiences wherever they are,"" Smith said. ""Bloomberg Media benefits from unique corporate advantages that allow us to pursue innovative distribution models to reach readers and viewers wherever they are, on whatever platform they prefer.""Smith said ""one of the clearest examples of this approach is how we are showcasing Bloomberg Media's coverage of the 2016 presidential campaign."" The Showtime series, he said, ""aims to pull back the curtain on the race by exposing the intimate, emotional, funny, and revealing details"" that might not be covered on the weekday program. Smith said Halperin and Heilemann will be able to use some of the material gathered for the Showtime series on ""With All Due Respect.""Read Smith's full memo below:All,"
18,POLITICS,Democrats Ramp Up Redistricting Plans In Effort To Avoid Repeating 2010 Fiasco,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-ramp-up-redistricting-plans-in-effort-to-avoid-repeating-2010-fiasco_us_56701109e4b011b83a6c784b,“He who controls redistricting can control Congress.”,2015-12-15,"DGA Chairman Dannel Malloy (D-Connecticut) is focusing heavy resources on redistricting in 2020, arguing it's the best, perhaps only, path for Democrats to win back the House.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- In an acknowledgement of the steep climb they face to regain control of the House of Representatives, three top Democratic campaign committees will meet this week to plot strategy for redrawing the congressional map, roughly five years before it will be altered.Top officials from the Democratic Governors Association, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee will attend the meeting at the DGA's offices in downtown D.C. on Thursday. An official with the Democratic National Committee will also attend. With the underlying goal of producing a sophisticated and coordinated redistricting effort to match Republicans, Thursday’s strategy session is seen as the first of many steps in recalibrating the balance of power in the states and on Capitol Hill.""We’ve got to get ready and to get ready we have to get everybody around the table,” Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, chair of the DGA, told The Huffington Post. “We need to make sure everyone is paying attention to this issue now. Each year, between now and the year after the census, we have important elections that will determine whether Republicans will jerry-rig a permanent majority or whether we can make it a fair map.”Democrats face a daunting challenge. Forty-three states are required to redraw their congressional district lines after the 2020 census is complete. And though there are myriad -- often-complicated -- mechanisms by which those lines are put together, more often than not, the state legislatures are given power to come up with a plan and governors can serve as a check on the process. All of which keeps Republicans well positioned to retain their current power stronghold. Right now, the GOP controls 68 out of 98 state partisan legislative chambers, while in 23 states it controls the governor’s office and both houses of the legislature (Democrats have full control in only seven), according to RealClearPolitics.This was no accident. The Republican State Leadership Committee, which has spearheaded the party's redistricting strategy, raised more than $140 million since the 2004 election to prepare for the post-2010 congressional map redrawing. And they tactically targeted states where there was more likely to be a greater turnover in seats. Karl Rove, the longtime Bush operative who helped guide that RSLC effort, wrote in The Wall Street Journal, “he who controls redistricting can control Congress.”Rove was right. Republican lawmakers at the state level won big in 2010. And, consequently, they were able to redraw more maps that helped influence races at the congressional level (occasionally in legally dubious ways). Those maps weren't the only factor in explaining the struggle Democrats have had in off-year elections. But even in the 2012 elections -- a presidential cycle -- Democrats gained only eight seats in the House and remained firmly in the minority despite winning 1.4 million more votes than Republicans. The 2014 elections -- a wave for the GOP -- brought the party down to a paltry 188 House members.To upend the current landscape, the committees will have to devote significant resources, considering that the RSLC has pledged $125 million to the 2020 effort. The DGA, according to an official there, will put ""tens of millions"" of dollars during the next three cycles towards it's ""Unrig The Map"" prospectus, which eyes influencing the post 2020 redistricting process. The DLCC, meanwhile, started a $70-million-over-four-cycles campaign dubbed Advantage 2020; while the DCCC, launched the Majority Project -- a three-pronged election strategy that includes a comprehensive database of voter data, a specific engagement plan for Democratic-leaning communities, and a proactive redistricting effort with allies.Thursday's meeting is meant to add a level of coordination to these plans. Officials from each committee will spend 15 minutes presenting respective redistricting strategy, according to a schedule of the session provided to The Huffington Post. The hope is that by synchronizing efforts, Democrats will better able to pinpoint critical races, create a more centralized database for voter contacts, excel at candidate recruitment and amplify messaging.The coordination will, for the time being, be conversational. There are no current plans to create a centralized office that would oversee redistricting strategy; nor will additional staffers be added. “I wouldn’t rule that out at all,"" Malloy said, adding that the idea right now is ""that there will be regular organizational meetings among the big parties.""DCCC Chairman Ben Ray Luján (D-NM) said in a statement to HuffPost that this would be the first of many meetings and regular conversations between Democratic allies on redistricting. ""I look forward to a robust discussion to ensure our organizations understand each other’s responsibilities and goals and can identify key areas of overlap and cooperation.""That these types of meetings didn't already take place underscores how ill-prepared Democrats were during the last redistricting process. Mark Schauer, director of Advantage 2020, said that as a congressman from Michigan heading into the 2010 election, he had no inkling of coordination between committees. ""Our only conversation about redistricting was about legal strategies and putting together funding for legal strategies,"" Schauer said. ""And the sad reality about that is you only need a legal strategy when you end up with bad maps.""To turn those maps back closer towards pre-2010 lines, each of these organizations has specific strategies.For Advantage 2020, the DLCC is prioritizing state houses it feels can be flipped from Republican control, with top targets in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Florida, Virginia, Wisconsin and North Carolina. The DGA, in its presentation on redistricting, spotlighted 18 states where the governor plays a key role and where the committee believes a change in power could result in a more favorably-redrawn map prior to the 2022 election. The DCCC's primary objective remains to find a net gain of 30 congressional seats to get to 218.Clouding each of these proposals is a similar question: can a party that successfully organized behind successive presidential campaigns convince everyone from the donor class on down that it needs to do the same at the local level? And can they do it nearly five years before the critical voting takes place.""It is being discussed more in these circles,"" said Carolyn Fiddler, National Communications Director at the DLCC. ""But whether they put their money where their mouth is, we will find out soon.""Also on HuffPost:"
19,POLITICS,A Child Is Shot To Death Every Other Day In The U.S.,Nick Wing,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gun-deaths-children_us_566f1e4ee4b0e292150ec036,Kids have faced tragic levels of gun violence in the three years since Sandy Hook.,2015-12-15,"Kate Suba (left), Jaden Albrecht (center) and Simran Chand pay their respects at one of the makeshift memorials in honor of the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A grim new statistic is putting the spotlight back on the youngest victims of gun violence, three years after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School.On Monday, NBC News reported that at least 555 children under the age of 12 have been shot to death in America since Dec. 14, 2012, the day a heavily armed gunman entered the Newtown, Connecticut, school and killed 26 people, including 20 students. That's a rate of about one child every other day, which, according to federally collected data, appears to be consistent with pre-Sandy Hook rates. (The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention breaks out deaths for the age group 14 and under, so it's hard to make a direct comparison.)The children's deaths account for only a small portion of overall gun violence, which claims tens of thousands of American lives each year, even after the number of murders dropped significantly in the 1990s. For its total, NBC News cited independently verified data pulled from a variety of sources, including local news reports and the Gun Violence Archive, a not-for-profit organization that tracks U.S. shootings. In 2014 alone, CDC data showed that 460 kids 14 and under were shot to death in homicides, suicides and unintentional shootings, according to NBC News. That's out of a total of more than 33,000 gun deaths for the year, according to a Huffington Post review of the CDC dataset.All these numbers increase significantly when non-fatal shootings are taken into account. According to the Gun Violence Archive, children below the age of 12 have been involved in at least 658 shooting incidents so far this year. Recent victims include a 4-year-old, who is expected to survive after shooting himself in the neck with his grandparents' gun earlier this month, and 7-year-old Emma Nowling, who was shot and killed by a family friend after soccer practice.Perhaps it shouldn't come as a surprise that there has been no measurable reduction in gun violence against kids -- or anyone, really -- in the years since Sandy Hook. Congress hasn't passed a single bill to address gun violence in that period. And while it's unclear what effect stricter laws would have on the sorts of mass shootings that often prompt conversations about gun control, a number of scholars have found evidence that regulating access to firearms can reduce overall levels of gun homicides and suicides. From a public health perspective, that's just as important as a promise to prevent another Newtown.In the face of federal inaction, some states have taken up the cause of gun control with their own reform efforts. Others have pushed measures to loosen restrictions on gun sales. In 2015, as driving continues to get safer, gun deaths are expected to outpace automobile deaths.With an estimate of more than 300 million guns in the U.S. -- about one for each person, if not more -- many Americans seem resigned to viewing gun violence as unavoidable. A Wall Street Journal/NBC survey, published Monday, found that 71 percent consider mass shootings and other random acts of violence to be permanent features of American society.With so many firearms around, young children end up as both victims and perpetrators of gun violence. As The Washington Post reported in October, toddlers in the U.S. are shooting themselves and others at a rate of about once per week.Also on HuffPost:"

Well, kind of.The star not only appears to be around the same size as the gas giant planet in our solar system, but it also has a strange and stormy dark spot on its surface (pictured above) that's mysteriously similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot. While planets have been known to have cloudy storms that appear as spots, this new discovery is the best evidence yet that stars can have the same thing, according to a statement released by NASA last week.Now, the astronomers plan to seek out other stormy stars in order to determine whether the cloudy spots are common or not.""We know this newfound storm has lasted at least two years, and probably longer,"" Dr. John Gizis, physics and astronomy professor at the University of Delaware and lead author of a paper describing the star, said in the statement. ""We don't know if this kind of star storm is unique or common, and... why it persists for so long.""The star, named W1906+40, was first discovered in 2011, and for the past two years, Gizis and his colleagues have been observing its storm using data from NASA's Spitzer and Kepler space telescopes.The astronomers found that W1906+40, which belongs to a class of celestial objects called L-dwarfs, has a temperature of around 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit and rotates on its axis about every nine hours. Earlier in their observations, the astronomers noticed that the star can be quite moody and release stunningly powerful flares.Their latest paper describing the star and its stormy atmosphere was published in The Astrophysical Journal on Nov. 4.Previously on HuffPost Science: Stunning Jupiter Video Reveals Mysterious New Red Spot FeatureAlso on HuffPost:"

But half of Americans now say they disagree with his political positions, up 7 percentage points since July, and 57 percent hold an unfavorable view of him personally. HuffPost Pollster's aggregate of all publicly available surveys gives him an average net favorability rating of -22, making him less popular than any 2016 candidate save for former Florida Gov Jeb Bush (R), former Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) or Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.).That trio suffers from a lack of support among Republicans, a problem Trump doesn't share.Fifty-seven percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning voters in the HuffPost/YouGov poll say they'd be satisfied or enthusiastic to have Trump as their nominee, up 5 points since July. Three-quarters agree with Trump's political positions, and 58 percent say they have a favorable view of him personally.Seventy-one percent of Americans, including 62 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning voters, say the media pay too much attention to Donald Trump. (Sorry, guys.) Just 3 percent of the public doesn't think Trump is getting his fair due in the press.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Dec. 10-11 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

The publisher later removed questions in the article about the group's owners remaining secret, as The Huffington Post reported. Over the weekend, some Review-Journal staffers expressed frustration that they still didn't know who was behind News + Media Capital Group LLC.At 4 p.m. EST on Monday, around two dozen Review-Journal staffers began tweeting links to the Society of Professional Journalists' Code of Ethics, which includes a section on being ""accountable and transparent."" There's been speculation that Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire casino magnate and Republican donor, could be involved in the mystery purchase. An Adelson representative has not responded to requests for comment. But a couple billionaires were ruled out on Monday after Charles and David Koch denied buying the paper. Even former Florida governor and Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush, who met for an hour Monday afternoon with the Review-Journal's editorial board, is in the dark. A member of the Review-Journal's editorial board brought up the issue at the beginning of Monday's meeting, prompting Bush to ask if the staff really didn't know who bought the paper, according to a source familiar with the meeting. Bush joked that it might be GOP hopeful Donald Trump. Bush was in Las Vegas ahead of Tuesday night's CNN Republican debate, which will be held at The Venetian, a hotel Adelson owns.
