But there are at least 10 reasons that women will rock a remake of the 1980s classic in a demon and ghost-possessed 21st century.,2015-02-04,Undated handout photo showing the logo for the new Ghostbusters video game.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb600542100000001c88889.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As a general rule, I hate Hollywood remakes. There is such a dearth of originality in Hollywood, that I cringe whenever I hear that someone is going to take an old idea, that was fabulous the first time around, and update it or, sometimes just copy it, to make a quick buck with moviegoers.But it looks like I'm not alone in holding back my judgment on the just announced all-female cast for a Ghostbusters 3 movie. Even though Tinseltown is still overwhelmingly male, there is a new moon on the rise with women of a certain age and, dare I say, feminist women of a certain age.With the announcement, some men seem to be threatened that the childhood memories will be ruined or that a classic film will be emasculated. But there are at least 10 reasons that women will rock a remake of the 1980s classic in a demon and ghost-possessed 21st century:1. Because women can be more than a demon cannister.2. The Sigourney Weaver character would slap her boss, who badgers her incessantly about a dinner date, with a sexual harassment lawsuit faster than you can say ""The Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.""3. ""The Gatekeeper"" won't have unprotected sex with ""The Keymaster.""4. Ghostbusters Inc. will be a woman-owned business.4. Because gender doesn't matter for this story. It's not a movie about men or women. It's a movie about ghosts. So please don't call it a ""chick flick.""5. The girls get the more awesome visual effects.6. Some of the dude critics are afraid their childhood dreams and memories will be crushed. GB3 will show today's girls what they can reach for -- whether it's being a ghostbuster themselves or the next wave of Hollywood producers!7. Maybe they'll write in a cameo appearance for the new She-Thor.8. It's no gimmick to showing our girls strong -- and funny -- female characters. Am I right Tina and Amy?9. Because there will be a geeky woman scientist and geeky women scientists are inspiring, fabulous and hot. 10. Because Ghostbusters in any iteration is awesome!Joanne Bamberger is an independent journalist and journalism entrepreneur who is also the author of the book Mothers of Intention: How Women and Social Media are Revolutionizing Politics in America, an Amazon.com bestseller.

1,WORLDPOST,The Familiar Yet 'Forgotten' Tragedy of Hama,"Maryam Saleh, ContributorSyrian-American writer based in Tampa",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-familiar-yet-forgotte_b_6592766.html,"On February 2, 1982, Syrian troops -- acting under the orders of then-President Hafez al-Assad and led by his brother, Rifaat al-Assad -- besieged the city of Hama in an effort to quell an anti-government uprising by the Muslim Brotherhood.",2015-02-04,2015-02-02-10888630_824368354269109_332982221876521876_n.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-02-02-10888630_824368354269109_332982221876521876_n-thumb.jpg,"On February 2, 1982, Syrian troops -- acting under the orders of then-President Hafez al-Assad and led by his brother, Rifaat al-Assad -- besieged the city of Hama in an effort to quell an anti-government uprising by the Muslim Brotherhood. By the 28th of that month, as many as 40,000 people had been killed, the majority of them unarmed civilians. For 27 days, artillery shells rained down on the city while soldiers, who had sworn an oath to protect their homeland (and its people), gunned down family after family in their homes and in city streets.For decades to come, the Syrian people were effectively silenced. The massacre, referred to as al-Ahdath (the ""events""), was discussed only in hushed tones and in utter privacy. In Hama, a hotel was built atop the ruins of al-Keilaneyeh neighborhood, which had been completely flattened, while half-destroyed houses remained untouched in some of the city's other neighborhoods, serving as a reminder of what would happen to those who dared speak out against the dictatorial regime.It was not until the birth of the popular uprising against current President Bashar al-Assad in March 2011 that the Syrian people began to publicly talk about what had befallen Hama and mourn the thousands of lives lost. The phrase ""Oh Hama, forgive us"" became commonplace in revolutionary songs, as the people of Syria tried to come to terms with the fact that they had remained silent during and after the onslaught of the country's fourth-largest city so many years ago.  A graphic design featuring Hama's landmark waterwheels and a blood-stained Orontes River marks the 33rd anniversary of the massacre. The 30th anniversary of the Hama massacre in February 2012 was the first real opportunity for the city's people -- the children and grandchildren of the victims -- to mourn the destruction of their city and its people. On a Facebook page entitled ""Commemorating the 30th Anniversary of the Hama Massacre,"" activists worked tirelessly to collect and disseminate the photos and biographies of the massacre's martyrs. Some of those activists, operating under pseudonyms, were able to, for the first time, publicly declare that their fathers had been killed by the Assad regime; for years, the government had offered certain benefits to families who signed documents stating that their loved ones were killed by the Muslim Brothers. There was an outpour of stories of the massacre being shared online, a hidden truth becoming public knowledge for the very first time. In Riyadh, Syrians in exile hosted an event marking the 30th anniversary, remembering the city's martyrs, and screening a mini-documentary produced specifically for the event. Eventually, Al Jazeera Arabic produced a full-length historical documentary about the events of 1982. And in Hama itself, the photographers of the Young Hamwi Lens collective took to the city's streets, photographing the ruins in neighborhoods such as al-Bashoura and Souq al-Shajara.When the Syrian revolution broke out nearly four years ago, the people were confident that Hama 1982 would not be repeated. Surely the power of social media and the ability to share with the world what was taking place in Syria would prevent Bashar from committing the same atrocities that his father had gotten away with! But alas, their optimism turned out to be sorely misplaced. On this 33rd anniversary, Homs and Aleppo and Douma and Ghouta and Darayya and Banias and Daraa and Deir Ezzor and countless towns and villages across Syria have been decimated, at least 200,000 people martyred, hundreds of thousands imprisoned and forcibly disappeared, and millions displaced. All on the world's watch.I have not many words left to say about Syria. Words will not stop the bloodshed, feed the hungry, shelter the displaced, or liberate those perishing behind bars. They will not heal the emotional and physical trauma endured by so many over the last four years, and they most certainly will not rebuild entire cities or repair the social fabric that has been torn apart. But I could not allow this occasion to pass without memorializing it. To the martyrs of Hama and Syria as a whole, forgive us, and rest in peace."
2,GREEN,Saving The Least Protected Habitat On Earth,"Mark Tercek, ContributorPresident & CEO, The Nature Conservancy; Author, 'Nature's...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/saving-the-least-protecte_b_6599852.html,"It's possible for people and wildlife to thrive side by side on the plains. The key is to work collaboratively with everyone who has a stake in this precious resource, from ranchers to nomadic herdsmen, from energy companies to government policy-makers.",2015-02-04,2015-02-02-grassbank_tnc_71904862_preview_cropped.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-02-02-grassbank_tnc_71904862_preview_cropped-thumb.jpg,"In the second episode of the new PBS series, EARTH: A New Wild, which debuts on PBS tonight, we learn about radical new ideas for restoring the planet's iconic grasslands. It may seem counterintuitive, but adding more grazing animals to damaged grasslands can restore the land to health. In tonight's episode, my former colleague Sanjayan visits the African plains, the Russian saiga, the Arctic tundra and the North American prairie to explore this idea. In each of these places we see that the plains support much more than wildlife. Grasslands are the world's breadbasket. They are where we grow our food and raise our livestock. They protect freshwater resources and regulate our climate by storing carbon dioxide. They provide an increasing number of our pharmaceuticals. And of course they provide habitat for multitudes of plants and animals.Yet grasslands are the planet's least protected and most altered terrestrial habitat. Intensive agriculture has replaced 41 percent of the world's temperate grasslands and 13.5 percent have been converted to urban, industrial and other uses. Worldwide, only about 5 percent of remaining grasslands are in protected status. Meanwhile, the threats are only increasing. As the world's population rapidly grows, demands for food, energy and space are putting more pressure on an already threatened landscape. The good news: it's possible for people and wildlife to thrive side by side on the plains. The key is to work collaboratively with everyone who has a stake in this precious resource, from ranchers to nomadic herdsmen, from energy companies to government policy-makers. Take ranching, for example. Some might think that raising livestock is incompatible with conservation. That's far from the case. On the plains, it turns out that grazing cattle like the large wild herds that once dominated these landscapes--in large, tightly-knit groups constantly on the move--can help nourish the soil, encourage plant growth and diversity and bring grasslands back to life. From the Great Plains to Kenya to Patagonia, The Nature Conservancy is working with ranchers to implement sustainable grazing techniques like this that benefit both nature and traditional ranching culture. Grassbanking is another innovative technique benefiting both people and wildlife on the plains. Under these programs, ranchers pay discounted fees to graze their cattle on a communal grassbank in exchange for wildlife-friendly practices on their own operations. The result: better wildlife habitat on private lands, as well as more grass for ranchers' cattle. As Montana rancher Leo Barthelmes says, ""We were a little skeptical at first. But it's working for us. It's got ranchers thinking about birds, and conservationists thinking about cattle."" We are now working with traditional pastoralists to adapt the strategy for Kenya. There, grassbanks are reserved for wildlife but can be used as emergency grazing lands for cattle in times of drought. It's a win-win for both people and nature. Of course grasslands around the world are valued not just for their agricultural and grazing productivity, but also for their rich oil and gas resources. And just as we've seen with ranching, it is possible to balance energy development with the needs of nature. In places like Mongolia, for example, leaders are looking to The Nature Conservancy for help as they pursue economic development in a sustainable way. As the country transitioned to a capitalist economy in recent decades, global petroleum and mining companies quickly moved in. But Mongolia's leadership was smart. They wanted to balance development with the country's traditional nomadic herding traditions and extraordinary natural heritage--including some of the planet's great remaining grasslands. Working with both the national government and with mining companies like Rio Tinto, TNC scientists created a conservation blueprint for the country. The plan is guiding development away from the most sensitive areas, and directing resources to strengthen protection at priority sites. Using smart science and collaboration, we can ensure a sustainable future for both the people and wildlife of Mongolia. From the nomadic herders of Mongolia to the ranchers of the American West, people depend on healthy grasslands for their lives and livelihoods.

3,COLLEGE,American Sniper: Students Debate Film's Quality and Impact,"Dan Reimold, ContributorReporter, author, journalism professor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/american-sniper-students-_b_6601472.html,"Amid the debates and staggeringly strong ticket sales, student journalists nationwide are weighing in with their own reviews of American Sniper and commentaries on its political and cultural significance.",2015-02-04,"Hosts Chris Pine and Academy President Cheryl Boone announce the movie 'American Sniper' as one of the Oscar nominees for Best Picture during the Academy Awards Nominations Announcement at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills, California on January 15, 2015. The 87th Oscars will be held on February 22 at the Dolby Theatre in downtown Hollywood. This year's crop of hotly-tipped movies is heavy on true stories: four of the five films nominated for the best drama award at last weekend's Golden Globes -- many of which could figure on the Oscars best picture shortlist -- were based on real-life events. AFP PHOTO/MARK RALSTON (Photo credit should read MARK RALSTON/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae55362600003500812c8c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"American Sniper has ruled at the box office for the past three weekends, racking up record-breaking grosses, while also earning multiple Oscar nominations.The film -- focused on the life and legendary Iraq War exploits of Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle -- has also stirred patriotic fervor and criticism in equal measure. Mainstream and social media continue to debate the film's accuracy, its depiction of snipers, its perspective on the U.S. military presence in Iraq, its impact on the Arab and Muslim communities and whether Kyle represents everything that is right or wrong with America today.Amid those debates and staggeringly strong ticket sales, student journalists nationwide are weighing in with their own reviews of the film and commentaries on its political and cultural significance.In The Spectator student newspaper, Seattle University sophomore Harrison Bucher calls the movie ""an amazing true story of an American hero.""North Carolina State University student Kevin Schaefer agrees, describing it in The Technician as nothing less than ""an exhilarating cinematic experience... that leaves audiences speechless.""Middle Tennessee State University student Maranda Faris is only slightly less enthused. In The Sidelines, she writes that American Sniper is ""an emotional roller-coaster that will have you on the edge of your seat for 132 minutes.""University of North Texas student Dalton LaFerney is also a huge fan of the film. ""American Sniper not only deserves the applause of movie critics and the prestige of Hollywood gold, but it's also a film that should be screened in psychology classes,"" LaFerney contends in The North Texas Daily. It's the kind of film that offers beautiful symbolism, bringing to life a true story. ... While many war films exploit battlefield tension, such as gunfire, massive explosions and carnage, American Sniper is more about the cerebral side of fighting. A warrior is more of a thinker, someone who has purpose not only in battle, but in life.In The Reflector, Mississippi State University student Blake Morgan argues the key to enjoying the film is to view it on a personal -- not political -- level.""What makes this movie so different from other American war movies, from Saving Private Ryan to Fury, is this movie is more about one man's journey through war,"" Morgan explains. ...The movie does not make a statement either way on America's decision to enter Iraq or to stay there for an extended period of time. 'American Sniper' hardly even approaches the subject; instead, it focuses on one man's mission to protect his friends, family and country.University of Oregon student Chris Berg appreciates the movie's mission of displaying both the glamor and gritty underbelly of war. But, he does point out two major narrative set-ups that he sees as less-than-stellar -- a dehumanization of the ""enemy,"" and a deification of Kyle.""We ... see next-to-nothing that permits the audience to sympathize with Iraqi soldiers and citizens,"" Berg declares in The Emerald. One of the few foreigners who does come off as something remotely human is soon revealed to be a traitor (by Kyle, no less). On the home-front, his redemption is represented in the form of returning to the traditional 'cowboy' lifestyle from which he came. His death is also never shown on screen, with the information conveyed directed to the audience through an epilogue post-script. All these elements heighten the impression that Kyle is larger than life -- a modern hero of a modern war.University of Southern Mississippi student Noé Cugny is similarly disturbed by what he perceives as an oversimplified depiction of Iraqis. As he writes in The Student Printz:The entire population the soldiers encountered in American Sniper is reduced to an anti-hero, similar to a comic book villain: vicious and misleading collaborators, helpless families who asked for money in exchange of information and were too foolish to understand that they needed America's help, or mere faceless terrorist minions, waiting to be shot down to the great joy of a bloodthirsty, flag-waving audience.Cheers or jeers aside, James Madison University student Matt D'Angelo wants the public to understand one main thing: ""The American Sniper isn't evil."" D'Angelo is making that case in respect to not only the movie, but the autobiography on which it is based, and the real-life man behind the film's main character.As he confirms in The Breeze:The man experienced war firsthand. He watched horrible people do horrible things. He had to make tough ethical calls regarding who lived and who died. There should be no surprise that he hated the Iraqi insurgents he was fighting. In other words, just because he killed more than any other sniper doesn't mean he was a crazed psycho picking off civilians left and right. ... [T]his movie was not like Lone Survivor or Saving Private Ryan. It didn't glorify war and the horrendous atrocities that are committed. It simply told the raw story of how a man who confronted evil on a regular basis and had to return home and be 'normal' again.Meanwhile, Sienna Heights University student Nate Adams argues there is nothing normal -- in a good way -- about Bradley Cooper's raw portrayal of Kyle.As he writes in The Spectra:Bradley Cooper is a revelation, giving, without question, the most authentic performance of the last year (and wholeheartedly earns his Oscar nom). He put on over 60 pounds of muscle, carries his southern drawl with crisp and clear diction, and gives you the true face of a man who has seen far too much -- one of the best characterizations ever.Ultimately, audiences' characterization of American Sniper appears to depend on the prism through which they view the film.At USM, Cugny writes:I feel sour, even sick, when witnessing the people in a theater room cheering in front of a film that glorifies acts of violence while shamelessly simplifying extremely complex realities and unapologetically categorizing entire chunks of the world population.By comparison, according to Schaefer at NC State:American Sniper is a reflection of the idea of the American hero, combined with the grittiness of modern day war films. It's hard-hitting, well-acted, well-produced and, Oscar nominations aside, well-deserving of at least one viewing."
4,ENTERTAINMENT,The Gentle Genius Behind the Greatest Jazz Label: Alfred Lion and Blue Note,"Ted Fox, ContributorAuthor, producer, manager",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-gentle-genius-behind-_b_6606198.html,"Monday was the anniversary of Alfred Lion's death in 1987. The founder of Blue Note - the greatest jazz label of all time - Lion produced some nine hundred records, including Thelonious Monk's first recordings.",2015-02-04,2015-02-03-0_AlfredLion_02_WithSonnyRollinscopy.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-02-03-0_AlfredLion_02_WithSonnyRollinscopy-thumb.jpg,"Monday was the anniversary of Alfred Lion's death in 1987. The founder of Blue Note - the greatest jazz label of all time - Lion produced some nine hundred records, including Thelonious Monk's first recordings. As I shamelessly promote my book, In The Groove, which features one of the most comprehensive interviews Lion ever gave, I should note that he never took a production credit.""Whenever you have a Blue Note in your hand,"" he told me, ""and you don't see my name on it, that's the one I made.""Many producers will say they never made a record they didn't like, but perhaps none can say that with such verity as Lion. Inspired by John Hammond's historic ""From Spirituals to Swing"" concert in 1938, Lion made his first recordings with two of the stars of that concert, Albert Ammons and Meade Lux Lewis. He established the reputation of his fledgling company with Sidney Bechet's classic ""Summertime."" His friend from his native Berlin, Francis Wolff, barely made it out of Nazi Germany in 1941, with Lion's help. Joining with Lion, and guided by their friend and musical advisor, saxophonist Ike Quebec, they began to document the exciting new bebop scene in the mid-forties with Monk, Bud Powell, and young Miles Davis. Lion also recognized the genius of Art Blakey, and made all of the great Jazz Messengers hard bop classics. Remarkably, and with characteristic self-deprecating candor, this Christopher Columbus of bebop told me he didn't really understand the new sound at first: ""I didn't dig it all the way. I'm sorry,"" he recalled to me. ""I didn't, and I'm not the only one who didn't. Then I started to hear...I love drummers. So when I heard Max Roach I said, 'Yeah it's different.' But I didn't know what it all was because I'm not a musician, and I could never read a note. All those years I had Blue Note I went by my ears and by my feeling. So I didn't know what they were doing with different timing and so forth, I just heard the difference. But it started to click for me. I could hear it better.""Many decades before the advent of college music production courses, and the Garage Band app, the founder of the world's most influential jazz record company started making records with absolutely no experience, nor technical know how. When I asked, he couldn't even remember where he made his first recording. ""I had no ideas of going into the business yet. I just wanted to make those records,"" he said. Aided by bottles of bourbon and scotch he cut ""the plates.""He liked what he heard and Blue Note was born: ""I decided to make some pressings and go into the record business. But I had no idea about how it was done. And what was the competition? Victor. Columbia. Decca. That was all. The three big companies.""In 1953 he hooked up with a young man, Rudy Van Gelder, who would become the greatest jazz engineer of all time with a marvelous studio he built from scratch. At that time, however, Van Gelder was recording sessions in his parent's living room in Hackensack, New Jersey: ""It was small. His equipment was limited, naturally,"" said Lion. ""He had a separate booth where he sat behind the glass, and the musicians played out in the living room. We moved all the furniture out, of course. I never changed engineers after that.""In the fifties and sixties Lion and Blue Note started or nurtured the recording careers of Horace Silver, Herbie Nichols, Lou Donaldson, Clifford Brown, Jimmy Smith, and Kenny Burrell... then Jackie McLean, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Freddie Hubbard, Donald Byrd, and Andrew Hill, among many others. He also explored the avant-garde with Ornette Coleman, Eric Dolphy, and Cecil Taylor. ""Did you intentionally try to create a group of people who would be associated with Blue Note?"" I asked him.""No, I didn't have that thought at all. It came very naturally. I used the men on the dates that sounded good to me. If the record came out really well, I'd say, let's make him a leader next time. I'd ask him if he had any good material. That's how all those guys developed at Blue Note. Herbie Hancock. Wayne Shorter. Lee Morgan. Now they say I was developing a repertory company, but I didn't dream this up.""Health problems forced Lion to sell out in 1966, and Francis Wolff stayed on until his death in 1971. Blue Note is now owned by a huge multi-national corporation. Lucky for us it has been - first under the brilliant stewardship of Bruce Lundvall, and now, Don Was - both very respectful and very intelligent about preserving and protecting Alfred Lion's treasured legacy. It's all there for us to enjoy today. They've even made sure to remain true to the groundbreaking modernist cover designs of Reid Miles, who, eerily, died six years to the day after Lion.TED FOX is the author of Showtime at the Apollo: The Story of Harlem's World Famous Theater, the definitive history of the Apollo, and In The Groove: The Men Who Made The Music Business.

6,WORLDPOST,Is Ukraine Fascist?,"Alexander Motyl, ContributorUkrainian-American Political Scientist, Rutgers University",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/putin-calls-ukraine-fasci_b_6600292.html,Ukraine ousted Yanukovych in order to avoid becoming fully authoritarian. The war Putin unleashed against Ukraine is his way of telling Ukraine that fascism and democracy are incompatible.,2015-02-03,"Russian President Vladimir Putin wears special glasses as he visits a research facility of the St. Petersburg State University in St. Petersburg, Russia, on Monday, Jan. 26, 2015. In televised comments after a meeting with students in St. Petersburg, President Vladimir Putin said that Ukraineâs army was at fault for the increase in violence and accused it of using civilians as âcannon fodderâ in the conflict. â(Ukraineâs army) is not even an army, itâs a foreign legion, in this case a foreign NATO legion,â Putin said. âThey have totally different goals, connected to the geopolitical containment of Russia, which absolutely do not coincide with the national interests of the Ukrainian people.â (AP Photo/RIA Novosti Kremlin, Mikhail Klimentyev, Presidential Press Service)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc144b824000033003829c1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"So which is it? Is Ukraine a hotbed of fascism, as the Kremlin and its supporters insist? Or is it a tolerant democracy, as Kiev and its supporters insist?The issue is important to sort out since members of the new Greek government, including Prime Minister Tsipsas, have suggested in the recent past that the new government in Kiev has neo-fascist links that harken to memories of World War II. And that has been the view often promoted by the Kremlin from the outset of the conflict.Although there are often two sides to a story, in this case, there really isn't. The Kremlin is dead wrong, and even though Ukraine isn't quite the consolidated democracy that its government says it is, the country is certainly far more democratic now than it was just over a year ago. And, despite some zigzags, it is becoming more democratic with every day.Let's start with a brief discussion of what fascism is and then ask whether any of Ukraine's present or past government fits the bill.WHAT IS FASCISM?Fascism is often used as an epithet, especially by the left, but it actually is a perfectly respectable academic term that refers to a particular type of political system. Everyone can agree that fascist states are authoritarian -- that is, they lack the fundamental attributes of democracy. Unlike democracies, fascist systems lack meaningful parliaments, judiciaries, parties, political contestation and elections. In fascist systems, as in all authoritarian systems, parliaments are rubber-stamp institutions, judiciaries do what the leader tells them, opposition parties are marginal and electoral outcomes are preordained. Like all authoritarian states, fascist states are highly centralized and hierarchical, they give pride of place within the power structure to soldiers and policemen, usually secret policemen, and they always have a supreme leader. Indeed, there can be no fascist state without a supreme leader. Like authoritarian states, fascist states limit freedom of the press, freedom of speech and freedom of assembly; and espouse some form of ethnocentrism glorifying their nation and their state and their fabulous past, present and future. But fascist states are not just run-of-the-mill authoritarian states. The latter typically connotes images of dour old men ruling a sullen population. Fascist states exude youth and vigor, and they always implicate the population in its own repression. Fascist leaders strut. They want to appear youthful, manly and active: they are machos, par excellence. They also appeal to those qualities in the population, usually co-opting the young into their movements or parties. No less important, fascist states are popular: they incorporate the population into the system of rule, promising it a grand and glorious future in exchange for its enthusiasm and support.Not surprisingly, fascist states tend to sound and act aggressively. The soldiers and policemen that run fascist states have a natural proclivity to toughness and weaponry. The ethnocentrism appeals to national and state glory, and cult of vigor sees enemies everywhere. The machismo-based cult-like status of leaders encourages them to pound their chests with abandon. And the population's implication in its own repression leads it to balance its self-humiliation with attempts to humiliate others.Seen in this light, Franco's Spain, Pinochet's Chile and the Greece of the colonels were really just your average authoritarian states. So, too, is today's China. In contrast, Mussolini's Italy was clearly fascist, as was Hitler's Germany and Atatürk's Turkey. What of today's Ukraine?I trust the question answers itself. Ukraine has a tri-partite government structure characterized by an independent presidency and parliament and a semi-independent (though corrupt) judiciary, a vigorous multi-party system, fair and free elections -- most recently, of both president and the parliament -- a free (if sometimes irresponsible) press and protection of human, civil and minority rights. Of special importance is the fact that Ukraine's government is run by civilians only and that its president -- Petro Poroshenko -- has none of the strongman features that a fascist supreme leader promotes via a machismo-based cult of personality. Last but not least, Ukraine has not pursued any of the repressive policies associated with fascism. Oppositions, minorities and marginal groups thrive, civil society is strong, and, if anything, Ukrainians accuse the government of being too weak -- and certainly not too strong. Ukraine is far from a consolidated democracy. Its democratic institutions are young and weak; its commitment to democratic practices has not yet stood the test of time. Police, judges and politicians are often corrupt, and bad policies are frequently adopted. These faults make Ukraine a flawed democracy, possibly a very flawed democracy, but they do not come anywhere near to making it a fascist state.IS UKRAINE RULED BY FASCISTS?Supporters of the Ukraine-is-fascist argument might say that Ukraine is not fascist, but its rulers are fascists who want to establish a fascist system of rule. Alas, this claim is absurd.Poroshenko and his predecessor, Acting President Oleksandr Turchynov, are obviously not fascists. None of the current cabinet members has anything resembling fascist credentials. The government that succeeded the corrupt Yanukovych dictatorship in late February 2014 consisted of 19 individuals: only two (Defense Minister Ihor Tenyukh and Deputy Prime Minister Oleksandr Sych) were members of the right-wing Svoboda party and one, the Secretary of the National and Security Defense Council Andriy Parubiy, had right-wing ties until 2004. In early 2014, Svoboda had 38 seats in Ukraine's parliament -- out of a total of 450. Svoboda's leader, Oleh Tyahnybok, had run for president in the 2010 elections that brought Yanukovych to power and received 1.43 percent of the vote. He ran again, in the presidential ballot of May 25, 2014, and received 1.16 percent. Dmytro Yarosh, head of the right-wing Right Sector, received a mere 0.70 percent in 2014. In the October 26, 2104, parliamentary elections, Svoboda and the Right Sector got, respectively, six seats and one seat.Tyahnybok has made some anti-Semitic and anti-Russian statements in the past but his language and behavior changed significantly during, and as a result of, the Maidan Revolution that ousted Yanukovych. He has since attempted to position himself as a moderate nationalist. Svoboda's approach to ethnic relations has been termed fascist but in point of fact it is strikingly similar to official policy in Estonia, Latvia and Israel. In effect, Svoboda aspires to create a ""lite"" version of what Israeli scholar Oren Yiftachel calls an ""ethnocracy,"" a system of rule within which the titular nation holds a position of dominance over the other nations inhabiting the land, such as Estonians and Latvians vis-à-vis Russians or Jews vis-à-vis Palestinians. As the Baltic and Israeli examples show, ethnocracies can be democratic, but they're obviously not as democratic as liberal democracies and, with their penchant for hierarchy, can easily violate the civil rights of minorities. Although Tyahnybok has gone on record praising Israel for the fact that all its parties are nationalist, Svoboda does not call for disenfranchising minorities in the manner of the Balts and Israelis. Instead, it supports a radical affirmative-action policy that would decisively promote Ukrainians and their language and culture within all spheres of the Ukrainian state and restrict citizenship to ethnic Ukrainians, everyone born in Ukraine and foreigners who speak Ukrainian. It goes without saying that Svoboda is anything but liberal (its representatives often deride Ukrainian liberals as ""liberasts"" -- a combination of liberal and pederasts) and that its ranks also include genuine anti-Semites, xenophobes and racists (the openly neo-Nazi ideologue, Yuri Mykhalchyshyn, comes to mind). But their relative presence in the party is probably no greater than that of Russian supremacists and Ukrainophobes in Yanukovych's Party of Regions and the Communist Party of Ukraine.Svoboda's socio-economic program, which is a mishmash of socially conservative, capitalist and socialist elements and often reads like a Tea Party document, is pretty much irrelevant to its supporters. It is not surprising that the party has done next to nothing in the provincial councils it controls in western Ukraine. Svoboda has neither implemented xenophobic policies nor bothered with economic issues. What they have done is engage in the shrill, anti-establishment, populist rhetoric that got them elected in the first place. Their inactivity is probably due to their ingrained preference for street politics, their absence of economic knowledge and their paucity of intellectual skills. In the first and second respects, the nationalists resemble Ukraine's Communists. In the second and third, they resemble the Party of Regions.The Right Sector, meanwhile, only emerged during the Maidan Revolution. Its members have indeed been among the foremost anti-Russian and anti-Yanukovych militants who then manned the barricades. Since then, they have actively participated in volunteer battalions in the fighting in eastern Ukraine. There are probably no more than a few hundred or a few thousand members, and their support within the population at large is under one percent. Interestingly, Yarosh, their leader, has criticized Svoboda for being anti-Semitic, while one of Right Sector's leading activists is a practicing conservative Jew.In sum, the right-wing presence in Ukraine's post-Yanukovych government has been so slight as to be virtually invisible.WHY PUTIN CALLS UKRAINE FASCISTSo why, then, do Putin and his supporters see fascism ablaze in Kyiv? There are several reasons for this bizarre charge.First, as the above characterization of fascism's key features should have suggested, the country that possesses all of them is not Ukraine -- but Putin's Russia. Its democratic institutions are at best moribund, having been transformed into pliant tools of the Kremlin; civil society and the press have been severely circumscribed; representatives of the military and secret police dominate all ruling elites and suffuse them with their antidemocratic ethos; the Russian nation and state are unabashedly glorified; Putin is the undisputed leader, and his macho image exudes vigor, youth and manliness; a variety of rabidly pro-Putin youth groups act as the vanguard of the state; the population overwhelmingly supports Putin and has done so since he assumed the presidency; ethnocentrism, a mistrust of both internal and external foreigners and a corresponding glorification of Russia's past (including its criminal Stalinist period) and present are the official worldview; Russia has taken to asserting its ""rightful"" place in the sun by engaging in war against Georgia and Ukraine.It makes a great deal of sense for Putin and his propaganda apparatus to accused Ukraine of the very crime that he has committed -- so as to deflect world attention from his own transformation of Russia into a repressive state.Second, the Kremlin needs to insist that Ukraine's democrats are fascists because it insists that Yanukovych was a democratic leader. Yanukovych was corrupt and dictatorial. He was rapidly closing down Ukrainian civil society and transforming the parliament into a rump institution, but he was too incompetent and too comical to be able to project the he-man image that Putin had perfected. Since the Kremlin refuses to acknowledge the right of people to oust tyrants, it has to insist that Ukraine is ruled by a ""junta"" -- which is just shorthand for fascism. According to this logic, Americans had no right to rebel against King George, and the government led by Washington, Jefferson and Hamilton was nothing but a junta!Finally, the Kremlin's insistence that democratic Ukraine is fascist goes back to old Soviet -- as well as tsarist Russian -- stereotypes of Ukrainians who insisted on their democratic and/or national rights as traitors, agents of imperialism, capitalist stooges and, of course, fascists. Ironically, continued use by Putin and his supporters of such terminology demonstrates just how deeply they are still ensnared in Stalinist political culture. The bottom line is this: Putin has transformed Russia into a fascist state. Ukraine ousted Yanukovych in order to avoid becoming fully authoritarian. The war Putin unleashed against Ukraine is his way of telling Ukraine that fascism and democracy are incompatible."
7,GREEN,Obama's Budget Calls For Billions In Climate Funding,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-budget-climate-funding_n_6608046.html,,2015-02-03,"Media surrounds as President Barack Obama's new $4 trillion budget plan is distributed by the Senate Budget Committee as it arrives on Capitol Hill in Washington, Monday, Feb. 2, 2015. The fiscal blueprint for the 2016 budget year that begins Oct. 1, seeks to raise taxes on wealthier Americans and corporations and use the extra income to lift the fortunes of families who have felt squeezed during tough economic times. Republicans, who now hold the power in Congress, are accusing the president of seeking to revert to tax-and-spend policies that will harm the economy while failing to do anything about soaring spending on government benefit programs. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb164423c000018010bce4a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This story was originally published by Mother Jones and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.In yet another sign President Barack Obama is making climate change a big theme of his final two years in office, the White House today released its proposed $3.99 trillion budget, and it contains a slew of programs designed to fight global warming. It's important to note that this budget is the president's proposal—a blueprint—given to Congress to be fought over or blatantly ignored; it's not law. So, this is first-and-foremost a political document used to outline the president's vision and define his terms of engagement with Congress. Most of these measures, to use the language of the moment, will likely be ""dead on arrival,"" given that both the House and Senate are now under Republican control.Having said that, the document is useful in showing which tools Obama wants to use in fighting climate change—a kind of ""would if he could"" laundry list of desires. Here's what you need to know:1. Increased spending on renewable energy research and developmentThe budget proposes $7.4 billion for programs designed to stimulate the development of clean energy technology, mainly through the Departments of Defense, Energy, and Agriculture, and the National Science Foundation. That number is an increase from the $6.5 billion Congress enacted for this year, according to Reuters.The budget outlines some of these activities, including fixing the energy grid to be able to use more renewable energy, reducing the costs of clean energy, finding cheaper solutions for carbon capture and storage from fossil fuels, and doing research to measure methane emissions that leak from natural gas operations.2. Extended tax credits for wind and solarThe budget also calls for the permanent extension of tax incentives used by the solar and wind industries. Supporters of the wind industry say the Production Tax Credit is an important lifeline to help wind compete against heavily-subsidized fossil fuel power sources; when it was in effect, it provided developers a tax break of 2.3 cents per kilowatt hour of energy their turbines produce for the first 10 years of operation. But the credit expired, and the Senate recently voted down a nonbinding measure calling for a five-year extension, continuing a kind of boom-and-bust cycle in the fortunes of the wind industry dictated by whether the tax credit is currently in effect.A separate provision, the Investment Tax Credit, provides an important incentive for solar development. It offers a 30 percent federal tax credit for solar systems on residential and commercial properties. The ITC is set to expire at the end of 2016.3. A new fund to help states cut emissionsThe budget calls for a $4 billion fund designed to encourage states to make faster and deeper cuts to power plant emissions than would be required under the rules proposed by Obama's EPA last year. In other words, the budget would give states a financial incentive to do even more to clean up their energy sectors. States can get these incentives by, among other things, working together in regional partnerships to cut greenhouse gases. There's unlikely to be much love for this measure in Congress: The EPA's proposed regulations have been met by intense opposition in coal-producing states, and Republicans have labeled them a job-killer.4. Being more prepared for natural disastersThe budget contains a range of proposals designed to help vulnerable parts of America prepare for natural disasters, including an increase of $184 million in the National Flood Insurance Program Risk Mapping efforts—historically beleaguered by debt and deficit—to $400 million. There is also additional money to tackle drought, wildfires, and coastal flooding.5. International efforts to fight climate changeThe White House wants to provide $1.29 billion to advance its Global Climate Change Initiative, which includes $500 million for US contributions to the UN's Green Climate Fund—the first installment of the $3 billion pledged by the US last November. ""The United States expects that the GCF will become a preeminent, effective, and efficient channel for climate finance,"" the budget states. But the measure is likely to hit stiff opposition in Congress, where Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), now chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, has vowed to fight it. ""The president's climate change agenda has only siphoned precious taxpayer dollars away from the real problems facing the American people,"" he said in November."
8,POLITICS,GOP Party Chairman Really Doesn't Want To Talk About Abolishing The IRS,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/reince-priebus-republicans-abolish-irs_n_6607656.html,,2015-02-03,"UNITED STATES - FEBRUARY 3: RNC chairman Reince Priebus speaks to reporters as he leaves the Senate Republicans' policy lunch on Tuesday, Feb. 3, 2015. (Photo By Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e70c240000310098faff.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- It's prominently featured on the Republican Party's website, with its own page and even a petition for the cause: ""Stand With The GOP And Fight To Abolish the IRS.""But on Tuesday, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus dodged question after question about whether he thinks the tax agency should be eliminated and if the position laid out on his party's website -- one that's been used to rally the tea party and raise money -- is official GOP policy.""I think clearly people need a simplified tax code, a flatter code,"" Priebus told one reporter, when asked if he supports abolishing the IRS. ""We need to obviously follow [House Budget Committee Chairman] Paul Ryan's lead of balancing the budget and getting control of our debt problems.""When the reporter asked again, the GOP Party chairman didn't even try to answer.""Listen, I'm coming out here to do one quick thing here,"" he said, trailing off. ""I'm already late....""Calls for abolishing the IRS are like catnip to the tea party, and their allies in Congress introduced legislation in the last Congress and again in this Congress to do so. But their 2013 bill never even made it out of committee, and it's unlikely to go anywhere this year, as House and Senate GOP leaders turn their attention to a more positive, unified party message ahead of the 2016 presidential election.Still, the RNC appears ready to keep the issue front and center on its website -- and has a ""contribute"" link conveniently next to its petition. Just last week, Priebus tweeted out a link to the petition on the party's website and urged supporters to weigh in on the ""unchecked power"" of the IRS.Priebus was on Capitol Hill Tuesday meeting with Senate Republicans during their weekly luncheon. He was mobbed by reporters on his way out, and dodged at least six questions about abolishing the agency.""I don't think the tax code is doing anybody any favors, so I think it's pretty clear that something big needs to be done,"" he told another reporter. ""But personally I'm going to follow my good buddy Paul Ryan's lead and support the things that he's doing.""When one reporter said he was asking about the GOP's official position on the tax agency because he's been curious about it for a while, Priebus said only, ""Oh good.""The RNC chairman was ultimately saved by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who was standing nearby and watching reporters pepper him with questions.""Answer the question!"" Graham shouted, as the two laughed together and walked off."
