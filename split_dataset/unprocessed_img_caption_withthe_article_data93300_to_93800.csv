1,COLLEGE,Duke Investigates Reports Of Student Taunted With Racist SAE Chant,Katie Sola,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/duke-sae-racist-chant-investigation_n_6956952.html,,2015-03-27,"East Campus Auditorium, Duke University. Durham, North Carolina",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae570f2400005100966360.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Duke University said it's investigating reports that a black female freshman was harassed by a group of white men who allegedly shouted the same racist chant that got a fraternity expelled from the University of Oklahoma. The Chronicle, Duke's student newspaper, said reports indicated the student was harassed by a group of white male students last weekend. One student may have used the words members of OU's Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter were caught singing on a bus. The lyrics go: ""There will never be a n***** in SAE. There will never be a n***** in SAE. You can hang him from a tree, but he can never sign with me There will never be a n***** in SAE.""University spokesman Michael Schoenfeld told the Washington Post that Duke is investigating the incident. A junior at the North Carolina school who asked to remain anonymous, citing concern for privacy, said she was with a friend on March 22 who received a phone call from a younger student who had just been taunted with the racist chant. ""She was a freshman, she was by herself, she feared for her safety, and she really needed someone to talk to,"" the junior told The Huffington Post. The junior says she's affiliated with a ""group of concerned students"" that is working to raise awareness of what they call a hostile campus. She would not provide the name of the group, but said its members are in touch with the freshman who was taunted.Students are talking. On Wednesday, an anonymous group called the Duke POC Caucus posted a statement to a newly formed Tumblr account, alleging the incident was part of a bigger problem at the school. ""The racist terror to which the young black woman was subjected is symptomatic of systematized racism,"" the statement reads. The group also mentions a Duke fraternity's controversial Asia Prime party.On Thursday, Duke's Black Student Alliance (BSA) launched a Twitter campaign called #WhatWeNeedFromDuke, asking students to tell the administration what they need. Other students used more traditional means and stuck notes to the BSA's walls. Imari Smith, a junior at Duke, has compiled what she says are screenshots of some of the messages posted on Yik Yak, an anonymous, local messaging app, in the wake of the alleged incident. Calls to Duke's Office of News and Information, the Office of Public Affairs, the Vice President for Student Affairs and the Duke University Police Department were not returned. "
2,LATINO VOICES,Latinos Can Honor the 43 Missing Mexican Students by Calling for 'No More Drug War',"Jeronimo Saldaña, ContributorMovement Building Team, Drug Policy Alliance",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/latinos-can-honor-the-43-missing-mexican-students_b_6956792.html,"Latinos have been paying dearly, sometimes with their own lives, for American prohibition without having a seat at the policy making table.",2015-03-27,"Relatives of 43 missing students hold portraits during a protest demanding justice and clarification of the disappearance of their loved ones from Ayotzinapa, on December 6, 2014 in Mexico City. Forensic experts have identified one of 43 missing Mexican students among charred remains found in a landfill, an official said Saturday, partly solving a case that has roiled the government for weeks. Federal authorities sent badly burned remains to an Austrian medical university last month after finding them in a garbage dump and river in the southern state of Guerrero.

For some reason, I thought of my Pop's hands.He has these rough, calloused hands with scars near the tips of his fingers from the years he spent as a farm worker. As a kid growing up in the suburbs of L.A., far removed from the back breaking labor of the fields of central California, I would stare at them and naively ask when I would get hands like his.As I approached the Consulate, I shook hands with Felipe de la Cruz Sandoval, a professor at the Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers College in Guerrero, Mexico from which the 43 students were forcibly disappeared last September, and was instantly reminded of my own father.As dozens of others joined Felipe to demand justice for the missing students, for their families, and for his son who miraculously survived the attack, I better understood how ending the war on drugs is a Latino issue and needs to be a top priority for national Latino advocacy organizations.From passage of marijuana prohibition in El Paso a century ago to the failed drug policies of the Reagan administration and President Obama's extension of the Merida Initiative, a plan under which the U.S. gives hundreds of millions of dollars to Mexico each year -- the vast majority of which is funneled into the disastrous and failed war on drugs -- Latinos have been paying dearly, sometimes with their own lives, for American prohibition without having a seat at the policy making table.That's why Professor De la Cruz' journey to NYC was so momentous -- he was there to announce a national tour (La Caravan 43) of some of the victims' parents and fellow students set to take place across the United States to share their tragic story and demand an end to the failed policies that are killing our children.With more than 70,000 people having been killed in Mexico alone as the result of drug war related violence since 2006 -- not to mention the countless disappeared and the 50,000 unaccompanied minors who arrived at the U.S. border in search of refuge from drug war related violence last year -- Latinos need to come out in support of La Caravana, Professor Felipe De La Cruz Sandoval and the families of the 43 students to demand an immediate end to the failed war on drugs.If you'd like to get involved or want more information, you can contact me here.Jerónimo Saldaña is the legislative and organizing coordinator for the Drug Policy Alliance.This piece first appeared on the Drug Policy Alliance Blog:http://www.drugpolicy.org/blog/latinos-can-honor-43-missing-mexican-students-calling-no-more-drug-war"

Aaron Schock’s (R-Ill.) rapid fall from darling of the Republican Party to tainted politician, the House has decided to clamp down on its members’ expenses.Schock found himself embroiled in a mounting scandal over the past two months after The Washington Post alleged he abused taxpayer dollars to pay for a lavish “Downton-Abbey”-inspired decoration of his Capitol Hill office. He has since reimbursed the government $40,000.To prevent similar offenses, the House Administration Committee is launching a review of standards for spending and accounting for official expenses.“This is an immense and sacred responsibility,” Rep. Candice Miller (R-Mich.), chair of the committee, said Friday. “The biggest room in the world is the room for improvement –- and our group of members is committed to finding solutions.”Reps. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.) and Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) will lead the review, which will examine rules pertaining to official expenses for each congressional member and ways to improve education for each office. “Every effort should be made to ensure that the rules and regulations governing member spending of taxpayer dollars are clear, straightforward and instill the elements of integrity and transparency,” said Rep. Bob Brady (D-Pa.), the ranking committee member. “The importance of ensuring accountability within this great institution crosses all partisan boundaries.”House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) showed little interest earlier this month in establishing more ethics requirements, according to National Journal.""Understand something: If somebody's going to violate the rules, they're gonna violate the rules,"" Boehner said. ""In almost every case, sooner or later, it catches up to you.""Schock, also under federal investigation for abusing taxpayer dollars for private flights and inflated car mileage, said he'll retire at the end of this month. In his farewell speech this week, Schock made no mention of the ethics scandal, but said he would work to make it up to those he disappointed. “I leave here with sadness and humility. For those I have let down, I will work tirelessly to make it up to you,” Schock said."

He also sent a letter to the leaders of all six powers, including U.S. President Barack Obama, though officials said the letter did not suggest Tehran was ready to compromise.""The difficulty is that the Iranians are not moving enough. They like to negotiate right up to the precipice and they're very good at that,"" a Western diplomat said.British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, on a visit to Canada on Friday, voiced optimism.""We will not do a bad deal but we are increasingly hopeful we may be able to do the right deal, which will ensure that Iran's access to nuclear technology is channeled entirely for peaceful purposes and that the world can be assured that Iran will not proceed towards developing a nuclear weapon,"" he said.Under a final accord, Tehran would halt sensitive nuclear work for at least a decade and in exchange, international financial and oil and some U.N. sanctions on Iran would be lifted. A deal aims to end Iran's 12-year nuclear standoff with the West and reduce the risk of war in the Middle East.Initial easing of U.N. Security Council sanctions could include such gestures as removal of individuals and entities from a travel-ban and asset-freeze blacklist and little more, said a Western diplomat, adding Tehran needed to bend further to allow a deal to be made in the coming days.He said the U.N. arms embargo on Iran would not be lifted in the initial phase after any Iran deal, adding that such a move would be unwise given the volatile situation in the region.While all sides agree they are inching toward a deal, there are major disagreements.Tehran insists on the freedom to continue research on advanced centrifuges, machines that purify uranium for use in nuclear power plants or, if very highly enriched, in weapons, at the underground Fordow site, and immediate lifting of all U.N. sanctions and the most severe U.S. and European Union sanctions.""There has been massive progress on all the issues,"" a senior Iranian official told Reuters. ""There are still disputes over two issues - R&D (research and development) and U.N. sanctions.""A Western official close to the talks confirmed that centrifuge research and enrichment in general remained the most difficult unresolved issue.France is demanding the most stringent limits on future Iranian nuclear activity for it to support a deal, negotiators say, and its foreign minister played down the importance of the deadline.""The important thing is the content not the deadline,"" Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told reporters at the United Nations in New York. ""There has been some progress, but there are things which are not yet solved.""Fabius is due to arrive in Lausanne on Saturday. His British and Russian counterparts will join the talks over the weekend. The Republican-led U.S. Congress has threatened to impose new U.S. sanctions on Iran if there is no March deal, although Obama has threatened to veto any such moves. 'NOT VERY PRECISE'The United States and European partners are reluctant to allow Iran to operate centrifuges at the Fordow site and the issue is unresolved, Western officials said.An Iranian government website said in November that Washington could let Iran keep some 6,000 early-generation centrifuges, down from nearly 10,000 now in operation.After meeting U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Friday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told reporters that it was unclear if there would be a deal in the coming days.""We think an agreement is still possible but when is another story,"" Zarif said.If there is a political framework agreement in the coming days, the U.S. and European delegations want it to be as specific as possible, including figures for permissible numbers of centrifuges Tehran could operate, uranium stockpiles and other sensitive technical issues.Further technical details would be included in annexes to be agreed before July 1.The six powers want limits on the most sensitive aspects of Iran's nuclear program to be in place for at least a decade followed by years of intrusive U.N. inspections. They also want to be certain Tehran would need at least one year to produce enough high enriched uranium for a weapon should the Iranians decide to produce one.Iran denies having any nuclear weapons ambitions.

I mean, you're bigger and smarter than your toddler, right? Well, definitely bigger. Yet, when you try to potty train, somehow, you end up using all your brain cells (that weren't killed by pregnancy) and still not ending up with a toddler who's dry through the night. I've therefore concluded that potty training is harder than getting an advanced degree, for many reasons, none of which have to do with getting paid more money down the line.1. Both of them involve comparing yourself to others.Grading on a curve means that you're in direct competition with everyone else in your class. Potty training your baby means that you're in direct competition with your sister-in-law, your neighbor and moms on sitcoms. And your mother, 30 years ago. (Spoiler alert: You lose.)2. Both of them require all of your intelligence.Whether you're pushing yourself to understand statistics or reading every book known to man on potty reward charts, both of these endeavors require you to be super smart. And wily. See my next point.3. Both require outside-the-box thinking.You can't write a thesis without original and creative thinking. And you can't figure out that your toddler will poop for graham crackers, but not for M&M's without some creativity either. Or that the sticker chart only works if it's supplemented by jelly beans, rendering it not a sticker chart. Moving on.4. Both require perseverance.Years of training in your chosen field require diligence and stick-to-it-iveness. As does trying to potty train at two years, 26 months, 28 months, 31 months and 37 months (if you don't say ""three years,"" it sounds better).5. Both require social support.In grad school, you went out drinking with friends to blow off steam. Now you go on Facebook and message your best friend with pictures of your urine-soaked carpet. Half a dozen of one, etc.6. Both involve diapers.Some of those exams are timed, and you don't want to take a bathroom break. Just kidding... Or am I? 7. Both make you extremely proud of yourself.

One major area that the RNC examined was the length of the 2012 primary season itself, which to their mind had become a debate-happy horrorshow that ended up playing a role in imperiling their chances. As The Washington Post's Aaron Blake noted in the wake of the RNC voting to ""significantly compress its presidential nominating calendar,"" the big takeaway from the 2012 contest was that it had become ""a long, sometimes nasty primary process that Republicans think hurt their chances of winning the presidency.""So, how are things looking, now that they've made major reforms to the primary calendar and limited the number of debates? Take it away, Patrick O'Connor of The Wall Street Journal!The race for the Republican presidential nomination is shaping up to be one of the most drawn-out in a generation.The most eye-catching thing about this? That whole part about ""the rise of super PACs,"" which threaten to artificially keep primary bids aloft long past their sell-by date. Republican pollster Bill McInturff shows up in O'Connor's report, emphasizing this:This cycle, because of all these structural rules changes and the advent of super PACs, people are not going to drop out,” predicted Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster who advised Arizona Sen.

The Cowboys have released Michael Sam from the practice squad, Tuesday, Oct. 21, 2014, another setback as the NFLâs first openly gay player tries to make an active roster during the regular season for the first time. (AP Photo/Brandon Wade, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb77a883c000032000d8fb0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Michael Sam has previously disclosed that a small number of gay athletes reached out to express their gratitude following his coming out as gay before the 2014 NFL draft. Now he says that some of them are quite well known as well. “I will never say anything about who [the gay players] are, what teams they are [on],” Sam said Thursday in Dallas, according to the Star-Telegram. “I’m just saying there’s some famous people, and I’m not the only one.”“There [are] a lot of us,” Sam said. “I respect the players that did reach out to me and had the courage to tell me that they were also gay, but they do not have the same courage as I do to come out before I even played a down in the NFL.”“I am not the only gay person in the NFL,” he said. Sam made the comments during an appearance at the 2015 Dallas Holocaust Museum Upstander Speaker series. Sam, 25, has struggled to earn a spot on an NFL roster since getting drafted in the seventh round of the 2014 draft. He has already been dropped by the team that drafted him, the St. Louis Rams, and the Dallas Cowboys.Sam’s hope for making a team took a hit recently when he registered a slower 40-yard dash at the veterans combine than he had prior to the 2014 draft. Nevertheless, questions remain about whether discrimination has played a role in the former SEC co-defensive player of the year’s inability to land a secure job on a team. On Thursday, Sam, a current contestant on ""Dancing with the Stars,"" said he was surprised that his decision to come out provoked so much national attention, saying “maybe I was naive.” But he says he believes, or at least hopes, that he’s not being discriminated against because of his sexual orientation. “Hopefully I’m not being discriminated [against] because I’m gay,” Sam said. “I don’t believe that I’m being discriminated [against] because I’m gay. I just want to know if I’m truly not in the NFL, it’s because of talent.""Sam is a recipient of the Arthur Ashe Courage Award, handed out annually to those “possessing strength in the face of adversity, courage in the face of peril and the willingness to stand up for their beliefs no matter what the cost.” At least 5 percent of men in the U.S. are primarily attracted to other men, according to a recent analysis.

At a growing number of airports, special agents will meet these celebrities, high-powered executives and wealthy vacationers at the curb and will privately escort them from check-in to security to boarding.

Travelers have oohed and ahhed over the in-flight amenities and luxurious enclosed seat ever since, and lamented about how out of reach the experience is thanks to the high price tag (roughly $20,000 round-trip). But despite what most consumers think, a seat in the airline's first-class suites is attainable for the average traveler. Factoring in the 15 percent point discount the airline's KrisFlyer program applies to online award bookings, all it takes is 31,875 to 91,385 frequent flier miles and $50 to $250 in taxes per one-way flight, depending on the route you're flying.So how do you accrue enough miles to fly one of these routes? It's actually pretty easy. The airline's frequent flier program offers four different reward program partners you can earn and transfer miles with at a 1-to-1 ratio, including American Express Membership Rewards, Chase Ultimate Rewards, Citi ThankYou Rewards and the Starwood Preferred Guest program.See: Navigating the Landscape of Airline Loyalty Programs in 2015Earning the miles With four different transfer partners, earning enough miles for a seat in Singapore's Suites Class is just one or two credit card applications away. Below is a list of every credit card offering a sign-up bonus to cover at least a one-way award in Singapore Airlines' Suite Class.American ExpressAmerican Express offers a variety of card options, though some of them have high spending requirements as well as annual fees that may not be waived the first year. In the past, both the American Express Premier Gold and Platinum cards have offered promotional sign-up bonuses as high as 75,000 to 100,000 points. With American Express restricting sign-up bonuses to one per card, it's preferable to get the highest bonus possible. For the latest news on the highest credit card sign-up bonuses, check the FlyerTalk forums or follow your favorite travel hacking blogs.ChaseSince eliminating the Ink Bold business card, Chase offers just two options for acquiring Ultimate Rewards points, which can be transferred to Singapore's KrisFlyer program at a 1-to-1 ratio. Both the Sapphire Preferred and Ink Plus cards have been popular for years thanks to generous sign-up offers and bonus points earned through popular merchants, making mileage accrual even easier. Chase Sapphire Preferred offers 40,000 bonus points after $3,000 is spent in the first three months of opening an account, while the Chase Ink Business card offers 50,000 bonus points after $5,000 is spent in the first three months.CitiBoth the Citi ThankYou Premier and Citi ThankYou Preferred cards offer bonus points for purchases made in common merchant categories like dining, entertainment and travel. So when you finally take that flight aboard Singapore's A380, you can splurge at your destination and earn bonus points. With Citi ThankYou Premier, you can earn up to 50,000 points just by spending with the card within the first three months of opening your account. And with Citi ThankYou Preferred, you'll rack up 20,000 bonus points after spending $1,500 in the first three months of opening the account, plus an additional 10,000 points after spending $1,500 in the next three months.Starwood Preferred GuestStarwood Preferred Guest is an anomaly among hotel rewards programs in that it offers a 1-to-1 ratio for transfers to airline rewards programs. Plus, when you transfer at least 20,000 points from your Starwood Preferred Guest account to any of the program's more than 30 airline partners, you'll receive a 5,000 mile bonus. This is why, odd as it may sound, the Starwood Preferred Guest Credit Card from American Express is a popular way for travel hackers to earn frequent flier miles.See: 2014-15 Best Travel Rewards ProgramsRedeeming your miles Once you have enough miles saved up for your first-class trip, it's time to search for award space. Point transfers are irreversible, so it's important that you wait to transfer your points to Singapore's KrisFlyer program until you find a seat on your desired flight. To search for award space, simply go to the Singapore Airlines website and check ""redeem award flights"" in the flight search box and select ""First/Suites"" in the cabin class dropdown menu. You'll be prompted to enter your KrisFlyer login information before the search results appear.Once the results are shown, look for availability on the Airbus A380, which is the only aircraft that currently offers Suites Class. You'll also want to select a Saver level award, which requires the least amount of miles. Keep in mind that the Saver mileage requirements initially displayed do not include the 15 percent online booking discount. But once you select your flight and proceed to the booking page, you'll see the discounted mileage requirement along with the taxes and fees.Unfortunately, Singapore Airlines doesn't allow holds on award tickets, so there is always the chance that your flight of choice won't be there once the miles appear in your account. Thus, it's important to be flexible when booking an award flight. Have a back-up plan and don't make any nonrefundable hotel reservations until your flight has been booked and confirmed.There you have it. You don't to spend $20,000 to fly one of the world's most coveted first-class experiences. All it takes is a few credit card sign-up bonuses and a bit of flexibility.See: 5 Ways to Make Reward Travel Cheaper for Families  About the author: Ariana Arghandewal is a travel writer who enjoys helping others navigate the world of travel hacking though her blog, Pointchaser.

By the way he said it, Claire sensed she had measured up. I wrote these words in my 2012 novel, Island Apart. While that book is a love story, not a cookbook, it does suggest the primal importance of a well-roasted chicken in human gustatory happiness. It also reveals a myth perpetuated by the French chefs I trained with in Paris--that a great roast chicken is a difficult dish to make. That myth has something to do with the contradictory attributes of a perfect roast chicken: skin so crisp it crackles when you bite it, yet meat so moist it squirts when you cut into it. Then, there's the confounding nature of a chicken's anatomy--white breast meat that's perfect at 165 degrees F and dark leg meat that tastes best when cooked to 175 degrees. In other words: how do you cook the latter without drying out the former? Well, call me a myth buster: the truth is it's easy to roast a chicken--especially if you do it on the grill. How easy? Put it this way: smoke-roasted chicken is a dish my wife and I make once a week on average--when we're short on imagination and can't think of anything else. It starts with the chicken--a local farm-raised bird when we can get it. (Easy in Martha's Vineyard; more challenging in Miami.) The best widely available supermarket bird we've found is Bell & Evans brand organic chicken. The next step is to season the bird inside and out with salt and pepper or a simple herb rub like my Best of Barbecue Mediterranean Rub. Sometimes we'll stuff fresh sage, basil, tarragon, or other fresh herbs under the skin.When I make the chicken, I truss the bird, that is, tie it or skewer it into a compact cylinder. I do this for aesthetics--a trussed bird looks smart and professional. My wife doesn't bother with trussing, and once again she has a point. When you roast the chicken untrussed, the heat penetrates the cavity and browns the inside of the legs more evenly. If you want to truss your bird, you'll find a cool bamboo skewer trussing technique in Planet Barbecue! on page 355, and step-by-step photos of traditional butcher string trussing in How to Grill on page 204. Because we're talking about a simple weeknight dinner here, we usually cook the vegetables right with the chicken (or in this case, under it). These usually include a sweet potato or a couple of Yukon Golds, some organic carrots or beets, a shallot or two--any root vegetable loaded with flavor. I cut the veggies into finger-size pieces, so they'll roast quickly and evenly. I arrange them in a single layer in the foil drip pan I place under the chicken. (It's important not to overcrowd the pan, otherwise the vegetables will stew, not roast.) The tubers sizzle in the melting chicken fat and juices (stir them once or twice), which makes these veggies you'll definitely want to eat. Now, here comes the secret my French chef mentors would never have dreamt of. You don't cook the bird in the oven; you smoke-roast it on the grill.

18,HEALTHY LIVING,5 Important Mental Health Reminders As We Talk About The Germanwings Tragedy,Meredith Melnick,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/andreas-lubitz-mental-health-germanwings_n_6956578.html,,2015-03-27,"Journalists gather around a stele, carved in French, German, Spanish and English, in memory of the victims of the Germanwings Airbus A320 crash, in the small village of Le Vernet, French Alps, on March 27, 2015, near the site where an Airbus A320 crashed on March 24. The Germanwings co-pilot who flew his Airbus into the French Alps, killing all 150 aboard, hid a serious illness from the airline, prosecutors said on March 27 amid reports he was severely depressed. AFP PHOTO / JEFF PACHOUD (Photo credit should read JEFF PACHOUD/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c9a905f2a00001a034f7571.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Media reports erupted today with news that Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz may have been suffering from depression or another mental illness when he crashed the aircraft in the French Alps, most likely killing 150 people, including himself.While headlines like U.K. tabloid The Sun's ""Madman In Cockpit"" are hardly surprising, such sensational links between mental illness and horrific tragedies can have an undesired outcome when it comes to stigma. Here are five ways to have a more productive conversation about the complex interplay between mental health, violence and tragedies such as this one. 1. Depression doesn't cause violence.The public's perception of mental illness -- which is largely fueled by movies featuring mentally-ill individuals turned violent and news headlines that thread mental illness into every story about mass killings -- needs a readjustment. People who are depressed are not likely to be violent. If they were, we'd all be in trouble: One in five of us will experience a serious mental health issue at some point in our lives, but only 3-5 percent of violent acts in the United States are committed by an individual with serious mental illness -- a tiny fraction of the country's violent crimes. ""If we were able to magically cure schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression, that would be wonderful, but overall violence would go down by only about 4 percent,"" said Dr. Jeffrey Swanson, an expert on mental health and violence and a professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Duke University School of Medicine, in a recent interview with Pacific Standard. What makes this misrepresentation even worse is that individuals who suffer from mental illness are 10 times more likely than the general population to be the victim of violent crime, an under-reported issue that is overlooked in favor of misleading depictions of depression as a violent condition. 2. Suggesting mental illness as the root cause of violence stigmatizes those who live healthy, full lives with conditions like depression.Approximately one in four U.S. adults in a given year suffer from a diagnosable mental illness, making it highly likely that you know someone who has been affected. However, only 25 percent of people who have mental health symptoms feel that others are understanding toward people with mental illness, according to the CDC. And it's no secret why.Public diagnoses, such as the discussion surrounding the Germanwings tragedy, plague every single mental illness sufferer. The truth is, the majority of those who have a mental health problem live healthy and complete lives. They are reliable at work and beloved by their families. Yet many people categorize them as ""abnormal"" because of unsubstantiated scapegoating during these types of tragedies, which can have a real impact: Studies have shown that knowledge, culture and social networks can influence the relationship between stigma and access to care. When people feel stigma, they are less likely to seek the help they need.The vast majority of people with mental illnesses are law-abiding, responsible and productive citizens. 3. Mental illness disclosure policies can push people further into the closet.Lubitz was seeking treatment for an undisclosed medical condition that he kept from his employers, alleged the public prosecutor’s office in Dusseldorf, Germany. They didn’t say whether it was a mental or physical condition, but investigators did note that they found a torn-up doctor’s note declaring him unfit for work, reported CNN. Employees in Germany are expected to tell their employers immediately if they can’t work due to an illness, according to Reuters, and that doctor's note would have kept Lubitz grounded and out of the cockpit.Lubitz had passed special health screenings, including psychological ones, before he was hired on as a co-pilot in 2013, reported ABC News, but unlike in the U.S. airline industry, annual mental health screenings for pilots aren’t a requirement in Germany. Additionally, per Federal Aviation Administration rules, U.S. pilots must disclose all “existing physical and psychological conditions and medications” or face fines of up to $250,000 if they’re found to have delivered false information. That means if he were an American pilot, Lubitz would have been obligated to disclose any and all conditions, as well as the medicines he was taking, in order to remain in good standing at his job. Because of these and other policies, U.S. airline standards are regarded as the strictest and safest around the world (though not without their flaws). But just because the FAA requires full health disclosure to an FAA-designated Aviation Medical Examiner doesn’t mean that pilots may feel completely safe disclosing their conditions, according to Ron Honberg, director of policy and legal affairs at National Alliance On Mental Illness. “If a person feels that it’s safe to disclose, and that they’ll have an opportunity to get help -- that there won’t automatically be adverse consequences like being prohibited from ever flying again -- then they’re going to be more likely to disclose [a mental illness],” said Honberg. “But I think historically pilots have known that if they admitted it, they’d never be able to fly again.” Generally speaking, barring industries where a person may be responsible for public safety (like a pilot or a police officer), one is not obligated to disclose any of this information to his or her employers in the U.S. Just as people don’t have to tell their bosses about diabetes, cardiac disease or HIV diagnoses, employees can’t be forced to discuss their mental health history beyond anything that may interfere with a person’s function at the job, explained Honberg. And employers can’t ask job candidates about their medical records or medical history except to ask about whether something might impact a person’s functional limitation in a job. “It has to be focused on if they’re capable of doing the job,” said Honberg. “Are there physical or mental health factors that may preclude them from being able to do that?” The FAA does not track rates of dismissal for pilots who disclose mental illnesses versus other conditions, or the number of pilots who continue to fly after disclosing a mental illness. But until we have all the facts about Lubitz’s situation, it’s important to hold off on any policy changes that might attempt to close up perceived loopholes, he said.“It’s really important to have all the facts, particularly before we decide on any policies to prevent anything like this from happening again,” said Honberg. “We want to somehow create a proper balance that on the one hand protects public safety and on the other hand encourages people to seek help if needed.""4. The conversation surrounding mental illness and mass violence reveals our ingrained ethnic and racial biases. Lubitz allegedly committed mass murder and, as many people have pointed out, it is troubling that his acts are ascribed to mental illness when, if he were Muslim or a racial minority, he would likely be assigned a two-dimensional ideological motivation.Yes, this is a disturbing expression of the dominant culture's racial pathologies, but rather than trying to correct the balance by referring to white mass murderers in an un-nuanced fashion, as some have suggested, perhaps the more productive action would be to view the underlying mental health problems among everyone who carries out mass violence -- regardless of race, religion or country of origin.Again, most people with mental illness will never be violent, but those who are violent often do have an underlying trauma or condition. ""More and more evidence from around the world is suggesting that many of the terrorists wreaking havoc both in America and abroad are racked with emotional and mental trauma themselves,"" wrote Cord Jefferson in The Nation in 2012:To be clear, nobody’s saying that all -- or even most -- terrorists aren’t cold, bloodthirsty killers who know exactly what they’re doing every time they commit another heinous act. But there is reason to believe that a significant number of foreign and domestic terrorists are suffering from the exact same mental distresses by which we quickly assume men like James Holmes and boys like Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the Columbine killers, to be afflicted.Indeed, Jefferson went on to note a study of Palestinian men who had signed up to be suicide bombers that found 40 percent showed suicidal tendencies by traditional mental health measures, and recruiters admitted looking for ""sad guys"" to carry out mass violence. More generally, the way we view mental health and race has a lasting public health impact: Minority and immigrant communities in the U.S. are dramatically underserved, according to a government report (and corroborated by the American Psychological Association). One major problem, according to the Surgeon General's report, is misdiagnosis or lack of diagnosis due to cultural biases on the part of mental health practitioners. 5. We may never have a diagnosis, and we have to be okay with that.When tragedy strikes, it's a natural human inclination to want an explanation to help get closure for our feelings of anger and loss. When such information is unavailable to us, our grief remains in this limbo of sorts -- or worse, we search for our own answer to help us move forward.In a recent article for The New Yorker, Philip Gourevitch aptly explained this phenomenon: To be told that a scene of mass death is the result of an accident of terrorism is to be given not only an explanation of the cause but also an idea of how to reckon with the consequence -- through justice, or revenge, or measures meant to prevent a recurrence.According to CNN, a physician did declare Lubitz unfit to work the day of the flight, and instead of sharing that information with Germanwings, Lubitz disposed of the note and boarded the plane. But even in light of such information, it's highly unlikely that we will ever know exactly what was going on in the mind of this pilot, and it is far from our place to speak as though we have a definitive answer. In the words of Gourevitch, we are left with a sense of ""cosmic meaninglessness and bewilderment"" when horrific events such as this one occur, and while that is one of the toughest collections of emotions to grapple with, there is no credible alternative in cases like this.___________________ If you -- or someone you know -- need help, please call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

Written by Lori McKenna, Hillary Lindsey and Liz Rose, ""Girl Crush"" actually tells the story of a woman who is jealous of her ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend.""I will speak out against my own industry right now and say this is a bunch of crap,"" country radio host Bobby Bones said about the controversy during a recent interview with Little Big Town's Karen Fairchild and Kimberly Schlapman. ""It shouldn't even matter if it's a lesbian song!""""There's so many problems with that whole issue,"" Fairchild added. ""The fact that country music is built on heartache songs and jealousy songs, this is like a modern day version of 'Jolene,' and people just need to listen to it."" But Fairchild and Bones aren't the only prominent members of the country music community to take issue with the apparent boycott. Speaking to The Huffington Post in an interview on Friday, singer Dierks Bentley echoed their sentiments.""When I heard that song, I never even thought about it being about a girl crush or a lesbian [romance]. And when I thought about it that way, I liked it even more,"" Bentley said. ""It’s just so silly, but, it’s always been that way. Look at Miranda Lambert’s career: She’s always cutting songs that are a little edgier, like 'Gunpowder & Lead,' about shooting down this guy who’s getting out of jail for beating you up, you know? You keep pushing down that wall and eventually the fans will demand it and push for those changes."" ""I have so much respect for Little Big Town and [producer] Jay Joyce ... to take chances like that and keep the genre going and moving, it requires bold artists. The song being pulled is probably one of the best things that could happen to them,"" he added. ""Like when Garth Brooks' ""The Thunder Rolls"" got banned from CMT for being too edgy. It just makes fans want to hear it more and go out there and find it."" To that end, Bentley cited Chase Rice's ""Ride"" as a perfect example of the power of pushing the envelope. ""I don’t know if that can get played on country radio, it’s over the top as far as the sex factor, but it’s selling 20,000 singles a week on iTunes,"" Bentley said. ""A little controversy is always good for music, so I think it worked out for the best. There’s always going to be great country artists and great country songs and I think “Girl Crush” is a really well-written, great idea for a song."" ""Girl Crush"" is currently No. 17 on the Billboard country music chart and is the No. 1 downloaded country song on iTunes. "
20,POLITICS,Ted Cruz's First Campaign Stop Hosted By Conspiracy Buff Who Wants Obama Arrested,Scott Conroy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ted-cruz-jack-kimball-new-hampshire_n_6956554.html,,2015-03-27,"New Hampshire GOP Chairman Jack Kimball announces Thursday, Aug. 25, 2011 in Concord, N.H. he has no plans of stepping down from his job. Some members of the party are questioning his leadership and whether he should step down. (AP Photo/Jim Cole)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ef9d2400005100577a1a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"MERRIMACK, N.H. -- There is no more provocative figure within New Hampshire Republican politics than Jack Kimball, so it is perhaps fitting that Kimball’s new conservative interest group played host to Sen. Ted Cruz’s first official event as a presidential candidate. On Friday afternoon, the Texas senator made his initial post-announcement stop in this southern New Hampshire town at an event held by the Conservative Business League of New Hampshire, a new organization that launched last week. Kimball, the most prominent of the five individuals on CBL’s steering committee, introduced Cruz at the event and stood behind him as the candidate answered questions from the audience.Though Cruz has never shied from controversy, his association with Kimball may prove particularly unhelpful as he tries to woo a broad spectrum of Republicans in the first-in-the-nation primary state. Kimball is a former chairman of the New Hampshire GOP, but he resigned in 2011 just as the party’s executive committee was poised to remove him some six months into his term. He is an avid social media user whose publicly accessible Facebook page serves as a repository for warnings about government takeovers, imminent wars with foreign nations and UFO sightings. Take three of his posts from this month alone.On Thursday, Kimball wrote, “Wake up America! Operation Jade Helm 15 (look it up) has now expanded to 10 states. It starts July 15 and ends in Mid September.” His post linked to a YouTube video titled “Military Takeover Plan Revealed: Is Your State Next.”On March 17, Kimball posted, “Urgent Urgent Urgent The US has gone to defcon 3 (yellow) and there has apparently been some air battles between our Air Force and Russia off the coast of Alaska. Just happened a short time ago. Check out this video then go to the defcon message board for further information (google it). Spread the word.”And on March 11, he linked to a video purportedly showing an “armada of UFOs” over California. This past Monday, Kimball posted on his Facebook page to promote Friday’s event with Cruz. “As you are aware, Senator Ted Cruz has officially announced his candidacy for President of the United States and our newly formed group, Conservative Businessmen's League of NH, LLC is hosting this event on behalf of the Senator,” Kimball wrote. “It will be his first official event since his announcement and our organization's first event on behalf of a Constitutional Conservative Presidential Candidate.""Kimball had won the chairmanship of the New Hampshire GOP in an upset victory at the height of the tea party wave. Since his resignation, he has become increasingly alienated from powerbrokers in the state party. One major reason for the falling out, according to several New Hampshire Republicans, has been the inflammatory rhetoric that is his calling card. At a gun rights rally in Connecticut last year, Kimball used some particularly colorful language in urging the arrest of President Barack Obama.“I am, by the way, an advocate of having one of my favorite sheriffs in the United States of America, Sheriff Joe Arpaio, to take some posses and go down to Washington, D.C., and put this man in an orange suit,” Kimball said. “In fact, pink is his suit, pink would look better, sorry, and drag his butt out of that White House.”In promoting an event that aimed to pressure the entire congressional leadership into resigning last spring, Kimball cited recent violent uprisings abroad as inspiration for what like-minded Americans could do to “take back this government and this country.”“And by the way, you saw what happened in the Ukraine,” Kimball said in February 2014. “You saw what happened in Egypt. You’re seeing what’s happening in Venezuela. And they don’t have what we have. We have the Second Amendment. They do not.”In 2013, NHJournal.com posted a story about an email that Kimball had sent to friends and family, in which he reported that his daughter and son-in-law had seen dozens of white military vehicles in Maine that were heading toward New Hampshire.""Don’t know what they were doing or where they were going but the white vehicles sound more like UN trucks,"" Kimball wrote in the email. ""Be alert.""Though he later disputed NHJournal.com’s suggestion that he implied the U.N. might be “invading” New Hampshire, Kimball nonetheless stood by the reasoning behind his alarm. ""We're on a watch for stuff like this,"" he told Portsmouth Patch. ""I sent it to 50 to 60 people to let them know it was seen. The only thing I said was it was white, so it could be U.N. because that's their color. We didn't really know.""Kimball also told Patch that soon after he sent the email, someone notified him that the trucks belonged to a convoy of National Guard medical units that were returning from a training exercise. ""We're all concerned about what's going on with Obama,"" he added. ""We've all been talking about what's happening. We've got Chinese troops arriving in Hawaii ... and Kansas. There's a lot of things going on that are very suspicious. There are a lot of people that are very vigilant.”Cruz is in New Hampshire for a two-day campaign swing before he heads to Iowa for a multi-day trip next week. Asked whether the senator had any reservations about conducting his first official campaign event with Kimball’s group, Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler responded in an email, “None.” This story has been updated with details from Friday's campaign event."

(AP Photo/Alastair Grant)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7fdf725000032003a0e94.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Using a twisted version of Islam, the militant group Islamic State, or ISIS, has pushed online campaigns to attract youth to its bloody crusade in Syria and Iraq. Now a group of British imams and scholars is looking to ""reclaim the Internet"" with a new magazine aimed at shifting the conversation and spreading a message of truth. Haqiqah, meaning ""the truth"" or ""the reality"" in Arabic, is a digital magazine created by Islamic scholars with the purpose of educating young people about the realities of extremism, according to its backers at Imams Online. The goal, they say, is to ""drown out"" the voices perpetuating violence. “Someone has to reclaim that territory from ISIS, and that can only be imams: religious leaders who guide and nourish their community,” Qari Asim, senior editor at Imams Online, told the BBC. “But now that we live in a digital mobile world, some young people are not coming to the mosque so we must reach out to them -– and this is the Muslims’ contribution to combat radicalization on the net."" More than 100 imams were reportedly present at the launch of the magazine in London Thursday night, including influential U.S. scholar Hamza Yusuf and Sheikh Abdallah Bin Bayyah, president of the Forum for Promoting Peace. One imam told BuzzFeed ""Haqiqa would reach out to vulnerable people, who are often targeted by extremists on social media."" CNN reports ISIS claims to have a $2 billion budget that it can use for the recruitment of youth around the globe, including funds for the production of videos and social media efforts. It's been estimated there may be as many as 70,000 pro-ISIS accounts on Twitter alone, and according to The Independent some 700 British people have traveled to join the group in Syria.The first issue of Haqiqah calls ISIS an ""empty banner"" and states that ""interspersing the occasional out of context Qur'anic verse with hyperbolic arguments"" doesn't equate to legitimacy. This misconstruction, the magazine argues, is not Islam. They are individuals who study Islam from a superficial point of view and emerge with their own ideas and imaginary interpretations, which often diverge greatly from established Islamic principles. We can see that many of the characteristics found in these young men and women are similar to those identified as the Khawarij (Extremist/Dissenters) by the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). They have no grounding in Islamic sciences or jurisprudence and yet want to establish an ‘Islamic state’/‘Islamic System’. In the pursuit of their illintended aim, they are prepared to bulldoze the fundamental teachings of Islam.Those in the wider Muslim community are optimistic about the effect a publication like Haqiqah can have. ""If this is part of community-led initiatives to counter ISIS, then it is exactly what's needed,"" Salam Al-Marayati, president of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, told The Huffington Post in an email Friday. ""Governments and their military forces cannot bomb away ideas of violent extremism. Authentic and credible community voices can wash away the filth from the cult of death, bring the the light of life to lost souls, hoping to rehabilitate them so they don't destroy themselves and their families.""

I was going through the motions, my head and my heart unconnected. I was wishing my children would hurry and grow up, wishing my husband was more romantic, wishing we owned a house, wishing I had studied and had a better career, wishing I was traveling, wishing I was free, wishing I could escape my own mind. Everywhere I looked was nothing how I wanted it. I felt frustrated and depressed. I wanted this so-called ""life"" to stop dragging me around.So I went looking for help, and the universe met me.I found a nun who did counseling and one night I told her all the worries and the thoughts I couldn't carry in my head anymore. She smiled and paused. The ceiling fan spun slowly -- its blades etching that moment in my mind. I waited. In the silence I absorbed the room around me. It's full of mismatched furniture and musty smells. My legs were sticking to the vinyl chair. Beside me was a leaflet warning of the dwindling numbers of nuns. The room was too big for the amount of furniture it contained, and as she begun to talk her words had a slight echo.""Hailey.. the secret to happiness is reflection and gratitude. Take time every day to think through your day and write down anything you are truly grateful for.""I left amused, and a tiny bit disappointed. Surely, it couldn't be that simple!When I arrived home I took out my notepad while sitting on my bed, and I thought carefully about my day. I felt a bit lost and didn't write down anything. I realized there's a big difference between feeling like you should be grateful for something, and actually being grateful for it. I made a commitment to writing down only genuine feelings of gratitude. This process of thinking, reflecting and looking for the good sparked something within me.I abandoned my notepad and took to carrying an old Polaroid camera. I decided I was going to push this a bit further and commit to a whole year of looking for good things in my life. Every single day I took a photo of something I am grateful for. In this project, I found my husband loves me in many ways I had been missing. I found him singing our children to sleep at night. I found him holding my hand in the car. I found him giving me the biggest piece of pie even though I wasn't looking. I found him bringing me ice cream on hot days. I found that my view had been obscured by my headspace. When I went looking I saw something far more beautiful than the ideal I had in my head.I found that when my thoughts got dark -- thinking ""You are not good enough"" -- or that I was failing, I could take this practice and find within me something beautiful to hold onto. I found that there are more good things about me than bad..I found that when life didn't go quite right and I just couldn't fix things that if I leaned into gratitude I could find something beautiful even in the mess, the pain and the awkwardness. I found I could at the very least learn something amazing!I found that parenting was awe-inspiring. Instead of wishing this time away, I was floored by the honor of traveling with these sweet souls. My heart was full.I saw that what I had was enough. I was freed from endlessly chasing and learnt instead to hold delightedly to the moments right in front of me.This is the moment and the discovery I am most grateful for. This gift a nun gave me. This idea of capturing grateful moments for a whole year -- the moment where I swore to look and find. And I did.This blog post is part of a series for HuffPost Gratitude, entitled 'The One Thing I'm Most Thankful For.'

From an early age, I had always been drawn to Vitamin C products that major cosmetics brands requested me to sample - but was never 100% satisfied. I wanted a Vitamin C product that was natural with even stronger anti-aging benefits. Instead of being watered down and weakened by harsh chemicals, perfumes, and ""fluff"" ingredients, I wanted something pure and powerful.So I began researching the superior anti-aging effects of Vitamin C and experimenting in my kitchen with my own mixtures.

30,BUSINESS,How Successful People Handle Toxic People,"Dr. Travis Bradberry, ContributorAuthor of #1 bestselling book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0, and...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-successful-people-han_b_6933180.html,"To deal with toxic people effectively, you need an approach that enables you, across the board, to control what you can and eliminate what you can't. The important thing to remember is that you are in control of far more than you realize.",2015-03-26,2015-03-24-1427219665-3781504-HowSuccessfulPeopleHandleToxicPeople_LI.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-24-1427219665-3781504-HowSuccessfulPeopleHandleToxicPeople_LI-thumb.jpg,"Toxic people defy logic. Some are blissfully unaware of the negative impact that they have on those around them, and others seem to derive satisfaction from creating chaos and pushing other people's buttons. Either way, they create unnecessary complexity, strife and worst of all stress.Studies have long shown that stress can have a lasting, negative impact on the brain. Exposure to even a few days of stress compromises the effectiveness of neurons in the hippocampus -- an important brain area responsible for reasoning and memory. Weeks of stress cause reversible damage to neuronal dendrites (the small ""arms"" that brain cells use to communicate with each other), and months of stress can permanently destroy neurons. Stress is a formidable threat to your success -- when stress gets out of control, your brain and your performance suffer.Most sources of stress at work are easy to identify. If your non-profit is working to land a grant that your organization needs to function, you're bound to feel stress and likely know how to manage it. It's the unexpected sources of stress that take you by surprise and harm you the most.Recent research from the Department of Biological and Clinical Psychology at Friedrich Schiller University in Germany found that exposure to stimuli that cause strong negative emotions -- the same kind of exposure you get when dealing with toxic people -- caused subjects' brains to have a massive stress response. Whether it's negativity, cruelty, the victim syndrome or just plain craziness, toxic people drive your brain into a stressed-out state that should be avoided at all costs.The ability to manage your emotions and remain calm under pressure has a direct link to your performance. TalentSmart has conducted research with more than a million people, and we've found that 90 percent of top performers are skilled at managing their emotions in times of stress in order to remain calm and in control. One of their greatest gifts is the ability to neutralize toxic people. Top performers have well-honed coping strategies that they employ to keep toxic people at bay.While I've run across numerous effective strategies that successful people employ when dealing with toxic people, what follows are twelve of the best. To deal with toxic people effectively, you need an approach that enables you, across the board, to control what you can and eliminate what you can't. The important thing to remember is that you are in control of far more than you realize.They Set Limits (Especially with Complainers)Complainers and negative people are bad news because they wallow in their problems and fail to focus on solutions. They want people to join their pity party so that they can feel better about themselves. People often feel pressure to listen to complainers because they don't want to be seen as callous or rude, but there's a fine line between lending a sympathetic ear and getting sucked into their negative emotional spiral.You can avoid this only by setting limits and distancing yourself when necessary. Think of it this way: if the complainer were smoking, would you sit there all afternoon inhaling the second-hand smoke? You'd distance yourself, and you should do the same with complainers. A great way to set limits is to ask complainers how they intend to fix the problem. They will either quiet down or redirect the conversation in a productive direction.They Don't Die in the FightSuccessful people know how important it is to live to fight another day, especially when your foe is a toxic individual. In conflict, unchecked emotion makes you dig your heels in and fight the kind of battle that can leave you severely damaged. When you read and respond to your emotions, you're able to choose your battles wisely and only stand your ground when the time is right.They Rise AboveToxic people drive you crazy because their behavior is so irrational. Make no mistake about it; their behavior truly goes against reason. So why do you allow yourself to respond to them emotionally and get sucked into the mix?The more irrational and off-base someone is, the easier it should be for you to remove yourself from their traps. Quit trying to beat them at their own game. Distance yourself from them emotionally and approach your interactions like they're a science project (or you're their shrink, if you prefer the analogy). You don't need to respond to the emotional chaos -- only the facts.They Stay Aware of Their EmotionsMaintaining an emotional distance requires awareness. You can't stop someone from pushing your buttons if you don't recognize when it's happening. Sometimes you'll find yourself in situations where you'll need to regroup and choose the best way forward. This is fine and you shouldn't be afraid to buy yourself some time to do so.Think of it this way -- if a mentally unstable person approaches you on the street and tells you he's John F. Kennedy, you're unlikely to set him straight. When you find yourself with a coworker who is engaged in similarly derailed thinking, sometimes it's best to just smile and nod. If you're going to have to straighten them out, it's better to give yourself some time to plan the best way to go about it.They Establish BoundariesThis is the area where most people tend to sell themselves short. They feel like because they work or live with someone, they have no way to control the chaos. This couldn't be further from the truth. Once you've found your way to Rise Above a person, you'll begin to find their behavior more predictable and easier to understand. This will equip you to think rationally about when and where you have to put up with them and when you don't. For example, even if you work with someone closely on a project team, that doesn't mean that you need to have the same level of one-on-one interaction with them that you have with other team members.You can establish a boundary, but you'll have to do so consciously and proactively. If you let things happen naturally, you are bound to find yourself constantly embroiled in difficult conversations. If you set boundaries and decide when and where you'll engage a difficult person, you can control much of the chaos. The only trick is to stick to your guns and keep boundaries in place when the person tries to encroach upon them, which they will.They Won't Let Anyone Limit Their JoyWhen your sense of pleasure and satisfaction are derived from the opinions of other people, you are no longer the master of your own happiness. When emotionally intelligent people feel good about something that they've done, they won't let anyone's opinions or snide remarks take that away from them.While it's impossible to turn off your reactions to what others think of you, you don't have to compare yourself to others, and you can always take people's opinions with a grain of salt. That way, no matter what toxic people are thinking or doing, your self-worth comes from within. Regardless of what people think of you at any particular moment, one thing is certain -- you're never as good or bad as they say you are.They Don't Focus on Problems -- Only SolutionsWhere you focus your attention determines your emotional state. When you fixate on the problems you're facing, you create and prolong negative emotions and stress. When you focus on actions to better yourself and your circumstances, you create a sense of personal efficacy that produces positive emotions and reduces stress.When it comes to toxic people, fixating on how crazy and difficult they are gives them power over you. Quit thinking about how troubling your difficult person is, and focus instead on how you're going to go about handling them. This makes you more effective by putting you in control, and it will reduce the amount of stress you experience when interacting with them.They Don't ForgetEmotionally intelligent people are quick to forgive, but that doesn't mean that they forget. Forgiveness requires letting go of what's happened so that you can move on. It doesn't mean you'll give a wrongdoer another chance. Successful people are unwilling to be bogged down unnecessarily by others' mistakes, so they let them go quickly and are assertive in protecting themselves from future harm.They Squash Negative Self-TalkSometimes you absorb the negativity of other people. There's nothing wrong with feeling bad about how someone is treating you, but your self-talk (the thoughts you have about your feelings) can either intensify the negativity or help you move past it. Negative self-talk is unrealistic, unnecessary and self-defeating. It sends you into a downward emotional spiral that is difficult to pull out of. You should avoid negative self-talk at all costs.They Limit Their Caffeine IntakeDrinking caffeine triggers the release of adrenaline. Adrenaline is the source of the ""fight-or-flight"" response, a survival mechanism that forces you to stand up and fight or run for the hills when faced with a threat. The fight-or-flight mechanism sidesteps rational thinking in favor of a faster response. This is great when a bear is chasing you, but not so great when you're surprised in the hallway by an angry coworker.They Get Some SleepI've beaten this one to death over the years and can't say enough about the importance of sleep to increasing your emotional intelligence and managing your stress levels. When you sleep, your brain literally recharges, shuffling through the day's memories and storing or discarding them (which causes dreams), so that you wake up alert and clear-headed. Your self-control, attention and memory are all reduced when you don't get enough -- or the right kind -- of sleep. Sleep deprivation raises stress hormone levels on its own, even without a stressor present.A good night's sleep makes you more positive, creative and proactive in your approach to toxic people, giving you the perspective you need to deal effectively with them.They Use Their Support SystemIt's tempting, yet entirely ineffective, to attempt tackling everything by yourself. To deal with toxic people, you need to recognize the weaknesses in your approach to them. This means tapping into your support system to gain perspective on a challenging person. Everyone has someone at work and/or outside work who is on their team, rooting for them and ready to help them get the best from a difficult situation. Identify these individuals in your life and make an effort to seek their insight and assistance when you need it. Something as simple as explaining the situation can lead to a new perspective. Most of the time, other people can see a solution that you can't because they are not as emotionally invested in the situation.Bringing It All TogetherBefore you get this system to work brilliantly, you're going to have to pass some tests. Most of the time, you will find yourself tested by touchy interactions with problem people. Thankfully, the plasticity of the brain allows it to mold and change as you practice new behaviors, even when you fail. Implementing these healthy, stress-relieving techniques for dealing with difficult people will train your brain to handle stress more effectively and decrease the likelihood of ill effects.I always love to hear new strategies for dealing with toxic people, so please feel free to share yours in the comments section below!"
31,ENTERTAINMENT,What Does 'The Jinx' Mean For The Future Of True Crime?,Lauren Duca,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/middlebrow-the-jinx_n_6932088.html,,2015-03-26,"GALVESTON, TX - NOVEMBER 10: Millionaire murder defendant Robert Durst (C) sits in State District Judge Susan Criss court with his attorney Dick DeGuerin (R) November 10, 2003 at the Galveston County Courthouse in Galveston, Texas. Durst is being charged for the murder and mutilation of his neighbor Morris Black. (Photo by James Nielsen/ Getty Images) ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4ae32250000cf0039078b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Middlebrow is a recap of the week in entertainment, celebrity and television news that provides a comprehensive look at the state of pop culture. From the rock bottom to highfalutin, Middlebrow is your accessible guidebook to the world of entertainment. Sign up to receive it in your inbox here.""What did I do? Killed them all, of course,"" Robert Durst says in the final moments of ""The Jinx."" His voice -- with a cadence that is an an eerie mix of Heath Ledger's Joker and Woody Allen -- bumps over his hot mic between burps and flushes in the restroom. That chilling last episode of the HBO docu-series aired hours after Durst's arrest for the murder of Susan Berman (one of three alleged Durst murders ""The Jinx"" depicts). With his subject's arrest, director Andrew Jarecki's years of research came to fruition in real time as the ultimate anxiety-based voyeurism: scandal at just the right distance, combined with the reassurance that the bad guys will get caught. Sources close to the Los Angeles Police Department told the L.A. Times that ""The Jinx"" ""played a role"" in Durst's arrest. And it's not the first time a documentary has had such tangible real-life ramifications. In a follow-up piece, the paper pointed to Errol Morris' ""Thin Blue Line,"" which led to the exoneration of Randall Adams in 1989. In 2011, Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky's ""Paradise Lost"" aided in the release of the three Arkansas men known as the West Memphis Three.The documentary genre has the potential to impact cases in this way because of its inherent and presumed journalistic ethics. And yet, as entertainment, the form falls under the danger of breaching that code of conduct in the push for sensationalization. When the content is working to convict a suspect rather than free the wrongfully accused, that inherent possibility is much more problematic.With ""The Jinx,"" Jarecki has ushered the typically pulpy tonality of true crime into the realm of prestige television. True crime has typically fallen into the category of guilty pleasure. (Consider that cop shows like ""America's Most Wanted"" were the first transition of the documentary into the reality TV.) The HBO mini-series marks a move back to the respectability of the documentary format with true crime content. Its resulting interest and popularity will likely change the future of sub-genre. But what does that shift mean for its subjects?Problems with ""The Jinx"" emerged almost as quickly as its rise. Once the news of Durst pulsed into virality, ""The Jinx"" timeline grew murky. Jarecki failed to answer simple questions about how things proceeded with The New York Times and canceled all future media appearances. Now, it is speculated that Jarecki held on to evidence for several years before handing it over to the police. ""The way these events are presented on the show, it looks like Durst’s arrest gave Jarecki leverage in his quest to get more time with his subject,"" Leon Neyfakh and Jay Deshpande wrote in one potential explanation at Slate. ""In reality, it seems like the arrest may have happened more than a year after he conducted his explosive second interview with Durst."" This does not alter Durst's potential guilt. It does call Jarecki's motives into question. As Kate Aurthur wrote at BuzzFeed, ""It’s unfortunate that Jarecki’s on-camera statement that its No. 1 goal is to 'get justice' might end up being another of its fictional re-enactments."" It's useless to speculate over whether Jarecki deliberately muddled things or why, though it's inarguable that altering the timeline could not align with his priority to ""get justice."" Really, a film's No. 1 goal can never be to ""get justice."" A film's No. 1 goal is to entertain. Regardless of good intentions, its impossible for that not to interfere with the ethical obligations inherent in journalism and the justice system. And where does that leave us? We have a man muttering a possible murder confession to himself while peeing. It might be inadmissible in a court of law, but all that really matters for ""The Jinx"" is that it's good TV.Follow Lauren Duca on Twitter: @laurenduca"

In fact, according to the What We Eat in America, NHANES 2011-2012 national nutrition survey, some 24 percent of our daily calories -- about 440 and 615 calories for women and men respectively -- come from our between-meal noshes. What's more, snacks provide an outsized 37 percent of total sugars in the diet. According to the Nielsen Global Snacking Survey in 2014, Americans' most popular snack choices include salty chips, chocolate, cheese and cookies. Since we eat only about half of the recommended number of servings of fruits and vegetables, while we get 2-3 times as much added sugar, more fat and sodium than we need, enjoying produce snacks, in place of nutrient-poor options, will instantly upgrade your diet. One of my nutrition ""rules"" I live by is to always have a serving of fruit or veggies as their snacks. My gym bag always has an apple, banana or clementines in it as I find those fruits travel well and are easy to eat when I'm time-pressed and on-the-go. The good news is that produce companies are offering many new options for ready-to-eat produce picks for healthier nibbles. Here are five of my favorite produce picks to keep on hand so you won't need to hit the office vending machine or candy bowl for your afternoon pick-me-up. 1. Naturipe Ready-to-Eat Fresh Blueberries  Delicate blueberries aren't the most travel-worthy fresh fruit snack, but these washed and ready-to-eat blueberries are sold in rigid single-serve packages so they can go anywhere you do. They're great to pack in lunch, gym or work bags. 2. OneBar  While most bars are loaded with added sugars, these bars are virtually all dried fruit with a little fruit or veggie juice concentrate used for color and texture--not to provide sugar. They're available in cherry, mango and apple flavors, they count toward one of your fruit servings. 3. Sunsweet Ones These individually wrapped prunes are a convenient way to satisfy you're craving for something sweet while getting a produce serving. I keep them in my car and in my carry-on bag when flying as it's often hard to get produce snacks when traveling. They have 25 calories each (four equal a full fruit serving), and are a good source of fiber and antioxidants.4. Woot Froot Love fresh peaches and nectarines but worried about traveling with these delicate fruits and how messy they can be to eat? Now there's a solution. Woot Froot provides pre-washed and sliced preservative-free peaches and nectarines that are perfect for snacking and won't leave your hands a sticky mess. 5. NatureSweet Cherriots Grape tomatoes are a satisfying snack we often overlook. Cherriots make snacking on them easy. Combine with a low-fat Ranch dip or enjoy over cottage cheese for a protein-packed energy boost.

However, with recent changes and advancements in airline services, economy flying no longer has to be taxing, and whether your flight is a long-haul overnighter to the other side of the globe, or just a short domestic hop, there's usually plenty of creature comforts on offer to make things better.When it comes to airline food, the changes have been colossal, with on-board meals graduating from processed dishes to fresh and healthy dining that's infused with the tastes and cultures of the airlines that offer them. To make sure you get the most flavorsome trip possible this year, be sure to check out this selection of the world's best economy class caterers, all courtesy of acclaimed airline awards body, Skytrax.10. LufthansaStanding strong for Western Europe on this list is the much-lauded German flag carrier, Lufthansa. Economy passengers with the aviation giant can expect to enjoy a healthy, fresh and tasty range of refreshments, all infused with the flavors of the continent and the Med. There are crispy croissants, juicy fruits, heavy rye breads and soups galore, not to mention oodles of frothy Bavarian beers on board! Lufthansa also have plenty of options for travelers with specific dietary needs, from gluten free meals to low cholesterol foods.9. Garuda IndonesiaIt's no secret that the economy offering from Garuda Indonesia is truly top-notch. Not only did they garner a second-place spot on Skytrax's coach ratings overall last year, but they also gained accolades for their cabin crew services, which means passengers can expect a truly memorable experience in the air when flying with the flag carrier. However, the bonuses don't stop there, because apparently Garuda's food menu is also something to write home about--touting a mishmash of spicy nasi goreng rice dishes and international staples besides!8. EVA AirStart the day with a dollop of Chinese porridge while taking off from the runways of Taoyuan International, then, settle down for a lunch of healthy Taiwanese steamed rice, and finally, an evening of international red wines and Asian beers as you descend to arrive in one of the four continents currently on EVA Air's line-up of destinations. Sounds good? Well that's because it should, with the Taipei-based carrier touting a respectable eighth place on this selection of the best economy catering services currently criss-crossing the skies.7. ANA All Nippon AirwaysWith a motto that reads 'Inspiration of Japan', it's hardly surprising that the economy class food offering of ANA All Nippon is heavily influenced by the flavors of the east. But who's complaining? Not many apparently, especially with that line-up of passenger-voted dishes, those citrus-packed Aromatic Kabosu cocktails (the airline's own creation), Chardonnay reserves, spicy curries, steamed chicken quenelles, sockeye salmon fillets, yellowtails in soy sauce, bento-style fish cuts and Italian potato gnocchi on the menu!6. Singapore AirlinesBolstered by the multiculturalism and cosmopolitanism of their home nation, fla- carrying Singapore Airlines throw up a mishmash of flavors from right across the globe. On some flights there are Chinese noodles in spicy gravy sauce; on others there are Italian ragus with steamed vegetables. Some fliers enjoy bubbling curries straight out of Little India; others settle for marinated chicken breasts or fish. And to back it all up, this one also offers a range of sweet treats for dessert; complete with muffins, ice cream et al.5. Cathay Pacific AirwaysSearching for the cheapest flights? Download Hopper's new mobile app, set up fare alerts, and we'll tell you when flight prices are at their cheapest.Offering the perfect culinary introduction to travelers heading across to bustling Kowloon, Victoria Harbour or the stylish eateries of Wan Chai and Causeway Bay, Cathay Pacific have done well to imbue the menus of their economy class with the flavors of Hong Kong cuisine. That means oodles hot noodle soups, freshly-cooked rice dishes and oriental curries in excess. Oh, and don't worry if you've got a special request either, because Cathay have covered all the bases--from vegetarian Hindu curries with a twist of spice, to gluten free dishes and low lactose foods.4. Etihad AirwaysTouting a simple a la carte of three separate main courses, a fully complimentary bar service that's loaded with spirits, beers and international wines, and a separate café laden with tea, coffee and pastry snacks to boot, UAE-based Etihad slip neatly into the top five here. Expect to enjoy a whole load of Middle Eastern flavors, with Emirati curries rubbing shoulders with saffron rice, next to oodles of international staples that are testimony to the carrier's origins in the multicultural megalopolis of Dubai!3. Asiana AirlinesGiven that Asiana Airlines hail in from one of the world's most up-and-coming foodie meccas, touting a catering team that has no doubt had first-hand experience of Gangnam's steamy food courts and Seoul's barbecue joints, it's hardly surprising that they sit at a distinguished third place on this list. Consequently, economy fliers with the Incheon International-based carrier can expect a flavorsome cook-up of Korean noodles, spicy soups, Japanese-style dishes and fresh vegetable salads straight out of Asia.2. Turkish AirlinesDedicated to bringing passengers a taste of Turkey while criss-crossing the skies, the economy class catering services of this national flag carrier offer up a range of super-fresh Mediterranean sandwiches, cold and hot continental breakfasts, gritty Greek coffees and the like, all framed by a safer mix of international tastes for the less adventurous traveler. That should be plenty to prep the taste buds for all those tandir kebabs, sweet baklavas and kuru fasulye beans in the street food stalls of Istanbul and Ankara!1. Thai AirwaysIn a taste-bud-tingling medley of peanut pad noodles, massaman curries and Southeast Asian rice dishes, national flag carrier, Thai Airways, soars straight to first place on Skytrax's selection of the top economy class caterers currently in the air, which is great news for any travelers looking to prime their palates for the fragrant eateries and roadside food stalls of Bangkok's Banglamphu! And don't worry if you don't fancy the flavors of the east either, because there's also a range of international dishes on offer, and--of course--an open bar!Liked this article?

I could run for miles in it.",2015-03-26,2015-03-26-1427387222-1322418-2015.02.ewmcguire.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-26-1427387222-1322418-2015.02.ewmcguire-thumb.jpg,"For months my 10-year-old son and I had been battling too much. Nothing dramatic, just a steady, exhausting cycle of nagging/ignoring, cajoling/sighing, yelling/yelling, then crying/crying. There were all the predictable triggers: homework, chores, screen time. Every day I practiced complaining about dirty shoes on the sofa and Minecraft on the computer, and he practiced scowling and stomping. We both got really good at being disgusted with one another.The small stand-offs became almost daily routines and I soon realized that no matter the outcome of each argument I felt like I was losing every single time. First I was furious, then heartbroken.Things were not always this difficult between us. In fact, from the very beginning our relationship was a breeze. I grew up with only brothers so I like to think I understand boy energy and humor. Personality-wise, my son and I have much in common. We are happiest outside, no matter the weather. Every day we require ample time to move and sweat and DO, balanced with ample time to just sit and dream. We are really good at leaping before looking, then getting frustrated at our impulsiveness and backpedaling into a plan. We are both playaholics more than workaholics.But none of these similarities were helping us much, and I missed the easy connection we had always shared.So one night, after a particularly ugly argument over homework, I approached him in his room. ""I would really like to find something fun for us to do regularly -- just you and me."" My voice caught and tears brimmed. He replied, ""Don't worry, Mom. I'm not going to college yet.""I laughed -- at both his wisdom and naiveté. I was not worried about college. I was worried only about that particular day, and the next day, and maybe the next, but no further. I was worried about the current heaviness between us. I was not looking for a cure-all for the battles or some lofty psychological insight into why mothers and sons fight at this stage. I was simply looking for a way to inject more easy, light moments into our days.He suggested we run. We had run together before and casually finished some 5K races, but we had never made it a regular habit. He had never before shown interest in consistent training and I was, to be honest, a little protective of my own running schedule.Running had been my sanctuary for almost two decades and I was accustomed to escaping family life five times a week to meet a steady group of friends and training partners. I wasn't sure how I would add another layer to this carefully orchestrated routine, but I knew it was worth trying.So the next Saturday morning, I met my friends at our usual predawn hour. I finished our 7-mile loop and while the rest of them kept going, I ran home to meet my boy. He was still in his pajamas, on the computer, and had not seen my reminder note. It was 29 degrees, there was hot coffee in the kitchen, and I was starting to chill in my sweaty clothes. I nearly ditched the whole idea. But as soon as I asked, ""Hey bud, still want to run a few with me?"" he jumped up with a cheerful Yes!The next 30 minutes were pure joy. Following his lead, we launched into ""adventure running""... half running, half exploring our neighborhood and nearby trail. My boy zigzagged along the sidewalks, tightrope-walked every curb he found, jumped over rock walls and benches, and paused when he saw an interesting tree or funny graffiti. For every mile I ran, he seemed to run a quarter more with his diversions.He chattered about ideas for his latest cartoon series, and asked me lots of ridiculous What If questions. Even though we've passionately covered the topic before, we spent at least a mile discussing why Super Speed is obviously the best superpower ever. Even better than flying and invisibility, we agreed.Along the way we vowed to register for an upcoming race where volunteers enthusiastically douse runners with colored powdered until they look like toxic circus clowns. After last year's race, we were blowing blue gunk out of our noses for days, so we decided this year to wear bandanas for protection. ""We will be the Booger Bandana Brigade, Mom! We will have a booger mascot! I can make us a booger logo and everything!""And it was in the middle of this boogery monologue that I had the distinct and intoxicating feeling that this moment was exactly what we needed. There was lightness and laughter between us again. Welcome to your new Saturday morning routine, I thought. I am totally in.A month later, our regular runs have not solved everything, of course, but the constant heaviness is gone. Knowing that once a week I am guaranteed time with him that is void of arguing and frustration somehow gives me more patience and empathy on the other days.We have found a simple space that contains only joy and ease, and nothing could keep me from showing up there. I could run for miles in it."
