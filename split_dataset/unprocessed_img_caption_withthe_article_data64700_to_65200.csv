0,POLITICS,Here's How Clinton And Sanders Would Improve Criminal Justice,Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/criminal-justice-survey-clinton-sanders_us_56bb841ee4b08ffac12399cf,The Democratic candidates answer HuffPost's criminal justice survey.,2016-02-15,Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton both see a role for the federal government in reforming criminal justice.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56bb851e1a00009c01ab264a.jpeg?ops=crop_39_276_4137_2282%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Last month, The Huffington Post surveyed the major 2016 presidential candidates in an effort to compare their views on criminal justice. The two leading Democratic contenders, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, participated -- as did former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who has since suspended his campaign following a poor showing in Iowa.Here's what we learned. The Democratic presidential nominee -- whether Clinton or Sanders -- will call for expanding federal investigations into local police departments, believe racial inequalities in the criminal justice system cannot be explained away by economic disparities, and think a variety of factors -- not mass incarceration alone -- contributed to the historically low levels of violent crime in the U.S. in recent years.The nominee will also think that prisons need to put more emphasis on rehabilitation, that the harmful practice of solitary confinement should not be used as a punishment, and that the U.S. Department of Justice should dole out federal grants in ways that push law enforcement agencies across the country to stop routinely violating constitutional rights.The nation has been paying more attention to criminal justice reform in the year and a half since protests broke out in Ferguson, Missouri, over the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown. As social media have helped give a voice to communities whose longstanding concerns were often dismissed by elected officials and ignored in the traditional media, many prominent law enforcement leaders have conceded the need for reform. Both Clinton and Sanders have met with key organizers in the Black Lives Matter movement.Yet the issue -- so connected to race -- remains tricky for Democrats to navigate. During the ""tough on crime"" 1990s, both Clinton and Sanders supported legislation that led to massive growth in the federal prison population, which they now seem to regret. In a country that remains heavily segregated, Democrats also risk alienating a segment of moderate white voters who struggle to relate to the experiences of many black Americans with police officers, who have little exposure to problems within the criminal justice system and who may be generally allergic to the suggestion that their skin color has given them any advantage in life. The Republican presidential nominee may seek to capitalize specifically on the racial divide in perceptions of law enforcement. In the years since Barack Obama was elected to the White House, many conservative politicians and media outlets have shown little hesitation in casting the nation's first black president and his former attorney general -- Eric Holder, a black man who spent most of his career in law enforcement -- as anti-police. Donald Trump has called police ""the most mistreated people"" in America and suggested that a Black Lives Matter activist ""should have been roughed up"" at one of his rallies. Other GOP candidates, including Ted Cruz and Chris Christie, have demonized the Black Lives Matter movement. Although some of The Huffington Post's questions asked candidates how they thought about criminal justice, many focused on what candidates would do as president. In contrast to the Republican contenders -- who have, for the most part, spoken very generally on criminal justice and suggest the issue should be handled mainly at the local level -- the Democratic candidates argue that the federal government can and should play a significant role.In answering HuffPost's survey, Clinton and Sanders both pointed to experiences early in their lives that informed their view of the criminal justice system. Sanders recalled ""being harassed by the police simply for putting up flyers in a neighborhood"" as a student organizer in the 1960s. He found the contrast between the officers he faced in real life and the ideal of local government he learned in class ""striking,"" Sanders said.Clinton recalled the work she did fresh out of law school for the Children's Defense Fund, where she investigated the incarceration of juveniles in adult jails in South Carolina, and with the University of Arkansas School of Law's legal aid clinic, where she advocated for inmates and low-income families. ""I saw how families can be torn apart by excessive incarceration and the toll it takes on children growing up in homes shattered by poverty and prison,"" Clinton wrote. ""Through my work, I came to see how our legal system can be stacked against those who have the least power and are the most vulnerable.""Both candidates were born in the 1940s and began their schooling before the Supreme Court's 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision, which declared state-sponsored educational segregation to be unconstitutional. Both came of age in the civil rights era. High-schooler Clinton met Martin Luther King Jr. around the time she was campaigning for Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater, who opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. College student Sanders was in Washington, D.C., for King's celebrated ""I have a dream"" speech in 1963.In his survey, Sanders said that race ""plays a role in every aspect"" of the criminal justice system and that police officers are human, subject to the same biases and behaviors as everyone else. ""People of color are more likely to be stopped by police, arrested, receive a prison sentence, receive a disproportionately longer sentence, and receive more punitive treatment in the prison system compared with white people,"" the senator wrote. ""Discrimination in the law enforcement and judicial systems must be addressed at every level.""There is ""something profoundly wrong when African American men are still far more likely to be stopped and searched by police, charged with crimes, and sentenced to longer prison terms,"" Clinton wrote. ""When an estimated 1.5 million black men are missing from their families and communities because of incarceration and premature death. And such racial inequalities are not merely a symptom of economic inequality. Black people across America still experience racism every day, whether intentional or implicit bias. That's the reality in the African-American community -- and we shouldn't stand for it.""Clinton has said before that she'd beef up the section of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division that investigates patterns of constitutional abuses, such as the predatory and profit-driven ticketing system in Ferguson. In the survey, she said she also wanted to double funding for the Collaborative Reform Initiative run by DOJ's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, which is a process of working with local police that's intended to be less adversarial than civil rights investigations.Read the full answers from Clinton and Sanders here."
1,POLITICS,Loophole In California Water Laws Could Open Way For Bottling Plant Despite Drought,"Alastair Bland, Water Deeply",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/groundwater-law-loophole_us_56c1ec6fe4b0b40245c72fd6,Is a bottling company about to get unlimited groundwater when locals have been conserving during the drought? Some residents,2016-02-15,Some residents of the nearby city of Mount Shasta are concerned about a loophole in a recent groundwater law that omits to regulate water from volcanic basins.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56c1ee061a00009c01ab2a6f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Is a bottling company about to get unlimited groundwater when locals have been conserving during the drought? Some residents of Mount Shasta City are concerned a loophole in a new groundwater law means that a planned bottling operation by Crystal Geyser could dry up local groundwater wells.A large beverage bottling operation could receive a free pass to use all it wants of a small Northern California community’s groundwater supply, thanks to an obscure allowance in state water laws and a protective trade agreement.Crystal Geyser has plans to launch a new beverage bottling operation in the small northern California town of Mount Shasta. In response to California’s drought, locals here cut water use by about 40 percent between 2014 and 2015, according to officials. However, an exemption in newly drafted groundwater regulations could give the giant company leeway to use unlimited water from the community’s underground supply. The company has sworn it will take an insignificant volume of water from the ground and that local wells will not be affected.The concern among locals, however, is that there is nothing in the law that will curtail Crystal Geyser’s use. That’s because the city of Mount Shasta's groundwater supply is considered to be a “volcanic basin,” not an “alluvial basin” – a geologic distinction that carries significant consequences under a set of new water use laws.The Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA), the newly passed legislation celebrated as a potential fix to the state’s aquifer overdraft problems, only addresses alluvial basins. Alluvial basins occur mostly in low-lying valleys, where substrate like sand or gravel is saturated with large volumes of water that flows in from upslope sources. SGMA’s new regulations are based on Bulletin 118, a Department of Water Resources list that names several hundred of the state’s important groundwater sources. All are alluvial basins.Tim Godwin, an engineering geologist with the California Department of Water Resources, says there are two basic types of groundwater sources recognized by scientists – alluvial basins in valley areas, where river sediments have accumulated for long periods of time, and aquifers in mountain regions, where the ground consists mostly of solid or fractured rock.“[The Sustainable Groundwater Management Act] only focuses on alluvial basins with lots of groundwater production,” he says.An alluvial basin is characterized by predictable “radial flow in permeable, porous medium,” he says, adding that this flow pattern makes managing, predicting and limiting water use relatively easy.But groundwater in mountain areas is very different. It doesn’t move through the earth in the relatively homogeneous way that water generally seeps through the alluvial sand or gravel soils of valley regions.“It’s very difficult to understand connectivity and flow in these basins,” he says. “So, as you start to enter into the fractured rock areas, like around Mount Shasta, you have combinations of conditions that make understanding how the groundwater behaves really challenging.”Fractures, porous volcaniclastic rock and tubes created by lava flows all serve as conduits for water, he explains. Groundwater in areas of solid bedrock flows in even less predictable ways.Godwin says that roughly 98 percent of the state’s groundwater use comes from alluvial aquifers, meaning few people will be affected by the exclusion of volcanic and fractured rock aquifers from SGMA.But for Californians who depend on mountain groundwater deposits, the exemption of such basins from the widely heralded new groundwater management laws seems an egregious omission. In the Mount Shasta region, the water that flows just below the surface ultimately winds up in the Sacramento River system – an increasingly troubled ecosystem in which native species are vanishing and on which millions of people, and vast sprawls of farmland, depend.“Leaving the Sacramento River’s source region out of SGMA is like trying to cure peripheral vascular disease without addressing the heart,” says Vicki Gold, who lives just outside of the city of Mount Shasta.Godwin says that aquifers that won’t be covered by SGMA may still be monitored and regulated by county officials. But Gold says she and other locals don’t trust that county authorities will do so in a fair way.Even if Siskiyou County wishes to bar Crystal Geyser from pumping the region’s groundwater, the beverage giant may have its way with local water resources through a new business-friendly trade agreement called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The TPP has been drafted through years of negotiations between the United States and 11 nations surrounding the Pacific Rim, and it could be activated this year. The partnership will work as a boon to economic growth and will essentially allow multinational business ventures to skirt local regulations.Since Crystal Geyser is owned by a Japanese pharmaceutical firm called Otsuka, the Mount Shasta beverage bottling project could be protected from any restrictions imposed by state or county laws.Nancy Price, the national co-chair with the Alliance for Democracy, says the TPP will allow corporations to sue governments in a TPP-specific court if any laws infringe on the profits of foreign-owned ventures.“What if groundwater sources are reduced or springs near Mount Shasta go dry after a really severe drought, and if the community decides that the amount of water taken for the bottling plant impacts these resources and needs to be reduced?” says Price. “The Japanese corporation that owns Crystal Geyser could sue the county by taking a case to protect their ‘investor rights’ in a secret international trade court that bypasses our U.S. court system and allows for no appeal.""According to Gold, when Coca-Cola operated the bottling plant now being resuscitated by Crystal Geyser, local groundwater supplies dwindled.“Wells went dry when Coca-Cola was pumping,” Gold says. “People had gravel and sand in their pipes.”Raven Stevens, the community liaison for the Mount Shasta Gateway Neighborhood Association, moved to the area four years ago but has talked with many of her neighbors about groundwater quality and reliability in recent years. She says at least six wells within half a mile of the bottling plant went dry or almost dry between 2005 and 2009. In 2010, the beverage maker left town.“Then everyone’s water issues went away and didn’t even return through the worst drought in history,” she says.Stevens says that Coca-Cola representatives informed of the well issues at the time said that because only some local wells, and not all, were experiencing issues the problem must have been related to the landowners’ pipes or the wells themselves.“But we’re in a volcanic aquifer,” Stevens says, explaining that the unpredictable movement of groundwater in such aquifers makes Coca-Cola’s straight-line conclusion much too simplistic to trust.Greg Plucker, community development director with Siskiyou County, says no records exist of resident complaints about groundwater supplies during Coca-Cola’s use of the bottling facility. Moreover, he says a review by the Regional Water Quality Control Board in 2001 determined that extracting 450 gallons (1,700 liters) per minute from the aquifer below the plant would not negatively influence local groundwater water supplies. He says Crystal Geyser has plans to use much less than that.Steve Burns, with the public relations firm Burson-Marsteller, which is representing Crystal Geyser, confirms this. He says the plan is to draw 80 gallons per minute – or 115,000 gallons per day – from the site’s production well and, perhaps in several years, if the project is successful, double that use. Never, he says, will water use on the Crystal Geyser site approach what Coca-Cola pumped from the ground.Stevens believes this is misinformation. She says that an additional domestic well on the property will have the capacity to take up to 320 gallons per minute. Eventually, she warns, Crystal Geyser’s project will be pumping at least the volume of water that allegedly drained locals’ water supplies seven years ago.“There is nothing legally stopping them from taking all the water they want,” she says.According to Burns, the domestic well will take a fraction the water that the production well will produce. “I don’t care how much water could come out of [the domestic well],” Burns says. “How many toilets would you need to flush to even come close to matching that production level?”Following a lawsuit filed last August by a citizens' group demanding a thorough review of Crystal Geyser’s proposed project, the company announced it would conduct an environmental review to ensure its bottling plant does no harm to the community. The first step in that process is submitting review applications to local agencies.At press time, Burns said the county application had been submitted months prior and another application would be turned in “any day now” to the city of Mount Shasta. He says it may take the city and the Siskiyou County Air Pollution Control District another two months to determine whether or not an environmental impact report is actually needed. An EIR, he says, could take many months more.Plucker, with Siskiyou County, says that even though California’s incoming groundwater laws will have no effect on the volcanic basin beneath Mount Shasta, an environmental review could potentially derail or stall the project.Stevens feels the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act will adequately serve communities in low valleys but fails communities like Mount Shasta.“The problem is that SGMA disregards areas like the top of the Sacramento River, where we are,” she says. “It’s no wonder Crystal Geyser has left places like Calistoga and Bakersfield, because they know it will be 20 years, and maybe 40, before the state turns its eyes up here.”Alastair Bland is a freelance writer based in San Francisco.

An EIR, he says, could take many months more.Plucker, with Siskiyou County, says that even though California’s incoming groundwater laws will have no effect on the volcanic basin beneath Mount Shasta, an environmental review could potentially derail or stall the project.Stevens feels the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act will adequately serve communities in low valleys but fails communities like Mount Shasta.“The problem is that SGMA disregards areas like the top of the Sacramento River, where we are,” she says. “It’s no wonder Crystal Geyser has left places like Calistoga and Bakersfield, because they know it will be 20 years, and maybe 40, before the state turns its eyes up here.”Alastair Bland is a freelance writer based in San Francisco.

""Now it's just a touchstone for me, a comfortable piece of my cast that, thanks to the podcast, I've been able to adapt into my career."" The gay community's love and admiration for the show's ""fab foursome"" -- Blanche, Rose, Dorothy and Sophia -- rivals that of icons like Judy Garland and Lady Gaga, he said.""They're the ultimate outsiders [who are] owning what makes them unique to their advantage. As older women, they're supposed to play a certain role in society, but the rail against that,"" he said. ""The same for gay people. For so long, we're told that who are doesn't mesh with society, but we do it anyway, because we'd rather be ourselves than be what society expects us to be."" So what would Scott, who is also a HuffPost Queer Voices blogger, say if he met Betty White, who is the sole surviving member of the show's principal cast?""Well, first, I would ask her in person what she thought my 'Golden Girls' tattoo.

During his premiership from 2006 to 2009, he was internationally credited with working toward a peace accord with the Palestinians, until graft scandals forced him to step down.""As prime minister I was charged with the highest responsibility of safeguarding Israel's citizens. Today I am the one to be locked behind bars,"" he said in a video released to media before he pulled up at Maasiyahu prison in central Israel in a motorcade protected by bodyguards assigned to former leaders.""At this time, it is important for me to say once more, as I did in court and outside it, that I completely deny the bribery charges I was accused of,"" Olmert said in the video.Olmert was assigned to a small wing of the prison, where he will be segregated for security reasons from the general population along with co-defendants in the real estate scandal.He will wear a prison uniform, have two cellmates and spend his first day in jail busy with assessment sessions with a social worker, criminologist - to assess, officials say, whether he is suicidal.Olmert was found guilty in 2014 of two bribery charges: accepting $129,000 from developers of a Jerusalem real estate project widely regarded as one of the city's worst eyesores and $15,500 in a separate land deal.He was sentenced to six years in jail, but the term was cut by the Supreme Court in December to 18 months after it overturned his conviction on the first bribery charge. Last month, a lower court tagged a month on to that sentence for obstruction of justice.A separate eight-month prison term is pending since Olmert's conviction last May in another case related to cash payments he was alleged to have received from an American businessman.Olmert, 70, is the most prominent of several Israeli politicians to be jailed in recent years. They include former president Moshe Katsav, convicted of rape, and present Interior Minister Aryieh Deri, once imprisoned for corruption.A lawyer by profession, Olmert began his political career in the 1970s as a lawmaker who targeted organized crime.As Israel's leader, Olmert waged war against militants in Lebanon in 2006 and the Gaza Strip in 2008. He claimed significant progress in talks with the Palestinians, offering an Israeli withdrawal from much of the occupied West Bank, though no agreement was reached."

(AP Photo, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Anthony DeutschAMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Islamic State militants attacked Kurdish forces in Iraq with mustard gas last year, the first known use of chemical weapons in Iraq since the fall of Saddam Hussein, a diplomat said, based on tests by the global chemical weapons watchdog.A source at the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) confirmed that laboratory tests had come back positive for the sulfur mustard, after around 35 Kurdish troops were sickened on the battlefield last August.The OPCW will not identify who used the chemical agent. But the diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity because the findings have not yet been released, said the result confirmed that chemical weapons had been used by Islamic State fighters.The samples were taken after the soldiers became ill during fighting against Islamic State militants southwest of Erbil, capital of Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region.The OPCW already concluded in October that mustard gas was used last year in neighboring Syria. Islamic State has declared a ""caliphate"" in territory it controls in both Iraq and Syria and does not recognize the frontier.Experts believe that the sulfur mustard either originated from an undeclared Syrian chemical stockpile, or that militants have gained the basic know how to develop and conduct a crude chemical attack with rockets or mortars.Iraq's chemical arsenal was mainly destroyed in the Saddam era, although U.S. troops encountered some old Saddam-era chemical munitions during the 2003-2011 U.S. occupation.Syria gave up its own chemical weapons, including stockpiles of sulfur mustard, under international supervision after hundreds of civilians were killed with sarin nerve gas in a Damascus suburb in 2013, an attack Western countries blame on President Bashar al-Assad's government, which denies it.Sulfur mustard is a Class 1 chemical agent, which means it has very few uses outside chemical warfare. Used with lethal effectiveness in World War One, it causes severe delayed burns to the eyes, skin and respiratory tract.(Reporting by Anthony Deutsch; Editing by Peter Graff)"

The onlookers applauded while Francis bent down to give the young girl a hug.@ConElPapa, the official Twitter account for Francis' visit to Mexico, later shared a prayer request for Garduño's health. The song, which Garduño performed in Latin, is a musical take on the ancient ""Hail Mary"" prayer, which is recited by Catholics around the world in honor of Jesus' mother. The young girl's choice of ""Ave Maria"" was perfect for the pope, since observers have often noted Francis' deeply personal devotion towards Mary.Garduño was just one of the 38 children Francis met during his visit to Federico Gomez Hospital, which is located in an impoverished neighborhood.

19,POLITICS,Justice Scalia Left Undecided High-Stakes Cases That Could Change The Nation,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/antonin-scalia-death-undecided-cases_us_56c072c5e4b08ffac1259d23,What will happen to them will be a test for the Supreme Court.,2016-02-14,Uncertainty looms over hot-button cases Justice Antonin Scalia participated in but never got to decide.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56c074f31a00009c01ab2a03.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It is not an overstatement that Justice Antonin Scalia's sudden death Saturday jolted the American political system -- and raised the stakes of the 2016 presidential election like never before.Amid the uncertainty, including the future of the Supreme Court itself, is the status of the 50-plus cases the court has heard or has yet to hear. Scalia no doubt had a hand in all of them -- whether he voted to add them to the court's docket, considered them at oral arguments, or was even in the process of writing an opinion for the majority.That leaves in legal limbo the fate of cases that could reshape the nation for decades -- including the constitutional future of abortion, affirmative action, the livelihood of public sector unions and President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration.The general rule for these cases, as explained by SCOTUSblog's Tom Goldstein, is that every vote Scalia cast toward deciding a case is a nullity if the decision is not yet made public.That means that a lot of the work Scalia and his law clerks put into the still pending blockbusters of the court's current term -- which tend to be decided toward the end of June -- is now technically void.Which in turn means that any case where the court was likely to split 5-to-4 along ideological lines -- with conservatives on one side and liberals on the other -- now runs the risk of resulting in a 4-to-4 vote. (The exception is cases where Scalia was in a supermajority, say 6-to-3 or 7-to-2 cases, which can still be decided without him on the bench.) If that's the case, the Supreme Court would issue a decision that would look something like this:Whenever the ""judgment is affirmed by an equally divided Court,"" that leaves the lower court ruling as the controlling final decision. The Supreme Court won't make any new law for the nation, but at least the parties will have some finality. The issue could always return to the court in the future.The starkest example where this result could be a game-changer is the pending challenge in Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, a case dealing with the right of public unions to charge ""agency fees"" to everyone in a bargaining unit, even employees who are not members of the union.Unions took a beating in that case at oral arguments in January, including from Scalia. But as The Huffington Post's Dave Jamieson noted on Saturday, no Scalia now means the case is bound for a tie -- which would leave in place the prior appeals ruling favoring the unions. And unions would get to breathe a sigh of relief, at least for now.But other cases aren't so clear-cut. The result in the closely watched affirmative action case, where Scalia infamously said that black students could be better served by attending ""slower-track schools,"" could still deal a blow to race-conscious policies at public universities. That's because the court went into that case with eight justices -- Elena Kagan recused herself due to her prior work in the dispute when she served as solicitor general.As for the outstanding abortion and immigration cases, which will be heard in March and April, respectively, the absence of Scalia should provide some measure of comfort to advocates of reproductive rights and an administrative reprieve for millions of undocumented immigrants. There, Scalia was likely to be in the minority -- Justice Anthony Kennedy is widely expected to carry the day and the majority, given his past role in upholding Roe v. Wade and the federal government's prerogatives in immigration policy.There are other major cases that remain up in the air -- including a separate religious challenge to contraception coverage under the Affordable Care Act and the future of the Constitution's ""one person, one vote"" principle. All of them could truly reshape the nation. With Scalia's chair now empty on the Supreme Court bench, the country should brace for some uncertain times ahead."
20,POLITICS,Replacing Antonin Scalia Could Mean The Biggest Supreme Court Shakeup In 25 Years,Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/justice-scalia-replacement_us_56bff995e4b08ffac125968e,Conservatives have had a functional majority at least since 1991.,2016-02-14,The next justice could push the Supreme Court in a very different direction.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Filling a seat on the Supreme Court is always a big deal.Filling the seat of Justice Antonin Scalia, the conservative icon who died on Saturday, will be an even bigger deal than usual. The appointment could shift the ideological direction of the court more than any other appointment in the last 25 years.It all depends on who gets to appoint the next justice. Senate Republicans have already said they will not confirm a nominee from President Barack Obama. If they carry out that threat and a Republican wins the November election, then Scalia’s replacement will almost certainly be another conservative. In other words, the next justice would probably end up voting like Scalia did -- and would do so for years to come.But if Obama somehow gets a nominee through, or if a Democrat wins the 2016 election and gets to appoint a justice, Scalia’s replacement will almost certainly be a liberal. It would arguably represent the sharpest shift in the court’s balance since 1991, when Justice Clarence Thomas, a staunch conservative, replaced Justice Thurgood Marshall, a staunch liberal.Appointing a liberal to fill Scalia’s seat would mean that five justices -- in other words, a majority -- are Democratic appointees. That would also be a milestone, as Andrew Koppelman, a law professor at Northwestern University, told The Huffington Post. ""The last liberal Supreme Court ended when Earl Warren resigned and Abe Fortas’ nomination to replace him collapsed and Fortas resigned, giving [former President Richard] Nixon two vacancies to fill in his first year in office,"" he said. ""We’d have a solid liberal majority for the first time since 1969.""Such a change could have profound consequences. It would likely mean a crucial fifth vote to protect the Voting Rights Act and abortion rights. It could also mean the court would be more supportive of efforts to regulate campaign contributions, greenhouse gas emissions and gun ownership. A fifth liberal vote could also result in more scrutiny of the death penalty.Of course, justices don’t always vote in the way that presidents anticipate they will. When former President George H.W. Bush in 1990 appointed Justice David Souter to replace Justice William Brennan, who was among the most influential liberal justices in history, Bush’s chief of staff promised that Souter would be a ""homerun"" for conservatives. But Souter didn’t line up with conservatives like Scalia and Thomas and, over time, became a reliably liberal vote -- providing a key vote to uphold abortion rights, for example.But Souter, whose prior service on the New Hampshire state Supreme Court hadn’t provided many clues about how he’d rule on national issues, may have been the last such appointment. Today both parties vet their appointees much more carefully. Conservatives actually adopted the motto ""No More Souters.""That doesn’t mean appointees always vote in ways that please the parties that appointed them; Chief Justice John Roberts has infuriated Republicans twice in the last few years by voting to uphold the Affordable Care Act, Obama’s signature domestic policy achievement. Overall, however, the justices that end up on the bench these days vote in the ways that the presidents who appointed them hoped.""There have been only four Democratic appointments total since 1967,"" David Strauss, a law professor at the University of Chicago, noted on Saturday. ""The Court moves slowly, but that kind of consistent pattern of appointments will definitely move it. … A Democratic majority could start a similar shift back in the other direction."""

But conservatives were already calling for Senate Republicans to block any nominee until Obama is out of office. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) also made clear that he wasn't going to go along with an Obama pick. ""This vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,"" he said.In other words, the 2016 election just got that much hotter and more intense. Even before Scalia's death, it was clear that Obama's successor would have a hand in shaping the makeup of the bench. Many of its most consequential cases are decided on a 5-4 basis, divided between the liberal and conservative wings -- with Justice Anthony Kennedy, who turns 80 in July, the deciding vote. Political observers have long speculated on potential retirements and the likelihood that the Supreme Court's ideological bent would shift.And on the campaign trail, the presidential candidates often speak what type of nominee they would choose if there is a vacancy, and what a high-stakes decision that would be.“We are one justice away from the Supreme Court concluding that nobody in this room and no American has an individual right to keep and bear arms,"" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said in January, warning what would happen if liberals make up a majority. ""We are one justice away from the Supreme Court striking down every restriction on abortion, and mandating unlimited abortion on demand, up until the time of birth, partial birth, with taxpayer funding, and no parental notification whatsoever.""Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R), another presidential candidate, has said he would not repeat the mistake of his father, former President George H.W. Bush, who picked David Souter for the court. Souter was supposed to be a conservative choice but often ended up voting with the liberal justices.""These picks are so important for the future of our country that if the next president gets to pick a Supreme Court justice they should pick someone -- I would pick someone -- with a proven judicial philosophy based on rulings and fight,"" he said in October. Donald Trump has said he wants justices who are ""smart, conservative and ... truly in love with the constitution.""Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) weighed in on Saturday and said the ""next president must nominate a justice who will continue Justice Scalia's unwavering belief in the founding principles that we hold dear.""On the Democratic side, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) often tells crowds that he would choose a nominee who is committed to overturning Citizens United. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a town hall forum this month that she wants justices who are ""rooted in the real world, who know that part of the genius of our system, both economic and government, is this balance of power,"" to ensure that it doesn't get ""too far out of whack, so that business has too much power, any branch of the government has too much power.""""You know one of the many reasons why we can’t turn the White House over to the Republicans again is because of the Supreme Court,"" she added.The presidential election isn't the only important contest. Right now, Republicans control the Senate, which is why they can threaten to hold up the president's nominee. But Democrats have a real chance at taking back the Senate in the 2016 elections, in which case they could help a Democratic president get nominations through -- or block a GOP president from doing so.The death of a sitting Supreme Court justice is extremely rare. Since Justice Robert Jackson died in 1954, only Chief Justice William Rehnquist passed away while still serving on the bench. Rehnquist, who was a Republican nominee, passed away during President George W. Bush's administration, so the makeup of the court did not change. Senate Democrats are already calling on their GOP colleagues to allow an Obama nominee to go through. ""The President can and should send the Senate a nominee right away. With so many important issues pending before the Supreme Court, the Senate has a responsibility to fill vacancies as soon as possible,"" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said. ""It would be unprecedented in recent history for the Supreme Court to go a year with a vacant seat. Failing to fill this vacancy would be a shameful abdication of one of the Senate's most essential Constitutional responsibilities.""According to the Congressional Research Service, since the Ford administration, it has taken the Senate an average of 2.2 months for Supreme Court nominees to get a floor vote after they're nominated.

It would also leave in legal limbo countless other cases Scalia and his clerks have worked on this term.Whomever Obama nominates will almost certainly be facing a long, drawn-out battle with near zero odds of confirmation in the Senate, making prospective nominees even harder for the administration to find. But there are some potential names currently considered to be on the president's shortlist.CNN legal analyst and New Yorker writer Jeffrey Toobin has his money on Judge Sri Srinivasan of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Obama fought to appoint the 47-year-old native of India to a seat on the D.C. Circuit court, and the Senate unanimously confirmed him in 2013. Srinivasan has joined liberal colleagues on the court in several cases, and seems to be of a similar ideological bent as Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.Esteemed court-watcher Tom Goldstein at SCOTUSblog argues that Paul Watford, who currently serves on the 9th Circuit, is the most likely choice. Goldstein makes the case that Watford, who is black, would add to Obama's legacy and help turn out a key Democratic constituency during the 2016 presidential election:No other black woman immediately comes to mind as a nominee, though I haven’t researched the question in some time. But there is an obvious black male: Paul Watford, an Obama appointee to the Ninth Circuit. Watford is in his late forties. He is well respected and reasonably well known in Democratic legal circles.A similar argument could be made for a Hispanic nominee. California Supreme Court Justice Mariano-Florentino ""Tino"" Cuéllar would fit the bill. Cuéllar previously served as an official in the Clinton and Obama administrations, and has a background in international law. At age 43, however, he would be one of the youngest Supreme Court nominees.Another potential nominee, according to Yahoo News' Olivier Knox, is Merrick Garland, the chief judge on the D.C. Circuit. Garland is a former high-ranking Justice Department official whose name was also considered for a seat on the Supreme Court after the retirement of Justice John Paul Stevens in 2010.Other possibilities on Obama's shortlist include several current and former officials in his Cabinet, including former Attorney General Eric Holder, current Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. All three officials would be even less likely to be confirmed due to the political nature of their duties.Solicitor General Don Verrilli successfully defended major parts of Obama's legacy on the court, including the Affordable Care Act and gay marriage, and is deeply popular with liberals in and out of the White House. But he, too, would face substantive resistance in the Senate. Another possibility is Georgetown Law professor Neal Katyal, who succeeded Kagan as acting solicitor general for one year.There is a chance Obama makes more of a consensus pick, a nominee who could appeal to moderate Senate Republicans. One such selection would be Judge Jane Kelly, who serves on the 8th Circuit. A moderate public defender from Iowa who graduated from Harvard Law in Obama's class, Kelly is beloved by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who chairs the crucial Senate Judiciary Committee. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), another member of the Judiciary Committee, suggested another candidate: ""someone like"" Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah). Hatch serves as the president pro tempore of the Senate and is the most senior senator among the GOP caucus."

Jeb is so wrong,” Trump said, before working in a jab at the audience who booed the comment.“You know what that is? That's Jeb's special interests and lobbyists talking,” he said. After garnering a second round of boos for a jab at Lindsay Graham’s poll numbers, he added, “I only tell the truth, lobbyists."" Trump and Bush later scuffled again over President George W. Bush’s foreign policy.“Obviously the war in Iraq was a big, fat mistake, all right?” Trump said, arguing that Jeb Bush took too long to reach the same conclusion.“Obviously, it was a mistake. George Bush made a mistake. We can make mistakes, but that one was a beauty. We should have never been in Iraq.”“Frankly, I could care less about the insults that Donald Trump gives to me,"" Bush replied. ""It's blood sport for him. He enjoys it, and I'm glad he's happy about it. He continued, “I'm sick and tired of him going after my family. My dad is the greatest man alive in my mind.”The audience again audibly sided with Bush, marking just the latest in a series of debate moments where Trump has incurred the hostility of attendees.At a rally in Manchester, N.H. on Monday, Trump told the crowd that the attendees are often well-connected people who can get tickets from the campaigns, such as lobbyists and deep-pocketed donors. Trump said that since he doesn't rely on these people, he doesn't always have the same base of support in the audience.As CNN’s Brian Stelter notes, he has something of a point:Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.Also on HuffPost:"

Those who do get casted for shows and presentations then have to deal with stylists who aren't trained to handle their kinkier tresses. No doubt this has played a significant role in the lack of diversity in the industry, but Texture on the Runway is one unique runway show where curls are embraced and the center of attention.Hosted by digital hair care platform TextureMedia, the show returned to New York City on Saturday after making its debut in 2012. And it's no coincidence that this event where women proudly flaunt their curls, waves and coils took place during New York Fashion Week. Michelle Breyer, the president and co-founder of TextureMedia, told The Huffington Post that Texture on the Runway provides a counterbalance to the lack of curls at a lot of shows.""I think it makes more of a statement to do it during a time when everyone is here and to tell the world what else is out there,"" she said. ""I've been to a couple of shows so far and I have seen amongst the straight hair some curly styles. But overall, it still is a very monolithic kind of look.""Hairstylists representing five major brands -- Garnier, Cantu, Au Naturale by Dark and Lovely, Creme of Nature and Design Essentials -- were tasked with creating fashion-forward looks to illustrate the versatility of curly hair and the overarching message that texture transcends ethnicity. Styles included tapered Afros, loose and silky curls, braided faux hawks and voluminous twist-outs. ""It is so refreshing to see stylists not fight against a model's natural texture,"" Breyer said.We are optimistic that this celebration of curls will continue to transform what we see on the runways, as well as change cultural standards of beauty that pressure women, men and children to straighten their curly hair.Check out the cool and creative curly hairstyles from the Texture on the Runway show below and stay tuned to HuffPost for more examples of diversity during New York Fashion Week.

Those who do get casted for shows and presentations then have to deal with stylists who aren't trained to handle their kinkier tresses. No doubt this has played a significant role in the lack of diversity in the industry, but Texture on the Runway is one unique runway show where curls are embraced and the center of attention.Hosted by digital hair care platform TextureMedia, the show returned to New York City on Saturday after making its debut in 2012. And it's no coincidence that this event where women proudly flaunt their curls, waves and coils took place during New York Fashion Week. Michelle Breyer, the president and co-founder of TextureMedia, told The Huffington Post that Texture on the Runway provides a counterbalance to the lack of curls at a lot of shows.""I think it makes more of a statement to do it during a time when everyone is here and to tell the world what else is out there,"" she said. ""I've been to a couple of shows so far and I have seen amongst the straight hair some curly styles. But overall, it still is a very monolithic kind of look.""Hairstylists representing five major brands -- Garnier, Cantu, Au Naturale by Dark and Lovely, Creme of Nature and Design Essentials -- were tasked with creating fashion-forward looks to illustrate the versatility of curly hair and the overarching message that texture transcends ethnicity. Styles included tapered Afros, loose and silky curls, braided faux hawks and voluminous twist-outs. ""It is so refreshing to see stylists not fight against a model's natural texture,"" Breyer said.We are optimistic that this celebration of curls will continue to transform what we see on the runways, as well as change cultural standards of beauty that pressure women, men and children to straighten their curly hair.Check out the cool and creative curly hairstyles from the Texture on the Runway show below and stay tuned to HuffPost for more examples of diversity during New York Fashion Week.

Nearly all reproductions of this quotation simply offer it as an undated, unsourced statement attributed to Stalin,” the Snopes authors write, noting that the quote ""doesn't really sound like something Stalin would have said, as its subtext is praise for the strengths of American patriotism, morality, and spiritual life.""This isn't the first time Carson referenced the fake Stalin quote or his only run-in with apocryphal statements. In a previous debate, Carson used his closing statement to misquote the preamble to the Constitution. His supporters also distributed a leaflet with an imaginary Alexis de Tocqueville saying on morality during last year's Conservative Political Action Conference.And Carson is far from the only offender. As MSNBC's Steve Benen pointed out last year, candidates this cycle have shared phony -- if pithy -- adages supposedly attributed to everyone from Thomas Jefferson to Patrick Henry."

The press referred to his 'energetic fervor,' 'astringent intellect,' 'peppery prose,' 'acumen,' and 'affability,' all apt descriptions. He was eminently quotable, his pungent opinions so clearly stated that his words never slipped from the reader’s grasp.Though the liberal Ginsburg and conservative Scalia frequently sparred over judicial matters, they shared a deep friendship and respect for each other's intellect and wit.Scalia wrote Ginsburg a touching tribute last year when she was honored as one of Time magazine's most influential people, calling her ""the high court's counterweight.""""Having had the good fortune to serve beside her on both courts, I can attest that her opinions are always thoroughly considered, always carefully crafted and almost always correct (which is to say we sometimes disagree). That much is apparent for all to see,"" he wrote in the magazine. ""What only her colleagues know is that her suggestions improve the opinions the rest of us write, and that she is a source of collegiality and good judgment in all our work.""Ginsburg often spoke highly of Scalia as well, praising his eloquence. Last year, she recalled the first time she heard him speak: ""I disagreed with most of what he said, but I loved the way he said it.""But she was never afraid to challenge her friend.""I love him, but sometimes I’d like to strangle him,” she once said.Even on the most contentious issues, they were always willing to have a little fun. After the court legalized gay marriage nationwide in 2015, a decision for which Scalia wrote a scathing dissenting opinion, he serenaded Ginsburg with a rendition of Bob Dylan's classic song ""The Times They Are A-Changin',"" she recounted. The two friends also shared meals and frequently celebrated New Year's Eve together. They parasailed in France and rode an elephant together in India.""Her feminist friends gave me a hard time because she rode behind me on the elephant,"" Scalia later recalled.They bonded over their mutual love of opera, frequently attending performances together. Their disagreements on the high court were dramatized in an opera called ""Scalia/Ginsburg,"" written by composer and lawyer Derrick Wang. Both justices reported highly enjoying it.Ginsburg's statement on Sunday referenced a passage from the opera in highlighting their unlikely bond.""Toward the end of the opera Scalia/Ginsburg, tenor Scalia and soprano Ginsburg sing a duet: 'We are different, we are one,' different in our interpretation of written texts, one in our reverence for the Constitution and the institution we serve,"" she said.""From our years together at the D.C. Circuit, we were best buddies. We disagreed now and then, but when I wrote for the Court and received a Scalia dissent, the opinion ultimately released was notably better than my initial circulation. Justice Scalia nailed all the weak spots -- the 'applesauce' and 'argle bargle' -- and gave me just what I needed to strengthen the majority opinion.""Years ago, Scalia chose Ginsburg when asked with whom he would want to be stranded on a desert island.""Well, there wasn't much competition,"" Ginsburg quipped when recalling the story last year.In the rare instances when the duo would appear together in public, they truly seemed to enjoy each other's company, treating audiences to their playful banter.""Call us the odd couple,"" Scalia said at an event last year. ""She likes opera, and she's a very nice person. What's not to like? Except her views on the law.""Also on HuffPost:"

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) is elected president in November, remember this Sunday as the day he said he wouldn't try to get the Senate to confirm a Supreme Court justice in his last year in office. Rubio, who was making the rounds on the Sunday talk shows the morning after he debated his five opponents for the nomination, was pressed repeatedly on how he could justify the argument he and his Senate GOP colleagues were making. The Senate, that argument goes, should not act on President Barack Obama's planned nomination of a justice to replace Antonin Scalia, who was found dead Saturday. Republicans have tried to distinguish Obama's position from that of former President Ronald Reagan, who had his Supreme Court nominee, Justice Anthony Kennedy, confirmed in February of 1988, the last year of Reagan's second term. But Rubio told George Stephanopoulos on ABC's ""This Week"" that he would ""recognize... that precedent that's been set over the last 80 years"" and not put a justice on the bench if he, as president, is not going to be held accountable for his pick at the ballot box. STEPHANOPOULOS: So if you're elected president, will you promise not to make an appointment in your final year?Rubio told Chris Wallace on ""Fox News Sunday"" that ""if this was early in [Obama's] second term, that would be one thing,"" and that ""perhaps this would be a different discussion"" if Obama were nominating a justice three or four months ago. Rubio's logic was echoed by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), one of his rivals for the nomination. Cruz told NBC's Chuck Todd, who hosts ""Meet the Press,"" that the Senate does not have an obligation ""to at least go through the process and have an up or down vote"" on Obama's nominee. ""It has been 80 years since a Supreme Court vacancy was nominated and confirmed in an election year,"" Cruz said.The distinction the Republican candidates appear to be making is that a president should not be able to nominate AND confirm a Supreme Court Justice, since Reagan nominated Kennedy in November of 1987 but had him confirmed in 1988. ""There is a long tradition that you don't do this in an election year,"" Cruz explained. ""And what this means, Chuck, is we ought to make the 2016 election a referendum on the Supreme Court. I cannot wait to stand on that debate stage with Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders and talk about what the Supreme Court will look like depending on who wins.""Also on HuffPost:"

This was exemplified Sunday by Ohio Gov. John Kasich saying that it would be ""a big mistake"" for the United States to use troops to try to depose the country's leader, President Bashar Assad. In the GOP's primary debate Saturday evening in South Carolina, Kasich interrupted an argument between businessman Donald Trump and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush about whether it was a mistake for President George W. Bush to invade Iraq, saying that their dispute was ""nuts.""In an attempt to clarify where the candidate stands on intervention abroad, NBC's Chuck Todd of ""Meet the Press"" asked Kasich on Sunday whether it was ""the right call"" for the U.S. to intervene in the civil wars in Bosnia and Lebanon in the 1980s and '90s. Kasich did not address Bosnia but said he voted against the intervention in Lebanon as a congressman, throwing in a criticism of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for the ""terrible mistake"" of going into Libya in 2011 to protect civilians from then-leader Muammar Gaddafi. KASICH: You know, frankly, that's something that people ought to be thinking about in regard to Hillary. You know, they talk about Benghazi, which is very legitimate. Of course it is. But we should never have deposed Gaddafi. That was a terrible mistake. The guy was working with us. And now, we've created chaos in that country. Look, I was not in favor of U.S. troops in Lebanon. And I voted against it. Even when Reagan wanted them there. Tip O'Neill wanted them there. Then when they got blown up, Tip was out blaming Reagan. And I never forget it. You know, since the sixth century, Sunni and Shiite have been fighting. And we want to get in the middle of that, it makes no sense. Kasich has previously called for sending U.S. ground troops to Syria and for a no-fly zone in the country to protect civilians. He has also said that ""it is not our job to try to get Sunni and Shiite ... to live together peacefully"" and that it's ""not our job to nation-build them."" His views on forced regime change in Syria put him in the same camp as Trump, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R) and Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). In contrast, Bush said during the debate that ""we need to destroy ISIS and dispose of Assad to create a stable Syria so that the 4 million refugees aren’t a breeding ground for Islamic jihadists."" ""We need to create a coalition, Sunni-led coalition on the ground with our special operators to destroy ISIS and bring about stability. And you can’t do that with Assad in power,"" Bush said Saturday. Florida Sen.

Todd asked Kasich whether this policy of obstruction was risky, since a Democratic candidate could win in November and nominate a more liberal justice if the Democrats also win back the Senate. ""Well, but that's life,"" Kasich said. ""I mean, you know, then the people actually have had some say. It's really kind of a unique thing when you think about it, Chuck.

""None of us have been able to find any instance where before the invasion you came out against this war,"" Todd told Trump, who has asserted repeatedly on the campaign trail, in several debates and in numerous TV interviews that he was publicly against the invasion. “If you look at 2003, there are articles,"" Trump responded. ""If you look at 2004, there are articles.""Just hours before Trump's appearance on ""Meet the Press,"" CNN's John King said on ""Inside Politics"" that he couldn't find any such articles, either. “Donald Trump repeated again last night in the debate that he was an early opponent of the Iraq war. Simply not the case,” King said during a journalist roundtable. “If you go back and look through time in 2003, before the war, there’s no public record of Trump saying ‘Don’t do this,'"" King continued. ""There is, in 2004, after the war was going south, he became very vocal in saying Bush was mangling the administration of the war. But he keeps saying that he was out there vocally before the war. Mr. Trump, if there’s a public record, send it on in. We’d love to see it. But it doesn’t exist if you go looking for it.”Todd and King aren't alone, as several outlets, including this one, have failed to find evidence Trump publicly opposed the war before the March 19, 2003, invasion. His campaign has yet to produce such evidence. The Huffington Post reported in September that there was no support for Trump’s claim and noted that a Reuters article the real estate developer frequently cited to back up his assertion was published in July 2004 -- more than 16 months after the U.S invaded Iraq. But Trump's claim continued to go unchallenged in TV interviews, as HuffPost pointed out the following month. On Saturday night, Trump claimed for at least the fourth time during a Republican debate this cycle that he was against the Iraq invasion. ""I'm the only one on the stage that said, 'Do not go into Iraq. Do not attack Iraq,'"" Trump said. “Nobody else on this stage said that. And I said it loud and strong. And I was in the private sector. I wasn't a politician, fortunately. But I said it. And I said it loud and clear.”It's true that Trump said at a 2003 Oscars party shortly after the invasion that the war was a “mess.” And he was a vocal critic of Bush in the summer of 2004.But Trump’s remark in September that there were “25 different stories” backing up his Iraq War opposition, and Saturday night's contention that his criticism was ""loud and clear"" before the invasion, are unfounded. BuzzFeed, The Washington Post’s “Fact-checker"" and Politifact have all been unable to find evidence to back up Trump's claim. Despite fact-checks being available for months, TV interviewers -- who've had dozens of opportunities to challenge Trump's persistent claim -- largely failed to do so.CNN's Jake Tapper appears to be only TV journalist who previously raised the issue directly, though Trump didn't acknowledge any inconsistency. TRUMP: No, no, no. You don't make that kind of success without judgment. Don't forget this, I was against the war in Iraq. I told everybody. You have all the documents.While it's good to see Todd raise the issue with Trump directly on ""Meet the Press,"" the Republican candidate again made the same unsupported claim on another Sunday show. Trump told ABC News ""This Week"" host George Stephanopoulos that he was ""the only one on the stage who said, 'Don't go into Iraq.'""The host didn't follow up.Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

""They lied,"" Trump said during the CBS News GOP presidential debate. ""They said there were weapons of mass destruction. There were none. And they knew there were none. There were no weapons of mass destruction.""Trump has been outspoken about his dislike of the war in Iraq (though he's fudged the facts about how early he was publicly speaking out against it). But his comments Saturday night went a step beyond his usual critique. Even Republican skeptics of the war argue that Bush acted with good intentions, so the fact that the Republican frontrunner is the one making the charge is remarkable. ""We spent $2 trillion, thousands of lives. ... Obviously, it was a mistake,"" Trump said. ""George Bush made a mistake. We can make mistakes. But that one was a beauty. We should have never been in Iraq. We have destabilized the Middle East.""Jeb Bush has also called the war was a mistake -- although it took him a while to do so. Still, he has vehemently defended his brother for keeping America safe. ""I'm sick and tired of Barack Obama blaming my brother for all of the problems that he's had,"" the former Florida governor said Saturday. ""And frankly, I could care less about the insults that Donald Trump gives to me. ... I am sick and tired of him going after my family.""Trump pointed out, as he has in the past, that the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks happened on George W. Bush's watch. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) chimed in that he's just happy Bush was in the White House on 9/11 instead of Democrat Al Gore, adding that he too believes Bush kept America safe. ""How did he keep us safe when the World Trade Center came down? I lost hundreds of friends,"" Trump replied. ""The World Trade Center came down during the reign of George Bush. He kept us safe? That is not safe,"" he said, to boos from the audience.""The World Trade Center came down because Bill Clinton didn't kill Osama bin Laden when he had the chance to kill him,"" Rubio shot back.Trump said Bush also had the chance to kill bin Laden but didn't. The popularity of George W. Bush will be tested in the coming days, as he heads to South Carolina to campaign for his younger brother Monday. Polls show that Trump has a sizable lead in the run-up to Saturday's primaries in South Carolina.Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.Also on HuffPost:"

McConnell ""is right that the American people should have a voice in the selection of the next Supreme Court justice,” Warren wrote. “In fact, they did -- when President Obama won the 2012 election by five million votes.”The clause in the constitution empowering the president to name Supreme Court justices -- Article II, Section 2 -- does not include an exception for when the president only has one year left in office, Warren noted.Of course, McConnell himself has acknowledged as much in the past, since he voted to confirm Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy in 1988, the last year of Reagan’s presidency.Warren’s post had been shared more than 75,000 times as of noon on Sunday.Also on HuffPost:"
