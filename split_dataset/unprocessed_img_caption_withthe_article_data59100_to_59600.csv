0,POLITICS,Union Representing Laid-Off Carrier Workers Endorses Bernie Sanders,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/carrier-union-endorse-bernie-sanders_us_571689c3e4b0060ccda4a2ba,"In a viral video, the workers learned their jobs are headed to Mexico. They're not huge fans of NAFTA.",2016-04-19,Bernie Sanders' latest endorsement comes from a group of Indiana workers.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57168a0e1600002b0031c192.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The union representing the Indiana workers slated to be laid off by Carrier Corp. has endorsed Bernie Sanders for president, the Sanders campaign announced Tuesday.The Carrier workers found themselves in the national spotlight after a video emerged in February that showed a company executive informing them that their jobs were going to Mexico. Since then, the Carrier story has worked its way into the stump speeches of presidential candidates on both the left and the right, as they have pilloried the company for its plans to offshore 2,100 jobs.Workers at the plant are represented by the United Steelworkers Local 1999, based in Indianapolis. Kelly Hugunin, a business representative for the union, told The Huffington Post that the union's executive board first made the recommendation to endorse Sanders. Membership then approved the move at its last monthly meeting. (Their international union, the United Steelworkers, headquartered in Pittsburgh, has not endorsed any candidate yet.)Hugunin said the union decided to back Sanders because of his consistency in opposing trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, which removed trade barriers between the U.S. and Mexico.""His position on trade has been consistent over the years,"" Hugunin said. ""He was a pretty staunch opponent to NAFTA, which, in our opinion, has cost us a lot of manufacturing jobs here and across the country.""Hugunin said the union felt Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, wasn't as dependable on their primary issue. Her husband, Bill Clinton, signed NAFTA, and the candidate herself hesitated before coming out against the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the mammoth trade deal that the union opposes, according to Hugunin.And the union also looked closely at the GOP front-runner, Donald Trump. The real estate magnate has made trade deals a focus of his campaign, and he's shamed Carrier repeatedly while on the hustings -- something the union has really appreciated. But in the end, the union didn't feel Trump's policies added up.""There are some Trump supporters out there in the membership,"" Hugunin said. ""We're grateful that he's making an issue of Carrier and talking about trade, but he's got a mixed message. He says he's gonna tax Carrier on their product coming back into the state; we don't see how that's even possible to do that without a lot of changes to the [law]. Also his position, he's said before, is that he believes American workers make too much money.""Also,"" he added, ""some of his own product lines are made in China."""

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Marly Arevalo, 21, has been outside the Supreme Court many times. She lives about 30 minutes away, in Riverdale, Maryland, and often participates in rallies with the immigrant rights group CASA de Maryland. Monday morning, she stepped inside the Supreme Court building for the first time, to hear attorneys and the justices debate legal standing and executive authority. The arguments also were about her. Arevalo came to the U.S. from Guatemala when she was 15 with her mother, father and two siblings. All of them are undocumented. She and her siblings would be eligible for one of President Barack Obama's immigration policy plans currently on hold due to a lawsuit now before the Supreme Court. She was one of a number of undocumented immigrants who went to the Supreme Court for Monday's oral arguments. Most rallied outside the building. A few, like Arevalo, got to see the court in action. A lawyer representing three undocumented mothers, unable to travel from Texas, received 10 minutes to argue for the Obama policy. The three, in turn, represent nearly 4 million undocumented immigrants who would be eligible for temporary work authorization and relief from deportation concerns under programs Obama announced in 2014.The court is considering whether Obama overstepped his authority by announcing plans to create the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents program, or DAPA, and expand the existing Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA -- and whether Texas and other states have standing to sue the federal government over them. Arevalo said she was anxious before the arguments, and left the courtroom unsure of what would happen. If the Supreme Court sides with the federal government, she hopes to be eligible for the expanded DACA program so she can become a social worker. ""I feel more motivated to keep advocating and participating, to fight for my rights and the rights of other families,"" Arevalo said.More than 30 undocumented mothers who would benefit from DAPA participated in a 48-hour fast outside the Supreme Court, praying that the justices see the case the way they did. Maria de Lourdes Reboyoso, a member of the group Mujeres Unidas y Activas, came from San Francisco for the hearing and took part in the fast, although she did not go inside the court. She is undocumented and has four children ranging in age from 19 to 28, two of whom are U.S. citizens. ""I came here because this was very important for me, for my family and for more than 5 million families,"" Reboyoso said afterward in Spanish, through an interpreter.Elia Rosas, who would be eligible for DAPA if it goes into effect, came to Washington from Dallas with her daughters. One of her daughters, Greisa Martinez, an advocate with the group United We Dream, said going inside felt like ""walking into history."" ""It was a mix of emotions because we didn't know whether they were going to approve or deny,"" Jocabet Martinez, another of Rosas' daughters, said. ""Either way, we're still going to fight for mothers and fathers."" Likely the youngest attendee was Sophie Cruz, a 6-year-old who delivered a letter to Pope Francis during his trip to the U.S. last year about her parents, who are both undocumented. Cruz and her sister are U.S. citizens, so her parents could be eligible for DAPA. She and her mother, Zoyla, attended the arguments. Sophie Cruz talked at a press conference afterward, after being lifted to the microphone by Jose Antonio Vargas, a journalist and immigration reform advocate who would be eligible for the expanded DACA program. Vargas also attended the arguments. ""We are united by a single mission: We want the same rights for all,"" Sophie Cruz said. ""I ask the judges to protect us children and all immigrants."" "
3,POLITICS,A Humble Suggestion To Make The Pulitzers Even Greater Again,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pulitzer-prizes-retroactive-award_us_5716874ae4b0018f9cbb65da,Foresight deserves recognition too.,2016-04-19,"Former Knight Ridder reporters Warren Strobel, left, and Jonathan Landay, right, were part of a team that got the run-up to the Iraq War right when so many other journalists got it wrong. So where's their Pulitzer?",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5716883c2200003600253ed1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Monday, journalists in newsrooms around the country gathered awkwardly together to celebrate the announcement of this year’s Pulitzer Prizes, which honored Lin-Manuel Miranda’s musical ""Hamilton,"" as well as a number of excellent works of journalism, but especially the musical ""Hamilton."" At last, ""Hamilton"" is getting some attention. This year’s honorees in the journalism category included a terrific investigation from the Associated Press that explored the role of slavery in our seafood supply chain; a massive Washington Post venture that documented police shootings nationwide; and the Los Angeles Times' coverage of the San Bernardino shootings. The New Yorker became the first magazine ever to win a Pulitzer for journalism with its study of the Cascadia fault line. The New York Times, which had traveled to Afghanistan to gather the stories of Afghan women, took the award for international reporting. The Tampa Bay Times stuck close to home to pick up a pair of accolades for investigative and local reporting. (Over here at The Huffington Post, we were bridesmaids for our investigation, by Jason Cherkis, into the heroin treatment industry. It was an honor to be at the wedding.)It was, in short, a pretty great snapshot of the journalism world. First-time wins for The New Yorker and The Marshall Project reflect the Pulitzer board's commitment to expanding the franchise and recognizing the excellent work of the present moment. But in some cases, it takes time to fully appreciate the importance of a work of journalism. Sometimes the true significance of things is only visible in hindsight. With that in mind, I submit that it’s time for the Pulitzers to take on the challenge of getting retrospective.There’s one example of unrecognized work that immediately comes to mind -- work so prescient that even those who created it didn’t fully recognize what they’d done at the time. In 2002, a group of reporters at Knight-Ridder (now McClatchy Newspapers) wrote a series of articles on the run-up to the disastrous Iraq War. These articles were, as The Huffington Post noted in 2008, “virtually alone in their questioning of the Bush Administration’s allegations of links between Saddam Hussein, weapons of mass destruction and international terrorism.” And to give you an idea of how difficult it was to be a dissenting voice back then, consider that the work in question often didn't earn the respect of many of the newspapers owned by Knight-Ridder, as reporter Jonathan Landay told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour in 2013. ""Lone holdout"" is a good word because even some of our newspapers -- we work for a chain of 30 newspapers. Even some of our own newspapers wouldn’t print our own stories. Why? Because they say it wasn’t in The Washington Post. They hadn’t seen it in The New York Times, so how could we, as Knight-Ridder journalists, have gotten the same thing? So it was very lonely. As The Washington Post’s media reporter Erik Wemple rightly states, “Every five years or so, around mid- to late March, Jonathan Landay and Warren Strobel should be media stars.”Alternatively, this could be the sort of journalism that becomes famous in mid- to late April. So let’s do it: Let’s add a category to the Pulitzer Prizes, one that involves looking back at previous years and re-evaluating the past in light of what's happened since then.What I’m suggesting here is that the Pulitzer board undertake a simple elongation of its window of perspective. The board should, on a yearly basis, take a look back at the journalism landscape and rediscover the work whose excellence it took time to reveal. Whether it’s a five-year window, a 10-year window or some other time frame, the exercise would be useful in recapturing the work that either missed the cut, or wasn’t on the radar, at the time the awards were distributed. It would be a great way of recognizing writers prescient enough to spot crises before they happened, writers who bucked trends when it was harrowing to do so, and writers who provided a foundation on which subsequent work could be built.Taking on this challenge would be of enormous, widespread benefit, especially to the journalists whose work was left behind by the arbitrariness of time.Interestingly enough, the Knight-Ridder reporters experienced no small amount of self-doubt as a result of having their work dismissed for so long. As Gilbert Cranberg, arguing in 2006 for a retroactive Pulitzer for the Knight-Ridder team at Nieman Watchdog, noted, Knight-Ridder bureau chief John Walcott didn’t submit his team’s work for Pulitzer consideration during the window in which it was actually produced:As Bureau Chief Walcott recalls it, ""I think we may not have submitted the '02 work because its merit wasn't clear until Bush attacked Iraq in March '03 and then the WMD never materialized. In other words, we may have lost out because we were so far ahead of the curve...""Cranberg went on to note that even if the Knight-Ridder team had submitted its work for consideration in 2002, it would have been “questionable how it would have been regarded” by those adjudicating the awards at the time, all of whom would have been influenced by the fashion of the moment. “Recall that this was a time when much of the press uncritically lauded Colin Powell's deeply flawed pro-war presentation to the U.N. Security Council,"" Cranberg wrote. ""The press, whether consciously or otherwise, reflected public opinion, which then strongly favored a war to oust Saddam.”It shouldn't count against a media organization to be ahead of its peers on an important story. By expanding its prize circle to include retroactive recognition, the Pulitzer board could encourage this sort of trend-bucking courage in coverage.And it could help to remap the media landscape in important, beneficial ways. As former Knight-Ridder reporter Warren Strobel told Amanpour in that same interview, the lack of recognition their work received had long-term effects on the media landscape: “I have to say, 10 years later, as it stands, we’re not exactly getting -- except for your kind invitation, you know, other people are talking about this, and they’re not necessarily the people who got it right.”Had the Pulitzers shed a little light on the efforts of these reporters, even years after the fact, it might have been an important and edifying corrective. It could have ensured that the right people got to keep telling the right story. (Consider this as well: After all these years, during which Knight-Ridder was absorbed by McClatchy, it has become much more difficult to find the Knight-Ridder team’s work online. It takes some dogged internet sleuthing if you want to actually read this coverage -- coverage that should shine above and beyond nearly all the other Iraq reporting from that time period.)This is not an attack on the Pulitzers' existing track record. And it’s not about issuing some sort of make-up call after the fact, as sometimes happens in the entertainment industry with “lifetime achievement awards"" and the like. The Pulitzers already have a mechanism for doing this, in the form of their Special Citations and Special Awards (which, as Cranberg notes, are as likely to go to authors and composers as to journalists). Prizes and plaudits like that are often mainly about letting the people handing out the accolades feel good about themselves.What I’m suggesting is that looking back on the media landscape of a bygone year become a task that the board undertakes as a matter of serious research -- really getting elbow-deep in it. It would be an experiment born of intellectual curiosity and a desire to do a public good -- the same impulses that lead people to create the work that the Pulitzers already recognize every year. And if people knew the Pulitzer board was looking for old work to make new, there'd be no shortage of amateur and professional critics offering up suggestions.The effort could lead anywhere -- including back to some of the original honorees. But it could also help recover greatness that gets lost in the shuffle of the everyday. It would shed light on work that may have previously looked slight by comparison, but which provided a strong foundation for further reporting or social change. And it would help reinforce the idea that journalism is practiced on a continuum, where the past informs the present to reveal salient facts about our lives. It’s the sort of thing that maybe only the Pulitzers could do.In the end, it’s all about asking a perennial question for reporters: What’d we miss? By leading an effort to look back on the ground already covered, the Pulitzers can help deepen our perspective, reward those who were ahead of their time and shine a light on the ways in which journalism can be vital and lasting. After all, if Lin-Manuel Miranda can get a Pulitzer for doing precisely this, maybe the Pulitzer board itself ought to give it a try.~~~~~Jason Linkins edits “Eat The Press” for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost politics podcast “So, That Happened.” Subscribe here, and listen to the latest episode below."

Bernie Sanders' (I-Vt.) campaign suggested the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign may have committed “serious apparent violations” of campaign finance law.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57169c142200002900253ef6.jpeg?ops=crop_0_810_5381_2777%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- State Democratic parties are ticked off that Bernie Sanders is characterizing fundraising arrangements they have with Hillary Clinton’s campaign as corrupt. A joint fundraising committee set up by Clinton's campaign, the Democratic National Committee and 32 state Democratic parties is essential to the survival of state party organizations, said state leaders, including some who said Sanders' complaints may be poisoning his supporters against Democrats. Sanders' campaign on Monday sent an open letter to the Democratic National Committee “to convey some extremely serious concerns” about the joint fundraising committee. The letter alleged the committee may have committed “serious apparent violations” of campaign finance laws by over-reimbursing the Clinton campaign.The committee, called the Hillary Victory Fund, can accept checks over $350,000 from individual donors; it raised $33 million in the first three months of 2016. Campaign finance experts have largely dismissed Sanders’ allegations, calling them “sour grapes,” and “less about legality and more about feeding into the Sanders’ campaign theme that Hillary Clinton is corrupt in her campaign finance dealings.” One expert told Think Progress that the fundraising committee appears “permissible but … offensive.”The Sanders campaign told The Washington Post it directed its letter to the DNC, rather than the Federal Election Commission, which would ostensibly investigate such claims, “as a first step.”Democratic organizations in Ohio and Virginia quickly weighed in on the spat, emphasizing that their fundraising agreements with the DNC and Clinton’s campaign provide vital financial support, since their activities don't tend to generate small-donor enthusiasm like Sanders’ campaign. Raymond Buckley, chair of New Hampshire’s Democratic Party, posted on Facebook that the joint fundraising committee “should not be used as a political football.”State parties said joint fundraising agreements like the one Clinton’s campaign has with the DNC help them because the mega-donors Clinton’s campaign can draw are, as Buckley put it, “out of reach of the average state party.”""Based upon past interviews and this new situation, I've become skeptical of Sen. Sanders' willingness to invest in building the infrastructure that is needed to win down-ballot races,” Rick Palacio, chair of the Colorado Democratic Party, told The Huffington Post.Palacio said the joint fundraising agreements have allowed his state party to hire organizers and staffers for voter registration and other outreach programs. “Politics is a team sport and Democratic politics needs to be more of a team right now than ever before, considering we have a minority in both the U.S. House and the Senate and all these legislatures around the country,” Palacio said. Democrats have complained that while Sanders has his own joint fundraising agreement with the DNC, he hasn't used it, even though the ""political revolution"" he advocates could only happen if more Democrats were elected to state legislatures and Congress. “We know all too well just having the White House isn’t enough to effect all of the change we need, especially here in Michigan, where the Republican Party holds unchecked power at the state level,” said Paul Kanan, the Michigan’s Democratic Party's press secretary. Some state party officials told HuffPost they fear Sanders' supporters won’t be interested in voting for down-ballot Democratic candidates in November if he tarnishes their reputations. “The victory fund arrangement is all standard procedure for modern campaigns -- Bernie could (and should) be doing this too if he wants to lead Democrats to victory this year,” a spokesman for a battleground state Democratic Party told HuffPost. He asked for anonymity to speak frankly about Sanders’ allegations against Clinton’s campaign and the DNC. “The tone of these attacks is troubling for us long-term because he's using his bully pulpit to turn his supporters against the Democratic Party.” Both presidential campaigns have tried to capitalize on the scuffle. The Sanders campaign made a fundraising appeal off its letter to the DNC 26 minutes after making the accusations. Clinton’s campaign fired back with two separate fundraising emails, calling the claims “irresponsible and poisonous” and “completely false.” Clinton’s campaign, which frequently highlights the work of state and local Democrats, suggested the dispute over how the funds for the committee are distributed reflects Sanders’ lack of interest in being the leader of the party. Sanders has said he decided to run as a Democrat to receive media coverage. He did send fundraising emails for three Democratic congressional candidates he has endorsed last week.“Instead of trying to convince the next generation of progressives that the Democratic Party is corrupt, Senator Sanders should stick to the issues and think about what he can do to help the Party he is seeking to lead,” Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said in a statement.

She schooled Senate Republicans intent on denying hearings for the president’s Supreme Court nominee, because it is a presidential election year.And her warm words for Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) candidacy have kept pundits wondering whether she will ever endorse a candidate in the Democratic primary.Now, Warren is training her fire on Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). The Massachusetts progressive seized on a Cruz campaign fundraising email in which Cruz touts the “sacrifices” he has made for his candidacy, including enduring personal attacks and severe reductions in family time and sleep.In a series of tweets, Warren lambasted Cruz for failing to support policies that would address the even greater stresses American families face due to economic circumstances not of their choosing. She cites Cruz’s opposition to providing paid family leave, affordable child care, increasing the minimum wage, and student debt relief, as well as his inflammatory remarks about minority groups, as examples of his hypocrisy.Read the full tweetstorm below:"

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the fossil fuel industry disputed the findings.Using revised methods to calculate emissions, the EPA reported Friday that the United States oil and gas industry releases 9.8 million metric tons of methane into the atmosphere each year. That’s 34 percent more methane than regulators previously estimated, according to the Environmental Defense Fund, which also researches and calculates emissions from oil and gas facilities.The new estimates put the oil and gas sector ahead of the agricultural industry as the leading source of methane emissions in the country. Methane emissions now account for 10.6 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S., per the report, up from 9.5 percent in 2013. ""That's simply too much climate pollution,"" Mark Brownstein, vice president of the EFD's climate and energy program, told The Huffington Post.Methane emissions have increased over the last decade, according to a recent study. While the cause of that rise is disputed, environmental scientists and activists have blamed oil and gas facilities, especially leaky ones, for the uptick. The EPA’s report confirms that view, experts say. “EPA is right to revise its numbers,” David Babson, a senior engineer at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told HuffPost. “It was under-representing emissions.”Methane is a potent greenhouse gas. Unburned, it packs 84 times more warming power than carbon dioxide for the first 20 years it’s in the atmosphere, according to the EDF. Methane emissions come mainly from leaks at processing and storage facilities, rather than from gas-fired electricity production.Despite its warming potential, natural gas production has grown in recent years. Thanks in part to the fracking boom, energy producers are trading coal-fired power plants for facilities that run on cleaner natural gas. That could be good news for the climate, according to supporters of the switch, since burning natural gas releases about half as much carbon dioxide as coal does. But widespread methane leaks at oil and gas facilities threaten to erase gains made by swapping coal for gas-fired power plants. “It looks like the bridge fuel we thought would carry us to renewables is actually a lot worse than we thought,"" Babson said. “This highlights the need to more rapidly transition from fossil fuels to renewables.”A representatives from the major trade organization for oil and gas producers called the EPA's report ""flawed.""""We're concerned the administration is putting politics ahead of science"" Kyle Isakower, vice president of regulatory and economic policy at the American Petroleum Institute, told reporters in a conference call Tuesday. Isakower said that methane emissions from the industry decreased substantially over the last year. He also claimed that the EPA's new estimates are “not an accurate reflection of science or reality.” Babson said API's argument simply isn't backed up by science. ""The new EPA numbers refute the argument made by the oil and gas sector that methane emissions are declining,"" Babson said. ""That simply has not been borne out by the evidence.""For Brownstein, the question of whether the amount of methane emissions went up or down last year is largely beside the point. ""I think it diverts attention away form the fundamental fact that you have 9.8 million metric tons of methane coming from the industry,"" he said. In response to API’s claim that the new EPA estimates might be politically motivated, Brownstein said, ""It’s kind of astonishing to me that API would champion getting better field data on the one hand and balk when the [EPA] actually learns from the science that’s been done and revises their methodology accordingly.""President Obama has committed to slashing methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by between 40 and 45 percent by 2025. But the EPA’s report underscores the urgent need for regulators to adopt stricter rules for oil and gas facilities, experts said.""There's plenty of evidence that these emissions can be effectively and cost-effectively reduced,"" Brownstein said. ""The only question now is when do we get the right set of regulations in place at the state and federal level.""New regulations should impose tough standards on the fossil fuel industry, regardless of how such measures would affect producers, Babson said. ""They can choose how to invest to meet the requirements or they can get out of the business."""

That’s 34 percent more methane than regulators previously estimated, according to the Environmental Defense Fund, which also researches and calculates emissions from oil and gas facilities.The new estimates put the oil and gas sector ahead of the agricultural industry as the leading source of methane emissions in the country. Methane emissions now account for 10.6 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S., per the report, up from 9.5 percent in 2013. ""That's simply too much climate pollution,"" Mark Brownstein, vice president of the EFD's climate and energy program, told The Huffington Post.Methane emissions have increased over the last decade, according to a recent study. While the cause of that rise is disputed, environmental scientists and activists have blamed oil and gas facilities, especially leaky ones, for the uptick. The EPA’s report confirms that view, experts say. “EPA is right to revise its numbers,” David Babson, a senior engineer at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told HuffPost. “It was under-representing emissions.”Methane is a potent greenhouse gas. Unburned, it packs 84 times more warming power than carbon dioxide for the first 20 years it’s in the atmosphere, according to the EDF. Methane emissions come mainly from leaks at processing and storage facilities, rather than from gas-fired electricity production.Despite its warming potential, natural gas production has grown in recent years. Thanks in part to the fracking boom, energy producers are trading coal-fired power plants for facilities that run on cleaner natural gas. That could be good news for the climate, according to supporters of the switch, since burning natural gas releases about half as much carbon dioxide as coal does. But widespread methane leaks at oil and gas facilities threaten to erase gains made by swapping coal for gas-fired power plants. “It looks like the bridge fuel we thought would carry us to renewables is actually a lot worse than we thought,"" Babson said. “This highlights the need to more rapidly transition from fossil fuels to renewables.”A representatives from the major trade organization for oil and gas producers called the EPA's report ""flawed.""""We're concerned the administration is putting politics ahead of science"" Kyle Isakower, vice president of regulatory and economic policy at the American Petroleum Institute, told reporters in a conference call Tuesday. Isakower said that methane emissions from the industry decreased substantially over the last year. He also claimed that the EPA's new estimates are “not an accurate reflection of science or reality.” Babson said API's argument simply isn't backed up by science. ""The new EPA numbers refute the argument made by the oil and gas sector that methane emissions are declining,"" Babson said. ""That simply has not been borne out by the evidence.""For Brownstein, the question of whether the amount of methane emissions went up or down last year is largely beside the point. ""I think it diverts attention away form the fundamental fact that you have 9.8 million metric tons of methane coming from the industry,"" he said. In response to API’s claim that the new EPA estimates might be politically motivated, Brownstein said, ""It’s kind of astonishing to me that API would champion getting better field data on the one hand and balk when the [EPA] actually learns from the science that’s been done and revises their methodology accordingly.""President Obama has committed to slashing methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by between 40 and 45 percent by 2025. But the EPA’s report underscores the urgent need for regulators to adopt stricter rules for oil and gas facilities, experts said.""There's plenty of evidence that these emissions can be effectively and cost-effectively reduced,"" Brownstein said. ""The only question now is when do we get the right set of regulations in place at the state and federal level.""New regulations should impose tough standards on the fossil fuel industry, regardless of how such measures would affect producers, Babson said. ""They can choose how to invest to meet the requirements or they can get out of the business."""

Teaming up with local LGBT rights advocates Brandiilyne Magnum-Dear and Kaylee Bradshaw, the lead singer of the '80s pop band, The Go-Go's, wrote a letter to Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant condemning the state's ""Religious Liberty Accommodations Act,"" or House Bill 1523. The bill, which Bryant signed into law April 5, promises that the state government will protect citizens who cite their religious beliefs in denying services to LGBT people. This includes those who refuse to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.Carlisle, 57, posted the full text of the letter she wrote to Bryant on her official Facebook page. In a cheeky nod to her hit 1987 song, ""Heaven Is a Place on Earth,"" the singer said that the governor and his supporters were making Mississippi ""hell on earth"" for many of the state's residents. The singer said she'd considered canceling her April 23 concert at Biloxi's IP Casino Resort and Spa because of the law. Instead, she vowed to move forward with the show in an effort to ""speak the truth"" of Magnum-Dear and Bradshaw, as well as other activists in Mississippi ""who are resilient and loving and brave."" She also pointed to her openly gay son, James Duke Mason, and said she couldn't ""imagine anything less Christian"" than using the new law ""as a weapon against others."" ""Because of my career as a performer and the privilege that has brought to our family, my son will be all right, but the pain you're causing LGBTQ Mississippians is devastating,"" she wrote. ""Especially the transgender folks and LGBTQ people of color who will be most directly impacted by these attacks.""Carlisle joins a growing list of celebrities in speaking out against the law. Earlier this month, rocker Bryan Adams announced that he was calling off his April 14 performance at the Mississippi Coast Coliseum ""in solidarity with all my LGBT friends.""Meanwhile, Bruce Springsteen and Pearl Jam have scrapped shows in North Carolina over the state's House Bill 2, which similarly harbors discriminatory practices toward the LGBT community.

13,BUSINESS,Donald Trump Is Mysteriously Quiet On Hedge Funds All Of A Sudden,Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-hedge-funds-new-york_us_57168f24e4b0060ccda4a9bc,"Maybe it's ""crass political calculation.""",2016-04-19,Because Trump really wants to win the New York primary -- and the GOP nomination.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/571692551600002b0031c1a0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- Donald Trump was full of bluster and vitriol when he talked about the financial industry eight months ago. He accused hedge funds of using the tax code to ""[get] away with murder.""Trump's bare-bones tax plan called for eliminating the carried interest loophole, which lowers the taxes of super-rich private equity investors by billions of dollars a year.""They're paying nothing. And it's ridiculous,"" Trump said on CBS’ ""Face the Nation"" in August. “Half of them, look, they're energetic, they're very smart, but a lot of them, it's like they're paper pushers. They make a fortune, they pay no tax. It's ridiculous, OK?”But as Trump turned to campaigning in the center of the financial world leading up to the New York primary, his anti-Wall Street rhetoric all but ceased.And it worked. Trump won New York’s primary handily on Tuesday.The shift was “a crass political calculation based on the industries that are in and around New York City,"" Rick Tyler, a former spokesman for rival candidate Ted Cruz, told HuffPost.“He can’t be in midtown Manhattan launching attacks on hedge funds and not expect that to have a negative effect on him,” said Doug Heye, the former head of communications for the Republican National Committee.Trump's silence could also be financially savvy. Longer-term, he might not be able to afford to impugn Wall Street. The GOP front-runner says he self-funding his campaign, but everything from the “donate” button on his campaign website to his fundraising filings with the Federal Election Commission show this isn’t entirely true. Most of his personal wealth is illiquid -- locked up in real estate and business ventures -- so even if he wanted to fund his campaign all by himself, it’d be tough. He’s also pledged to take no money from super PACs, which cuts out millions of dollars in potential support. Trump is going to have to raise a lot more money if he ends up the Republican Party nominee, and that means asking for checks from Wall Street or reversing his super PAC pledge. Either way, ""he's going to do a complete flip-flop on the idea that he isn't bought and paid for,"" Tyler said.But raising money from financiers after he’s attacked them won’t be as easy as running in favor of New York values in New York. “If you’re a hedge fund guy in New York and Trump has attacked you and staked out extreme, nonsensical positions on issues you care about, are you going to raise money for Donald Trump?” Heye asked. “Not likely.”Someone also has to actually ask for the money from Wall Street donors. But Trump has no real fundraising apparatus -- he doesn't have a finance team or even a finance chair. As Heye noted, “those aren’t things that necessarily come from scratch."" Of course, logic and strategic thinking only get you so far in analyzing Trump. And his campaign did not respond to a request for comment.Trump has charted the course of his presidential run using a “feedback loop he has been so good at cultivating,"" Republican messaging consultant Michael Maslansky said. ""He is constantly trying out new material. ... He ties everything to his master narrative around making America great again. But what goes under that changes. When he gets the right kind of reinforcement, he sticks with it. If it isn't driving the conversation around him, he moves on.”And deploring tax exemptions for certain types of investment funds just doesn’t have the same visceral appeal as inciting violence and spewing xenophobia.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Above, Ferguson residents attend a meeting of the city council on Feb. 2. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ST. LOUIS -- A federal judge on Tuesday approved a deal between the city of Ferguson and the Justice Department that aims to end the patterns of unconstitutional policing and municipal court practices that helped spark unrest in the St. Louis suburb following the police killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown in August 2014.U.S. District Judge Catherine Perry signed off on the consent decree after hearing from supporters and opponents of the deal for several hours at the federal courthouse. While the vast majority of speakers either supported the deal or wanted aspects of the consent decree strengthened, a number of Ferguson residents indicated they still didn’t recognize the legitimacy of the complaints of residents in the majority-black city that were recognized in the DOJ report. One white Ferguson resident claimed the federal government had “empowered the criminal element” in the city.Christy Lopez of the Justice Department said the department's year-and-a-half-long investigation of the Ferguson Police Department and municipal court system found the narrative that law-abiding citizens didn’t have to worry about the police to be “false,” and spoke about the patterns of unconstitutional conduct that federal investigators had identified.The report, based in part on emails and documents provided by the city, found that Ferguson officials had worked together to increase the city’s revenues through increased fines and fees that had no connection to public safety. Federal investigators also uncovered racist emails sent and received by high-ranking officials in Ferguson and regular violations of the civil rights of the city’s residents, particularly those living in the African-American parts of the city.“We want Ferguson to be known for how it responded to this crisis,” said Lopez, saying the Justice Department was interested in helping “bring about systemic change” in the city.The consent decree was first announced in January and was the product of several months of negotiations between the city and federal authorities, who over a year ago delivered their report on widespread policing abuses.Many speakers pointed out that the problems identified in the Ferguson report were not unique to the city and were present in many municipalities in St. Louis County that heavily rely upon fines and fees to keep their governments afloat. Lopez said the DOJ can’t “blanket all of St. Louis County,” but said it was better to address the problem than say nothing at all.Vanita Gupta, the head of the Civil Rights Division, said in a statement that the Justice Department “is looking forward to working with the city of Ferguson as it implements the decree and continues the essential work to create a police department that the Constitution requires and that residents deserve.”While some residents complained that the process wasn’t transparent, Lopez said the Justice Department would be able to proactively provide more information moving forward. Judge Perry said it was helpful to hear from the public and that the agreement would be an effective path forward.“Give this a chance to work, and I hope it will work,” Perry said. “It’s a good first step.”Mariah Stewart reported from St. Louis. Ryan J. Reilly reported from Washington, D.C."

Although Barney says she did not report what happened to BYU, the school contacted her in late November after getting a copy of a police report related to her case. In an email obtained by HuffPost, the school told Barney the police report provided ""information that you have engaged in behavior that violates the BYU Honor Code."" The Mormon-owned school has a notoriously strict code of conduct that requires chastity, ""clean language,"" and abstaining from drugs, alcohol, tobacco, tea and coffee, among other things. Barney says the school has not disclosed what rule she broke, but has nonetheless placed her on academic hold, meaning she can't register for classes and will either have to leave or allow the school to conduct a formal review over the alleged honor code violation. According to court records, BYU obtained a copy of Barney's police report because Edwin Randolph, a sheriff's deputy and a former women's track coach at BYU, provided it to the school without Barney's consent or knowledge.It's unclear why Randolph would do this. Prosecutors claim he was friends with Seidu, the alleged assailant, and accused him in February of handing over the case file in order to get Barney punished by her school. The charges of witness retaliation were later dropped.Randolph's attorney has denied that Randolph was friends with Seidu and released a statement on Friday saying the sheriff's deputy did not intend to punish Barney. According to the statement, Randolph actually wanted BYU to investigate male athletes for honor code violations or for victimizing women. Yet Barney told HuffPost there's nothing in her case file relating to athletes. She also said Seidu lied about his age, claiming he was 26, which led her to believe the assault was premeditated and prompted her to file a police report. Attorneys for Randolph did not respond to The Huffington Post's multiple requests for comment this week.Meanwhile, Barney says BYU will not let her withdraw from certain classes unless she answers a series of questions about the assault -- something she can’t currently do because she’s not supposed to talk about the details of her case until after the criminal trial is over. ""I've been looking for help with withdrawing from classes and they're saying they can't prove that a rape happened, so they can't provide the services they would provide to a rape victim,"" she said. Barney plans to transfer out of BYU. Withdrawing from classes she struggled with during the criminal investigation would help protect her GPA. The school said Monday it would review its policies and procedures on honor code violations involving sexual assault cases. The Department of Education currently has 221 investigations open at 175 colleges and universities to determine whether schools violated the gender equity law Title IX in their handling of sexual assault on campus. _______Tyler Kingkade is a national reporter who covers higher education and sexual violence, and is based in New York.

During a Tuesday appearance on ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show,"" Spade hilariously recounted his ""buzzed"" experience meeting the star.The actor admitted he was starstruck by Adele, a feeling that doesn't come often for him, and swore he wouldn't introduce himself. But after a few drinks (some ""loud mouth soup""), Spade was ready to say hello it's me. But first, he had to get past the singer's bodyguard. ""I don’t want to just bust in so I do the procedure where I walk up, and he’s like, 'And you are?' And then I go, 'Hey, can I go talk to Adele? I’m sort of a medium star,' you know, whatever,"" Spade said, before he made his grand entrance.The actor said he didn't use the ""Hello"" line (from Adele's hit song, like we all would've) but led with a crazed ""Wazzuppppp,"" with his tongue out. It only got more awkward from there.""I talked to her and she was very sweet,"" Spade said. ""Oh she goes, 'I’m playing the Staples Center in August.' And I go, 'Oooh, that whole month is tough for me.' She invites me and I don’t even know what I’m saying, because I’m a little loopy, you know, buzzed.""As the audience (and Ellen) roared with laughter, Spade said he kept talking to the star and definitely overstayed his welcome. ""[As I was leaving] I said, 'Hey let’s do this at my house next time. I have a huge backyard,'"" the actor admitted before shouting to the audience, ""'What am I talking about? Why am I saying this? I was probably there four minutes too long."" Let's just hope the next time Spade sees the singer -- whether it's at the Staples Center or in his backyard -- things go a little smoother. "

Trump exclaimed to huge cheers from the audience downtown at the First Niagara Center, where police estimated the crowd to be over 11,000 people.The seeds of Trump's current presidential bid took root at least as far back as 2014. That year, he submitted a bid to buy the Buffalo Bills. He wasn't the most popular suitor, but he did seem better than Bon Jovi, who was looking to move the beloved team to Toronto. Trump's bid fell short (as did Bon Jovi's), and the rest is history.""[I]f I bought the Buffalo Bills, I probably would not be doing what I'm doing now, which is much more important,"" Trump told Sports Illustrated last year. Trump played up his ties to the city and the team at Monday's raucous rally, getting a high-profile endorsement from Bills coach Rex Ryan, who introduced Trump. ""With this great great coach, you're going to have an unbelievable team this year, and I'm going to be rooting for the Buffalo Bills!"" Trump promised. In other words, stick with him and not only will he make America great again, but he'll make the Bills great again, too. Although the city of Buffalo is solidly Democratic, the surrounding suburbs and rural areas lean conservative -- and the region is one of the most racially segregated in the country. It's the area represented by Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), who was the first member of Congress to endorse Trump. It's also home to real estate developer and former gubernatorial candidate Carl Paladino, who is basically the Trump of Buffalo in both personality and politics. Both men spoke at Monday's rally. Drive just outside the city and it’s rare to spot yard signs for anyone but Trump, whose message on the economy has resonated with workers in this blue-collar area. There are also still plenty of signs calling for repeal of the SAFE Act, a state gun control law passed in response to the Sandy Hook massacre in 2013. When he wasn't touting the greatness of Buffalo at Monday's rally, Trump focused on the trade deals he argues have cost America jobs, and, of course, the need to build a wall on the border with Mexico -- probably his most famous line by now. Trump also focused his fire on Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), whose social conservative politics aren't especially popular in New York state; polls show that he could come in third, behind Trump and Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R). ""Lyin' Ted Cruz -- one of the great liars of all time,"" Trump said.Among Trump's supporters at the rally, Cruz was nearly as unpopular as the Democratic presidential candidates. Some, in fact, said they'd even vote for Hillary Clinton or Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) before pulling the lever for Cruz. ""Ted Cruz is creepy,"" said Jessi Jeziorski, 18, from nearby Orchard Park.""I think he's a snake,"" added Andy Russell, 70, from West Seneca. His wife, Pam Russell, 60, said she believed in the separation of church and state and worried that Cruz would base many of his decisions on his religious beliefs. Terry Fava, 76, from Rochester, wasn't as against Cruz as some other attendees, but she said she thought he'd be better as a Supreme Court justice. She said she also was concerned that he was born in Canada and may not be eligible to be president. ""Of course Obama wasn't either, and they didn't care. But I'd just like to see an American get it,"" Fava said, adding she didn't believe that Obama was born in Hawaii. Cruz's mother is American, and he argues that he is therefore automatically an American citizen and therefore eligible to be president. So far, the courts have agreed with him and thrown out cases challenging whether he's a ""natural born citizen"" under the U.S. Constitution. Trump also attracted a fair amount of protesters Monday. A group of people -- including activists from the local chapter of Showing Up For Racial Justice -- linked arms and sat down on the floor of the arena shortly after Trump began speaking, and many of them were literally dragged out by police. Gin Armstrong, 33, also from Buffalo, was one of the protesters pulled from the venue by security officers and described what happened to The Huffington Post. After the event, however, it appeared that only two protesters were taken to the police holding center. They had yet to be released as of late Monday night. Other protesters left the arena and stood blocking the nearby light rail tracks until police formed a line and pushed them away with batons. ""We led the march from the First Niagara Center down to here, and we were going to block off the train tracks so that Trump supporters couldn't go home,"" said Shaketa Redden, 33, a Black Lives Matter activist from Buffalo. ""Because our message is that Buffalo is the sixth-most segregated city in the nation, and if we can't rest, they can't rest. Instead of us being able to do that, the cops came up and pushed us and kept pushing us. So we just held the line and sat.""Buffalo doesn't usually find itself getting this sort of political attention. It's the first time in decades that New York has had a competitive presidential primary in both parties. All the candidates came to Buffalo, with the exception of Kasich. Former President Bill Clinton, along with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), were also in Buffalo Monday campaigning for Clinton -- the state's former U.S. senator -- and rallying supporters at a phone-banking event.

25,POLITICS,Lawsuit Targets Education Department Over Guidance On College Sexual Assault Policies,Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sexual-assault-lawsuit-education-department_us_57165996e4b0018f9cbb2a55,The Obama administration is accused of violating the law when it issued “substantive” new Title IX rules.,2016-04-19,"Education Department Secretary John B. King Jr., center, is named as a defendant in a new lawsuit claiming a man accused of sexual assault was unfairly treated by CSU-Pueblo.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5716741a1600002b0031c15f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A new federal lawsuit filed by a student punished for sexual assault by Colorado State University-Pueblo is taking on a target much more prominent than the school: The Department of Education. The complaint filed Tuesday by Grant Neal, represented by Andrew T. Miltenberg, names CSU Pueblo and several officials as defendants, as well as the Education Department, Secretary John B. King, Jr., and Assistant Secretary Catherine Lhamon. CSU Pueblo is accused of not conducting a fair investigation into a sexual misconduct claim against Neal, which resulted in his suspension in December. Neal claims he received an inadequate hearing at which he wasn’t able to defend himself fully. Neal was kicked off the football team during this process.The Education Department is accused of having violated the Administrative Procedure Act when its Office for Civil Rights released its 2011 Dear Colleague letter. That Dear Colleague letter was a ""call to action,"" highlighting what schools are obligated to do under the gender equity law Title IX in response to reports of sexual assault and harassment, including provisions about how investigations should be conducted.The APA requires agencies to provide public notice and then allow stakeholders to comment before issuing ""substantive"" new rules, such as in the form of a Dear Colleague letter. The APA bypasses this comment period if a letter like this is providing information about how a federal agency interprets existing laws or the agency's practice: The Education Department has said in the past that its 2011 Dear Colleague letter falls under these parameters.The lawsuit, however, contends that this Dear Colleague letter included ""new substantive rules and creates binding obligations,"" but was issued without going through a required regulatory procedure. Dozens of men accused of sexual assault have filed suit against their colleges and universities claiming they were mistreated during investigations. Many alleging that schools were biased against them as men, in violation of Title IX, have lost or been prevented from proceeding to a jury. Some suits, however, have succeeded along procedural errors or on the grounds of due process violations, and a few have survived motions to dismiss in recent weeks. In those suits, Miltenberg has become known for representing men accused of sexual assault in civil suits.The suit that Miltenburg is fighting on Neal's behalf beats the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education to the punch. Earlier this month, FIRE, a civil liberties nonprofit, offered to sue the Obama administration on similar grounds, on behalf of a student or college willing to work with the group. Neal was accused of sexual misconduct by a third party who'd learned of his relationship with an athletic trainer, named Jane Doe in the suit. Doe and Neal engaged in a consensual relationship, the suit says. The suit said that another athletic employee saw a hickey on Doe, and that employee ""presumed"" it was a result of non-consensual sexual contact, and then filed a report of sexual assault with the director of athletic training. University officials launched an investigation even though Doe told them that she hadn't been raped, according to the suit. Doe maintained from the beginning that all of their sexual activity was consensual, according to the complaint, but an investigation ensued anyway. CSU Pueblo determined that Neal was guilty of sexual misconduct and suspended him for as long as Doe remained a student. The lawsuit says the university was biased against him because he is a male athlete. ""As a result of the Obama Adminstration's directive, CSU Pueblo has violated my client’s due process rights and engaged in gender discrimination in his wrongful suspension,"" Miltenberg said in a statement. ""There’s a mountain of evidence to prove my client’s relationship with the alleged victim was entirely consensual — including statements from the alleged victim herself. Yet, CSU Pueblo disregarded this information and relied upon a third party, hearsay, account in handing down a life-altering suspension to my client, an exceptional student and athlete with a bright future in medicine.""Both CSU Pueblo and the Education Department said they do not comment on pending litigation. The lawsuit argues that the policies the Education Department advised schools to adopt in their 2011 guidance put students accused of sexual assault at a disadvantage. For example, the suit complains that the ""preponderance of evidence"" standard of proof threshold that is used by schools to determine if a student is guilty of sexual misconduct is too low, because it only requires a 51 percent certainty -- which is the standard used in civil court cases -- unlike ""beyond a reasonable doubt,"" which is used in criminal cases and requires virtually 99 percent certainty.Brett Sokolow, head of the Association of Title IX Administrators, told The Huffington Post he does not believe that OCR's 2011 guidance on Title IX needed to be subjected to the public comment stage and negotiated rule-making process under the APA, ""because sub-regulatory guidance is inherent in OCR's authority to administer the equity mandates of the Title IX regulations, which were appropriately authorized under the APA.""In February, Lhamon, who is in charge of the Office for Civil Rights, told one Republican senator in a letter that a notice and comment period was not necessary because the 2011 Dear Colleague letter did not carry the force of law, as the Supreme Court affirmed in a case last year._______Tyler Kingkade covers higher education and sexual violence, and is based in New York.

Above, a coal-fired power plant in Holcomb, Kansas.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The U.S. government doesn’t attach a price to harmful greenhouse gas emissions when it evaluates long-term energy projects. An influential Washington policy group with close ties to the Obama administration argues that it should.The Center for American Progress said in a report Monday that President Barack Obama ought to order federal agencies to take into account the hypothetical price of every metric ton of carbon emitted by potential projects such as pipelines, power plants and other proposals they assess that generate and transport energy.Because pollution costs typically aren’t taken into account now, CAP said, the U.S. economy consumes more fossil fuels than it would if the price of fuels such as oil and coal accurately reflected the costs of pollution.Putting a price on carbon would force government agencies and businesses that need government money or approval to finally consider the long-lasting effects of pollution on the world’s climate when evaluating the costs and benefits of future projects, CAP said.Carbon pricing also could spur new investments in sustainable projects that cleanly generate energy such as solar power and windmills because these projects might be less costly than energy from oil or coal, according to CAP’s report.It also would help the U.S. do its part to limit global warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, the goal that nearly 200 nations agreed upon in December to combat climate change.“As the world unites to fight climate change, more and more countries are turning to carbon pricing as a means to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions,” CAP said. “By putting a price on carbon, governments can correct the market’s failure to account for the climate costs of burning fossil fuels; in so doing, carbon pricing mechanisms encourage polluters to find cleaner, lower-carbon processes.”Big companies such as Microsoft, General Motors and Walt Disney already apply a price to carbon, CAP said, in part to avoid over-investing in carbon-heavy projects that could lose value in a world seeking to limit carbon emissions.Federal and state governments should do the same, CAP said.“Unwise commitments to carbon-intensive energy infrastructure could leave the broader U.S. economy unable to adapt quickly in a world that needs to limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels,” CAP said.CAP’s recommendation carries particular weight in Washington because of its ties to the Obama administration and the Democratic front-runner to replace him, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Top officials at CAP held senior positions in the Obama administration. The organization’s founder, John Podesta, is chairman of Clinton’s presidential campaign.The policy group urged Congress to approve a new law that would require federal agencies to consider the cost of carbon emissions when reviewing permit applications for energy infrastructure projects, but “given Congress’ current intransigence on climate change policy,” CAP said, either Obama or his successor should enact the provision through executive orders.For example, CAP identified three existing executive orders from the White House (orders 12893, 13653 and 13677) that Obama could use to require federal agencies to consider the price of each ton of carbon emissions.States, too, should follow suit when their local utility commissions rule on permit applications for potential energy projects, CAP said.Already, the federal Energy Department and utility commissions in Minnesota and Colorado have utilized carbon pricing when evaluating some projects, CAP said.The federal government has employed some estimates for the cost of each metric ton of carbon emitted, which ranges from $11 to $105 per ton, CAP said.The International Energy Agency estimates that carbon emissions should be priced at $140 per ton by 2040 in order to keep global warming below 2 degrees, according to CAP’s report.The federal government ought to act soon: In 2012, the International Energy Agency estimated that the world’s existing power plants, factories and other projects already were responsible for nearly 80 percent of all carbon pollution that could be emitted by 2035 before exceeding the 2-degree limit."

Three presidential candidates have close ties to the Empire State, and are hoping to leverage that into primary votes. Trump has spent most of his life in New York City. Clinton represented New York for eight years as a senator. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) was born and raised in Brooklyn.But an NBC News/WSJ/Marist New York poll shows that it’s party identification, not background, that really determines whether voters think Trump, Clinton or Sanders is the most authentic New Yorker.Overall, 41 percent of registered voters in New York say Trump is the ""real New Yorker"" of the three candidates. Twenty-five percent select Sanders, and 23 percent choose Clinton.Yet the differences are starker when the results are broken down by party. Among Republicans, 76 percent believe Trump is the true New Yorker, compared to just 22 percent of Democratic voters. Meanwhile, just 8 percent of Republicans choose Clinton, compared to 36 percent of Democrats, and another 8 percent of Republicans select Sanders, versus 33 percent of Democrats.Independents fall in between. Forty-four percent view Trump as the real New Yorker, while 27 percent say it's Sanders and 16 percent say Clinton.Along with party identification, political ideology matters, too. Forty percent of liberals deem Sanders the real New Yorker, and 29 percent favor Clinton. Only 21 percent of liberals consider Trump to be the most authentic New Yorker.Conversely, 61 percent of conservatives say Trump is the real New Yorker. Only 18 percent of conservatives think Clinton is more of a New Yorker, and only 13 percent choose Sanders.What do you think? Who’s the real New Yorker? Weigh in on a nonscientific Twitter poll.The NBC/WSJ/Marist poll was conducted April 6-10 and included 1,987 registered voters with a margin of error of +/- 2.2 percentage points.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."
