Interest Rates Don’t,” the Times argued that if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates in the near term, it could slow job creation at a time when there are still too few jobs to generate substantial wage growth.  “Wage stagnation is a clear sign that the economy is not at full employment, which means it needs loose monetary policy, not tightening,” the Times wrote.The Times called the Fed a “crucial player” in efforts to undo the decades-long trend of worker wages not growing in sync with the broader economy. The paper noted that from 1973 to 2014, median worker pay rose 7.8 percent while overall productivity increased by 72 percent, a finding published Wednesday in a report from the liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute. An interest rate hike would exacerbate, rather than reverse, this trend by slowing wage growth, the Times editorial suggested. The paper also said that an interest rate hike would send “the wrong signal of economic health,” undermining efforts by advocacy groups to raise workers’ wages through measures like increasing the minimum wage. It is unclear what impact the Times’ editorial will have on the Fed’s decision-making, but it is a high-profile boost for progressive activists and economists, who have long argued that a Fed interest rate hike should be tied to wage growth that is about twice as high as it is currently. These activists, led by the Center for Popular Democracy's Fed Up campaign, note that even as the official unemployment rate declined to 5.1 percent in August -- its lowest level since April 2008 -- wages have grown 2.2 percent in the past 12 months, only marginally outpacing increases in living costs. Since wages rise when demand for workers is high enough that businesses must compete for labor, many economists attribute ongoing sluggish wage growth to the number of people who are underemployed or have given up looking for work -- figures masked by the low official jobless rate. The Fed Up campaign sent a memo to newspaper editorial boards across the country on Sept. 1, asking them to oppose an interest rate hike in 2015. The memo, a copy of which was obtained by The Huffington Post, employs arguments that resemble those used by The New York Times. The memo warned that an interest rate hike in 2015 would ""leave millions in considerable and unnecessary economic distress and would exacerbate troubling longer-term trends in wages and incomes for the vast majority of American workers and their families."" Fed Up campaign director Ady Barkan celebrated the editorial, but stopped short of claiming credit for it. ""The New York Times Editorial Board is right,"" Barkan said in a statement. ""Workers do deserve a raise! The data is crystal clear – stagnant wages and the lack of inflation mean that the Fed shouldn’t raise rates anytime soon. The Fed Up campaign is of course glad that the Times and other leading voices are speaking up about this issue.""Fed officials have signaled for months that they plan to raise the current near-zero interest rates before the year’s end, but William Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, recently indicated that a September increase may be too soon in light of market fluctuations. The Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank body charged with adjusting key interest rates, will report on whether it plans to raise rates on September 17.Supporters of an interest rate hike argue that it is necessary to head off excessive price inflation, which, along with maintaining full employment, is part of the Fed’s dual mandate.

But Cortes claims that she did not know Hatcher, and police have yet to reveal how she knew the person who pulled the trigger. ""She admitted that she conspired with an unnamed individual,"" Dallas police said in a press release.Cortes allegedly told detectives that a yet to be identified person paid her $500 to drive her male accomplice to the parking garage of Hatcher's apartment building on the day of her slaying. Cortes said she was told the man was going to rob Hatcher, police said.Hatcher's aunt, Lisa Sato, told NBC News that this story just doesn't add up. ""Robbers don't walk up and shoot somebody first and then grab their stuff,"" she said. ""That's just not the way robberies happen. There was just no reason for a robber to kill her, to get whatever it was they took.""Last week, Hatcher's family said they suspected an ex-boyfriend is connected to her slaying, The State Journal-Register reported. Authorities have yet to comment on a possible motive.Police identified Cortes as a possible suspect when they released grainy surveillance video from the parking garage that showed a Jeep Cherokee following Hatcher to her parking space.A child allegedly witnessed what happened next.""My son, he was telling me that a black Jeep Cherokee drove by [and] a guy with a mask put a bullet in her and just drove off,"" the boy's father, who did not wish to be identified, told WFAA.com.Cortes told investigators the gunman stole several items from Hatcher after he shot her, according to the arrest affidavit.Hatcher died at the scene. Her body was found next to her vehicle.On Sept. 4, an unnamed individual contacted detectives and told them he recognized the vehicle in the surveillance video as his own. The witness, police said, told them his vehicle had been lent to Cortes prior to Hatcher's slaying.Cortes voluntarily went to the Dallas Police Department on Friday, at which time she allegedly confessed to her role in Hatcher's slaying. Cortes also allegedly provided ""information that other unidentified suspects may have been involved,"" police said.Police have yet to say whether Cortes knew Hatcher. Authorities have also not named any other suspects or persons of interest in the case.Cortes' brother, Rudy Aguilar, described his sister to local news channel CBS 11 as a loving mother. ""This has just been a shock to the whole family.""He also said he believes his sister's role in Hatcher's slaying was minimal.""You know she didn't rob anybody,"" he said. ""She was just the driver. I don't know if she knows what she was doing or if she got threatened to do it.""Cortes has been charged with capital murder. She is being held in the Dallas County Jail in lieu of a $500,000 bond. Jail records do not list an attorney for her.Sato told NBC the family hopes to soon have answers in her niece's slaying.""You know somebody did this and you can't get past that until you know who and why they did it,"" she said.The Dallas Police Department is asking anyone with information on the case to contact its homicide unit at (214) 283-4818.Earlier on Huffpost:"

It's unclear how much longer the girls will need to stay at the hospital, but doctors say they're healthy and that their lives are about to change forever.“We have the potential at Nationwide Children’s to take two patients who would never have been able to have a normal life as they were before and make them into two separate individuals who, I expect, will have healthy and normal lives,” said Dr. Gail Besner, chief of Pediatric Surgery at the hospital.The Akello sisters, daughters of Ester Akello of Uganda, were flown to Nationwide Children’s in December 2014.

Our primary concern was preservation of the twins’ neurologic function so they may have adequate leg movement and bowel and bladder function once separated.”Once the pair was separated, reconstruction began. Surgeons finished working on them at 11:30 p.m., marking the hospital's fourth successful conjoined twins surgery. Their mother, Ester, doesn't speak much English, but ""no words were needed to convey her gratitude,"" according to the release. Now, the sisters only have one surgery to go.

4,BUSINESS,Paid Sick Leave Is Fast Becoming A Right -- Not A Privilege,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/companies-paid-sick-leave_us_55ef2fa7e4b002d5c076eb85,“Companies are going to start offering this just because their competitors are doing it and their workers will expect it.”,2015-09-08,"<p>A Chipotle worker, who's presumably not sick, prepares a burrito.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55ef37c72c00003600aaf360.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s getting harder for your boss to get away with not offering paid sick leave. That’s of course good news for the many workers, mostly hourly and low-paid, who either lose money when they’re ill or wind up coming to work sick. It’s also a welcome development for those of us who don’t want to shop or eat at businesses with a lot of sick employees running around.On Labor Day, President Barack Obama announced that starting in 2017, federal contractors must provide workers with paid sick time. Obama's executive order provides one hour of leave for every 30 hours of work for up to seven paid sick days a year. This won’t directly affect a ton of people -- about 300,000 workers, according to the White House -- but its impact could be far more widespread, transforming paid sick leave from a privileged benefit for salaried, white-collar workers to a basic right for everyone. “The executive order is another brick in the wall that will get us to a new workplace standard all across the country,” Dan Cantor, national director of the Working Families Party, told The Huffington Post on Tuesday. “Companies are going to start offering this just because their competitors are doing it and their workers will expect it.”Cantor, whose organization has helped lead the charge on the paid leave movement, used the hypothetical example of a McDonald’s on an Army base. Once it starts offering the benefit “the word will spread,” he said. Soon more McDonald’s workers and other fast-food workers could demand this. Competitors would be forced to keep up.Just a decade ago, there were no laws on the books in the U.S. that required employers to pay when workers missed a day due to illness or a family emergency. Obama’s order caps off years of massive progress in the paid sick leave arena. Three states and 15 municipalities passed sick leave laws this year and last year, including Massachusetts, California, Oregon, Philadelphia and Newark. At the same time, a range of businesses have taken the initiative and started offering it.Chipotle earlier this year announced it would offer its workers paid sick leave, a relief to anyone looking to nosh on a germ-free burrito bowl. The Mexican chain operates in many of the locales that have passed the new laws and is an example of what paid leave supporters are hoping to see happen in the business sector: Companies see the change coming and move proactively.""Sooner or later, this will be the law of the land. Why not just do it?"" said Ellen Bravo, an executive director at Family Values at Work, which has been pushing for the new laws.The nation’s largest private employer, Walmart, said earlier this year that it was reconsidering its policy on sick leave. Right now, full-time hourly associates who want a sick day must dip into their vacation time to take their first day of sick leave. Only after that does paid sick leave kick in. Part-time workers get no sick days at all.Facebook and Microsoft both announced this year that they’ll only do business with contractors and suppliers that offer paid sick leave.Offering paid leave is a good business practice, leading to a “happier and more productive workforce,” wrote Brad Smith, a Microsoft vice president, in a blog post. There’s a wide body of research out there supporting Smith’s point: Studies have shown that workers with access to paid sick days are less likely to get injured on the job or to expose their coworkers to contagious illnesses, as HuffPost's Jonathan Cohn noted earlier this year. Paid sick leave is a fairly standard benefit for high-paid, salaried workers -- about 82 percent of management and professional workers in the private sector are paid when they're sick, according to the Labor Department. It's far more rare for low-paid workers: Just 40 percent of private-sector service workers receive paid sick leave. Workers in the hospitality industry -- who are interacting with the public every day -- are among the least likely to be able to take a paid sick day. While business owners fret that offering the new benefit would come at great cost, a study that looked at Connecticut’s businesses after the state passed its law in 2011 showed very minimal impact.Obama’s used executive orders before to set workplace standards, such as raising the minimum wage for federal contractors to $10.10 last year. But there’s a long history of presidents issuing executive orders that raised the bar on workplace and societal norms. In 1948, President Harry Truman issued an executive order desegregating the national armed forces, setting a new standard at the time. Perhaps Obama has done the same."
5,MEDIA,Austin Beutner Out As LA Times Publisher; Timothy Ryan In,Gabriel Arana,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/austin-beutner-timothy-ryan-la-times_us_55ef1698e4b03784e276a0b7,The move comes amid continuing financial troubles at the paper.,2015-09-08,<p>Austin Beutner (left) is being replaced by Timothy Ryan as publisher of the Los Angeles Times.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55ef18991700009a01569a2f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After a mere 13 months as publisher of the Los Angeles Times, former Wall Street banker and Deputy LA Mayor Austin Beutner has been given the boot by Tribune Publishing Co., sources close to the firing confirmed to The Huffington Post. Politico's Ken Doctor first reported the news Tuesday. Beutner minced no words in commenting on his firing in a Facebook post. “I am writing to let you know that I am leaving the Los Angeles Times, effective immediately,” Beutner wrote. “I am not departing by choice, nor is this some ‘mutual agreement’ on my part and Tribune Publishing. Tribune Publishing has decided to fire me. I am sorry you will read this on social media, but I no longer have access to my Times email.”The reason for the firing wasn’t immediately clear, but various media outlets, including the Chicago Tribune, have cited financial troubles at the paper and Beutner’s expensive, high-profile hires from the world of politics and business -- which some suggested were made in contemplation of a run for political office -- as reasons for the decision. Among the hires suspected to be politically motivated were Nicco Mele, an Internet strategist who worked on Howard Dean's 2004 presidential campaign, and Johanna Maska, a former White House aide under President Barack Obama.During his tenure at the LA Times, Beutner spearheaded several digital initiatives, including the launch of online ""verticals"" focused on news events such as the California drought and 20 topical newsletters boasting more than 100,000 total subscribers. Beutner also helped orchestrate the purchase of the San Diego Union-Tribune in May, part of a strategy to ease regional distribution and production costs.The firing also comes amid long-running tensions between the Chicago-based Tribune Co. and the LA Times, which was owned by Times Mirror before Tribune bought it in 2000. The board recently rejected a proposal from billionaire LA investor Eli Broad to buy the paper and put Beutner in charge.Beutner concluded his Facebook farewell note by saying, “It has been a privilege to serve in this role and work with all of you ... California is where America comes to see its future and the place where that story begins is the Los Angeles Times. I will continue to root for you to succeed.”Tribune Publishing Co. announced in a press release Tuesday afternoon that Timothy Ryan, publisher of the Baltimore Sun Media Group, will take over for Beutner, effective immediately. In the release, Tribune Publishing CEO Jack Griffin called Ryan “one of the country’s most-accomplished publishing executives.”“Tim’s successful track record of strategic acquisitions, revenue diversification and digital transformation are successful models for the industry and for our Company,” Griffin added.Ryan said it is a “privilege” to run the LA Times and San Diego Union-Tribune.This piece has been updated to include a statement from Austin Beutner and the Tribune Publishing Co.'s announcement on Timothy Ryan's hire."

First with revulsion at witnessing such intimate and vicious violence perpetrated by a sports star. But then, with judgment directed towards the victim of the assault, Janay Rice.Many commenters questioned why Janay -- who married Rice after the assault -- would stay with someone who abused her. If it was really was so bad, they wondered, wouldn’t she just leave? Writer and domestic violence survivor Beverly Gooden remembers watching the public’s reaction in disbelief. ""The conversation was centered on her response to the violence, instead of his actions,"" she said. Fed up with what she perceived to be blatant victim blaming, she shot off a series of tweets using the hashtag #WhyIStayed to explain why she remained with her abusive ex-husband. ""I stayed because I thought it would get better. It never got any better,"" she wrote in her first tweet using the hashtag.Gooden had less than 1,000 followers and didn’t expect much of a response. But her message struck a nerve. Hundreds, then thousands of survivors began to tweet using her hashtag. Another hashtag, #WhyILeft, also emerged, which focused on what triggered survivors to finally flee. By the time night fell, both Twitter hashtags were trending in the U.S. The overwhelming response spiked over the next few days and then continued at a steady stream for weeks. (Even today, the hashtags are still used almost daily.)""In 40 years working on domestic violence, I’ve literally never seen a conversation of the kind we are having now,"" Kim Gandy, CEO of the National Network to End Domestic Violence, told The Huffington Post at the time. The viral movement had successfully transformed the release of a graphic video into a nuanced, educational and compassionate conversation on intimate partner violence, driven by survivors. Now, a year later, one organization has released a data analysis of that conversation, calling it ""a milestone in domestic violence history"" worth cataloging and commemorating. Big Mountain Data, a startup that develops data science solutions to help fight domestic violence, studied the use of the hashtags #WhyIStayed and #WhyILeft on social and mainstream media between Sept. 8 and Dec. 1, 2014. The data counted 198,696 mentions of the hashtags during that snapshot of time. Most were on Twitter, followed by Facebook and mainstream news. Of the hashtagged posts, 85,687 were original posts (not retweets).On Tuesday, Big Mountain Data shared its findings in an infographic that highlights both the scope of domestic violence and the themes that emerged from survivors' stories. ""This was a 21st-century response to the victim shaming and blaming that surrounds domestic violence,"" said Susan Scrupski, founder of Big Mountain Data. ""We wanted to honor and preserve this moment on behalf of these courageous women who came forward. We couldn’t let it slide on by on the newsfeed.""The data gathered on the hashtags will be stored online and available for researchers to access at a later date, Scrupski said. ""For me personally, the posts were heartbreaking, they brought me to tears. I think anyone who’s been involved in an abusive relationship can relate,"" she said. ""But as someone who does research, I realized that if you put this pool of knowledge in a data set, you can mine it for insights.""An analysis of the posts found that the most common reason survivors gave for staying with an abusive partner was to keep the family together. The second most common reason was love, followed by being too scared to leave. That fear is justified: Women are at a higher risk of being killed when they are attempting to leave an abusive partner, and during the period immediately after fleeing. For those survivors who wrote about leaving their partners, the most reported reason was fear for their children’s safety. When women are shot in domestic disputes, children are often killed alongside them. The majority of mass shootings in the U.S. -- when a shooter kills four or more people -- involve an intimate partner or other family member.Seventy-five percent of the people who shared on Twitter using the hashtags had less than 1,000 followers. ""These are not celebrities, these are real women talking about real life,"" Scrupski said.Gooden believes the social media movement she sparked with her tweets changed how the media and the public talk about domestic violence.""Before as a survivor, when I would read about domestic violence, I would read about it from the angle of 'here are the statistics,' etc. Now, I see lots of survivors talking about what they went through,"" she said. ""Usually, we are being talked about. But that day, we took control of the conversation.""She still checks the hashtags every day. ""The worst thing for a survivor to feel is alone,"" Gooden said. ""I want them to feel that someone is out there listening.""- - - - - The Huffington Post ran a series on why women don’t leave abusive partners, exploring themes of fear, love, family, financial abuse, isolation and shame.Read those stories below: Why Didn't You Just Leave?

We couldn’t let it slide on by on the newsfeed.""The data gathered on the hashtags will be stored online and available for researchers to access at a later date, Scrupski said. ""For me personally, the posts were heartbreaking, they brought me to tears. I think anyone who’s been involved in an abusive relationship can relate,"" she said. ""But as someone who does research, I realized that if you put this pool of knowledge in a data set, you can mine it for insights.""An analysis of the posts found that the most common reason survivors gave for staying with an abusive partner was to keep the family together. The second most common reason was love, followed by being too scared to leave. That fear is justified: Women are at a higher risk of being killed when they are attempting to leave an abusive partner, and during the period immediately after fleeing. For those survivors who wrote about leaving their partners, the most reported reason was fear for their children’s safety. When women are shot in domestic disputes, children are often killed alongside them. The majority of mass shootings in the U.S. -- when a shooter kills four or more people -- involve an intimate partner or other family member.Seventy-five percent of the people who shared on Twitter using the hashtags had less than 1,000 followers. ""These are not celebrities, these are real women talking about real life,"" Scrupski said.Gooden believes the social media movement she sparked with her tweets changed how the media and the public talk about domestic violence.""Before as a survivor, when I would read about domestic violence, I would read about it from the angle of 'here are the statistics,' etc. Now, I see lots of survivors talking about what they went through,"" she said. ""Usually, we are being talked about. But that day, we took control of the conversation.""She still checks the hashtags every day. ""The worst thing for a survivor to feel is alone,"" Gooden said. ""I want them to feel that someone is out there listening.""- - - - - The Huffington Post ran a series on why women don’t leave abusive partners, exploring themes of fear, love, family, financial abuse, isolation and shame.Read those stories below: Why Didn't You Just Leave?

Or I expected to be that,” he said.“I wasn’t mad at that…but I think that I’m a serious artist. So it’s a fine line to walk. But I accept that. This is the realm that we’re in.”The song -- which was featured on D’Angelo’s second album “Voodoo” -- ultimately went on to receive Grammy Awards in 2001 for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance and Best R&B Album. Following the album's success, D'Angelo took a hiatus and returned in 2014 with his latest album “Black Messiah.” As he has discussed in previous interviews, the album’s lyrics from songs on ""Black Messiah"" speak about social issues often addressed by the Black Lives Matter Movement -- making it his most political project to date.“Young black men and women are just getting killed for nothing,” he said before later adding, “I’m not trying to be like a poster child or anything of the movement, but definitely a voice as a black man -- as a concerned black man and as a father, as well.”Check out part one of D’Angelo’s interview with Tavis Smiley in the clip above, and part two below."

The arrangement seemed to be working smoothly until a coworker complained to the airline in early August that Stanley had been delinquent in her duties because she refused to serve the cocktails. The complaint also noted that Stanley ""had a book with foreign writings and wore a headdress,"" CNN wrote.In late August the airline notified Stanley, an employee of three years who became a Muslim about two years ago, that the accommodation had been revoked. ExpressJet placed her on unpaid leave for 12 months, Masri said. She was also threatened with termination, the lawyer added.In an interview with HuffPost on Monday, the airline said it could not comment on personnel matters, but offered the following statement: ""We embrace and respect the values of all of our team members. We are an equal opportunity employer with a long history of diversity in our workforce.""Masri told HuffPost that Stanley was open to mediation, but if no satisfactory solution is reached, she and her client would consider a lawsuit. In the meantime, Stanley was seeking other employment, the attorney said.Responding to parallels drawn to the case of Kim Davis, the Kentucky clerk who cited her religious beliefs in refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, Masri said there was no comparison.Stanley is not a public official, she said. She emphasized that Stanley's request to accommodate her faith was ""not at the expense of anyone else."" As instructed by her employer, she reached an accord with colleagues so passengers could still get their drinks.""She got suspended for following the directions,"" Masri said to HuffPost, adding that ""serving alcohol is not a central duty of being a flight attendant.""In summing up the conflict, the attorney told CNN that Stanley was fighting for basic rights: ""What this case comes down to is no one should have to choose between their career and religion and it's incumbent upon employers to provide a safe environment where employees can feel they can practice their religion freely.""H/T PatheosAlso on HuffPost:"

It said it killed 25 fighters, including non-Syrian jihadists.“The regime has lost the last oilfield in Syria,” said the Observatory, which tracks violence through a network of sources on the ground.Commentators on social media said fighting had surged in the last two to three days and the rebels had taken the oilfield on Sunday. Jazal is a medium-sized field that lies to the north west of the rebel-held ancient city of Palmyra, close to a region that holds Syria’s main natural gas fields and multi-million-dollar extraction facilities.The army, which has been fighting to retake the city and surrounding areas since they fell in May, had managed to secure the oil field’s perimeter in June.The Observatory also said U.S.-led coalition bombing raids in areas in the militant’s de facto capital of Raqqa had killed at least 16 militants, including five foreign jihadists.Islamist insurgents bombarded the heart of the Syrian capital Damascus and mortars killed at least one civilian and wounded scores, state television said.Also on HuffPost:"

""We took this action because there was no alternative.""The air strike was ""entirely lawful,"" he said.Amnesty International's UK Director Kate Allen said it was ""extremely alarming that the UK has apparently been conducting summary executions from the air.""In following the United States down a lawless road of remote-controlled summary killings from the sky, the RAF has crossed a line,"" she added.British warplanes have launched regular air attacks against Islamic State fighters in neighboring Iraq in recent months and flown drones over Syria to gather military intelligence. But unlike some countries in a U.S.-led international coalition, it does not generally target IS in Syria.The Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think tank said the strike marked a big departure in policy.""The point is not so much that this man was British but that he was targeted in an area that the UK does not currently regard, legally, as an operational theater of war for UK forces,"" said RUSI Director General Michael Clarke in a statement.In 2013, Cameron suffered a humiliating defeat in parliament when he sought approval of possible military action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.That defeat was inflicted by the opposition Labour Party, whose popularity among a war-weary electorate still suffers because of the decision by former leader Tony Blair to take Britain to war in Iraq in 2003.But on Monday Labour struck a conciliatory tone and refrained from directly criticizing the air strike. Interim leader Harriet Harman's response focused on seeking more information about the legal basis for the strike and the procedures taken to authorize it.""There is a need for independent scrutiny of what the government has done here,"" she said.PLOTSKhan, from the Welsh capital Cardiff, and Amin from Aberdeen in Scotland had their assets frozen by Britain's finance ministry last year after reports they had been involved in terrorism-related activities in Syria and appeared in an IS recruitment video.""There was clear evidence of the individuals in question planning and directing armed attacks against the UK,"" Cameron said. ""These were part of a series of actual and foiled attempts to attack the UK and our allies.""A third Briton fighting with IS, Junaid Hussain, was killed in a separate U.S. air strike, Cameron said. U.S. authorities last month reported on the death in Syria of Hussain, describing him as a hacker from Birmingham in England who was believed to have been one of Islamic State's top computer experts.Cameron said both Khan and Hussain had been involved in ""plots to attack high profile public commemorations, including those taking place this summer.""He said the drone strike was not an expansion of Britain's role, but added that there was a strong case for one.He said he would not join coalition strikes in Syria without first winning parliamentary approval. Harman said Labour would ""carefully consider"" any proposal to extend military action into Syria.An effort by Cameron to build a cross-party consensus for a fresh vote is likely to be opposed by leftwing lawmaker Jeremy Corbyn, the favorite to become Labour's new leader on Saturday.Also on HuffPost:"

""It seems cats are much more resource focused... I’m sure you know someone whose cat moved in with their neighbor who started to feed it (rather than offered it shelter and protection).""The study was patterned on a classic psychology experiment known as ""strange situation,"" so named because in the experiment -- developed by American-Canadian psychologist Mary Ainsworth (1913-1999) -- a baby or child is left in a room to play by the mother or caregiver while a stranger then walks in. The experiment is modeled to help scientists gauge how attached children are to their mothers.Similarly, the researchers placed 20 pet cats in an unfamiliar room and then observed how they responded when they were left alone in the room with a stranger, their owner, or simply by themselves. The researchers selected cats whose owners said were particularly attached to them, Live Science reported.What did the researchers find? The cats vocalized slightly more meows when their owners left them in the room with a stranger, but the researchers didn't notice any additional evidence to suggest that the cats were strongly attached to their owners.""This vocalization might simply be a sign of frustration or learned response, since no other signs of attachment were reliably seen,"" Mills said in a written statement. ""In strange situations, attached individuals seek to stay close to their carer, show signs of distress when they are separated and demonstrate pleasure when their attachment figure returns, but these trends weren’t apparent during our research.""The study was published online in the journal Plos One on September 2, 2015.Also on HuffPost Science:"

While there are lots of exercises that can help you become mentally strong, here are three secrets to building mental muscle:",2015-09-07,An athlete with a prosthetic leg celebrating with arm raised high.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ef9b92000003000fe94d3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Most people know how to build physical strength, but there's a lot more confusion over the steps you can take to develop mental strength. While there are lots of exercises that can help you become mentally strong, here are three secrets to building mental muscle:1. Talk to yourself like a trusted friend.Scientists at the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging estimate humans have about 70,000 thoughts per day. That means you have 70,000 opportunities to either make yourself stronger, or tear yourself down.Your thoughts greatly influence how you feel and behave. In fact, your inner monologue has a tendency to become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Thinking things like, ""I will never get hired for this job,"" or ""Nobody ever listens to me,"" can alter your behavior in a way that makes those predictions come true.Practice replacing overly negative thoughts with more realistic ones. When you notice yourself thinking something like, ""I'm a loser and I'll never amount to anything,"" remind yourself that your thoughts aren't necessarily true.Ask yourself, ""What would I say to a friend who said this about herself?"" Then, offer those kind and gentle words to yourself.2. Take charge of your emotions.Allowing your emotions to control your life will deplete your mental strength. While there's nothing wrong with being in a bad mood sometimes, staying stuck in a negative spot can be a slippery slope. Sadness can lead to self-pity, anger can turn to bitterness and mild anxiety can become paralyzing fear if you're not careful.A lot of problems stem from a desire to avoid discomfort. For example, people who fear failure often avoid new challenges in an effort to keep anxiety at bay. Avoiding emotional discomfort, however, is usually a short-term solution that leads to long-term problems.Develop an awareness of how your emotions impact your life. Decide that you're going to be in control of your emotions so they don't control you. Face uncomfortable feelings head-on and take charge of your life. The more you practice tolerating discomfort, the more confidence you'll gain in your ability to accept new challenges.3. Make productive choices.It's impossible to feel mentally strong when you're engaging in self-destructive behaviors that sabotage your best efforts. Yet, most people have a few unproductive habits that they indulge in on a regular basis.Many of these bad habits seem minor--complaining about your boss, hosting your own pity party, or trying to please everyone--but they can wreak havoc on your mental state. When you perform these bad habits, right alongside your good ones, your efforts become counterproductive.You only have a finite amount of time and energy in life. Devoting those resources to the things mentally strong people don't do will tire you out and slow your progress toward your goals.Build Mental StrengthEveryone has the ability to build mental strength. Similar to building physical strength, developing mental muscle requires dedication and hard work. With practice, you'll gain an increased ability to regulate your thoughts, control your emotions, and behave productively despite your circumstances.Amy Morin is a psychotherapist, keynote speaker, and the author of 13 Things Mentally Strong People Don't Do, a bestselling book that is being translated into more than 20 languages.
