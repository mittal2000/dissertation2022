This year's theme is ""No Longer Slaves, but Brothers and Sisters.""""All of us are called (by God) to be free, all are called to be sons and daughters, and each, according to his or her own responsibilities, is called to combat modern forms of enslavement. From every people, culture and religion, let us join our forces,"" he said.Last month Francis appealed to consumers to shun low-cost goods that may be the product of forced labor or other forms of exploitation.That message was sent to heads of state and governments, international institutions and parishes throughout the 1.2 billion-member Church.The Argentine pope has made defense of migrants and workers a central issue of his papacy. At a Vespers service on New Year's Eve, he condemned administrators and criminals in Rome accused of pocketing public funds meant to help poor migrants, urging a ""spiritual and moral renewal.""The second global slavery index released in November by the Walk Free Foundation, an Australian-based human rights group, estimated that almost 36 million people were living as slaves, trafficked into brothels, forced into manual labor, victims of debt bondage or born into servitude.After Mass, the pope delivered his traditional New Year's Day noon address to tens of thousands of people, most of whom took part in peace marches to the Vatican.""Peace is always possible but we have to seek it. Let us pray for peace,"" he told the crowd of people carrying balloons and banners with peace slogans. (Reporting by Philip Pullella; Editing by Ruth Pitchford)"

Faithful Catholics had the chance to see Pope Francis at his Wednesday general audiences, liturgical celebrations, Sunday Angelus prayers, and at special audiences. And they came in droves.The popular pontiff drew about 5.9 million people to the Vatican in 2014 -- slightly less than the 6.6 million he drew in his inaugural year, but still far ahead of predecessor Pope Benedict XVI.In 2011, Benedict attracted a total of 2.5 million, Crux reports. Francis beat those numbers with just his Angelus addresses, which attracted about 3 million. Easter was prime time for the pope, with more than 200,000 crowding into St. Peter’s Square for his Wednesday general audiences in April. In total, 1.2 million attended this year’s general audiences. Saint John Paul II drew 1.6 million in 1979 and 1.5 million in 2000. The statistics were calculated by adding up the number of invitations distributed and attendance requests received by the Prefecture for the Pontifical Household, according to News.Va. The Vatican doesn’t make adjustments for repeat visitors, so there may be some double counting. The numbers also don’t include audiences present at Francis’ trips outside of the Vatican -- like his visits to Israel, Turkey, and South Korea.Francis is expected to draw large crowds in January when he makes his first trip to the Philippines, the third-largest Catholic country in the world. The pope also has a large platform online, with Twitter accounts in nine different languages. According to Twiplomacy, he’s the most influential world leader on Twitter. His Spanish account receives an average of 10,000 retweets for every tweet, while the average is 6,436 for every message sent out on his English account. "
2,TASTE,Let's Not Forget Spaghetti Alla Puttanesca,"Edward Schneider, ContributorTravel, cooking and food writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cooking-off-the-cuff-its_b_6393514.html,You can tell from the ingredients that this is not a shy kind of sauce.,2014-12-31,"I used salt-packed anchovies, soaked and filleted; oil-packed would be fine too",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e798a2400003100540104.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"In the winter, sometimes it's nice to eat a seasonless dinner, one that doesn't depend on a chilly trip to the farmers market; pasta often fills that bill. For quite some time now, my go-to no-marketing red-sauce dish has been bucatini or other pasta all'Amatriciana, but a couple of days ago I found that I was running low on guanciale, a key ingredient in its wonderful sauce. What I was far from running low on was anchovies, of which I acquired at least a year's supply right after a recent trip to Rome and Venice, where they seemingly turned up in everything we ate apart from the doughnuts.Indeed, I had a supply of most of the savory and/or salty pantry items that have saved the day for countless cooks: capers, olives, good-quality canned tomatoes -- and of course that stockpile of anchovies. Along with olive oil, garlic and dried chilis, these added up to the sauce for pasta alla puttanesca (there is lots of tedious speculation about the origin of that name, and you can pass the time running internet searches for it unless you'd rather be doing something gratifying). What with our long-running Amatriciana phase and our fondness for Venetian onion-anchovy salsa, Jackie and I hadn't had that great Neapolitan classic for quite some time.So, the other night we did. It's one of those recipes that lodge in the memory, and what I describe is pretty much the classic dish, distorted by just one personal preference that I think enhances it without betraying it.I begin with my innovation: Typically, the sauce is made with plain peeled tomatoes, fresh or (more often) canned, and there's no reason not to make it that way. But, as with my Amatriciana sauce, I prefer to tinker with the tomatoes first: I cook a can of genuine San Marzano tomatoes, crushed in my fist, for 20 minutes with a whole garlic clove, quite a bit of olive oil, a few sage leaves and a wee bit of salt: the simplest of simple tomato sauces and the one I like to keep in the house (especially when made with fresh late-summer tomatoes instead of canned, but that's an idle dream in December). As that was simmering, I prepared the other ingredients.For two or three portions, I rinsed five salt-packed anchovies and soaked them for five minutes in tepid water, then used my fingers to open them lengthwise, remove the backbones and any traces of innards and separate them into two fillets each. These I rinsed again, dried on a paper towel and set aside, drizzled with a little olive oil. If I hadn't had my monster can of salt-cured anchovies, I would have used ten oil-packed anchovy fillets, which are more likely to be in most cupboards or fridges. I also rinsed, dried and roughly chopped a good quarter cup of capers (about 65 ml by volume - a little handful); again, I used salt-packed capers, but those in vinegar work fine. I roughly chopped 2/3 cup (160 ml by volume) of olives that had been pitted. I used a mixture of meaty, flavorful green and black olives; you could use all black ones such as Gaeta or Kalamata, but I like the diversity of juiciness that you get with an assortment. Finally, I chopped three cloves of garlic, not too fine.I began by cooking the garlic in a deep skillet with about three tablespoons of good olive oil. When the garlic began to turn toasty golden, I added a sprinkle of Calabrian chili flakes, then a few seconds later the anchovies, which I stirred and pressed with a spatula until they seemed to dissolve into the oil -- a matter of moments. Then, in went the capers and olives and half a minute later about 2/3 of the sauce (which had been made with one 28-ounce -- 800-gram -- can of tomatoes). I brought this to the boil and left it to simmer, loosely covered, for perhaps fifteen minutes, tasting for salt.Meanwhile, I brought a pot of salted water to the boil, and when the sauce was done cooked two portions of spaghettini (not my first choice: I was out of thicker spaghetti). As it cooked, I chopped a handful of parsley and kept it at the ready. When the pasta was done, I drained it (saving a cup - 250 ml - of the cooking water) and added it to the sauce, combining everything thoroughly with a pair of tongs. Once the pasta had absorbed some of the liquid, the sauce needed nearly half of the reserved water to be a nice consistency -- thick enough to cling to the spaghettini, but not cludgy. I turned it out into a serving bowl and incorporated some of the parsley, then added more as a topping. The parsley is not optional: you'll be surprised how much flavor it adds. No cheese, please; there's plenty of umami as it is.You can tell from the ingredients that this is not a shy kind of sauce. Yet neither is it particularly aggressive; all those powerful elements are cooked long enough with the tomatoes that they combine to create a united savoriness. But they don't entirely lose their individuality: To play a little game, concentrate on a forkful and you'll be able to taste every single thing that's in your mouth. All that flavor without having had to bundle up and go out into the frigid weather!"

Ramos and his partner, officer Wenjian Liu, were killed Dec. 20 as they sat in their patrol car on a Brooklyn street. The shooter, Ismaaiyl Brinsley, later killed himself. (AP Photo/John Minchillo)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae5445260000cf00812c3c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"You would think grown men and women -- especially those considered so mentally and physically fit as to be trusted with the task of protecting lives -- could take a little criticism.I'm talking about the New York City Police Department. Since the senseless slaying of two NYPD officers in Brooklyn, the entire police department has unleashed a hissy-fit against the mayor, Bill de Blasio.It began at a press conference after the killings, when cops literally turned their backs on the mayor as he entered; they did so again at the funeral of one of the officers, this time amidst a sign that read, ""Dump de Blasio."" The head of the police union, Patrick Lynch, went so far as to say there was ""blood on the hands"" of de Blasio, and a former-cop-turned-blogger released a statement, supposedly written by current cops, declaring: ""We no longer have confidence in Mayor de Blasio, nor in his ability to lead New York City and promote the values that both the NYPD and the good law abiding citizens of the city hold dear.""Admittedly, de Blasio is not the warm, cuddly figure that Michael Bloomberg was when it comes to the NYPD. The de Blasio campaign focused largely on reforming the police department's stop-and-frisk policy, and he called for the creation of an inspector general and the end to racial profiling. More recently, cops were very upset when de Blasio said he had told his son, Dante, to ""take special care"" when dealing with the police.But to anyone who has paid attention, that criticism was a long time coming. The NYPD's stop-and-frisk policy grew so out of control -- 500,000 stops in 2012; 50 percent of which involved blacks (overall, the city is 18 percent black); 88 percent of whom were completely innocent -- that a federal judge ruled it unconstitutional. The so-called ""anti-cop campaign"" earned de Blasio 73 percent of New Yorkers' votes. No matter what you think about criminal justice or law enforcement tactics, the mandate could not have been clearer. A mayor's job is to carry out his promises to voters -- and, in this case, to follow orders from a federal court -- not write a blank check for cops.The criticism leveled against the NYPD is not unlike criticism leveled against all levels of our government, by citizens and representatives from all corners of the country, day in and day out since the day free speech has been protected. Are Republicans in Congress inciting violence when they criticize President Obama? Are they out of place? Have they turned their backs on Americans?No, they're doing their job, and carrying out the demands of democracy. Just because cops do important work does not mean they should be immune from criticism. The NYPD is asking for an unprecedented level of immunity that, if granted to every public servant who did important work, would render our democracy nonviable.The reaction from the NYPD is not only disrespectful, illogical, and immature, but also borderline libelous and damaging to the well-being of the city. It's far too convenient for cops to make outlandish claims against Mr. de Blasio, suggesting he is responsible for the murder of two cops, just as the NYPD is coming under legitimate criticism from courts, legislators, executives, and New Yorkers at-large. Instead of turning its back on the mayor and calling ""foul,"" maybe the NYPD should grow up, stare de Blasio and the rest of the city in the face and answer the criticism. That would be nice for a change."
4,POLITICS,Our Prediction For 2015 Is That Most Economic Predictions Will Suck,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/state-of-economic-predictions_n_6392878.html,,2014-12-31,"President Barack Obama speaks during a news conference in the Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House in Washington, Friday, Dec. 19, 2014. The president said the US is making significant strides where it counts, beginning with the economy. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais )",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e27a1f0000000225787e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The American economy, bolstered by a run of decent employment numbers and a party-in-the-USA third-quarter GDP pop, is finally beginning to show signs of health. While this good news didn't arrive in time to help Democrats retain control of the Senate, it still technically qualifies as good news, because ""the economy"" is actually not just a thing that determines whether affluent politicians get to keep their seats. American taxpayers have endured much hardship since the 2008 financial crisis, and pretty much everybody, from career politicians to human beings, will be better off if the economy continues to improve.Speaking of ""pretty much everybody"": It's worth remembering as we head into the new year that anyone -- officeholders, pollsters, whoever thought it was a good idea to make a spaghetti sauce say ""bae"" -- anyone at all can make confident predictions about what the economy is or is not going to do. That doesn't mean we have to pay attention each time. Here, we offer a greatest-hits tour of economic forecasts that did not exactly pan out, with a gentle suggestion that in 2015 we leave this kind of thing to the actual economists.THE WHITE HOUSE: UNBRIDLED OPTIMISM THAT PERHAPS SHOULD HAVE REMAINED BRIDLEDAfter President Barack Obama took office in 2009, a good way to die of cirrhosis would have been to take a shot of liquor every time the White House made mention of the dire economic circumstances they'd inherited. Because those were some dire circumstances indeed, as they reminded us, constantly. Yet at the same time, the administration strove to persuade the public that these Very Grim Realities were somehow going to be dispelled sooner rather than later.Christina Romer, then Obama's chief economist, got the ball rolling during the administration's first term by suggesting the fiscal stimulus package was going to keep the unemployment rate below 8 percent. This, the stimulus package did not do -- it was a moment of oracular straining that Romer would come to regret. Vice President Joe Biden, however, was right alongside Romer, claiming in February 2009 that the stimulus was going to ""literally drop-kick us out of [the] recession"" within 18 months. In a technical sense, the recession did end within that time frame, but not with anything like the momentum of a drop-kick, or even the regular kind of kick.Still, by June 2010, the White House had declared that ""Recovery Summer"" had arrived. The ensuing months, however, were more of a recovery bummer. (See, ""bummer"" rhymes with ""summer,"" and... you get it.) Unemployment remained high, job growth was tepid and the alarming foreclosure crisis continued apace. Economists, meanwhile, were much more inclined to worry about the possibility of a double-dip recession than they were to sift through the whiplashing economic indicators looking for reliable signs of hope. This is not to say the White House's efforts were for naught -- the stimulus package still deserves credit for arresting the economy's perilous descent. But the administration's repeated assurances of good times ahead wrote a political check that reality couldn't cash. As Dean Baker, co-director of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research, told The Hill in 2010: ""People don't understand what the stimulus is about... [Obama] just really lost that debate. I don't doubt it would be worse without their policies, without their stimulus, but it's hard to put too good a face on that.”And so in August 2010 -- Biden's original deadline for the drop-kicked end to our economic woes -- there came a New York Times op-ed from then-Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner titled ""Welcome To The Recovery."" In it, Geithner touted a number of important, tangible gains, but also repeatedly emphasized that the work of revitalization was just getting underway. ""We have a long way to go to address the fiscal trauma and damage across the country,"" he wrote, adding that ""considerable challenges"" still lay ahead.Good thing they didn't print those ""Recovery Summer"" beer cozies! Now, years later, we're starting to see signs of what was prematurely promised. In fact, as Steve Benen recently noted at MSNBC, the White House can take some cheeky satisfaction in the way it delivered on many economic promises faster and better than several of the people who sought to unseat Obama in the 2012 election. Mitt Romney promised to have the unemployment rate under 6 percent by 2016; Obama did it two years sooner. Tim Pawlenty said that the key to getting 5 percent GDP growth was to offer the wealthy some generous tax breaks; Obama raised those taxes and hit 5 percent anyway. And Newt Gingrich famously vowed that he'd get gas prices down to $2.50 per gallon (after predicting that Obama would bring America $10-a-gallon gas). The ability of presidents to affect gas prices is highly overrated, but if we're keeping score -- most states currently have prices lower than what Gingrich promised.Which brings us to our next point -- as little as you could rely on the White House for accurate economic predictions, the opposing side hasn't been much better.OBAMA'S CRITICS: TOO MUCH DOW, TOO MUCH DYSTOPIAThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is a highly overrated indicator of economic health, and I would not recommend that you assign it too much importance when trying to determine whether a nationwide economic recovery is afoot. Having said that, let's have a little fun with the fact that last week, the Dow closed above 16,000 for the first time ever. This is mainly worth noting because so many people have in recent years predicted the incipient demise of the stock market, as well as, like, the very concepts of money and ownership.In March 2009, for example, Michael Boskin -- a Stanford University economics professor and former economic adviser to President George H.W. Bush -- wrote a piece for The Wall Street Journal called ""Obama's Radicalism Is Killing The Dow."" In this piece, Boskin claimed that Obama, for some reason, wanted to ""change the foundation of American capitalism."" It's hard not to see the continued sell-off on Wall Street and the growing fear on Main Street as a product, at least in part, of the realization that our new president's policies are designed to radically re-engineer the market-based U.S. economy, not just mitigate the recession and financial crisis.This was an odd conclusion to reach from the mere fact that there were a handful of policy prescriptives that Boskin didn't support -- like imposing a cap-and-trade plan (which never materialized), reforming health care (which did happen, but not in the form of the government-provided universal health care option that Boskin seemed to believe was in the offing), and raising taxes on the wealthy (which came about somewhat by allowing some of the George W. Bush-era tax cuts to expire). Obama also didn't manage to make the cuts to earned benefit programs that Boskin called for in his column (though not for lack of trying).Overall, Boskin wrote a solid piece enumerating his preferred economic policies -- but as the White House didn't actually ""radically re-engineer the market-based U.S. economy"" after all, perhaps it would be good of him now to acknowledge that he should have rejected that thesis in favor of ""Here is my conservative economic policy philippic, you guys.""He never even got around to describing how all of this was going to ""kill the Dow,"" which, again, has done great.(Hat tip to The Washington Post's Matt O'Brien, whose own thoughts on ""the worst op-ed in history"" are certainly worth your time.)Boskin was hardly alone in his weird Dow doomsaying. During a March 2010 episode of CNBC's ""The Kudlow Report,"" Larry Kudlow and Jim Cramer batted around the idea that Obamacare would be a Dow-killer.KUDLOW: You are saying that Obamacare will topple the stock market. This is a huge issue. Let me get your first take.As Media Matters was happy to note, the Dow finished up 43.91 points the day after the House of Representatives passed the Affordable Care Act.What's funny is that anyone interested in critiquing Obama on this issue already had plenty of material available. The slow pace of the recovery, coupled with the White House's habit of overpromising, meant there were more than enough opportunities to point out room for improvement. But often, Obama's critics depicted the economy as if they'd just come from their Young Adult Dystopian Literature class at the Learning Annex. It was not uncommon for people -- most of them in or adjacent to politics -- to suggest that the White House was bent on actually destroying the economy. Former U.S. Rep. Allen West (R-Fla.) asserted this as fact. Rep. Pete Session (R-Texas) insisted that Obama wanted to ""inflict damage on the free enterprise system, if not... kill it,"" and also that Obama sought to ""diminish employment and diminish stock prices"" in order to permanently consolidate power. I don't actually understand that's supposed to work, but then again I do not do too much laudanum.Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.), likewise, offered a characteristically unique reading of the situation in 2009. ""If you want to look at economic history over the last 100 years, I call it punctuated equilibrium,"" she told conservative radio host Bill Bennett. ""If you look at FDR, LBJ and Barack Obama, this is really the final leap to socialism."" (Anyone tracking corporate profits since Obama took office would have to conclude that this is a different approach to socialism than we're used to.)A BRIEF COMEDIC INTERLUDEIt might be fun at this point just to pause and laugh at some people who've offered terrible economic advice to the Obama administration over the years. Go ahead and relive the memories of career pollsters Douglas E. Schoen and Patrick H. Caddell advising Obama not to seek re-election for the sake of the country. From the faltering economy to the burdensome deficit to our foreign policy struggles, America is suffering a widespread sense of crisis and anxiety about the future. Under these circumstances, Obama has the opportunity to seize the high ground and the imagination of the nation once again, and to galvanize the public for the hard decisions that must be made. The only way he can do so, though, is by putting national interests ahead of personal or political ones.Then proceed to journalist Michael Kinsley's bizarre 2013 assertion that Obama should give in to Republican demands to delay the implementation of the Affordable Care Act in return for a debt ceiling increase -- because that would somehow teach the Republicans a lesson.The media will no doubt call Obama weak because he gave in. So let them. Sticks and stones. Meanwhile, will the Republicans really take the past couple of weeks as a precedent and push him around on every issue that comes up? Highly unlikely. They are already getting most of the blame. They surely don’t look forward to trying to convince voters it was such a swell experience that they’re going to put us through it again and again.WHAT NOW?We've had some fun here, but make no mistake, these are still precarious economic times for most of the 99 percent. It's good that GDP growth is up, better still that unemployment is down. I suspect we're still a couple of years away from being able to fully evaluate whether the Affordable Care Act delivered on its promise to enroll more of America's uninsured while keeping health care costs manageable, but early signs are encouraging. That said, here are two things worth focusing on in the near future.1. The quality of jobs. Always remember that while it's nice to see the U-4 unemployment rate come down, low unemployment is all for naught if American workers don't actually have quality jobs with decent pay and benefits. If the future of American employment is schlepping around an Amazon fulfillment center as a glorified temp, that's really no future at all. And for all the ""innovation"" in what we're euphemistically calling ""the sharing economy,"" there's still a lag in critical labor rights for the people who perform the daily IRL work that makes ""digital entrepreneurship"" possible.2. Wage growth, or the conspicuous lack thereof. Via Mother Jones' Kevin Drum, this is the real recovery bummer: ""This is the basic lay of the land. Yes, the economy is improving and jobs are becoming more plentiful. But most of us have seen our pay stagnate for four years and counting. That's one of the reasons the public mood remains so sour.""I, personally, would venture that this isn't going to change anytime soon. But let me remind you: I am not an economist. And most of the people who will strive to convince you in 2015 that certain things are or are not going to happen will also not be economists. Politicians have their own reasons, obviously, for confidently telling the public that X, Y and Z are in the cards. A great thing we can do, next year and every year, is to keep in mind that just because someone is talking where you can hear them, it doesn't mean they know what they are talking about.[Would you like to follow me on Twitter? Because why not?]"

And, as many people know well, around 30 days later is when we'll break those resolutions.According to Amy Cuddy, a social psychologist and Harvard Business School professor, these resolutions could actually be doing more harm than good. The problem is simple: We're setting ourselves up for failure... and failure isn't a very good motivator. We tend to set unreasonable aims for ourselves, she explained, and then experience negative emotions and a lack of motivation when we don't reach them. Failing to meet the unreasonable goals we set for ourselves can in turn take a negative toll on our self-worth. ""We're really bad at setting reasonable goals,"" Cuddy, who has researched goal-setting extensively, recently told Business Insider.Part of the problem is that we frame our resolutions in absolutes, according to Cuddy. ""People are making absolute statements about what they're going to do, and that's setting them up for failure immediately,"" Cuddy told Business Insider, ""because they're not always going to go to the gym three times a week.""Indeed, research has found that failure can impair performance on future tasks unrelated to the prior failure. Failure can also cause us to overestimate the difficulties of our goals, underestimate our own abilities and can quell our motivation, according to psychologist Guy Winch. So what happens when you do fail to meet a goal, and you need to get back on your feet? Winch advises trying to be aware of the way that failure may distort your perception and self-image. ""Recognize that failure distorts your perceptions about the task itself and about your capacities. Don’t ‘buy’ that you are incapable,"" he writes in Psychology Today. ""Adopt a mindset of persistence and optimism."""

After years of skirting rumors of ill health, Franklin is currently touring with tracks from Aretha Franklin Sings the Great Diva Classics. Franklin pulsed onstage to the standing, all but sold out Verizon Hall in Philly Dec. 29, already in strong voice belting out Jackie Wilson's soul classic Your Love Keeps on Lifting me Higher and late in the show, serenading with The Way We Were. In between Franklin illustrating themes from both numbers. Aretha was intimate with the audience throughout the night and fondly remembered her start in Philly at the famed jazz club Pep's on South Broad St. and expressed appreciation for Philly's gospel legend Clara Ward and radio personalities Mary Mason and Georgie Woods. At 72, Franklin's voice isn't what it was and she navigates air pockets, raspiness and evaporation points that can still cruise right into her iconic vocal power. The contrasts actually adds to the intensity of the performance. But in performance, Aretha goes for it, full throttle and full-throated.

After years of skirting rumors of ill health, Franklin is currently touring with tracks from Aretha Franklin Sings the Great Diva Classics. Franklin pulsed onstage to the standing, all but sold out Verizon Hall in Philly Dec. 29, already in strong voice belting out Jackie Wilson's soul classic Your Love Keeps on Lifting me Higher and late in the show, serenading with The Way We Were.

While Solomon's Winning Marriage is rich, certainly there are other stories still to be told.",2014-12-31,2014-12-30-140421_OUT_ForcingSpringCOVER.jpg.CROP.promovarmedium2.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-30-140421_OUT_ForcingSpringCOVER.jpg.CROP.promovarmedium2-thumb.jpg,"The race to write a triumphal history of the struggle for marriage equality for lesbians and gay men has begun. During 2014, publishers released two substantial books tracing the recent past. In the spring, Jo Becker's Forcing the Spring debuted with much fanfare and press attention. This fall, Marc Solomon's Winning Marriage entered bookstores with somewhat less attention, a shame because Winning Marriage is by far a superior book. While both of these books provide an emergent history, much of the history of marriage equality remains to be written. History, like science, is ""a cumulative process.""In Winning Marriage, Solomon organizes his narrative around four main struggles for marriage recognition. He begins in Massachusetts where he worked with the Massachusetts Freedom to Marry Coalition as a volunteer and paid lobbyist. The narrative that Solomon provides from the moment of the court decision to the final vote by the legislature to not amend the constitution prohibiting lesbians and gay men from marrying is fast-paced and compelling. Solomon profiles state legislators, gay and lesbian couples and activists demonstrating grassroots support for the law and documenting the extensive organizing efforts to secure marriage in the first state with the freedom to marry.Solomon then continues with the story of securing marriage equality through the legislature in New York and winning at the ballot boxes, with particular attention to Maine, Minnesota and Washington. He concludes with President Barack Obama's evolution on marriage and the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Windsor. Solomon is an engaging narrator throughout the book, never too intrusive. He consistently provides compelling and interesting detail while keeping the narrative moving forward. Most impressive in Winning Marriage is its commitment to recognizing multiple people -- activists, legislators, lobbyists and just plain interested citizens -- and their role in the struggle for marriage equality. In Solomon's hands, the story of marriage equality is multi-vocal, even cacophonous, with an array of people working with commitment to achieve the goal.This characterization is, of course, in sharp contrast to Becker's narrative in Forcing the Spring. Becker, a Pulitzer-prize winning, New York Times journalist selected an elite group of white men to be the focus of her narrative, thinking that they would certainly be the people to lead the historic change. Through Forcing the Spring, Becker seeks to lionize Chad Griffin by placing him alongside legal lions, Ted Olson and David Boies. Of course, it was not their case against Proposition 8 that was the winner at the Supreme Court -- it was the case of Robbie Kaplan litigating on behalf of Edie Windsor. Similarly, Becker's narrative to lionize Griffin fails.Forcing the Spring is organized into four parts, pivoting around what Becker imagines as a dynamic and dramatic court case. She even alludes to the Scopes monkey trial to situate the historic significance of the case. The first section of Forcing the Spring chronicles the lead up to the trial, including the assembly of the cast of characters, which in comparison to Solomon's rich story is paltry. Most striking is how ungenerous Becker is to LGBT activists; her derisive characterizations of movement activists is both mean-spirited and fails to recognize the multiple elements necessary for social movement success. The second section is a day-by-day recap of the trial and, much like the HBO film, The Case Against 8, a dry and boring experience. It takes great artistry to make art out of trials.The third and fourth sections of Forcing the Spring open further, almost into an interesting narrative. After the district court trial, the political environment heats up for marriage, and Becker looks outside of the single case providing interesting history about Obama's evolution and the myriad of options the Appellate and Supreme Courts had with the case.At one point, Becker almost seems to recognize the differences between the Proposition 8 case and the Windsor case, writing, ""The teams were as different as could be. The Proposition 8 team was led by two straight men; Kaplan's was predominantly female, and led by three lesbians"" (361). It is almost as if she can see a broader community working on marriage equality but not quite. Becker continually focuses narrowly on her selected, elite subjects, resulting in a book that ultimately feels short-sighted, narrow, and unreliable.If journalism is a first draft of history, the movement for marriage equality deserves many more drafts quickly. While Solomon's Winning Marriage is rich, certainly there are other stories still to be told. When a more comprehensive history has been drafted, Becker's Forcing the Spring can wrap day-old fish."

The gerund constructed from the verb refers to a state of being that manifests both individually in say the ambivalence of an uncommitted relationship or collectively in the kind of indecision that countries or leaders or often accused of. President Obama was criticized for waffling when it came to responding to the Assad regime's use of chemical weapons. But let's go back to the everyday waffle for help. Pancakes which are made from a similar batter generally have a smooth surface though their edges may be somewhat irregular due to the way the batter is poured into the griddle on which they're cooked. A waffle on the other hand, which is usually cooked in an iron, has rectilinear edges with a surface that's punctured by squares or rectangles which are smaller versions of the whole. The waffle then is a little like a play within a play and therein lies the basis of waffling. What is the most famous play within a play of all time? The ""Murder of the Gonzago,"" in Hamlet and of course Hamlet is the greatest waffler of all time. He doesn't even know whether he himself wants to be or not. Indecision can be a curse and Hamlet suffers from the doubting disease. But did his neurosis go back to his problems growing up in the shadow of his father in Elsinore. Was he the eponymous waffler? And was president Obama perhaps given too many waffles as a kid? Perhaps after finishing his monumental history of Johnson, Robert Caro will turn his attention to Obama and we will finally know.Hamlet, Act III, Scene III (Delacroix, 1843){This was originally posted to The Screaming Pope, Francis Levy's blog of rants and reactions to contemporary politics, art and culture}"

According to news reports, the 15-year-old has lost her entire family in the recent AirAsia tragedy. Otherwise, please join me in praying for hope and comfort for Chiara, as well as everybody else who has been affected.Dear Chiara,My name is Karen, and I'm a 23-year-old Indonesian girl. I read about you in stories covering the recent AirAsia tragedy. My heart grew heavy as I learned that you have so suddenly lost the people I imagine had been closest to you. I was filled with an overwhelming urge to get in touch with you, but I didn't know how, so I started emailing the editors of Singaporean newspapers. But I realized I didn't want to waste any time. To people who aren't in deep pain, another day is just another few hours that invariably tick by. But for those in agony, time stalls and you find yourself in an abyss where past, present, and future meld together. And so I'm writing to you here, and I hope you see this. I don't have magic words or any big promises. To be honest, I don't know how I can help you, except to tell you that you are not alone. Maybe you have many strangers trying to reach you with a word of comfort right now, or maybe they, like me, don't know how. Maybe you will read this and you wouldn't be able to take me too seriously because I don't know your pain, but I just need to do something and I pray I can help in some way.Before I say anything else, I want you to know that I am and will continue to pray for your father, your mother, as well as your brothers, Nico and Justin. I believe in a God whose love and mercy is unparalleled, and I pray that He, with the intercessions of the saints and angels, will lead your family members' souls to heaven. And I know I'm not the only one praying for them.I don't know much about you other than the few details I could find in those articles. If I gather correctly, you are an Indonesian studying in Singapore. If so, we have at least one thing in common. I was also born and raised in Indonesia. In 1998, my parents sent me and my older sister to Singapore to get a better education. We lived apart from the rest of our family for quite a while, before they were able to join us more regularly when our youngest sister got older. Between then and now, we've relied on airplanes to take either our parents to Singapore, or us to Indonesia. Once or twice I've imagined the possibility of a disaster, but never too seriously. Words cannot express how sorry I am that this has happened to you. As I thought about you, I couldn't imagine anyone feeling more alone than you must have felt when you received the news. But at the same time, I also thought, wow, that this girl is somewhere out there right now, wow, she is strong.Dear Chiara, I don't know your pain, and I don't know your fears. All I can offer is any empathy or insight that could come from having been clinically depressed a few times in my life. Each time, reality and facts would become so distorted in my mind that I believed with every fiber of my being that I was alone, and that I had nothing left. I pulled through with the unsolicited help of some very unexpected people in my life. For example, a friend of my ex-boyfriend's parents reached out to me and became a listening ear and a constant source of support. Who would have thought? Well, God intervenes in our lives in very unexpected ways. Dear Chiara, I hope during this time you will be open to even the most unexpected sources of support. Dear Chiara, this must sound most contrived, but how I wish I could give you a hug.I am and will continue to pray for you, my sister. Many things may not make sense right now, but have hope in a God who knows and sees more than we do. Where we see no open doors, He sees one that we don't even know exists. You are very strong, and you are very loved.Chiara, please feel free to contact me anytime at all.

(Photo by Leigh Vogel/WireImage)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e297200000c70101d699.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In 1975, a report released by a special Senate Committee found ""concrete evidence of at least eight plots involving the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) to assassinate Fidel Castro."" The report detailed the various plans hatched during the 1960s to assassinate the Communist leader using poison pills and cigars, a ball-point pen outfitted with a deadly hypodermic needle, an exotic seashell rigged to explode, and a contaminated diving suit. Of course, these efforts -- just like the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion -- failed to remove the Cuban leader from power and led to President Ford's 1976 ban on political assassinations. Earlier this month, President Obama took steps to end another failed U.S. policy -- the trade and travel embargoes against Cuba that have been in place since the early 1960s. As the president noted, this sanctions policy ""has had little effect beyond providing the Cuban government with a rationale for restrictions on its people.""By isolating Cuba, America hoped to undermine the Castro regime and promote democratic reform. But after more than 50 years and 10 U.S. presidents, it is clear that this policy hasn't worked. Today, Cuba is still a one-party state ruled by the Castros and the Communist Party. Cuba's 11 million citizens lack basic rights such as freedom of expression and association. The Castro regime suppresses all forms of dissent and has a record of human rights abuses including arbitrary arrest and detention, harassment and intimidation. It is time to reject the failed policies of the past and chart a new course that will better serve America's interests and improve the lives of Cubans and their families. And President Obama's decision to normalize relations with Cuba is the right approach. Instead of punishing Cuban citizens by restricting trade, travel and remittances, we will help empower them. The president's new policy will support entrepreneurship, the private sector and civil society in Cuba, and expand Cubans' access to new sources of information. Supporting and engaging the Cuban people is the best way to promote American values and ideals.Instead of alienating regional and international partners with our unilateral sanctions policy against Cuba, we will reinvigorate America's leadership role in improving the future for all Cubans. This means continued strong support for democratic reforms and universal human rights. Instead of stifling trade and investment in Cuba, we will expand export opportunities for American businesses. These changes will give more Cubans access to U.S. goods including building materials, farm equipment and communications devices and services -- improving living standards and encouraging economic independence. But our economy won't see the full benefits of this new policy until Congress lifts the embargo against Cuba. I had a chance to see some of those potential benefits firsthand when I traveled to Cuba in 2002 with a delegation from California's agricultural community. What I said at the time remains true today: ""Current U.S. policies of trade and travel restrictions have not worked. By opening trade and travel, we can begin to bring positive change to the Cuban people and enhance our economy at home."" That is why I will urge the Senate to take this issue up next year. This is the beginning of a new chapter in U.S.-Cuba relations. We have finally turned the page on the past. Now let's make the most of the future for the American people and the Cuban people.This post is part of a Huffington Post blog series called ""90 Miles: Rethinking the Future of U.S.-Cuba Relations.""

The Belgian Catholic Church was last year rocked by revelations of nearly 500 cases of abuse by priests since the 1950s, including 13 known suicides among victims. AFP PHOTO / JOHANNA GERON - BELGIUM OUT - (Photo credit should read JOHANNA GERON/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7f6e8200000c10101899d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A Belgian bishop is bravely standing up for love.Bishop Johan Bonny of Antwerp, Belgium has called on the Catholic Church to recognize the caring and committed relationships of gay and lesbian couples around the world.Bonny made the remarks in a December 27 interview with the Belgian newspaper De Morgen. He pointed out that just as civil society recognizes that there are several different ways that people can be partnered for life, the church should also recognize that relationships come in a “diversity of forms.” ""We have to look inside the church for a formal recognition of the kind of interpersonal relationship that is also present in many gay couples,” the bishop said, according to a translation provided by the National Catholic Reporter. “The intrinsic values are more important to me than the institutional question. The Christian ethic is based on lasting relationships where exclusivity, loyalty, and care are central to each other.""Bonny said that heterosexual relationships still hold a “particular sacramental character” within the church. But he doesn’t think that the conversation should end there.“This particularity does not have to be exclusive nor does it have to close the door on a diversity of relationships whose inner qualities the church can acknowledge,” he said.“Personally, I find that in the church more space must be given to acknowledge the actual quality of gay and lesbian couples; and such a form of shared-life should meet the same criteria as found in an ecclesiastical marriage,” he said. “…And we have to acknowledge that such criteria can be found in a diversity of relationships and one needs to search for various models to give form to those relationships.”Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit priest and editor at large of America magazine, cautioned that Bonny is not calling for the Catholic church to start performing same-sex marriages. Rather, he seems to be inviting the church to realize that gay unions have positive qualities that the church can recognize and perhaps even bless. His comments recall the initial report from the Synod on the Family, which said that committed gay relationships have ""gifts and talents"" to offer the Christian community. (That language was removed from the final report.) So we shouldn't overemphasize what Bishop Bonny is saying: after all, he's only one bishop. On the other hand, we shouldn't underemphasize it either: it's quite revolutionary.This isn’t the first time Bonny has expressed a desire for a more openness towards same-sex couples. Prior to the October’s Synod of the Bishops, Bonny penned a letter to the Vatican urging the church to come to terms with the reality on the ground -- that modern believers are “no longer able to agree with the dogmatic texts and moral statements coming from Rome.” He insisted that this discord on matters like relationships, sexuality, marriage, and the family has grown over time. As a solution, he put forward the examples given by Jesus and his disciples. They were close to people . . . They were free and they brought joy; they welcomed the lost and the condemned back into the centre of the circle; they called for compassion and forgiveness; they rejected every use of power and violence; they preferred to take the last place and they believed in the power of love, a love that does not count on reward.Pope Francis’ willingness to engage with previously taboo topics has given him courage to speak up, NCR reports.New Ways Ministry, an organization that seeks to build bridges between the LGBT community and the Catholic Church, strongly applauded Bonny’s call for the ecclesiastical recognition of same-gender couples.“Bishop Bonny’s statements will have a profound effect on this discussion because he is raising an idea which has too long been suppressed, but which many in the Church have desired. He gives voice to a major segment of Catholicism which has previously been voiceless,” executive director Francis DeBernardo said in a statement. “Courage breeds courage. Let’s pray that other bishops will follow Bishop Bonny’s example and speak out for recognizing the holiness in the committed relationships of lesbian and gay couples.”"

(Photo by Mike Marsland/WireImage)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb49768200000e500007dfc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Into the Woods is one of the most highly anticipated movies of the year. The Stephen Sondheim Broadway musical has long been an audience favorite and its adaptation to the screen had theater lovers going wild with excitement. Then when the cast, headed by Meryl Streep as the Witch, was announced, anticipation inched up even higher.Now it is in theaters and some of the excitement has cooled down. It isn't that the cast doesn't do its best to bring this fairy tale adventure to fulfillment. It isn't that the songs aren't some of the best Sondheim has ever written. It isn't that the look of the movie isn't gorgeous. Its just that something, some little something is awry.Maybe it is in Streep's portrayal of the Witch. She gives a true Streep performance and also adds in some better singing ability than she showed in Mama Mia. Still the Witch cries out to be shown as wicked with a sense of humor. You can tell that in some of her best lines -- ""No .... you have a sister."" That line should be purred, not just stated.Or maybe it is the throwaway use of Tracey Ullman's talent as Jack's mother. Granted the role as written is not big, but each time Ullman is seen she says her lines and there is a quick cutaway from her. Ullman is a major talent and deserves more screen time at least visually.Or maybe it is the elimination of the song ""No More"" which is used in the play to draw everything together. I though the finale needed something to let you know this group of surviving characters were going to be okay. They had come through a lot after ""happily ever after"" and needed to show their cohesiveness. This song would have helped with that. As is the ""group"" seems too individualized to make it as a whole.Keeping the whole project to a PG level might also have been a mistake. There are some dark doings going on in Into the Woods. If the Baker's wife (Emily Blunt) had been shown to have a more flirtatious side or even to have been overly impressed with nobility, her slip in the forest might have been more acceptable. Granted the Baker (James Corden) and his spouse don't seem to be an overly romantic couple but they do seem loyal in their quest to have a child.Lastly the last few scenes which cover the deaths of several characters don't have the emotional impact they should. It all seems a little rushed as each character moves on to his/her new life. A tear here or there should have been shed for that which was lost.There is a lot to like in Into the Woods but there is also a lot more that should have been better. If the playfulness and emotions inherent in Sondheim's songs had been delivered, the movie would not have been just good -- it would have been great. Then I could have scored the film higher than the 6 out of 10 I gave it. Jackie K Cooper www.jackiekcooper.com"

18,QUEER VOICES,The Top 2014 LGBT Stories From Latin America,"Javier Corrales, ContributorProfessor of Political Science, Amherst College",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-top-2014-lgbt-stories-from-latin-america_b_6399758.html,"The region continues to be at the forefront of some of the most progressive lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) events in the world, often with the support from the United States.",2014-12-31,"Rainbow flags in the wind. The rainbow flag, sometimes called 'the freedom flag', is commonly used as a symbol of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) pride and diversity.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafd3de1f00002501231d1d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Latin America made world headlines in 2013 when Uruguay and Brazil, following the lead of Argentina in 2010, legalized same-sex marriage. In legal terms, nothing happened in the region this year that compares to last year's big gay-marriage stories from Uruguay and Brazil. Nevertheless, the region continues to be at the forefront of some of the most progressive lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) events in the world, often with the support from the United States. From a famous diver coming out to lesbians in office revealing their love, here is my list of the top 10 LGBT stories in 2014 from our neighbors to the South.  10. Goya goes gay. Not typically known for its defense of gay rights, Venezuela wins its first Goya Award (equivalent to the Spanish Oscars) for Best Latin American Film with the movie, ""Blue and not so Pink,"" by director Michael Ferrari. The movie tells the story of a gay father reuniting with his teenage son.9. Gay Diplomacy. At a meeting of the Organization of American States, Brazil with the support of the United States and various other members introduced a resolution condemning all forms of discrimination against people motivated by sexual orientation and gender identity and expression. It urges OAS countries to eliminate, where they exist, barriers that prevent ""lesbians, gays and bisexuals, transgender and intersex people"" from taking part in public life and the political process. 8. Anti-Gay Diplomacy. The Paraguayan Episcopal Conference, the Paraguayan Association of Evangelical Pastors, and the Paraguayan Association of Evangelical Churches openly opposed the OAS resolution. There were protests in favor and against the resolution in the Paraguayan capital. In addition, more than 47,000 people signed a petition on CitizenGo asking the OAS to protect itself from ""the imposition from feminist and homosexual pressure groups."" 7. Separation of Church and Congress. Anti-gay evangelical pastor Javier Soto interrupted a session of Chile's House of Deputies to protest a bill that would give legal protections to unmarried couples (the Acuerdo de Vida en Pareja). After his full-tilt meltdown, Mr. Soto was ejected from Congress. 6. Not All Bishops are Created Equal. In a country where most of the high clergy is publicly homophobic, Catholic Bishop Raúl Vera López of Saltillo made headlines by directly criticizing homophobia. In an interview published by Spanish daily, El País, Vera López declared: ""The people who say homosexuals are sick are sick themselves."" He also said: ""The Church needs approach to [homosexuals] not with condemnation, but with dialogue."" 5. In Tom We Trust. Inspired by British Olympic diver Tom Dailey's decision to come out in 2013 as a bisexual man, top Brazilian diver Ian Matos publicly came out in 2014. Matos also revealed that he was advised by many to wait until after the Rio 2016 Olympics to come out to avoid jeopardizing endorsements. 4. Husband and Husband. Six months after their controversial arrival in Santo Domingo, U.S. Ambassador to the Dominican Republic, James ""Wally"" Brewster and his husband Bob Satawake released an official video on occasion of LGBT Pride Month 2014. They talked about the importance of fighting homophobia in the Dominican Republic and abroad. 3. Hate Crime Refuge.  Taking advantage of Costa Rica's policy of granting refuge to victims of hate crimes, activists from Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and El Salvador presented lawmaker and legislative Human Rights Commission Secretary Epsy Campbell with a white paper documenting cases of LGBT victims of violence. The paper claims that five LGBT people are killed in hate crimes every month. 2. It's never too late. Shortly before winning re-election, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos announced his support for same-sex unions. In 2011, Colombia's Constitutional Court ruled that same-sex couples should have access to the rights and benefits provided by marriage and made moves within the government to ensure that the decision was respected at all levels, but congress has failed to legislate on the matter.1. Lesbians Rule. Speaking of Colombia, Angélica Lozano Correa was elected in 2014 to the Colombian House of Representative, becoming the first openly lesbian national legislator in Colombia. She has publicly claimed that any peace agreement in Colombia must involve reparations to LGBT individuals, given that both sides of the conflict engaged in LGBT-related hate crimes. In 2014, she also revealed being in a relationship with Senator Claudia López. This prompted a lawsuit against them, spearheaded by Víctor Velásquez, a former senator and current Evangelical pastor, based on Article 179 of the Constitution, which bans two people in a relationship (marriage or permanent union) to serve in Congress. Ironically, Lozano and López contend that because marriage equality and civil unions are not legal in Colombia, this constitutional stipulation does not apply. The lawsuit against Lozano and López happened on the heels of revelations by two female cabinet members, Commerce Minister Cecilia Álvarez and Education Minister Gina Parody that they were involved in a ""sentimental relationship"" with each other. No other Latin American country has had this degree of coming out, let alone, lesbian openness, on the part of high-ranking, national-level politicians."
