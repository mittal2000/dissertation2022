Make the best of your time at Yosemite National Park thanks to these tips. Camp or LodgeThe beauty of Yosemite National Park is that you can choose to either camp out or opt to stay in a lodge. Be warned though, a summer trip requires advance reservation for both the on-site hotel, the Ahwahnee Hotel, or any of the campgrounds. If you are unable to plan your visit too far in advance, there are many alternatives right on the borders of the park grounds. Check out the official Yosemite National Park website for options.That said, there really isn't anything quite like being right in the park. Can't make a summer reservation? Don't worry. Winter at Yosemite is less popular, but equally gorgeous. Embrace the outdoors through a family hikeWhen you're at home, it's often hard to convince your kids to disconnect and come take a hike with their parents. The beauty about visiting national parks with them is that there are few electronics and limited access to WiFi. This makes it the perfect time to hike together as a family. Throughout the park there are plenty of trails and hiking opportunities. Take it slow and easy and enjoy being surprised by what your kids can accomplish. Make sure that first hike is an easy one and work your way up from there. The family that hikes together, stays together - Image by Girl Gone TravelCooling offOne of the best ways to motivate your kids to go on a hike through the forest is to promise them a dip in any one of the park's bodies of water. Of course, there are a few places where swimming is not allowed, but, as long as you are cautious, you can find a spot to swim in easily enough at Yosemite. Our favorite, despite the frigid temperatures, was Tenaya Lake, which you'll find between Yosemite Valley and Tuolumne Meadows. At an elevation of 8,150 feet, this alpine lake is freezing even in the middle of the summer. But after a long hike, it's an incredibly refreshing way to cool-off.

Erin Lee Carr, daughter of the New York Times' David Carr, did it by focusing on the wisdom he left behind.I was in the passenger seat as my dad steered our family's SUV in the direction of my first internship, at Fox Searchlight Pictures. He ignored the car wedging into our lane and turned my way. ""Who's your supervisor?"" he asked. ""Who's head of the company? What films of theirs do you like?"" Family Man: David Carr, with Erin, center, and her twin, Meagan, when they were about four (Photo: Courtesy of Erin Lee Carr)I mumbled something about how I'd loved the acerbic side of Juno, which the studio had put out about a year earlier. My dad shook his head, lit a cigarette, and said, ""No one is going to take you seriously if you don't take the job seriously. Do your f--king homework.""I hadn't even started yet, but this was still a defining moment in my career. My dad's message stuck with me: Do the work and know what you're talking about.To our family he was a wise, generous and devoted father. He had a remarkable voice, a raspy one that often ended in a laugh. To the world he was a famed media columnist for The New York Times, author of the memoir The Night of the Gun, and star of Page One, a documentary about the Times. His life was colorful, with stints in restaurants and on drugs and, later, with babies and bylines. He often said to me and my twin sister, Meagan, ""Everything good started with you."" Being a dad to us and our little sister, Maddie, was a chief joy, in large part because it pulled him out of the depths of addiction and toward the man he would become. I didn't know David the drug addict; I knew David the loving dad.As I followed him into the media world (documentary film is my field), he counseled me on the best way to get my voice heard. ""Don't be the first to speak,"" he would tell me. ""But if you do, say something important."" I took notes every time we spoke on the phone about my work, and if he didn't hear the click of the keyboard, he'd ask why I wasn't committing his advice to paper (or pixels). The day before he died, I had a work issue and called to ask if he had five minutes to help me sort it out. His answer: ""I always have time for you.""He was constantly typing, talking, learning, moving. He had a hunger for knowledge, trivial or monumental, and he expected me and my sisters to share that curiosity. When I was a teenager, he assigned books for us to read. He issued quizzes to ensure that our vocabulary was as extensive as he thought it should be. (The family later begged me to cut back on my use of copacetic.) He taught us to challenge information, places, and people -- and never, ever to settle for less than the best of anything. He never did.The night of February 12, 2015, I watched my dad speak onstage in New York City to filmmaker Laura Poitras, journalist Glenn Greenwald, and (by way of video conference from Russia) government-secrets leaker Edward Snowden. After the talk was over, I sneaked backstage to give him a bear hug. He introduced me to Greenwald, who said, ""Your dad is your biggest fan."" I quickly replied, ""I'm his.""We stepped outside, into the brutal winter hellscape that is February in New York City. My dad had quit smoking only four days before, and he looked exhausted. I gave him a hug and told him I loved him. I left for the subway; he got into a cab. It was the last time anyone in our family would see him alive.I got the call from my stepmom. My dad had been found unconscious on the floor at the Times. He hadn't been in the best of health. If you knew about his bout with cancer and years of substance abuse, you might have expected this day would come. But I never imagined it. To me, Dad was invincible.I rushed to Mount Sinai Roosevelt hospital, sobbing in the cab as I called my best friend. When I paid the fare, my driver mumbled, ""I'm sorry."" I nodded but had no words. Big Fans: Erin and her dad at the 2012 US Open (Photo: David Carey)I walked into the hospital and found out: It was over. My dad had died. My stepmom and I went to his bedside, but before I could say goodbye, my phone started buzzing. Word had broken that my dad had passed away. Someone had tweeted about his death. I was filled with rage. Couldn't I have at least 30 seconds to comprehend what had happened without having to hear the Internet's take?Couldn't the loss of the most important man in my life be my own, if only for one quiet moment? My stepmom and I raced to call my sisters, reaching them, thankfully, before the news went viral. It felt unfair to rush through the most difficult words I would ever say just so I could beat the Internet.As I sat in the grief room, my phone still buzzing, I couldn't help but look at the things that were being said about my dad on Twitter. Over the course of the following week, countless tweets and beautifully crafted pieces of writing would appear on the Web and in print. For The Atlantic, my dad's friend and protégé Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote a moving tribute called ""King David,"" about how powerfully motivating it was to have someone like my dad rooting for him. The day after he died, my dad made the front page of The New York Times -- in Irish tribute, we hung it on our front door.Hundreds flocked to his wake and funeral -- musicians, weirdos, writers, media tycoons, schoolteachers, coworkers, and gangsters. I realized how many roles my dad filled for other people. He was a friend, secret sharer, mentor, boss, ally. Several women (myself included) spoke about my dad's devotion to feminism. My father was one of seven kids from an Irish Catholic family -- he would have loved the attention.The other day I got some good news and, wanting to share it, reflexively typed ""dad"" into my phone. There are moments in grief when the finality sets in, and here it was: I would never be able to hear his voice again. But I've realized, strangely, that instead of resenting the Internet, I'm grateful for it. I can tap Dad's name into Twitter and be flooded with the lessons he shared with others, including some he never had a chance to share with me.

He was there when I was in the Girl Scouts, standing alongside my mother as I went door to door selling cookies. It was for that same troop that he volunteered to play Santa and months before that, when he dressed up as a scary creature for a Halloween party on the military base where we lived. There were father-daughter dances, the time he took me to the hospital during a dehydration episode and many instances of playing ""guess the profession"" as we'd people watch while waiting for my train to arrive and take me to my job in New York City. Then, this past February, my father said goodbye. Moments we shared together were no longer simple memories, but rather ones jolted from my mind by the incessant, rhythmic ventilator that made his chest rise, then fall with predictable precision. Thin Mints, bicycle rides and laughs ebbed and flowed in between images of his body, reduced to a fragile man nearing his end on this earth. Even still, I cannot think of past memories without visuals from the recent, upsetting one nudging their way in. While some people find comfort in reading books about life after death or engaging in meditative practices to help themselves heal (both of which I've been doing), I've found that the simple act of sleep has allowed me to find the peace I need during this time. No, this isn't about trying to sleep off -- and therefore not acknowledge -- my feelings. Quite simply, after my father's death caused by metastatic melanoma, I've had numerous dreams about him. As I go to bed, I am excited knowing I will dream and that when I do, I'll likely hear his voice and see his face just as I did during my 40 years with him. My sleeping hours have been filled with vivid details for as long as I can remember. Many of these dreams I'd share with my father, often discussing the previous night's recollections just for fun. Sure, we spoke of work, family and world events, but sharing my dreams with my dad became our ""thing,"" something I'd later learn would hold a special significance. My father knew how fascinated I was with dreams in general, how excited I'd get in telling him the colors and words I'd hear; I'd like to think that his appearance in my dreams after his death is his way of visiting me, of letting me know all is well with him and that it should therefore be with me too.Welcoming the chance to see my father againOne dream involved me taking his picture, at which point he raised both hands up to give the peace sign gesture just as I clicked the button. Another night's dream allowed me to see him at my grandmother's house where he grew up, folding laundry and vacuuming together in silence. A more elaborate dream involved him as some kind of cruise ship tour guide (although the boat was much smaller than a cruise ship), wearing black pants and a white short-sleeved top. Then, he was often pointing out towards the ocean as he spoke with passengers who stood on the steps before him, about to embark on their nautical journey. In that dream, he was making jokes and talking with the passengers, making them erupt in laughter. I don't recall what the jokes were but it didn't matter. Observing him was enough for me.In real life, he frequently made it a point to engage with others, making this cruise ship dream not so far off base. He was often determined to make even the most serious person smile, without being obnoxious, but genuine and funny. He did this quite a bit, easily talking to other people and interacting with them as if they'd been friends forever, which I think is what we all are in the end anyway, and perhaps his point to people all along.I actually remember waking myself up laughing out loud from this dream, despite the fact that I can't remember what the heck he was saying that caused the people on those stairs to giggle. Perhaps I don't need to know; maybe just the the fact that he made me smile and remember the importance of a sense of humor again was enough... for him and for me. On one hand, I welcome these dreams with open arms because I'm able to see my father once again. However, it's every bit as heartbreaking as it is glorious. It's heartbreaking because I wake up, disappointed with thoughts that he's relegated a stage of sleep, photos and conversations that use the past tense. Yet I look forward to the end of the day, excited with the hope that I'll see him soon in my dreams.Bittersweet reflections of wishes fulfilled  Of course I've had other dreams since he passed away. I've fed wild geese Brazil nuts and have had some of those floating sensation ones. My favorite dreams, of course, are the ones where I see my father. I'm convinced it's his way of visiting, of letting me know that while he may be gone in his energetic, friendly, physical form, he's still very much around in other ways. My most recent dream took me right back to the same hospital room where he died. Perhaps this was merely an extension of my daily thoughts, the ones in which I replay that exact moment in detail. The sweet, yet salty-medical smell of his skin as I kissed his left temple. The cloud-white comforter that covered him from the shoulders down. A chest that no longer moved rhythmically, but sat still no matter how hard I willed it to move again.In this dream, I remember taking his hand and joining it with my mom's hand and mine, the last time the three of us would be able to do so. In reality, my mom and I held hands as he passed, but we were unable to hold his as they remained secured under the tightly tucked-in comforter that the doctors had prepared. This dream, I am sure, is my dad's way of letting me know that he was holding our hands all along, just not physically. He was doing for me now what I wished we could have done then. My father may not be around to listen to my dreams anymore, but I consider myself fortunate. I am, after all, still sharing my dreams with him. "

The Mission Continues is a nonprofit organization that encourages returning veterans to do community service work, through paid fellowships and as volunteers.

(AP Photo/Lynne Sladky)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f9b52100005002c96f91.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Think today's veterans are mostly suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and barely making ends meet? According to a recent report by Got Your Six, just the opposite is true. Got Your Six notes that today's veterans tend to be engaged citizens, more likely to volunteer and vote than the general population. As a group, they earn more than non-veterans with comparable qualifications, complete educational programs at the same rate as non-veterans, and comprise only 8.6 of the homeless population.Veterans are among our most community-oriented citizens. The study shows that they volunteer an average of 160 hours annually, 25 percent more than non-veterans. They belong to civic groups and attend neighborhood meetings, often assuming leadership roles. Furthermore, 48 percent of them vote in elections regularly, 16 percent more than non-veterans.These findings should surprise no one. Those who serve in today's all-volunteer military usually do so out of a sense of commitment. Although the government offers educational, health, and other assistance to service members, of the scores of veterans I have interviewed, every single one has named duty to country, not benefits, as his or her primary reason for serving. Furthermore, nearly all -- including severely wounded soldiers -- say they would do it again. Once soldiers transition to civilian life, many want to continue serving. The reason, according to Army CPT James Perkins, lies in the very nature of military service. Perkins is a graduate student at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business and president of the Georgetown University Student Veterans Association (GUSVA). He believes that ""the all-volunteer force has a greater collective sense of responsibility and service than the American public."" He remarks that ""since 1974, service members have had to choose to volunteer to serve, and inherent in that choice is a wealth of immeasurable and intangible data about many, if not all, service members."" The kind of young people who put their lives on the line for the good of the nation will continue to feel a sense of commitment after they have completed their deployments. Perkins mentions the existence of numerous organizations such as The Mission Continues, which seeks to empower veterans to continue to serve in different ways, as evidence of veterans' desire to remain engaged even after leaving the military.For David Maxwell, a retired U.S. Army Colonel who is currently Associate Director of the Center for Security Studies at Georgetown University, veterans' high voting rates are a natural outcome of the pledge soldiers make from the very beginning of their training. Maxwell comments: ""I think veterans take the responsibility to vote seriously because they believe in the oath they have recited so often, 'to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.' Our Federal Democratic Republic requires engagement by its citizens and for veterans this is a continuation of their service ethos manifested as civic responsibility.""Veterans not only volunteer in civic organizations, but many also choose careers in public service. They work as paramedics, police, and first-responders, using skills they learned in the military. According to a study by Gregory B. Lewis and Rahul Pathak, veterans are now more than four times as likely as non-veterans to work for the federal government and 10 percent more likely than non-veterans to work for state and local governments. Although preferential treatment for veterans is certainly a factor in this phenomenon, many former military see government employment as a means of continuing to serve the nation. At Georgetown, where 87 percent of student veterans are in graduate programs, two of the most popular fields are Security Studies and Public Policy, both of which tend to lead to jobs in civil service or politics. Although veterans compose only about 3 percent of the entire Georgetown student body, David Maxwell notes that 19 percent of Security Studies students are veterans. Today record numbers of veterans are becoming entrepreneurs, but even many of these see business as a means to serve, not just to make money. One example is former U.S. Marine Alec Reisberg, whose new company, Match Grade Apparel, produces high quality, American-made clothing and donates a portion of the earnings to military charities. ""After I got out of the Marines, I felt I needed to give back,"" says Reisberg. ""I wanted to do something that would be beneficial for the country and for fellow soldiers and veterans. My wife and I were joking about how uncomfortable the Marines' dress shoes were, so we set out to make more comfortable, longer-lasting shoes. That's how we got started."" Now Reisberg is expanding into American-made shirts, hats, and other items that combine comfort and durability with attractive styling. By using American labor and materials and by donating to charity a specific dollar amount for every item sold, Reisberg says he is ""filling a void"" left by military service. ""When you're on active duty, you have a sense of fulfillment because you're doing your duty for your country,"" he remarks. ""When you leave, something is missing. Starting my company helped me get those positive feelings back.""Got Your Six released its study to combat the misconception that veterans are ""broken""--unemployed, homeless, under-educated, and unable to cope with civilian life. Although some veterans do suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, alcoholism, and economic challenges, and these men and women deserve our help and compassion, the vast majority are productive citizens whose contributions strengthen America's communities. Got Your Six, which means ""I've got your back"" in military jargon, is a coalition of private, government, and non-profit groups that strives to promote a more positive and accurate image of veterans than the one that pervades the media."

Each time you attempt to speak to someone they walk away from you while you are speaking, act as though they are listening, but then their face is constantly facing down to their smart phone, magazine, etc. If this is consistently your experience it can drive you to the point of feeling that speaking up for yourself is futile. This experience could possibly instigate feelings of unworthiness. This experience could also promote a level of deep-rooted anger that an individual could internalize and or project onto to other people. The experience of not being heard or misunderstood can also cause the individual to become so frustrated it can promote a level of opposition that the person feels they have no alternative but to make the person who they feel is inflicting this oppression, respond aggressively. Since 2014, I have worked with the SPARK Mentoring Program at the University of West Georgia. This transformative community-based program seeks to help youth begin to remove the metaphorical tape from their mouths, and empower them through their voices. What is unique to SPARK is the intentional philosophy and approach in working with youth. The program utilizes an alternative approach where university students connect with youth through icebreakers, improvisation, art, and West African drumming. SPARK places major emphasis on not attempting to change youth, but solely seeing youth as sacred. This concept of sacred is derived from Martin Buber's I and Thou theory, which promotes the sentiment that we deeply value our daily interactions with one another. The crux of SPARK is an activity where youth and university students have the opportunity to share their life stories, or COSMOS, with everyone. The COSMOS promotes a community where everyone's voice matters. As people develop the courage to share intimate details of their lives, others have the courage to be present and listen. This collective act of vulnerability helps to normalize challenges that many people experience, but also assists in providing confidence and support for youth and mentors in knowing that they are not alone. As such, this cultivated relationship between youth and mentors helps to diminish the traditional power dynamics of adult to child. Through the reciprocity of the relationship they begin the process of refraining from judging the other person, and learning how to empathically listen and begin to comprehend different perspectives. This mentoring program, reminds me of the necessary empathic understanding, which is desperately needed in our communities that endure incidents where Freddie Gray was killed. It is easy to judge Baltimore and say what people should do. Ask yourself if you consistently saw people in your community unfairly treated and stifled systemically; what would be your reaction? Witnessing these traumas repeatedly creates systemic injuries for communities, and can instigate the same aggressive reaction by which the community feels was thrust upon them. This is my intention for Baltimore, and other communities: being a part of transformative solutions by seeking to understand, rather than flippantly characterizing communities with stereotypical rhetoric.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8fa49260000300183c4f0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Debates about health care frequently focus on the number of people with and without insurance, because it’s a relatively straightforward thing to measure. Either you have coverage or you don’t.  But an equally important question is what kind of insurance you have -- and that includes whether your policy leaves you exposed to large, potentially crippling out-of-pocket expenses. The answer makes a big difference.A big co-payment might discourage you from filling a prescription to treat a serious condition, or from seeing a specialist whose attention you need. If you get sick and end up in the hospital, a high deductible could leave you owing many thousands of dollars, forcing you into financial distress.  You wouldn’t be uninsured, but you would be underinsured. You’d also have lots of company.  Recently released data, including two brand new surveys, suggests that millions of Americans with insurance are in just that situation. And while there would almost certainly be more of these people if the Affordable Care Act were not in place, those who still face high medical bills are disproportionately poor and sick -- in other words, the very people who most need the protection that health insurance is supposed to provide.  It’s a complicated situation to parse -- in part because, strange as it sounds, high out-of-pocket costs also have an upside. But the findings from those two new surveys tell a story that gets too little attention from policymakers.  The first comes from the Commonwealth Fund, which for many years has been asking respondents about their medical expenses and how big those expenses are, relative to household income. It defined the underinsured as those whose out-of-pocket expenses are more than 10 percent of household income or, for people who are at or below twice the poverty line, more than 5 percent of household income. By its definition, about a quarter of all working-age adults, some 31 million people, were underinsured as of 2014.   That’s proportionally more than twice as many people as were underinsured in 2003, although the percentage has been stable for the last few years. The report is full of interesting and potentially telling details -- like the fact that, among the most populated states, the problem was far worse in Florida and Texas than it was in California and New York.  But perhaps the most important survey finding is about the consequences for people who fit into the underinsured category. Some took financial hits: 47 percent of respondents said they exhausted their savings to pay medical bills, 23 percent were dealing with collection agencies and 7 percent had to declare bankruptcy. Others who were underinsured opted not to get recommended care: 26 percent didn’t fill a prescription because of expense, while 24 percent didn’t get prescribed follow-up treatment or tests for the same reason.These findings are consistent with other recent studies -- including one from the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, published in the spring, which found that about one-quarter of all non-elderly Americans with private insurance don’t have enough liquid assets to pay the deductibles on their health insurance policies. As Drew Altman, the foundation’s president, wrote in the Wall Street Journal, those people will “have to put off care or incur medical debt” if they develop any serious health problems.  Of course, a major goal of the Affordable Care Act, or “Obamacare,” is to protect people from precisely these situations -- not simply by helping people without insurance to get coverage, but also by setting minimum standards for what insurance must cover. Mostly those standards apply to the “non-group” market -- that is, for people who buy coverage on their own, directly from insurers or through new insurance exchanges, rather than through employers.  The new healthcare law requires that all plans include “essential benefits,” even benefits such as prescription drugs, rehabilitation, mental health and maternity care that non-group plans often previously left out. The law also sets limits on out-of-pocket expenses. People with household incomes below 250 percent of the poverty line ($48,500 for a family of four nowadays) are eligible for special tax credits that offer yet more protection against high out-of-pocket expenses. These requirements raise premiums overall, and that's why so many people (particularly younger and healthier consumers) experienced ""rate shock"" when the the Affordable Care Act first took effect. But the law by design discounts those premiums for low- and middle-income buyers through a series of tax credits.  Have those reforms helped make health care more accessible and affordable? If so, by how much? That’s where the other new study -- from the advocacy group Families USA, based on data from the Urban Institute -- can shed some light. More people had insurance, the report noted, and people buying coverage with federal financial assistance tended to have better protection from expenses. Even so, the report pointed out, one in four people in the non-group market were still going without recommended medical care because of the cost.   Ron Pollack, president of Families USA and among the Affordable Care Act’s most enthusiastic proponents, told The Huffington Post the Affordable Care Act ""has not only expanded health coverage to more than one out of three of the previously uninsured, it also provides subsidies to low-income people seeking help with deductibles and co-payments. However, even with these significant improvements, more than 25 percent of those with year-round insurance are forgoing needed health care because they find these costs unaffordable. This can best be fixed by reducing the burden of high deductibles.”  Survey data like this is not always the most reliable source of information, since it relies so heavily on personal recollections and impressions. The RAND Health Experiment, a decades-old study conducted by the RAND Corp. that is more or less the holy grail of health care economics research, demonstrated that people are pretty lousy at distinguishing bad care from good care. Throw in the fact that physicians don’t always know, either, and it’s likely that at least some of the people skipping medical care were no worse off -- since the tests or treatments they avoided were unnecessary.  Economists also argue, plausibly, that high cost-sharing encourages people to be more aggressive consumers for health care -- whether that means shopping for cheaper policies or picking providers of care that can perform the same services for less money. In fact, most experts think the increase in out-of-pocket costs is a major reason that private health insurance premiums, and health care costs generally, are rising at historically low rates. When conservatives and business executives talk about giving people “skin in the game,” this is what they have in mind. It’s why employers were increasing cost-sharing before the Affordable Care Act became law -- and why they’ve continued doing so since.  Many experts would say the trick with designing an insurance system is striking the right balance -- in effect, exposing people to just enough costs that they start to think like consumers but can still afford their medical care when they are sick. Others emphasize the need to design benefits in a way that steers patients toward the most effective kinds of care, either by linking cost-sharing to quality (as an initiative called Value-Based Insurance Design would) or simply by managing and coordinating care more effectively (as integrated group practices like Kaiser Permanente traditionally have).Notwithstanding the caricature of Obamacare as a far-left, government takeover of health insurance, the Affordable Care Act was an effort to blend these different approaches. If these two reports are correct, there’s more work to be done."

In an interview with Radio Times, the ""Star Trek"" actor was critical of the entertainment industry's movement away from gritty art films, like ""The Godfather"" and ""Taxi Driver,"" and toward the superhero and comic book content that fills movie theaters today. “Now we’re essentially all consuming very childish things –- comic books, superheroes,"" Pegg told Radio Times. The ""Hot Fuzz"" actor added that the geek culture prevalent today is ""dumbing down in a way"" since it's ""it’s taking our focus away from real-world issues."" These comments, of course, erupted across the Internet, igniting rebuttals from i09 and debates on Reddit. In response, Pegg wrote a blog on his website clarifying what he meant, and admitting that after doing so many interviews, ""you get sick of your own opinions and start espousing other people’s.""In the blog, Pegg touches on the growing consumerism attached to genre films that has preyed on audiences' nostalgia for youth. Citing the philosophies of cultural theorist Jean Baudrillard, Pegg explains how society has become infantilized to distract us from the real horrors of the world. ""There was probably more discussion on Twitter about the 'The Force Awakens' and the 'Batman vs Superman' trailers,"" Pegg writes, ""than there was about the Nepalese earthquake or the British general election.""The actor summed up his previous comments by saying that good, thought-provoking genre films still exist, citing ""Ex Machina"" and ""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" but that it's still important to question what we like and why. Pegg, who is also co-writing ""Star Trek 3,"" reassured fans that he's still a proud nerd at heart. Read Pegg's full response on his blog."

The San Diego Rodeo is put on by the Golden State Gay Rodeo Association (GSGRA), one of four founding associations of the International Gay Rodeo Association (IGRS). This is the 20th IGRA-sanctioned gay rodeo season in California. (Photo by David McNew/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafdc3d260000cf0081640f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Steve BarnesLITTLE ROCK, Ark., May 20 (Reuters) - On a clear Arkansas spring afternoon after a day of horse riding, Wade Earp sighed and said, ""I wish we didn't have to have a gay rodeo. I wish we could just rodeo.""Earp was a contestant at the International Gay Rodeo event held last month in Arkansas, a Bible Belt state on the front lines of the fight over gay rights and one of the 13 U.S. states where same-sex marriage is not recognized.""Everybody deserves equal treatment. Everybody deserves equal rights,"" said Earp, 45, a native of Benton, Arkansas, where he was raised in a fundamentalist Christian denomination, and a competitor in barrel racing, calf roping and steer riding.The sixteenth Diamond State Rodeo held in Little Rock drew 75 contestants, far outnumbering spectators, from a dozen states and Canada, all hoping to qualify for the International Gay Rodeo 2016 finals in Las Vegas.""For years, no one would allow us to advertise it,"" said Sandy Bidwell, president of the Diamond State event, for fear protesters would create a disturbance.""My attitude is, let them. It's free advertising.""This year, they put up a sign directing traffic to the event, and no protesters came.For two days, gays and lesbians and at least one transgender man competed in barrel racing and bull riding on the soft soil of a fairgrounds arena at the rodeo that looked like just about every small-scale rodeo held across the country.The arena's railings were festooned with the banners of corporate sponsors advertising products such as Bud Light beer, Jack Daniels whiskey, and Gun Oil personal lubricant. TUSSLE OVER MARRIAGEWith same-sex marriage now legal in 37 states and Washington D.C., the focus has shifted to states such as Arkansas and the battle between social conservatives and those seeking expanded rights for the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community.Change might be right around the corner in Little Rock, the state capital, where in May 2014 a state judge declared unconstitutional Arkansas's ban on same-sex marriage.But one year later, the Arkansas Supreme Court has yet to decide the state's appeal, prompting the chief justice and an associate justice to angrily accuse their colleagues of manufacturing a delay.Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule in June whether to strike down bans on gay marriage nationwide.The Arkansas legislature this year approved a religious freedom bill that critics said would allow for residents to deny service to the LGBT community citing their religious beliefs.Pressure from Arkansas-based retail giant Walmart Inc and other corporations along with rallies by gay rights activists helped spur the legislature to tone down the proposed law. BAN 'ALMOST INSULTING'In the state capital and some other pockets, support for the LGBT community has been strong.Only days before the rodeo began, the Little Rock Board of Directors approved an ordinance barring discrimination against gays in municipal hiring and among vendors doing business with the city.In Fayetteville, home to the state's largest university, a human rights policy friendly to gays was approved by aldermen but reversed in a referendum spearheaded by religious conservatives.Back at the rodeo, Earp and partner Jonathan Suder, 25, dressed in typical western garb, insist they are not asking for ""anything special.""""We just want what's right,"" said Earp, which for both men means marriage, a legal covenant denied them in Arkansas and Texas.The contentious Arkansas debate over same-sex unions ""has drawn our community in Arkansas closer than ever,"" organizer Bidwell said.Bidwell, 68, and Lisa Smith, 59, sidestepped the Arkansas barrier by traveling from their home in Little Rock to wed in Bidwell's native New York, where same-sex marriage has been legal since 2011.Yet to Ashley Vickers, an event volunteer and mental health technician from Little Rock, having to leave the state to marry her partner, Sara Strickland, ""is almost insulting.""""I pay taxes here. I feel bad that I have to even considering going elsewhere to get married,"" said the 29-year-old Vickers. (Writing by Jon Herskovitz; Editing by Mary Milliken)"

Trust me: Kids movies are not just for kids and this summer's lineup will have adults LOL-ing just as much as the kiddies! Plus, when the movie is over, you know your kids will want to bring the magic home and -- thanks to a huge array of super fun toys -- it's easy for them to do so. Here's a peek at the movies your whole family will love this summer and some of the awesome toys that will be available along with them.Earlier this year, we were briefly reunited with our Disney Frozen friends in the Frozen Fever short. Okay, so it's not a full-length feature film to fill our Frozen void, but it did succeed in keeping our own Frozen fever hot, hot, hot! Every single time poor Elsa sneezes, little baby snowmen -- or Snowgies -- pop up. Fans will love the Disney Frozen Fever Snowgie Chatterbacks, from Just Play. They are adorable and repeat everything that you say, so don't be afraid to let them help you get the ""clean your room"" message across twice (or 40 times). Avengers: Age of Ultron hit theaters earlier this month, and Hasbro has so many great role-play items that let kids become their favorite superhero. In the movie, the ultimate battle takes place between the Avengers and Ultron, a robot designed by the Avengers. Ultron was developed to keep the peace, but when he decides that the only way to do that is to end humanity, well, let's just say the Avengers have their work cut out for them. From the Hulk's grippy fists to Thor's mighty hammer, kids will have a blast!On June 12, after two decades of false starts, Jurassic World will open its doors for business. And so it's no surprise that dinosaurs are stomping and chomping through the toy aisles in a big way this year. Lego has a whole line of sets that lets kids recreate their favorite scenes from the movie and also include cool collectible dino figures. The Playskool Heroes line has a Tyrannosaurus Rex figure with fierce chomping action that kids can use to gobble up the human figure.We've all been waiting anxiously for the Minions movie for a long time. Well I'm here to tell you that wait is not in vain, and you definitely won't be disappointed with these mischievous creatures. Bring the fun home with Tumblin' Stuart, from Thinkway Toys, or make a splash at the pool with the Minion swim goggles or goggle kickboard from Skyrocket Toys.And last but not least, Disney•Pixar's Inside Out will not only have your entire family laughing, but also relating to all the emotions that kids and grown-ups face on a daily basis as they watch Riley, her parents, and their emotions tackle life's challenges. Adults will laugh and shake our heads, while the movie serves as teachable moments for our kids' social development, especially when accompanied by a great line of plush emotions from Tomy that have the voices of the characters built in.You don't have to wait for a rainy day to dive into this lineup. Movies make great family day trips. So grab the fam and head to theater -- and don't forget the popcorn!"

Plus, when the movie is over, you know your kids will want to bring the magic home and -- thanks to a huge array of super fun toys -- it's easy for them to do so. Here's a peek at the movies your whole family will love this summer and some of the awesome toys that will be available along with them.Earlier this year, we were briefly reunited with our Disney Frozen friends in the Frozen Fever short. Okay, so it's not a full-length feature film to fill our Frozen void, but it did succeed in keeping our own Frozen fever hot, hot, hot! Every single time poor Elsa sneezes, little baby snowmen -- or Snowgies -- pop up. Fans will love the Disney Frozen Fever Snowgie Chatterbacks, from Just Play. They are adorable and repeat everything that you say, so don't be afraid to let them help you get the ""clean your room"" message across twice (or 40 times). Avengers: Age of Ultron hit theaters earlier this month, and Hasbro has so many great role-play items that let kids become their favorite superhero. In the movie, the ultimate battle takes place between the Avengers and Ultron, a robot designed by the Avengers. Ultron was developed to keep the peace, but when he decides that the only way to do that is to end humanity, well, let's just say the Avengers have their work cut out for them. From the Hulk's grippy fists to Thor's mighty hammer, kids will have a blast!On June 12, after two decades of false starts, Jurassic World will open its doors for business. And so it's no surprise that dinosaurs are stomping and chomping through the toy aisles in a big way this year. Lego has a whole line of sets that lets kids recreate their favorite scenes from the movie and also include cool collectible dino figures. The Playskool Heroes line has a Tyrannosaurus Rex figure with fierce chomping action that kids can use to gobble up the human figure.We've all been waiting anxiously for the Minions movie for a long time. Well I'm here to tell you that wait is not in vain, and you definitely won't be disappointed with these mischievous creatures. Bring the fun home with Tumblin' Stuart, from Thinkway Toys, or make a splash at the pool with the Minion swim goggles or goggle kickboard from Skyrocket Toys.And last but not least, Disney•Pixar's Inside Out will not only have your entire family laughing, but also relating to all the emotions that kids and grown-ups face on a daily basis as they watch Riley, her parents, and their emotions tackle life's challenges. Adults will laugh and shake our heads, while the movie serves as teachable moments for our kids' social development, especially when accompanied by a great line of plush emotions from Tomy that have the voices of the characters built in.You don't have to wait for a rainy day to dive into this lineup. Movies make great family day trips. So grab the fam and head to theater -- and don't forget the popcorn!"

24,MEDIA,Jorge Ramos' Show Isn't A Mouthpiece For Democrats,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/univision-jorge-ramos_n_7343992.html,,2015-05-20,"In this Dec. 14, 2011 photo, Univision newscaster Jorge Ramos works in the studio in Miami, Florida. Ramos is anchors one of the most watched news shows in Spanish the U.S. (AP Photo/Alan Diaz)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5c78225000032003961ae.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Conservatives have charged that Univision, particularly its influential host Jorge Ramos, hasn't been fair to them. A new report on Ramos' show, however, found that the program doesn't refuse to give conservatives a chance to voice their views.Media Matters For America, a progressive media watchdog group, analyzed the 120 guests who appeared on Noticiero Univision's ""Al Punto"" from Dec. 21, 2014 -- soon after potential Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush announced an exploratory committee -- through May 17, 2015. Its report, released on Wednesday, found that although more guests were progressive than conservative, two-thirds of the guests weren't affiliated with either party. Most of the elected or administration officials who came on ""Al Punto"" were Democrats -- 16, compared to five Republicans. Among political pundits, though, Media Matters found that conservatives got more airtime than progressives, with 14 of 23 pundit appearances going to the GOP. Univision is the largest Spanish-language media company in the U.S., and an influential channel for politicians hoping to reach Latino voters. But Republicans have felt overlooked by the station -- and Ramos in particular -- because it has criticized the GOP.Ramos, a supporter of immigration reform, is tough on Republicans about the issue -- he's tough on Democrats, too -- and critics have said that he isn't giving conservatives a fair shake. ""It’s highly questionable whether we’re treated fairly on Univision,"" Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus told BuzzFeed News in January, although he said members of the party would continue to appear on the network. The criticisms go beyond Ramos, however. Univision has ties to former Secretary of State and current Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, Politico has reported. Its owner, Haim Saban, is a Clinton supporter who has donated to the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, and Univision worked with the foundation on a early childhood education initiative. A spokeswoman for Univision told Politico that the initiative's leadership council had Republicans and Democrats and that the editorial and corporate sides of the company were kept separate. Media Matters said its study proved that conservative claims of bias from Univision aren't true. ""The right-wing media playbook hasn't changed over the years: claim the media has a 'liberal' bias and then say it again even louder. Rinse, repeat,"" Media Matters President Bradley Beychok said in a statement. ""However, with Hispanic voters growing as a part of the electorate, it's never been more important to prevent this well-worn playbook from succeeding within the Hispanic media landscape.""Univision did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report. In 2013, The Huffington Post analyzed the political guests of ""Al Punto"" and Telemundo's ""Enfoque con José Díaz-Balart"" and found that Republicans appeared regularly on the programs -- although not as frequently as Democrats -- but that most of the GOP appearances were Congress members who support immigration reform. The networks said that was not because other members weren't asked, but because they often turned the requests down. Ramos laid out his philosophy on journalism in a commencement speech earlier this month at the University of Southern California School for Communication and Journalism. He told graduates not to be partisan, but not to be neutral, either. ""Yes, I'm asking you to take a stand,"" he said. ""Don't be neutral. Neutrality is for referees in a football game. The really, really good journalists always take a stand with those who have no voice and with those who have no rights. Maybe you don't know it yet, but actually you chose to be a fighter. Don't quit now."""
25,POLITICS,The Death Penalty Is Probably About To Disappear In One State,Kim Bellware,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nebraska-death-penalty-repeal_n_7343784.html,,2015-05-20,"Neb. Gov. Pete Ricketts gestures during a news conference in Lincoln, Neb., Wednesday, May 20, 2015. Gov. Ricketts voiced his opposition to a bill to abolish the death penalty which is up for a final vote before the Legislature on Wednesday, and promised to veto the bill should it pass. (AP Photo/Nati Harnik)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8fa663c000018010e0335.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Nebraska lawmakers voted to abolish the death penalty Wednesday with enough votes to override a gubernatorial veto. Lawmakers voted 32-15 on a bill to replace the death penalty with life without parole as the state's highest penalty. Gov. Pete Ricketts (R) has vowed to veto the bill, but the legislature is expected to have enough votes to override the veto. Stacy Anderson, executive director of Nebraskans for Alternatives to the Death Penalty, told The Huffington Post last week that a shift in numbers on the anticipated veto override vote is unlikely.""I think the senators have made up their minds,"" Anderson said. ""They've studied the issue and they're ready to get this bill through.""If lawmakers successfully override Ricketts' veto, Nebraska will be the first state to repeal the death penalty since Maryland eliminated the punishment in 2013. Nebraska's repeal would bring down the number of death penalty states to 31.""Nebraska becomes the latest state to acknowledge that the death penalty is an irrevocably broken and unjust practice,” Steven W. Hawkins, executive director of Amnesty International USA, said in a statement Wednesday. “The legislature has taken a courageous step forward for human rights. Rather than stand in the way, Governor Ricketts should get on the right side of history by signing this bill into law,"" Hawkins' statement continued. ""The remaining states that retain the death penalty should follow Nebraska’s example and do away with this cruel and inhuman punishment forever.”The push to repeal the death penalty has had Nebraska's conservatives squaring off against one another. Republican abolitionists have criticized the death penalty as being out of step with conservative values of fiscal responsibility, protecting life and limiting the role of government.Nebraska's legislation, known as LB268, is retroactive, meaning that anyone who has already been sentenced to death but has not yet been executed will have their sentence commuted to life without parole. There are currently 11 inmates on Nebraska's death row.“This morning’s debate on the death penalty is significant,” Ricketts said in a statement Wednesday ahead of the vote. “No one has traveled the state more than I have in the past 18 months, and everywhere I go there is overwhelming support for keeping the death penalty in Nebraska. Ahead of this morning’s vote, I am reminding senators that a vote for cloture on LB268 is a vote to repeal the death penalty and to give our state’s most heinous criminals more lenient sentences. This isn’t rhetoric. This is reality.”Ricketts has five days to sign or veto the bill before it automatically becomes law.A spokesman for Ricketts told The Huffington Post via email Wednesday afternoon that despite the legislature’s current veto-proof majority, Ricketts will veto the bill but did not specify when.The last time Nebraska used the death penalty was in 1997, when it executed Robert E. Williams by electric chair.James Clark, the senior death penalty campaigner for Amnesty International, told HuffPost that Wednesday’s vote is a signal that the death penalty is on its way out.“We’ve been seeing for years [that] death sentences are declining and more and more states are realizing the system is broken. It’s not from any one political ideology anymore,” said Clark. “A state like Nebraska is a game-changer because it’s so conservative,” he went on. ""The arguments used to support repeal this time around were conservative arguments. They came from a wide range of perspectives and viewpoints from the state.""Though Ricketts has said the death penalty is right for Nebraska, Clark said that Wednesday's vote is proof to the contrary.""I don’t think [Ricketts’ view] reflects what we saw today in the legislature,” Clark said. “These senators are responding to what they’ve heard from their own constituents. They don’t want Nebraska in the business of killing its prisoners. They’ve seen it isn’t an effective policy.” ""Even folks who have may have supported the death penalty in the past are seeing now it doesn’t deliver on its promise,"" he added.Clark noted that several states, including Washington and Kansas, have the death penalty on the books but haven't used it in decades. ""States are going to see that they’ve lived without it for decades and that having it hasn’t made them safer,"" he said.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mistakenly stated that LB268 is not retroactive."

Under fast track, Congress would be stripped of authority to filibuster or amend the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a pact with 11 other nations currently being negotiated by the Obama administration. The TPP almost certainly cannot pass without fast-track power.While Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) have supported Obama on both fast track and the TPP, tea party Republicans and most Democrats in Congress oppose the measures, as do traditional liberal interest groups including labor unions, environmentalists and Internet freedom activists.To win over additional Democrats, Republicans have agreed to couple fast track with a program called Trade Adjustment Assistance, which provides financial aid and training to workers who lose their jobs to increased foreign trade. But much of the GOP is opposed to such support, and House Republicans have pushed a measure that would force $700 million of TAA funding to come out of the budget for Medicare. The CREDO Action ads accuse lawmakers of cutting Medicare to pay for the fast-track bill, and will target Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Ron Kind (D-Wis.), Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) and Ami Bera (D-Calif.). Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) is the lone Republican who will be featured in the first round on advertising, CREDO Action said.Here's an example of an ad the group plans to run on Facebook:Obama has spent months trying to woo critical Democrats who believe his trade agenda will exacerbate income inequality and undermine important regulations that protect the economy and the environment. The progressive wing of the party remains strongly opposed, however, and in recent weeks, Obama's persuasion tactics morphed into public attacks on Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a popular figure among liberals who has helped rally additional opposition. The fast-track bill is likely to pass the Senate in the next few days, but remains several votes short of passage in the House."

In this photo taken May 10, 2015, a dead dolphin washes ashore in the Gulf of Mexico on Grand Isle, Louisiana.In 2011, Louisiana saw 163 dolphins stranded, while Mississippi had 111. By comparison, each of those states saw an average of 20 such incidents per year from 2002 through 2009, reported the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.One in three of the dolphins recovered from the coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama suffered from otherwise rarely-seen adrenal lesions consistent with petroleum product exposure, according to a report from NOAA's Office of Response and Restoration. In Barataria Bay, Louisiana, one of the areas hit hardest by the oil spill, half of the dolphins showed similar lesions. In contrast, only 7 percent of stranded dolphins found outside of the Deepwater Horizon spill zone have had similar adrenal gland damage.The adrenal gland produces and regulates a wide range of hormones, which, in turn, help manage basic bodily functions including metabolism and blood pressure. A dolphin lies on dead on a beach on Horn Island, in the Gulf of Mexico, Tuesday, May 11, 2010.""Animals with adrenal insufficiency are less able to cope with additional stressors in their everyday lives,” Stephanie Venn-Watson, the study’s lead author and a veterinary epidemiologist at the National Marine Mammal Foundation, explained, ""and when those stressors occur, they are more likely to die.""In addition to adrenal gland damage, researchers found 22 percent of dolphins suffered from serious bacterial pneumonia. In 70 percent of those animals, the lung disease was severe enough to have ""either caused or contributed significantly to death,"" the researchers noted. Outside of the spill area, only 2 percent of dolphins had similar lung disease.""The evidence to date indicates that the Deepwater Horizon oil spill caused the adrenal and lung lesions that contributed to the deaths of this unusual mortality event,” Venn-Watson told the New York Times. “We reached that conclusion based on the accumulation of our studies including this paper.""BP responded to the report by questioning the link between dolphin deaths and the oil spill. ""This new paper fails to show that the illnesses observed in some dolphins were caused by exposure to Macondo oil,"" Geoff Morell, BP's senior vice president for U.S. communications and external affairs, told AFP.""According to NOAA, the Gulf 'unusual mortality event' (UME) began in February 2010, months before the spill. ... Even though the UME may have overlapped in some areas with the oil spill, correlation is not evidence of causation,"" Morell added.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story stated BP owned the Deepwater Horizon. The drilling rig was in fact leased by BP from Transocean."

While JetBlue will soon be instituting bag fees, their weekly sales and popular routes still entice flyers.

The Conservative Party fared much better than expected in Britain's parliamentary election, with an exit poll and early returns suggesting that Prime Minister David Cameron would remain in his office at 10 Downing Street. The opposition Labour Party led by Ed Miliband took a beating, according to the exit poll, much of it due to the rise of the separatist Scottish National Party. (AP Photo/Scott Heppell)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/60d98ada280000d0376ff7da.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This week, a historic new class of fifty-six pro-Scottish independence Members of Parliament is being sworn into the House of Commons in London.With a record high turnout -- significantly higher than the rest of the UK -- Scots voted in the recent UK election for 95 percent of their Parliamentary representatives to come from one party, the Scottish National Party (SNP). For all the talk of David Cameron's victory, his Conservative Party returned only one solitary Member of Parliament from Scotland, and that MP held on to his seat by just 798 votes.As the Prime Minister prepares his legislative program for when the Queen opens the new Parliament next week, he will be aware that he has no mandate in Scotland for his agenda. The reality is that Scottish voters chose something markedly different than their English neighbors. But since more than 80 percent of UK voters live in England, the reality is that the UK will once again get the government that England votes for. And England voted Conservative.It is exactly this democratic deficit that leaves so many Scottish voters frustrated by the political system. Scotland has not voted Conservative in a UK general election since 1955, but has spent most of the last 60 years living under Conservative governments. Understand that, and you can understand that the desire many have for independence is less about a flag and more about political disenfranchisement.As popular as independence is for many Scots, the new class of Scottish MPs have been clear that the mandate from this election is to work for the good of their constituents within the UK system. And as the third largest party at Westminster, they also have a responsibility to act in goodwill towards voters in the rest of Great Britain, too.Beyond that, the members of this newly powerful group defy easy categorization. Most of them have made their careers outside politics. They include a Queen's Council, a surgical oncologist, and a former speechwriter for U.S. Senator Daniel Moynihan.And for people who mistakenly try to classify SNP politicians as purveyors of identity politics, what then to make of the SNP Westminster leader, a former BBC journalist who was born in Wimbledon to a German mother? The SNP also sent Scotland's first woman of color to Parliament -- Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh, a Bollywood star turned successful lawyer whose mother is half-Czech and half-Welsh and whose father was Pakistani.What all these Members of Parliament have in common is not their identity or their pasts -- it's their desire to see a fairer, more progressive Scotland. And top of that list is arguing against the deeply damaging austerity program of the Conservative government.One of the most popular SNP slogans in recent months has been ""BAIRNS NOT BOMBS."" ""Bairns"" is Scottish for children, and considering that both the Conservative Party and the Labour Party proposed spending 100 billion pounds in new nuclear weapons as well as further cuts to social services, it's clear why many in Scotland voted as they did.On my way to SNP headquarters on election night, my taxi driver -- once learning my destination -- excitedly asked me if I knew the leader of the SNP, the hugely popular Nicola Sturgeon, who he called ""our Nicola."" He stopped the cab to tell me that he was a Labour man. He was an ex-miner in his late 60s and said he voted SNP this time because he trusted them to speak up for Scotland. He told me he wanted ""nae mair cuts and nae mair bombs.""David Cameron may have won the UK election, but he knows that he has no mandate in Scotland for further austerity -- and that almost half the country voted for independence only eight months ago. How the Prime Minister approaches Scotland in the coming months -- and how these 56 new MPs and their party react -- could well be the most defining legacy of his government.Jennifer Erickson is the Director of Competitiveness and Economic Growth at the Center for American Progress.
