And just like Apple's watch could start a new era in wearable devices, this software framework could start a new era in medical research.I realize the app world already is filled with medical offerings -- just like there are already plenty of terrific wearable devices. What could make these new offerings such game-changers is being backed by Apple.MyHeart Counts is one of the inaugural five apps developed using ResearchKit. As the name suggests, MyHeart Counts is focused on cardiovascular disease. It's part of a study conducted by Stanford University School of Medicine. Although my organization, the American Heart Association, is not involved in enrolling users into the study, or actively collaborating with Apple to promote ResearchKit, we are very pleased that the app is built upon heart disease and health metrics and advice compiled by some of our top volunteers. The Silicon Valley analogy I might use is, rather than ""Intel inside,"" this is ""AHA inside.""(Last summer, I wrote about another cardiovascular research study in which the AHA is helping recruit participants. It is called the Health eHeart Study, and is similar but different from MyHeart Counts.)Dr. Michael V. McConnell is a professor of cardiovascular medicine at Stanford and the principal investigator of the MyHeart Counts study. It's my pleasure to let him take you on a deeper dive into this exciting new opportunity.---Do you have an iPhone?Is it with you pretty much all the time?If you are among the millions of Americans who answer yes to both questions, then I'd like to offer you the opportunity to learn about your heart health and contribute to our future understanding of how to keep hearts healthy.The value to you comes in three forms. The first two are tangible: a snapshot of your cardiovascular health right now, and, later, testing ways to improve your cardiovascular health tailored to your specific needs. Plus, there's a third item that's an intangible -- the feel-good of helping advance medical research.All you need do is download the free MyHeart Counts app and spending some time reviewing the consent information. Then you just carry around your iPhone, as you probably already do -- while at working, exercising, running errands, etc.What's the catch? Pretty simple: You have to care about your cardiovascular health.You have to decide that your heart counts.Heart disease is the No. 1 killer of Americans, and stroke is No. 5. While we're always getting better at treating these conditions, what we really need to do is get better at preventing them. Physical activity is the best prescription. The next step is understanding -- and addressing -- your specific risks for heart disease and stroke. This means paying attention to the factors you are born with and those that develop from your lifestyle.This is where MyHeart Counts can help.Once you download the app and go through the consent process, MyHeart Counts will ask you to input your height, weight and age, and to answer questions about how much exercise and sleep you get. You'll be asked about your blood pressure and cholesterol numbers, and, if you are able, take a six-minute walk. You also can connect to other wearable devices you use.The fact you are doing all this on your iPhone is part of the technological advancement. Better still is the fact the device's various sensors can measure the speed and distance of your walk. All these factors make this study, and this app, unique.Over the first week, you'll be asked more questions about your diet, your health and wellness, and some daily check-ins to see what you did and how you slept.If that sounds like a lot, you'll be relieved to know that no category has more than 10 questions, and most have less.After a week, you'll receive that snapshot I promised. It will come in the form of some easy-to-understand numbers, such as your chances of having a heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years, and the chances of either occurring over their lifetime.This risk assessment is based on the ASCVD Risk Estimator, a tool developed by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology. This is a standard system used by cardiologists nationwide based on prevention guidelines released in 2013. You'll also receive your ""heart age,"" a calculation that gives additional perspective on what those risk-assessment numbers mean.The aim is to provide an indication of how your heart is aging relative to the optimal cardiovascular health for someone your age. To offer a basic example, a healthy 52-year-old with very good cholesterol and blood pressure numbers may be declared to have the heart of a 50-year-old, while a 52-year-old smoker with elevated blood pressure may be deemed as having the heart of a 60-year-old.You're encouraged to use the app for regular activity monitoring. About every three months, you'll be asked to check-in and update your information.As we develop the app, we'll be tapping into resources from the American Heart Association such as MyLifeCheck and Heart360 to provide guidance customized to each user. You could also call it coaching, or offering motivational tools, all personalized.This is another important, relatively unstudied area of preventative care -- the ongoing encouragement that can keep people who aren't heart patients from becoming heart patients. The best way to provide this feedback -- texts, pop-ups or strictly in-app notifications -- and their frequency are also part of the research.Now let's talk about the research potential for all this, which obviously is what ResearchKit is all about.Research is the lifeblood of science, and data collection is the lifeblood of research. By bringing data collection to the iPhone, we are hoping to build massive volumes of information that can power all sorts of studies and clinical trials.We aim to track whether people act on the advice given -- such as, if told to step up the amount of physical activity, does the user do it? We also could give different types of advice to see which gains better traction. Even the challenges of format and frequency for notifications are up for randomization and analysis.This is why it's great to have iPhone users as our participants. Capturing even a small percentage of that community would provide us a wealth of information that can help shape the future of cardiovascular care. Apple will also be making ResearchKit ""open source"" soon, so broader use will be possible.There are a few important things to note, starting with an understandably major concern -- privacy.We're asking for the least amounts of data possible, with your personal information kept separate from your study data, which only has a random code. Thus, it becomes encrypted without your name. Users also will have the option of allowing us to share their data with other trusted researchers, or keeping it strictly at Stanford.Also, the app is primarily designed to work with the iPhone 5s, 6 and 6 Plus as these have built-in motion chips that don't drain the battery. It's currently available only in English and in the United States, both of which we plan to expand. Additionally, the 10-year and lifetime projections are geared for people between ages 20 and 79. Now that you have a better feel for what we are doing and why, I hope you'll join us. Please make your heart count."

Video showing Sigma Alpha Epsilon members singing a racist chant while traveling on a tour bus went viral after being uploaded to the internet. SAE's national chapter has since suspended the students involved and the University of Oklahoma President David Boren has terminated the fraternity's affiliation with the school. (Photo by Brett Deering/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae0857250000320037b2c4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As many witnessed the infamous SAE chant video, these occurrences become commonplace, where racist remarks emerge and go viral, quickly flooding news feeds and shaking up the Internet. Whether seen on live television, or through camera phone footage, the underbelly of America's race issue keeps emerging to the surface in dramatic fashion. In a time where technology, digital media and other influential aspects of society show evident signs of progress, longstanding questions remain regarding the state of race relations in America. With these unsettling, yet unsurprising scenarios unfolding in a timespan that recently celebrated the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s landmark march in Selma, Alabama -- the country has reached yet another conversational crossroads. For the past several months, compelling think pieces have stirred debate over racially-charged instances igniting national outrage, while countless news outlets have hosted expert panels and town hall specials to unite diverse viewpoints in hopes of bringing greater clarity to troubled times.While a fire to force change fuels passionate protests, there are still a few critical truths that tend to be overlooked, but require great attention. Though these necessary and assertive attempts provoke dialogue, refute racism and combat injustices, there's a reason the dynamics of privilege still escape these periods unscathed. One of the most fundamental is how we, as a country, understand racism. The Realities Of RacismRacism is real, but the concept of racial hierarchy is a myth. Unfortunately, the notion of racial superiority is so deeply woven into the fabric of society, that it's nearly impossible for even the most conscious individuals to escape elements of its existence. Of greater note, there is simply no merit to the idea that white people are superior to any other race. As living, breathing human beings -- we're all, in fact, created equal. Racism, by form and function, is an ideology imparted as psychological law, used to set order and impose self-governance according to a fictitious ranking system. Racism was intentionally formed to fuel classism. Before being considered people, black people were considered property. By controlling the access and allocation of assets -- money, property and resources -- people of color were forced to accept a default positioning as second-class citizens. Thus, throughout history, blacks and other minorities have been staggeringly underprivileged and considered systematic non-priorities. The mission of racism is bigger than pinning black against white. Rather, the purpose is to preserve a power structure by sustaining control. Taking Responsibility For America's History Understanding the framework of racism transitions into the second truth: White people don't want to take responsibility for their honest place in history. It's not a secret that America was built on the backs of enslaved and exploited minorities. The brutal realities of our history haunt this nation to such a degree, that reliving them through music, motion pictures and intense dialogue is often too piercing for white people to digest. However, to properly address the issue of racism and appropriately dispel the fraudulence of its foundation, white people would have to accept that everything America has been built upon, structurally and systematically, is birthed from a vicious lie. More so, it would need to be acknowledged that this lie is intentionally perpetuated through core competencies like language and education, as well as America's economic makeup and faulty legal system. As a consequence of accepting this truth, the concept of reparations, or other methods of repaying minorities for years of malice mistreatment would need to be seriously considered. Post-Racial vs. Post-Racist It is also important to provide clarity around what people are really fighting for. The overarching desire is not to live in a ""post-racial"" America, but to exist in a ""post-racist"" America. The goal is not for all races to be considered the same, but for each race to have a private identity and culture that is separate, but respected equally. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s dream was not grounded in the aspiration that race would be eliminated, but that every race could live peacefully in America, individually, with each having the freedom to enjoy the same liberties. A post-racial country insists a mass assimilation to one collective culture and identity, ultimately falling into dominant ideals. A post-racist country references the destruction of racism as an active ideology, stripping its power and condemning the enforcement of such discrimination going forward. This is not to say that all races practice exclusivity and withhold from sharing their culture, but each reserves the right to privatize the unique nuances that define them. Responding To Racism Another significant point of discussion is how blacks are expected to respond to instances of racism. When moments of ignorance or insensitivity arise in relation to the black experience, people of color are faced with the option to defend themselves, educate the masses, or defer from responding altogether. For those aware of history and the inner-workings of discrimination, the choice to defend their truth is instinctual. Making a decision to teach, though admirable and sometimes productive, means voluntarily taking on what could be delivering an endless course in blackness void of certainty that white people will legitimately walk away learning anything. Consequently, many black people don't want to teach because they simply lack a desire to, or feel it's not their responsibility -- and understandably so. It's exhausting to be reminded you're not valued equally. It's tough pushing to close a deficit you didn't choose to have. These things are what upset many black communities. Classism Fuels Racism For the many that confidently believe classism does not play into racism, the framework of class may need to be put into a clearer context. If you neutralized race, making all equal, classism would then determine value and ranking in society according to worth (money), assets and social status. Therefore, the measuring stick of power would then be determined by the accumulative differences in wealth among communities. Which, due to the established racial dynamics that placed people of color at a disadvantage, would still position whites atop the class system due to amassed wealth and control; resuming top priority for resources, opportunity, service and the like. Today, that system is also what drives racism.Privilege Is Misunderstood. For many, white privilege is merely a myth. Hearing privilege discussed amongst distinguished intellectuals and scholars is often interpreted as reactive speech to somewhat prehistoric realities of racism. Instead of enhancing the universal perspective of injustice and inequality, their attempts to elevate awareness land as misinformed lectures void of applicable lessons. Consequently, a substantial percentage of the population classifies dialogue about white privilege as imaginary and irrelevant, finding no value in addressing an ideology that seemingly has no tangible traits.Consequently, when turmoil strikes subjugated people in traditionally segregated cities, the finger is pointed to a lack of skill or ambition, not privilege. When young people of color find their identity in a lifestyle of criminal activity out of the desire to feed their family, we turn to messages in music as a fault of misguidance and stupidity, not privilege. Yet, what the vast majority fails or refuses to realize is that privilege is not a physical battle of black against white. Privilege is a mental war of politics and positioning. The movement for justice and racial equality is complex and multifaceted. For real change to occur, there must be an emphasis on developing a deeper cultural sensitivity and awareness, but also accepting an assortment of unpopular truths that have continued to kept this country bound for several decades. It's time that transparency takes precedence to face the realities of these truths, making even greater and more effective strides toward eradicating racism."

4,BUSINESS,Do We Need Managers?,"Jacob Morgan, ContributorAuthor, The Future of Work, Speaker, Futurist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/do-we-need-managers_b_6876846.html,"What would happen at your organization, if there were no managers? Would everything fall apart and go into chaos or would you see a more engaged workforce and a more successful organization?",2015-03-17,2015-03-16-1426507070-9718526-The_Managerless_Company.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-16-1426507070-9718526-The_Managerless_Company-thumb.jpg,"In 2011, Gary Hamel wrote a seminal article called First Let's Fire All the Managers where he explores the challenges with modern management and hierarchy. These include large overhead costs, poor decision making, sluggishness due to bureaucracy, and employee disengagement and lack of empowerment. Managers have long been considered to be the bedrock of organizations, so even thinking about getting rid of them is considered by many to be taboo. But, it's time for us to challenge convention and think differently about the world of work.According to the article:""A small organization may have one manager and 10 employees; one with 100,000 employees and the same 1:10 span of control will have 11,111 managers. That's because an additional 1,111 managers will be needed to manage the managers.""So what's the alternative? If managers are doing more harm than good, then can we really just get rid of them and still operate a successful organization? Yes! In my recent book, The Future of Work, I chronicle several ""managerless"" companies including Morningstar Farms, Sun Hydraulics, Valve, Medium, W.L. Gore ,Inc, and several others. Some of these companies like Valve, the gaming company that has produced such hits as Half-Life and Counter-Strike, are very tech savvy; whereas others are far more traditional such as Sun Hydraulics, which creates valves and manifolds, or Morningstar Farms that produces canned diced tomatoes and tomato paste. Clearly, this isn't just something that cool, hip, modern companies are doing.When I first heard about these companies without managers, I became quite curious. After all, how can anything possibly get done in this type of environment? In the visual below you can see a breakdown of how traditional organizations compare with ""managerless"" organizations in various areas ranging from hiring and firing to leadership to what happens at the company if something goes wrong.Of course, this type of a structure doesn't make sense for every company in the world, but the point is that this type of a scenario is possible and the organizations that have adopted this approach are doing very well. Most companies that I speak with and research are all trying to figure out ways to ""flatten"" their structures, and getting rid of managers may be a bit extreme for some. However, other organizations such as Tangerine (formerly ING Direct Canada) do have managers, yet they don't focus on these titles or roles internally. For example, in a meeting nobody would bring up seniority as a way to shut someone down. Other companies like Whirlpool have also shifted away from traditional managerial roles by creating four different types of ""leadership"" where everyone at the company is considered a leader of some kind (for example, if you are an entry level or junior employee you may be called ""a leader of self."")Whether your organization decides to get rid of managers or not, one thing is clear, the traditional models and approaches to how work gets done are dramatically changing. The future of work will see some very interesting experiments emerge -- some will be successful and others won't. I'll be writing more about these companies individually in the future, but for now I wanted to introduce the idea to get you thinking about it.What would happen at your organization, if there were no managers? Would everything fall apart and go into chaos or would you see a more engaged workforce and a more successful organization?Jacob Morgan is a futurist, best-selling author and keynote speaker, learn more by visiting The Future Organization.com or check out his latest book,""The Future of Work: Attract New Talent, Build Better Leaders and Create a Competitive Organization,"" on Amazon."

These tips aren't for all of your customers, rather, they're specifically reserved for your best ones - the ones who already generate the most revenue for your business. We'll go back to generating Zombie Loyalists out of all your clients in the next post, promise.Anyhow... I don't have to tell you how important loyalty is to your business. Countless studies have done that already, with stats galore: ""It costs X less to keep a current customer than it does to gain a new one,"" or ""a loyal customer is Y times more likely to be believed when they say how great you are as opposed to an advertisement.""So... Two rules:A) A loyal customer likes you, but can still be tempted by another brand, and can still leave you at any time.B) A lifelong loyal customer will stay with you through hell or high water, and nothing any other brand can do will ever tempt them away from you.So - How do you convert A into B? Considering how much effort you've spent to get your loyal customers, wouldn't you sleep a lot better at nig knowing you've made them lifelong loyal customers?Tweet: Turn a loyal customer into a lifelong loyal customer by doing things that make their lives easier. -@petershankman - http://bit.ly/1x7UfnVWhen a customer is already loyal, they don't need to be impressed by the simple things - That's what got them there in the first place. Instead, they're looking for you to help them simplify. They want you to remove worry form their lives.Here's the example that inspired this post, and was completely unexpected: I've been loyal to Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) for over ten years. They're my hotel chain, and I make sure that every year I stay at least 25 stays or 50 nights to keep my platinum status. For the past ten years, I've made sure that my hotel stays benefit my total nights so I'll maintain my platinum status, which gives me room upgrades, more points, and just a better loyalty experience. I had no idea how long I've been platinum with SPG, all I know is that it's important to me that I plan accordingly so I continue to make the goals to stay platinum. Sometimes, that involves having to stay at a hotel a distance away from my conference or speech, because I need to make sure I make my nights to keep my status.So imagine my surprise when, with no prior warning, I get this image in my inbox: Essentially, Starwood has just told me that for the rest of my life, I'll always be at their top-level of elite status, and I never again have to worry about ""making my numbers,"" or ""counting my nights.""I don't have to tell you how huge this is for anyone who travels at all, let alone weekly. This means that every single time I stay at a W, a Sheraton, a Westin, a Four Points, an Aloft, or a ton of other hotels in the SPG family, I'll automatically be upgraded to the best room or suite they have. I'll automatically get three Starpoints per every dollar I spend. I'll automatically get free lounge access, club floor access, free Wi-Fi access, etc.Starwood has just taken any worry out of every future hotel stay, for the rest of my life. Do you have any idea what a relief that is?? No more counting nights!Of course, with one very big caveat: I have to stay at a Starwood brand hotel to enjoy all of this.Here's the thing, though - Why the heck wouldn't I? I've been loyal to them for ten years, and they're thanking me in the biggest way they know how, and taking a huge worry off my shoulders, forever! Why would I ever want to stay anywhere else again?The secret to turning a loyal customer into a loyal-for-life customer? Do something that guarantees that they'll come back to you every single time, because going anywhere BUT you would cause them undue stress.Own a business-to-business corporation? Well, every salesperson is a human, as is every buyer. The salesperson needs to be able to figure out what the buyer's pain point is, and eliminate that worry.Restaurant? The loyal customer shouldn't have to worry about getting a table during a busy time. (Hello, Morton's!)Loyal customers are great.

8,POLITICS,"Civil Rights Bill Top Priority For LGBT Voters, According To New Poll",Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lgbt-discrimination_n_6879230.html,,2015-03-17,Ballot box with national flag on background - LGBT flag,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8edb2240000510057798e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- With the Supreme Court set to rule in the coming months on marriage equality, the gay rights community already is gearing up for its next big fight: the push for a comprehensive federal nondiscrimination bill. The Human Rights Campaign is out with a new poll Tuesday that shows 74 percent of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans believe such legislation should be a ""top priority"" for the community. Only marriage equality scored higher. The bill appears to have wide support among the general pool of likely 2016 voters as well, with 69 percent saying they support it and 27 percent opposing it. Even 51 percent of Republicans say they back these protections.Federal law already prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin in regard to housing, employment, education, credit, jury selection, federal funding and access to public spaces. But there are no explicit federal protections for sexual orientation and gender identity, meaning LGBT individuals are susceptible to discrimination unless the state they live in happens to have its own protections. According to the HRC survey, which was conducted by Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, 63 percent of LGBT Americans surveyed say they've experienced discrimination. Forty-seven percent have faced discrimination in the workplace, 19 percent in accessing public spaces, 14 percent in housing and 8 percent in the education system.In 2013, the Department of Housing and Urban Development conducted the first-ever study examining housing discrimination against same-sex couples at the national level. It found that they were ""significantly less likely than heterosexual couples to get favorable responses to e-mail inquiries about electronically advertised rental housing."" In fact, heterosexual couples were favored over gay male couples in 15.9 percent of the tests, and over lesbian couples in 15.6 percent. ""This data again demonstrates that most Americans are shocked to discover that many LGBT Americans can be denied a job, a room in a hotel, a seat at a restaurant, a place in school, equal access to credit, or housing because they still lack explicit federal protections from discrimination -- and that once people learn that, they overwhelmingly support the basic idea that LGBT Americans should be judged only on their merits, just like everyone else. It's time to act,"" said Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.).In November 2013, the Senate passed Merkley's Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which would have made it illegal to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity in the workplace. The House, however, never took up the legislation, and many LGBT groups later expressed concern that the bill's exemptions for religiously affiliated institutions were too broad. Merkley, along with Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), will be leading the legislative fight for a comprehensive nondiscrimination bill this spring. The legislation would be similar to the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which outlawed discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin.LGBT advocates expect them to introduce the bill in late spring, before the Supreme Court comes out with its marriage equality decision in June.According to The New York Times, groups like the Human Rights Campaign, American Civil Liberties Union and Lambda Legal Defense Fund have been meeting to work on a proposed bill for more than six months. “The simple and unfortunate reality is that for all the progress made in recent years, LGBT Americans still lack fundamental federal legal protections when it comes to issues like employment and housing,” said David Stacy, government affairs director for the Human Rights Campaign. “Nearly two-thirds of LGBT Americans report experiencing discrimination, which is why now more than ever, we need a federal bill to ensure that everyone, including LGBT Americans, has a fair chance to earn a living, advance themselves, and be judged on their performance, not on who they are or who they love.”The HRC poll also includes a cautionary note to politicians, with 64 percent of likely voters saying they would be less likely to support their member of Congress if he or she opposed a federal nondiscrimination bill. Vice President Joe Biden gave his endorsement to such legislation at a recent Human Rights Campaign event, saying, ""We have to pass the federal non-discrimination legislation, and we need to pass it now.""GQR surveyed 1,000 likely 2016 voters by live interviewers from Jan. 25 to 31. It also interviewed 1,000 LGBT Americans online from Jan. 23 to Feb. 3, using a web panel monitored by Research Now.Want more updates from Amanda? Sign up for her newsletter, Piping Hot Truth."

That you'd rather sit near the bathroom than the car seats. Or be squeezed in a middle seat rather than sit by a child. You'd prefer to stand in the terminal before you'd dare engage them in conversation.A pillar theme for our 2015, what we're calling the year of hope, is that we're choosing experiences over things. Adventure over ordinary. Memories over material.Writing that is easy. Doing it is hard. And it requires planning, daring and going. We had an incredible week in Florida. As far as vacations go, this was our best one yet. Some reasons were far outside of our control, but many were because we had a great plan (translated as my wife is a stud and prepared us well) and full hearts.Here are 12 travel tips for you families with young children. Not to make the inconveniences go away (because they won't) but to make more space for memories and the meaningful.1. Travel Light. Shed the excess, you won't need it. Pack light and pack with intention. You're staying a few days, not a few months. 2. Book the Rental Car Early. We used Priceline and got a brand new Suburban for $33 a day. It took a few days of hunting on different sites, but because we booked over a month out, we got a great deal.3. Bring $40 in One Dollar Bills. Whether it's the skycap, the rental car shuttle driver or the bellhop at the hotel, it pays to have a few extra bucks in hand to take care of those that are taking care of you. Be remembered for your generosity, not your nuisance.4. Buy Snacks Before The Airport. Brooke loaded up the carry-on bag with granola bars, gum (for ear-popping), crackers and fruit snacks. The Cinnabon smell still called out to us, but this saved us a few bucks at the airport while we waited to board the flight.5. Be Grateful. Traveling with children isn't easy. There are fights over beds, electronics and pool toys. There are encounters with waiters, flight attendants and other travelers. Choose to stick out because of your grateful attitude, not your entitled one. Things won't always go your way, the weather won't always be perfect and your accommodations won't always be ideal. But choose gratefulness instead of bitterness. People notice.6. Put Your Phone Away. Time away needs to be exactly that. Time away. From Facebook, work email, scheduling craziness, Twitter, endless text conversations... the list goes on. This one is hard for me. I run to my phone before my own family many times. I try and get the best picture for Instagram, not just the memory. I check in with work stuff even though I have people covering for me. Chances are pretty good that your world won't fall apart if you leave your phone behind for a few hours at a time.7. Check Luggage Curbside. It took us a few trips of schlepping bags and kids onto the rental car shuttle before we realized there was a much smarter way. Now we take everything and everyone to the curbside check in, unload the bags and car seats, check all of that stuff and then Brooke goes into the terminal with the kids. And I go back to the rental car return with one carry on bag and maybe one adventurous kid.8. Pack Small Individual Bags Into Bigger Bags. For seven of us for an entire week (actually eight days), we only checked five bags. Part of that was because we are learning to travel light. Another part of that is that Brooke packs small individual bags for each kid and then we shove those into bigger bags that we check. 9. Dress with the Airport in Mind. The dreaded security line with multiple young kids. Wear slip on shoes (with socks, that floor is nasty) and leave the belt in the bag. If you're leaving cold and headed to warmer weather, wear light layers that you can shed easily when you arrive. 10. Soak It Up. The sun, yes, but also the memories. No vacation will perfectly satisfy you, but work to be engaged and present during your short trip. These trips, whether they're across the world or simply down the road, are opportunities to forge deep meaning into your families. The bills, the work and the chaos will be there for you when you return. 11. Bring Cards, Books, Even Homework for Flights and Layovers. We'd be lying if we said we didn't put the iPad, iPod or other mind-numbing electronic device in front of our kids to entertain them. Especially on the plane. But we are also deliberate with them on these trips that we want their minds to wander, explore and create. It's not simply another place to go to watch Netflix or play Crossy Road. Books, playing cards, even homework can do the trick.12. Find a Song. For us this trip it was ""Geronimo"" by Sheppard. We saw them play on ""The Today Show"" and loved the song. So we bought it and played it every single time we were in the rental car. Windows down, laughing, singing. Music is part-magic, part-mystery. There's no doubt in my mind that every time our kids hear this particular song, they'll think of this specific time in Florida. "
10,WORLDPOST,Why Britain Joining China-Led Bank Is a Sign of American Decline,"Kishore Mahbubani, ContributorDean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/britain-china-bank-america-decline_b_6877942.html,SINGAPORE -- The U.S. can no longer dominate world history. A new power has also arrived. The British decision to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank was an epochal event. It may have heralded the end of the American century and the arrival of the Asian century.,2015-03-16,China's economy is nearly four times bigger than ours,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc1474e2300003300d0c763.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"SINGAPORE -- Some events are epochal. The decision by Great Britain to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank was one such event. It may have heralded the end of the American century and the arrival of the Asian century. A clue to the epochal significance of this event came from a senior U.S. government official interviewed by the Financial Times. His sharp words were very telling: ""We are wary about a trend toward constant accommodation of China, which is not the best way to engage a rising power."" No ally has been as faithful to the U.S. as the British. Only they would follow the United States into the Iraqi quagmire -- and that was only 12 years ago. Today, that same ally has decided that history has turned a corner. The U.S. can no longer dominate world history. A new power has also arrived. The British, like most other middle powers, have decided to hedge their bets and work with China as well as the U.S. But this is also a matter of survival. If London does not serve the financial and economic interests of a rising China, it could become sidelined in the 21st century. Hence, the British have no choice but to work with China.The petulant White House reaction was predictable. Sadly, it was also unwise. Any objective and calm assessment of the Chinese decision to launch the AIIB would show that this is a bank whose time has come. The Asian Development Bank has estimated that Asia needs to spend at least $8 trillion in infrastructure investment. The American-dominated World Bank and related institutions cannot possibly fulfill this demand. China's decision to use its reserves to boost Asian infrastructure investment was clearly welcomed in Asia. Given its spectacular success with developing world-class infrastructure in record time, China has a lot of expertise in this area. Asia needs this.Until the British joined the AIIB, America had been publicly denying that it was discouraging countries from joining the new bank, even though it was well known that America was doing so. Australia and South Korea held back from joining the AIIB because of direct calls from Washington. Now that the British have joined, there is no reason for them to hold back any longer. America should wisely accept their decision. Publicly, America said that it could not support the AIIB because it could only support an institution with high standards of governance. If America truly wants these high standards of governance, it should welcome the British decision to join. The British can and should lobby for the position of vice president of corporate governance at AIIB. If high British standards of the rule of law and corporate governance are embedded in the AIIB, the bank could provide a role model of a new kind of international institution. Sadly, the American-dominated World Bank cannot serve as a model for the AIIB. It is now well known that the World Bank has served as an instrument of American foreign policy. Joe Stiglitz has documented how the World Bank punished Ethiopia at the request of private American banks, which had lost revenue on loans to Ethiopia. If the U.S. wants high standards of governance in the AIIB, it should serve as a role model and agree to relinquish control of the World Bank. It should also allow true meritocratic governance, instead of insisting that only an American can run the World Bank. At the end of the day, this new competition between America and China to produce better multilateral institutions will be good for the world. This will be a race to the top in corporate governance, and not a race to the bottom. It does not matter whether America wins or China wins. Either way, we will see an improvement in the standards of managing institutions of global governance. In the process, the Asian people will be better off. And the Asian century will arrive faster."

The corriente that ran through the neighborhood is gone. There's no Jerry Rivera blasting from passing cars. La doña who never left her spot at the window of her second floor apartment on Grove Street, is gone.",2015-03-16,2015-03-16-1426521558-6976656-familypicnicmerylmeisler.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-16-1426521558-6976656-familypicnicmerylmeisler-thumb.jpg,"I say, ""I'm from Brooklyn,"" like there's a grenade exploding from my mouth.I walk different after saying it. My step is a little harder, my shoulders more square, nose held higher in the air. It's a momentary self-assuredness that follows me for a spell.I feel it rise into my jaw when I see her approach across the water as I'm crossing the Williamsburg Bridge; when the train doors close on First Avenue and the L snakes under the East River.The thing is, the Brooklyn I'm from isn't the Brooklyn of today. It's not that funky Brooklyn that I keep in my back pocket in case somebody tries it. (You don't wanna mess with a girl from 1980s Bushwick.)My Brooklyn is the Brooklyn of the Domino sugar factory and rubble. Nostalgia can be a confusing thing. It isn't always for the neat and pristine. It's sometimes a longing for something you know wasn't always pretty, but was always home._____When people speak of the old Brooklyn, when they refer to it in articles and essays, the Brooklyn before the organic markets and food co-ops, before there was a trash can on every corner and community gardens -- they talk about it like it was all bad, like all there was was poverty and crack and single moms (because you know, we're the bane of existence, right?) violence and high school dropouts.When I discovered my seven year old self in a picture in an exhibit by Meryl Meisler, I hesitated before reaching out to her. I was far too familiar with the images of my old neighborhood from way back when. Yes, there was drugs; yes, there were addicts and there was violence and the blaring sirens from the fire trucks were so common that they became white noise -- but you know what? There was also love, there were people who thrived in that and loved in that, and raised families in that. What I loved about Meryl's work was that that's what she focused on. There's no images of the crack vials in the gutter or the mother pulling hard on her pipe while her child looks on. There's none of that. Why? Because there was more than that, and that's what Meryl documented.So when people talk about gentrification like it's something that saved the neighborhood, that saved my people, it's real reminiscent of the defense of colonization and the idea that the white man came to the new world to civilize the savages. There's something insidious about that mindset. It's called Columbus-ing._____When I think of Brooklyn, the first word that comes to mind is home. But my home isn't today's Brooklyn. Those quaint cafés and yoga studios were not built for me. My Brooklyn isn't the Brooklyn where a townhouse just hit the market with an asking price of $40 million dollars.There's something about losing our homes that's particularly grating. Humans have a natural pull to where we're from, like umbilical cords that keep us linked to a maternal figure, a patria, something greater than ourselves; a place of where we felt safe and welcome, where we could be our full selves. To have that taken away and be made to feel like strangers in our own land is jarring and painful in so many ways.I miss the sense of community of the old neighborhood. I miss the intrinsic Latino flavor that signaled that I was home as soon as I stepped off the L train on Myrtle Avenue. The piragüero on the corner who knew me by name and always asked for my mother. The borinqueña waving in the wind from every other window. The bodeguero Miguel who gave us credit when the food stamps ran out. And our Boricua neighbor from next door who gave us a tembleque during the holidays and mom gave her tamales.We all need to feel like we belong somewhere, and that's what Bushwick gave me, especially after I left for boarding school at 13 and found myself rootless in the world. Nostalgia is strange like that. Sometimes it's a longing for the gritty and profane._____My mind goes to that woman who came to the Bushwick Open Studios Exhibit I co-curated with Meryl Meisler (Defying Devastation: Bushwick Then and Now) and read my work on gentrification. She shifted uncomfortably as she read, breathing heavily, her leg started shaking and she folded her arms over her chest, folding and unfolding several times. ""But Nyssa's white,"" she told me, as if I hadn't notice this fact about Nyssa, the owner of The Living Gallery. ""What's your point?"" ""Well, you're talking about us."" ""Is that all you got from the piece?"" She rolled her eyes, shrugged and walked away.She didn't want to understand where I was coming from, or at least I didn't see her making any attempt to. I heard the defensiveness in her voice, the ""us versus you"" in her tone. It didn't matter that the exhibit was an attempt at a dialogue about gentrification and how we can possibly connect those who have been here for a long time and those who are fresh arrivals, new to the city and this neighborhood that has so much history, so much life, where so much existed before even this woman was born. I wanted to tell her that before she came to this earth, I'd had my first kiss less than a mile away in the hallway of 365 Palmetto Street. Across the street and three blocks down was where I started to come out of my shell and saw that maybe I did have a knack for this writing thing. And a block over from there was where I practiced for months before hopping on a plane to Turkey in April of 1989 to represent the U.S. at the NATO Children of the World Festival. The irony does not escape me that a group of brown and black kids from Bushwick were chosen to represent the U.S. at this festival all those years ago.These days, when I go back to Bushwick what I remember isn't what is. The corriente that ran through the neighborhood is gone. There's no Jerry Rivera blasting from passing cars. La doña who never left her spot at the window of her second floor apartment on Grove Street, is gone. She took her PR curtain flag with her. The cuchifrito spot on the corner is gone too; there's a $5 cappuccino spot there now. When I went in to order a café, the barrista said, ""You mean coffee?"" ""No,"" I said, ""I mean café."" I almost slapped him when he charged me $3 for an eight ounce cup. The café wasn't even good._____I read on Twitter that on her desk writer Tayari Jones has ""a tiny jar containing a few spoonfuls of earth from Lorain, Ohio. This is how much I love Toni Morrison."" I thought of that junk yard next to our building at 383 Palmetto Street, and that backyard where I'd climb up the plum tree. In those connected yards was where I started telling myself stories. There are the roots to this writing life I created for myself. In that junk yard, among the debris, the lumber with rusted nails sticking out at all angles, the piles of car tires and license plates, the feral cats that nested beneath all that rubble, there I started telling myself stories, I started imagining a different life, I imagined myself the female Indiana Jones and that I was a dancer like Leroy and Coco in Fame.If I could, I'd have a tiny jar containing spoonfuls of that soil. The soil from back then. The soil that fed mami's garden those two years that she planted her tomatoes and peppers and eggplant, before she brought her plants inside because there she could protect them, outside she could not.That soil didn't need anyone to save it. That soil is what did the saving. That soil is what molded and saved this girl, who is now writing this essay at her desk, living this life that she started imagining way back in the Brooklyn people denigrate.The other day at a reading in Greenpoint, an audience member asked, ""Where are you from and how does that shape your work?"" I said, ""I'm from Brooklyn,"" like I had a grenade exploding in my mouth. I survived boarding school and Columbia University and those people that said I couldn't and I shouldn't because I'm brown and woman and poor, I survived all that because I'm from Brooklyn. Nearly 40 years old and that's still true.Thank you, Brooklyn. Como tú, no hay, y nunca habra, otra."

Following SAE's decision, the university closed the fraternity house, which the school owns, and ordered the students living there to vacate the property. Fifty-nine percent of poll respondents said OU made the correct call in closing the frat house, while 15 percent said it was the wrong decision and 27 percent weren't sure. Older Americans and Democrats tended to be more supportive of the university than those ages 18-29, Republicans and independents.OU also said last week that it would expel two students for their ""leadership role"" in the singing. Most Americans agreed with this decision as well, with 57 percent saying it was the right move to 17 percent saying it was wrong. Twenty-six percent were not sure.Those ages 18 to 29 were less likely (45 percent) to say expelling the two students was right. But as with the decision to shutter the frat house, they were also more likely (39 percent) to say they just weren't sure if it was right or wrong. Commentators have suggested that OU, a public university, violated the students' First Amendment rights by expelling them for racist speech.The YouGov poll surveyed 997 people between March 11 and March 13, using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.

Obviously I can't see them everyday.Of course it is hard to see them regularly. But overcoming hard should be chips to get in the game when it comes to the most important things in our lives. So...no excuse there. If it is important, we will make time.Do I email with them? Do I Whatsapp? Yes, occasionally. But not regularly. And Facebook doesn't count.

But there is another factor at play here too. Often, the people we love the most, the people we value the most (in business too!) get the short end of the stick. We feel we can get away with a certain lack of attention that we can then apply to less forgiving priorities. We think that our friendship is so strong that we can relax on the investment side.Wrong.

Each week you would head to your local mom and pop VHS (or Betamax) shop in hopes of grabbing the latest new release. But, alas, your dreams were often shattered by someone who just picked up the last copy. Long before any immediate way of choosing an alternate film (i.e. Rotten Tomatoes, iPhone trailers), you spent the next 60 to 90 minutes allowing the video box art to dictate your selections. During the glory years of videocassettes, production companies often used video box artwork as the sole messenger of a film's contents, turning the video store into a makeshift underground film art gallery. They certainly they knew their target market, frequently going after the coming of age teens that dreamed of wild sexual encounters, space travel, severed heads and anything explosive. Videotape art was also the only line of defense for studios that couldn't proudly announce a celebrity cast or ""Two Thumps Up!"" on their packaging. This nostalgic trip is superbly captured in Thomas Hodge's new ode to the videocassette era, VHS Video Cover Art, which contains over 240 full-scale video sleeves according to genre, just like an actual video store. However, don't expect a typical collection of familiar titles and images. nstead, Hodge selected movies that had the greatest visual impact on his current career in independent film artwork, including cult flicks such as The Bikini Carwash Company, Cocaine Wars and Savage Streets (with Linda Blair).""VHS covers were the face of film as I was growing up,"" says Hodge (aka ""The Dude Designs""). I loved renting videos and the excitement of browsing endless rows of tapes. The artwork was so visually potent. As a kid I even made my own video covers for films that I recorded from television, which lead to a career in graphic design.VHS Video Cover Art will be available worldwide in May. Check it out."

21,QUEER VOICES,Opening the Door to the Deliciously Disabled: The Importance of Having Accessibility in Sexual Spaces,"Andrew Morrison-Gurza, ContributorDisability Awareness Consultant",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opening-the-door-to-the-d_1_b_6868040.html,"The deeper issue for me lies in the fact, that by not having access to these spaces, I am denied the opportunity to safely show off my sexuality. I am denied the chance to be anonymous. I am denied the possibility of the prowl, the chase and rolling up in my chair to go in for the kill.",2015-03-16,"Berkeley, California, United States, North America",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafd83d2200004301db2437.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Over the past few weeks, I have been invited to a few sexy dance parties in the queer community. My Facebook has been blowing up with invites to underwear parties, back room boogies and tasty two steps. Each time I receive these invites, my heart swells at the thought of them. I get a huge, shit-eating grin on my face at the thought of even being in the presence of these beautiful men. Just as quickly as the pitter patter of possibility pulls my strings, and I am whisked away to my fantasy (which may involve a lot of mood lighting, beards and leather, by the way), I am abruptly halted and handicapped by my reality: Many of these spaces are inaccessible to the deliciously disabled, and that is problematic. I want to explore what it feels like not to be able to directly access these spaces as a person with a disability. How does it feel on an emotional level? I also want to examine what it would mean if these spaces considered accessibility, and what exactly that would mean for the community as a whole. Lack of access for persons with disabilities is a constant fight. This is nothing new to any of us, nor is it something that we will ever stop advocating for. There have been many moments where I have had to decline a dance party because the venue can't hold all my amazingness. I just tell myself that they're not ready for all my jelly and move on. But then I go home and imagine all that I might be missing. I turn on the music, attempting to drown it out by dancing. No luck. The thoughts linger, hang and gnaw at me. If I am being honest, I am mourning the maleness, accessing my masculinity, and the memories I wanted to make. The deeper issue for me lies in the fact, that by not having access to these spaces, I am denied the opportunity to safely show off my sexuality. I am denied the chance to be anonymous. I am denied the possibility of the prowl, the chase and rolling up in my chair to go in for the kill. I don't get to look in your eyes with a half smile and wheel away, waiting for you to follow me to the back room. A lack of access leaves embers of lust, a desire that is never quite satiated. These are the outlets where sex and sexuality is free and fun. For me, it is all forbidden. Stairways that lead to smoke-filled rooms are just reminders that I am removed.When I think of accessible sex spaces and why they are critically important, I think of the young queer cripple who lives at home with their parents, and who can't get out to be who they are. Having accessible space to engage in sexuality would mean that if I chose to, I wouldn't have to host you; if I don't feel like explaining every piece of my Palsy to you, I don't have to. It would mean that I don't have to attach a false sense of permanence to our play; there would be no misinterpretations to be had. Considering accessibility in these spaces would strengthen the bond within the queer community. Providing access to these sexual sanctuaries would show the community all it is that they are missing. Disability and difference would soon be in demand. Instead of racing up the stairs holding hands on your way to the back room with that beautiful boy, you could have your hands on the back of my chair, watching each revolution of my wheels up the ramp, reveling in what might come. Accessibility in these spaces would remind me that the community considers disability a dish not to merely to be tasted, but to be devoured. Opening the door to disability in sexual spaces allows for everyone to bask in the warm, red glow of desire (for some reason, I assume that all sexy spaces are lit in this way). Failing to do so leaves the cute cripple crankily craving, but most unfortunately, it leaves the queer community out in the cold on all that could be when it comes to disability.This piece originally appeared on the blog A Dose of Deliciously Disabled."

Over the last 200 years it took form of an Anglo-American worldview introducing the age of economics: industrialization, liberal representative democracy, colonization, and economic growth sponsored by innovation. These elements coalesced into economic globalization. The seismograph now registers something more sinister than cracks; the needle indicates underlying challenges to virtually all fundamental elements.The alpha male of the world order, the US, is neither willing nor capable of defending the steering system. It has ceased being the indispensable nation. The streak of idealism has disappeared, forcing the US to fall back on raw power despite the talk about soft power. Moral authority has slipped away, no longer available to support and substantiate US policies and interventions. The malaise starts at home. The Americans no longer trust their own model and no longer express willingness to ""export"" it. Inequality is growing. The family, important for raising children, is gradually being sidetracked; single parent children have less experience of living together with other people. Together these societal ""earthquakes"" annihilate coherence and commonality, thus undermining common purposes and consensus. Around the world the US model -- as the ultimate objective or a blueprint to be adopted albeit with adaptations and adjustments -- has lost its allure. The American way of life is still attractive, but neither the US political system nor the economic model evokes similar feelings. Absence of moral authority has opened the door for a flurry of new ideas, new ideologies and new models, all of them tampering with, picking holes in, and contesting the existing world order. Economic globalization is being challenged by economic nationalism. Economic globalization has worked wonders and still delivers higher economic growth than any other palatable model. There are several problems, though.Almost ex definitione economic globalization rips into people's cultural identity rooted in nationalism, regionalism, religion, and family culture perceived as norms for daily life. People have so far been willing to sacrifice a part of their cultural identity because the rewards through economic globalization were large and tangible. With falling global growth it is not so any longer. Policies to keep it going proliferate in the shadow of lower growth, crowding out many national rules and in the process alienating people from political control of the economy -- feeling the system is not theirs, but set up, run, and controlled by 'somebody.' The concentration of capital and consequently control of the economy has taken a dramatic turn over the last two decades. The number of financial institutions, including banks, has decreased, giving fewer institutions -- and implicitly fewer people running these institutions -- a power over the global economy never seen before. 147 companies control directly or indirectly 40 percent of global business transactions. The link between the entrepreneur and the workers both living in the same community and meeting each other does not exist anymore. Ownership becomes more and more impersonal and non-transparent through funds whose ownership is blurred with an agenda of short-term profit -- playing the game of financial wizardry -- and uninterested in building a long term genuine business activity providing jobs. It is disturbing that surveys unequivocally show a deliberate policy to avoid taxes and, if that's not possible, to shuffle revenues and profits around to minimize taxes; many nations see no tax revenue from multinational companies operating there at full throttle. The degree of inequality is growing. Recent analyses disclosed that globally the 138 richest people possess higher wealth than the 3.5 billion poorest people. Another survey revealed that soon the one percent richest people's wealth would be higher than what the rest of mankind possessed.The citizen comes easily to the conclusion that if higher growth goes to the already wealthy persons an economic model with lower growth more equally distributed may be better for him or her. Extremism versus compromise and consensus may not be new in an historical perspective, but from 1945 until a decade or two ago compromise and consensus reigned largely unchallenged. The fanaticism giving birth to Nazism, Fascism, and Communism may explain why the Western worldview moved fast and strongly in this. It may be this dominance -- this success -- that gave rise to opposition rallying around extremism often using (abusing?) religion. From a Western point of view it took the shape of Muslim fanatics, but it is not a phenomenon unique for Islam. Wahhabism is the driving force behind much terrorism ascribed to Islam yet counts less than 10 million people. Christian fundamentalism rejects the evolution theory and thus science and technology as cornerstones in modern societies. Not to kill and non-violence are central to Buddhism and yet news comes out of Buddhist monks instilling hatred against Muslims. Hindu extremism (nationalism) is a force to be reckoned with in India. It is hard to escape the observation that religion is hijacked by extremism.Urbanization has produced a class of social losers. They find it difficult to accept their new conditions and even more difficult to admit that it may be due to an inadequate education system and petrified economic structure resisting the combination of modernization and development. Instead they blame foreigners and the Western economic model. From there to seek refuge in religion -- at least for some of them -- is not a big step. The next one in the form of violence as defense of identity requires justification, which is offered by religious fanatics quoting religious texts -- often out of context. Three swing factors explain why this cause-effect is more visible among groups of Muslims than for other religious groups. First, the Muslim world is geographically close to Europe. For centuries Christianity and Islam have confronted each other. Since industrialization a large part of the Middle East and the Arab world became part of the British and French Empires. The once proud times with opposite roles were not forgotten, explaining growing animosity and anger looking for an explanation; and even more important, how to reestablish a more equal relationship. Second, the Muslim world and Islam are special: almost all other cultures welcomed the Western culture or aspects thereof. Islam was left as the only theocratic ""worldview"" fundamentally different from not only the Western worldview but secularity. Muslims felt that they and their religion had a special role. Third, Muslim immigration into Europe now accounts for between four percent and almost 10 percent, respective on which country is observed; this has been a game changer. These immigrants constitute a link between the European (Western) cultures and their home countries and the culture there. The integration does not go smoothly partly because of lower economic growth, turning many of them into social losers who blame their new home countries. They float around without identity being torn between their new home and where they or their parents came from. Social networking offers ample opportunities to connect with others in similar situations searching for answers. They want an identity. Some of them are seduced by fanatics convincing them that the grievances they nurse are justified. Violence against the oppressors (economic globalization and the Western worldview) are preached by extremists as the only way to solve the dilemma. Successful attacks proves the point that the Western model is decadent and impotent, thus giving credence to the message of the extremists. The response of the West by invading Muslim countries adds fuel to the flames, offering the extremists the gift of referring to the Crusades and the Colonial Era. Terrorists use (abuse) religions to justify violence and move the world into a cognitive vacuum, void of values and norms, which raises the specter of a depraved mankind.Social networking may enhance segregation. At a first glance social networking may improve mutual understanding among people and respect for values, but a closer inspection discloses a serious risks to tolerance and mutual respect.People using social networking tend to communicate with those of analogous culture/behavioral values. They reinforce each other in their beliefs, promoting non-compromising attitudes, solidifying views that ""we"" are right and ""they"" are wrong. These networking groups withdraw into their castles, hoisting the intellectual -- or rather mindset -- drawbridge. Before the internet information quality control weeded out incorrect or culturally offending communication. It was the responsibility of the Editor in Chief. In a worst case scenario he/she could be held accountable -- legally or ethically. Today anybody can post the most preposterous statements on the net. The danger enhances when the net is used for information that looks serious and factual, but is in fact deliberately misleading. In today's world the individual is exposed to pressure of impression through the overwhelming mass of information and constant invitation to communicate by the web and networking. Similarly, economic globalization through the market and a vast array of goods and services force the individual to make choices in daily life, which may seem terrific, but embeds risks and uncertainties not hitherto known. Taken together, well-known identity in local communities and established cultural norms are under massive attack. The individual reacts by moving back to basics: Who am I?The response has been to look for joining groups anchored in common and shared values. Social networking makes this accessible for the majority. A worrying effect is a deeper segregation of societies with value walls arising inside nation-states dividing groups according to culture -- values. Formerly the nation-state acted as service provider for the population offering human, economic, and social security. The lower growth in the slipstream of the economic downturn deprives nation-states of the financial means to fulfill that role. People fall back on groups outside the state framework to supplement or outright replace the state as service provider. That being the case they become captive of the group having stepped in to provide the services they need. A lower social and geographical mobility follows.In some cases groups formed by extremists prevent members from leaving, and if necessary by applying their own jurisdiction detached from the state or local community. It becomes an all or nothing. Parallel societies flourish, but are sometimes difficult to detect as they do not openly challenge the state. The result is no loyalty to the state and no identification with citizens of the same state. Religion is an obvious candidate for group values, but far from the only one and maybe not the strongest value connecting people. Culture in a region or similar geographical or political unity as seen in the old European regions (Scotland, Catalonia, Bavaria, and Lombardy to mention a few examples) resurface after two hundred years in the shadow. Various lifestyles (e.g. motorcycle gangs) work in the same way. Technology is crowding out human interaction, taking us into a world of communication and interaction among humans, but with actually very little human contact. People, especially young people, spend more and more of their time separated from other humans, but ""linked"" to their PC or whatever device they use for communication. Their world is becoming something like a comic strip where neither the person nor those he/she communicates with sense or feel the consequences because what they see is images or texts, but not genuine human beings. The world of downloading and games convey the impression that it is possible to undo what happened and start anew. Disasters, pain, and even death befalling others are not felt because people captivated by the device world do not know what the real world is. People enrolled in this non-natural world becomes insensitive, even callous, confronted with fellow human beings' suffering. Violence, cruelty, and terrorism to others do not matter and cannot be judged in a human perspective. They apparently do not feel any inhibition to undertake actions that hurt fellow human beings. There is much talk about robots and artificial intelligence surpassing human beings, relegating them to ""slaves."" It seems more urgent to look at how human beings turn into clones of machines without feelings eroding fundamentals of humanity. Fundamental rights of freedom have gained ground over the preceding decades even if it may not look like that reading mass media, mainly in the Western World, lamenting the state of affairs in countries rarely analyzed throughout. A mix up of fundamental freedom with human rights, freedom of expression, and democracy penetrates almost all writings blurring the issues. Fundamental rights of freedom can be defined as the citizen's right to define his or her own cultural profile vis-a-vis other human beings and vis-à-vis the state -- no human being lives in a dome of a cheese-dish so the question is what can be done and what can be said provided a person wants to continue living in this society, community, or group? The English philosopher John Locke (1632-1704) stated that freedom presupposes self-discipline. Individuals going too far force a collapse of common and shared values without which the group or community cannot hold together. The will of the strongest takes over from values. Freedom becomes the victim. The individual will be without protection from either fellow citizens through common values or rule of law with everybody equal to the law. The task to find the limits and thereby defend fundamental rights of freedom rests with the individual. Neither the group nor the community/society can solve the conundrum. Group behavior and common values diminish (ideally remove) the need for enforcement. The less deep seated or inbred common values are, the more likely it is that enforcement escalate into supervision and control -- actually turning into autocracy violating fundamental rights of freedom. Freedom of expression is embedded in fundamental rights of freedom provided that self-discipline is incorporated in behavioral patterns, but if not these two ideals risk being irreconcilable. As events over the preceding decade have shown, freedom of expression inside groups or communities, even nation-states, neglecting outside values raises the question of what freedom of expression means. If the reaction of groups with different values becomes too strong, the state intervenes to prevent conflicts. If the state does not intervene, outside groups may take it into their own hands to signal that their values have been violated. In both cases there will be limits -- written or unwritten -- for freedom of expression, however much it is denied. ""If you use your freedom of expression at my expense do we then both have the same degree of freedom?"" is a counterargument.The concept of human rights suffers from the weakness that it is difficult to define and globally seen as a Western phenomenon. For cultural groups and nation-states not wishing to adopt the Western societal and political system this link makes human rights unpalatable, even if many of its elements are integrated in their societies and thrive well. The West would have done wisely in telling other nations and cultural groups about the virtues of human rights as practiced in the West instead of teaching and trying to ""export"" the model, not realizing how long it took to strike roots in the Western world and the vast differences between cultural backgrounds in the West and other cultural spheres. The perception is that freedom cannot be achieved without democracy. There are several weaknesses in this point of view. In many non-Western countries there is skepticism about democracy as seen in the West and the position that freedom cannot be achieved under any other political system is not accepted. The vast majority wants fundamental rights of freedom, but is disposed to give another political system a try before jumping on board alternative political systems of which they know very little. What happened in Iraq does not exactly entice them. Most countries in Asia and Africa are multicultural, multireligious, and multiethnic. In these countries the state protects the minorities. Democracy with free elections may deliver a parliamentary majority constituting a government uniquely composed of one of these cultural groups, opening the door to exercise cultural imperialism, or even worse to oppress the minorities. Supporters of democracy and free elections have not been able to square this circle and explain why democracy promotes fundamental rights of freedom under such circumstances. In established democracies voters cast their vote according to political parties' performances -- at least a sufficient number to change the majority do. Not so in most multicultural countries with a voting pattern fixed by cultural identity.Illiberal democracies are emerging as a strange hybrid. On the surface they look like democracies, but in reality they violate most democratic principles at the same times as fundamental rights of freedom are under attack and in some cases barely exist. There is, however, a distinction to draw between illiberal democracies in countries close to or belonging to the Western circle of culture (let's label them monoculture countries) and countries outside the Western circle.For the second group of countries illiberal democracy may be seen as a step in developing a political system, be it democracy or something else, and groping to find the best way to deal with fundamental rights of freedom bearing in mind the ""constraints"" of multiculturalism. In some cases the status of fundamental rights of freedom may be better than a decade or two ago. For the first group of countries the picture is different. For them illiberal democracy may be and often is a retrograde step ruling out genuine democracy and seeing illiberal democracy as a cloak for autocracy, even dictatorship. As most of these countries are geographically close to Western democracies they turn into battlefields for societal systems, as Ukraine is a clear example of. If Ukraine succeeds as a genuine democracy combined with economic prosperity, the pressure on Russia and its leaders to change the political system will grow. If Russia succeeds in preventing Ukraine from embarking on this course, the pressure on a number of Central and Eastern European countries will rise; adjacent nation-states to the east running a much less liberal and less open system will not be ""nice"" neighbors. Unfortunately for Western democracies, especially for the U.S. Congress, a new phenomenon, which may be labelled oligarch democracy to borrow from abroad, is gaining ground. In 1986 winners of a seat in the House of Representatives spent $360,000, skyrocketing to $1.6 million, in 2012 -- an increase of 344 percent. For the Senate the corresponding figures (all adjusted for inflation) are $6.4 million and $10.4 million -- up 62 percent. Add to this the amount spent on lobbying. Over the last decade oil, gas, and coal lobbied for around $100 million per year with the overwhelming part going to the Republicans; over the two years 2008-2009, during the financial crisis, lobbying by the financial sector has been calculated at more than $800 million. It takes a brave person to maintain that under such circumstances the political system and individual politicians have managed to wriggle themselves free of influence exercised by donors and lobbyists. It questions the very character of liberal representative democracy expected to reflect the social strata of the population; the money factor rules that out. Xenophobia albeit in a milder form is becoming more widespread and creeps surreptitiously onto the political agenda as something everybody knows, but few admit. It is more and more difficult to get into other countries to work; several countries are introducing schemes requiring proof that a national cannot do the job before admitting a foreigner; limits or quotas surface.The main worry in a ""philosophical"" sense is the tacit acceptance that human beings are not equal. Broadly speaking, until a decade or so ago it looked like the world was moving in the direction of equality, but the restrictions for immigration and work permits may be the first shots in a coming conflict about values centered on discrimination of human beings according to culture, race, and religion.History provides examples (e.g. the interwar period in Europe) that if this door opens, in whichever way it happens, escalation into outright discrimination justifying oppression followed by maltreatment and cruelty may be next. Those in power (maybe the majority) feel entitled to adopt such policies because other people are not their equals. Many Germans who in 1930 would never have dreamed about killing Jews did so ten years later under the pretext that Jews were not human beings like them. You cannot get a foothold on a slippery slope! The elite versus the majority. The values used to be set by a comparatively small number of human beings -- the elite and well-educated strata who possessed a lingua franca facilitating communication among the members of this select group. This has changed with exponential speed over the last quarter of a century.The global elite has turned to English as a global and common language, but they still think and act according to their original culture, giving the same word different meanings: A common language at the expense of a lingua franca! The Anglo-American culture does not any longer reign supreme; other cultures and religions have re-emerged from hibernation. Values and the sharing of values across borders have slipped out of the elite's control; millions, maybe even billions, of people use social networking to contest reigning values and the role of the elite. The global communication takes place on separate levels with insiders (the elite) and outsiders (the majority) communicating independently. In a long-term perspective this division overshadows economic inequality as a threat to globalization. It may not be politically correct to say so, but the non-elite do not have the same upbringing and education; it tends to be more nationalistic and less interested in the many facets of globalization. The non-elite act more by intuition and automatic response steered by emotions and ""near to me values,"" making its members easy prey for seduction, supporting snap decisions, and favoring short-term solutions often at the expense of ""others."" They are less critical and more emotional. The more time-consuming and laborious way of proceeding by rationality and logic, applying critical analysis inherited from the enlightenment, is brushed aside. This may not be totally new, but the scale is. Lessons from history and what we have seen over the last quarter of a century indicate that the elite may be capable of dealing with such movements provided that the economy is good, there is confidence in the economic model and the political system is highly regarded -- in short, the elite delivers results. This is precisely what has been lost over the last 10 or maybe 15 years where the ""global model"" did not deliver and misled the voters by skirting the truth, losing credibility in the process, and in many cases turning events from bad to worse and inviting alternative thinking to the surface.The question is whether civilization as we know it can survive a transformation from values laid down by a few (the elite) to a global auction offering different and often conflicting values and perceptions. With luck a kind of benign global civilization may emerge. The alternative is conflicts born out of values justifying violence and armed conflicts against those who think otherwise -- the easy way.People's power may look wonderful, but it is dangerous to overlook that it opens the door for values kept under lid and control when perceptions were shaped by those able and willing to incorporate repercussions on others of their actions. Populism lurks around the corner.The Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza (1632-1677) pondered about this dilemma. Democracy is the most reasonable form of government; for in it ""every one submits to the control of authority over his actions, but not over his judgment and reason; i.e., seeing that all cannot think alike, the voice of the majority has the force of law."" The defect of democracy is its tendency to put mediocrity into power; and there is no way of avoiding this except by limiting office to men of ""trained skill."" Numbers by themselves cannot produce wisdom, and may give the best favors of office to the grossest flatterers. ""The fickle disposition of the multitude almost reduces those who have experience of it to despair; for it is governed solely by emotions, and not by reason."" Thus democratic government becomes a procession of brief-lived demagogues, and men of worth are loath to enter lists where they must be judged and rated by their inferiors. Sooner or later the more capable men rebel against such a system, though they be in a minority. ""Hence I think it is that democracies change into aristocracies, and these at length into monarchies""; people at last prefer tyranny to chaos. Equality of power is an unstable condition; men are by nature unequal; and ""he who seeks equality between unequals seeks an absurdity."" A new system. The world is passing through one of these rare but tumultuous phases where an existing order is unable to accommodate changes. Possibly the age of economics will be recorded as an interregnum to build the materialistic foundation to take humanity into an age of non-materialistic values as was the case for many ancient cultures. If so, it is unlikely that the shift emerges in the US having been so committed to economic thinking.A resurrection of Asian values subdued over the last 250 years -- indeed culturally oppressed and crowded out by Western values -- can happen. Asian religions and philosophies offer an alternative anchored in a less materialistic worldview, a better and deeper acknowledgment of interactions between God, nature, and human beings, and a stronger role for the collective versus the individual. In some, maybe even many respects, traditional Asian values stand for the opposite of the Anglo-American value system. An example of this is the low ranking in the traditional Chinese hierarchy of the merchant and the high ranking of the farmer. Money did not exercise the same leverage on societal order as was the case in industrialized countries. Such a new worldview depends largely on the Asian countries ability and willingness first to build mutual trust and second to lead.Reconciliation between China and Japan is the first step; otherwise the animosity between these two countries will act as a spoiler. China and India need to move closer together. A deeper understanding of common values is imperative. In Europe, Christianity, despite its various editions, served that purpose, but there is no similar philosophy at hand in Asia.Asian history and in particular Chinese history reveals a lack of ambition to lead and offer its model abroad -- the Great Wall radiates Chinese psychology. There seems to be a kind of inhibition when faced with leadership outside one's own cultural sphere that may block any ""globalization"" of Asian values. Obviously another element may be whether other cultures are attracted by Asian values -- of which no signs yet.It is very much up to Asia to step forward. Without much doubt many traditional Asian values -- philosophy and religion -- resonate well with underlying trends emerging around the world questioning the era of economics. So far Asia has bought into the Western model serving as a platform for fast economic growth. Consumerism is visible in many Asian countries. Enormous investment in infrastructure is also on the agenda. This cannot, however, be seen as Asia buying into the Anglo-American world of economics. Building physical infrastructure and capacity for production and consumption is necessary for moving beyond economics to an era of non-economics highlighting other values. Without satisfying basic needs such a jump would not be possible. If Asia does not respond to this challenge we must look at two alternatives.The first one is a divided world where globalization gradually gives way to regionalism with Western values, Asian values and similar values defined by cultures or geography. Samuel Huntington talked about a clash of civilizations, but a model with divergent worldviews is feasible inside a functioning global economy, albeit less strong and less coherent than what we have seen and been led to believe would continue. It would be manageable. What would be missing is global governance but isn't that what we have seen over the last ten years? Maybe we are already there! The second one is falling into the abyss of a new dark age where nationalism, populism, and xenophobia rules the world order in a sinister combination of fanaticism, ignorance, and anti-science. Unlikely? No. This is what happened repeatedly in China, with dynasties collapsing to be followed by precisely such chaos void of values. The Roman Empire was succeeded by more than 600 years of dark ages waiting for the Renaissance to emerge. The frightening observation is that however much it is repulsive to conclude most omens point to the last scenario without many of us realizing it and fewer stepping up to prevent it. ______________Joergen Oerstroem Moeller is a Visiting Senior Research Fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore; Adjunct Professor at Singapore Management University and Copenhagen Business School; and an Honorary Alumnus of the University of Copenhagen.[1] Here summarized after Will Durant, The Story of Philosophy, Chapter IV Spinoza."

It's certainly some kind of moment, and now we get to have it en Español: The Joan Rivers of celebrity policing in Spanish-language television in the United States, host Rodner Figueroa, was swiftly shown the door this week after saying on air that First Lady Michelle Obama resembles the cast of Planet of the Apes. The comment was made during a segment for Univision's El Gordo y la Flaca, where he's been pushing his trademark equal-opportunity comic ruthlessness since 2010, though his work with Univision goes back 17 years. Here are some figures to paint a picture of the reign he enjoyed up until this week: Coming into the homes of 94 million people, Univision is the largest Spanish-language network and the fifth largest in the country. He is royalty in Spanish broadcast journalism.Why should we care? As these things go, he's sure to be back on top sooner rather later. Plenty will have tons to say about whether Figueroa should have been fired to begin with, but that isn't the focus of this piece.On Thursday, Figueroa released an apology letter in Spanish to the First Lady -- published in its entirety by HuffPost-Voces, if you're interested in getting the story directly from the momentarily-fallen royal's mouth. Employing the most formal mode of address in Spanish, he offers an earnest apology to the First Lady but maintains that his ""unpleasant"" and ""out of line"" comment was in response to the work of the imitator that was being discussed in the segment, and not against her. He asserts that he's ""no racist"" and -- with all due respect -- pulls the ""I have X friends"" trope, or in his case, an Afro-Latino father. He tells the First Lady that he voted for her husband twice and mentions that he was the first openly gay anchor on Hispanic TV.His heartfelt apology is indisputable proof that no one is exempt from blind spots, no matter how feminist or inclusive or culturally competent we strive to be most of the time. Let us be reminded from Figueroa's personal and professional nightmare that being a member of any one minority group does not exempt us from making naïve, shortsighted, misguided and straight up unfortunate calls of judgment.We can be romantically involved with, or be children to or parents of people of color, and experience moments of prejudice, and yes, racism. We can have mothers and sisters and wives and daughters -- we can be women -- and fall into sexist patterns of thought and action. Identifying as gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender or queer, does not excuse us from facing the consequences of experiencing such moments.Figueroa's story is all the more baffling to us, and probably himself, because of his journalistic experience, family history and identity as a gay man. He should know better. Period. Incidentally, Patricia Arquette, too, should know why so many of us were left cringing at the audacity of her absurd demand at the Oscars this year that it's time for gay and people of color to help win wage-equality for white women. We hope someone shared with her Rutgers Professor Brittney Cooper's declaration of strike against the ridiculousness of Arquette's logic. Figueroa, Arquette, all of us: We should all try to know more. Do better."

My story has not only been shut down but even completely denied by even some of my closest loved ones. My infertility losses and my childfull motherhood are hardly ever publicly acknowledged. My bright shining light of Ever Upward scares many. And yet, I still speak. And, I will shout until all of us speak more.My heart literally aches when I read vague social media posts of the pain that mothers who have lost post. The mothers who I know are suffering, who have lost, but yet are not telling anyone. My heart aches, but I also get frustrated.It is unrealistic for those of us in the infertility and loss community to expect people to give us what we need in our suffering and healing when we refuse to speak our stories out loud. This does not mean you must write a book or publish the very public blog or even put out the post on your social media walls before you are ready. But you must speak. Because if you stay silent, I can pretty much guarantee it will be difficult to find the support and love you will so need in this lifelong journey of loss and recovery.You can also completely lose yourself to that silence.Our loved ones, and especially the public, will never be educated unless we educate them. Our loved ones, and especially the public, will never have the words we need to hear unless we give them those words. Our loved ones, and especially the public, will never be able to give us the compassion we need to heal unless we use our words and ask for what we want and need.This does require us to be brave and to break the taboo of our shamed silence; to make our loved ones and society uncomfortable, to make them acknowledge and talk about painful things, to see and to understand our losses. But more than that, this requires us to simply live our truths, to be the parents we know we are.  Like my friend Julie, whose daughter Josie was born still. Julie posts Josie's beautiful picture on her social media wall every year for her birthday. Now some may say this is courageous, and it is, but I say it is my friend simply living her truth; being a mother, Josie's mother, always.And the fact that her post may not be acknowledged with likes and shares by even some of her closest loved ones or the fact that my infertility posts or Ever Upward posts are not shared or liked with even a fraction of the shares and likes of your baby post will not shut us up.Because I will swing this sword of silence until the taboos are shattered and we are all seen. I will swing it until we are all sharing our stories. Because this is the only way the conversations will change and the only way we will continue to heal.It is only through our spoken stories that we are all seen and can rise ever upward."

Here are just a few ideas. By the Month: One of the simplest ways to document baby's first year and track his growth is by using stickers, such as Sticky Bellies, showing how hold your baby is. A large birthday poster that can be personalized can round out the year and then be used annually.  Photo: Molly FlanaganBy the Baby: Scrap any preconceived ideas of how your baby's first year will go and document life as it unfolds.  Kirsten Lewis, a photographer who takes a photojournalistic approach to documenting families and instructor of Creative Live's Family Photography: Modern Storytelling, says:Any Mom can agree that one of the most enjoyable parts of having a baby is getting to know them. Try spending time just exchanging glances, smiling and cooing. Have your camera near your face and as your little one begins to stretch, yawn, practice moving their eyebrows or smile a big ""I've got gas"" smile make some pictures. Because you are interacting with your baby while you are using your camera, the photos will be honest moments. Photo: Kirsten LewisBy the Numbers: Mom*Tog and author of the UnManual2 , Drew Bittel used balloons to document her daughter's growth, using one balloon in a photo when she was one month, two balloons for two months and so on. It's fun to see the number of balloons increase each month as the baby gets bigger! Photo: Drew BittelBy the Person: Beryl Ayn Young, creator of online classes for Moms learning to use DSLRs and editing photos recommends capturing baby with important family members during visits and holidays. For a timeless feel, edit in black and white.  Photo: Beryl Ayn YoungBy the Day: Mindi Stavish of Stavish Still Photography suggests taking one photo a day with your phone and posting it on Instagram using the same hashtag every day. This is a fun and easy way to document how much your baby changes during the first year since you always have your phone. Or, go old-school with an instant camera. This is a great way to create a daily record of baby's life in a fun way that is easy to create and display and save. By the Milestone: A baby's first year can be measured in milestones, like baby's first smile and baby's first meal. Sticky Belly stickers can be placed on baby's clothing or anywhere in the frame for an easy way to document all of baby's firsts in an easy to see way! Be sure to capture baby's personality!By the Book: Photos should find a place alongside the notes of milestones and cute moments in baby's life to create a book. Baby's First Year Photo Gallery is a great book that has guided prompts to document baby's first year, such as ""It's in your nature to be"" along with die-cut months photo cards that can be used to photograph baby each month to keep it simple.  Look for a baby book that has guided prompts and combines photos with words for a compete record of baby's first yearUse a jumbo animal, such as Riley Rabbit, for scale  By the Inch: It can be fascinating to look back and see how much baby has grown. Put baby in a 12 month onsie starting at one month old and watch them grow into it. Give your baby some personality with a patterned onsie from Kapital K with stars or another pattern. Or, place baby on a stroller-sized blanket with stripes, such as the Chevron stripes blanket from Mamas & Papas so it's easy to watch baby inch towards the bottom of the blanket stripe by stripe. Or, use a jumbo stuffed animal, such as Manhattan Toy's Riley the Rabbit, for scale.  Photo: Colette Smith. Don't be afraid to combine ideas, such as a 12 month onsie, jumbo stuffed animal, and monthly stickers such as those from Sticky BelliesAsk nothing of them -- 30 Day Challenge  One of the biggest struggles people seem to have with photographing their kids isn't the light or the gear, it is their kids running from the camera. Who can blame them? We are constantly in their face saying, Look at me! Look here! Smile! Say cheese!If you have a child that doesn't like the camera, then let's retrain them. For the next 30 days, you can not ask them to look at the camera, pose or do anything. If you are going to take a photo of them and they ask you to put the camera away, then you must listen. Teach your children they have a voice and you will listen to it.By Themselves: Courtney Slazinik from Click it up A Notch recommends not asking your child to look at the camera, pose or do anything. ""If they are playing with a toy, then go ahead and take the photo but don't bother them. Some of my favorite images are those of my children focused on what they are doing they don't notice I'm there."" Go for a onise that has personality for baby to grow into like this one for your star from Kapital KBy you!: Many Moms will find it worth the investment to hire a professional photographer to capture what life was like during a day of baby's first year. If a photographer isn't possible, investing in a couple of pieces of equipment will make it possible for Mom to get in the photo. A lightweight tripod such as Manfrotto's Befree is easy to keep anywhere around the house or on the go and is simple to set-up. Use it with the inexpensive Hot Shoe Bubble level to make sure your camera stays straight both on the tripod and for times you may want to rest your camera on a table or even the floor for a shot with baby!  Photo: Stavish Stills Photography Find a way to get in the photo with your baby weather you hire a photographer or use a tripodBy the Detail: Babies grow so fast. Be sure to capture the small details that change quickly like his hands in fists, wrinkly feet, tiny eyelashes and the chubby rolls on his thighs. Molly Flanagan, instructor of Visual Storytelling for the Define School, reminds new parents that the detail of life with a baby are also important because ""[t]he dropped sippy cup, the finger print smeared glass door, and the mountain of unfolded laundry are each a part of your story. If you edit your life to make prettier pictures, you are documenting a false reality."" Capture the little details of your baby! Use a blanket with stripes, such as the Chevron pattern from Mamas & Papas to clearly show how your baby is growing stripe-by-stripe. Get creative with your perspective.  There are small steps you can take to help make your photos of baby really stand out. Many photographers would agree that light is the most important component of a great photo (aside for your adorable child of course!) Know where to find good light in your house is essential. A simple tool like a reflector will also be invaluable for being able to take well-lit photos in many types of situations, including with a window or the sun behind your baby. Look for a reflector that is large enough to reflect light on a large area and one that has flat sides that can lean against furniture or a tree. The Lasolite 6' x4' Panelist Collapsible Reflector is a good choice for a sturdy reflector that folds up small enough to be stored wherever you will use it most.  Life with a baby can be crazy and messy - don't be afraid of showing that in your photos of baby's first year! Photo: Courtney Slazinik  Also, be sure to have your camera with you wherever you go. The best way to capture your first year with a baby is to always have your camera ready to capture the firsts, the tears, sneezes, smiles and smudges is to have your camera ready to go when the right moment strikes. The JuJeBe Be Prepared has ample room for a DSLR plus some padding and plenty of pockets to keep your gear away from wipes and sippy cups.

Two recent nonfiction books about lesbians in Illinois tell two very different stories. One is a beautiful, hardbound book from the once-feminist publisher Seal Press (now part of a New York-based corporate publishing conglomerate). The other, published by the independent Chicago-based enterprise, Prairie Avenue Productions, is more modest -- a paperback original, though available in an edition with color photos. One book tells a vibrant, overlooked story about a lesbian activist whose work shapes our world today; the other offers a closet parable and demonstrates how some people today take advantage of the labor and lives of those in the past who worked for LGBT equality. Under This Beautiful Dome: A Senator, A Journalist, and the Politics of Gay Love in America by Terry Mutchler (Seal Press, 2014) is the story of Mutchler's relationship with a state senator, Penny Severns. In 1993, Severns was a rising star in the state democratic party (the book belabors the parallel between Severns and another young party member, Barack Obama). She met Mutchler, who was working as a journalist covering the Illinois state house. The two fell in love, eventually living together and sharing a life that they understood to be committed and ""married."" While they had this mutual understanding, they did not share the nature of their relationship with their families or anyone else. They were closeted. To the public, Mutchler was simply a devoted friend and press agent for Severns.You can imagine how this ends: Severns is diagnosed with cancer. Treatment, struggle, treatment, struggle, death. Severns's family, not knowing the relationship, quickly acts to exclude Mutchler from Severns's estate and legacy. It is a sad story. I do not want to minimize the pain and anguish the situation caused Mutchler, but remember this was the mid-1990s. These two women had other options. They could have come out; many courageous gay and lesbian people came out, refusing to live their lives in the closet. At some points in Under This Beautiful Dome, it seemed like this story was happening in the 1950s or maybe the 1980s. The fact that it was happening in the 1990s makes the book more of a farce than a tragedy. Mutchler's talent as a journalist makes Under This Beautiful Dome a good yarn, but anyone with a political consciousness recognizes that both of these women made choices that are fundamental harmful to themselves--and to the broader LGBT community.The fact that Severns and Mutchler hurt themselves is one thing. What galls me about this book is that after Mutchler choses to be closeted and not speak out, she writes this book in 2014 and wants to position herself as a part of the story of the achievement of marriage equality in the state of Illinois. This claim is offensive.Particularly when Under This Beautiful Dome is considered in tandem with the wonderful biography of Vernita Gray by Tracy Baim and Owen Keehnen. This delightful book, part biography, part oral history, part tribute volume to Gray, provides a rich history of the Chicago-based activist. Subtitled From Woodstork to the White House, Vernita Gray covers Gray's early years (she was born in Chicago in 1948), her engagement in the civil rights movement, coming out as a lesbian in the 1970s (with rich anecdotes about Chicago lesbian-feminist institutions), and her activism during the last four decades of her life. Gray lived a life worth emulating. She gave to the community in numerous ways. Her death, also from cancer, affected the Chicago community tremendously. Baim and Keehnen provide an entertaining and highly readable account of Gray's life. In addition to that, this book is a service to the community in at least two ways. First, it is a way of honoring and respecting the work of an out, African-American lesbians--and making that work more visible. Second, Gray's life provides an important window into queer history, both in Chicago and in the United States during this period.Sadly, these two books, both with life stories about lesbians in Illinois are not dueling in the marketplace. Mutchler's unapologetic story of her own life seeks to capitalize in the advances of gay and lesbian people over the past twenty years; advances to which she did not contribute. Yet, because it is published by a New York-based publishing house, packaged in an attractive way, it gains the attention of readers--and even of the Lambda Literary Foundation which named it one of the finalists for Lesbian Memoir/Biography. Maybe that is appropriate if lesbian now means women who sit back while other women do difficult activist work and then step up when it is easy to take credit for some of it.Baim and Keehnen's book, on the other hand, receives less attention. Vernita Gray is the more interesting book, however. It tells the story of a woman with extraordinary integrity, a woman who lived a life that both made a difference to those around her and to the LGBT community in Chicago and nation-wide. Through Prairie Avenue Productions, Baim is increasingly telling these important and overlooked stories. She is a woman worthy of our collective admiration--and support.Current readers should be aware of what stories are being told and packaged by New York publishing houses and engage in healthy skepticism. Looking beyond the glossies, readers can find gems like Vernita Gray. Future historians, looking for breadcrumbs to understand what was life like for lesbian and gay people in the Midwest during the 1990s, should read Vernita Gray carefully and give Under This Beautiful Dome the little regard it deserves."

They probably traveled across Europe with false passports and had the help of foreign recruiters.The mother, originally from Russia's restive southern province of Chechnya, and her two Dutch children, aged 7 and 8, had been living in the southern town of Maastricht, but have not been seen since October 29 last year.The head of the children's Islamic school alerted the father that the mother had printed plane tickets for herself and the children for flights to Greece. They are now believed to be in Raqqa, an Islamic State stronghold in northeastern Syria.Prosecutors suspect that the woman received help from others to travel because she managed to dodge an international arrest warrant and they are investigating the case.Dozens of families with children have left the Netherlands over the past two years to join Islamic State, which has seized swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq but this is the first known case of one parent leaving without the other's consent.About a dozen minors have also left the Netherlands on their own to join Islamic State, which has established a self-proclaimed Islamic caliphate that follows a puritanical form of Islam in the territory it controls.The Dutch Justice Ministry said a total of 180 Dutch jihadis are known to have left the Netherlands for Syria. Around 35 returned and 21 were killed in the civil war, which has left more than 200,000 dead and sent millions more fleeing. (Reporting By Anthony Deutsch; Editing by Gareth Jones)"

""First-graders doodle all over the exams.""In opening statements, prosecutor Fani Willis told the court there had been almost 257 million ""wrong-to-right erasures"" in 2009. An 800-page state investigation in 2011 found that 38 principals and 140 teachers in the Atlanta school district were involved in cheating on the 2009 standardized tests.Trial testimony revealed how ""a testing fixation had infected entire schools,"" said Bob Schaeffer, education director for FairTest, a nonprofit group that focuses on limiting the use and ending the misuse of standardized tests.In the past five years, there have been confirmed cases of test cheating in 43 states and the District of Columbia, Schaeffer said.While it is clear that cheating took place in the Atlanta schools, Schaeffer said it was uncertain whether the jury would convict the educators of participating in a criminal conspiracy, which could result in 20-year-prison sentences.

So President Barack Obama is aiming to clamp down on the private companies that service federal student debt with a presidential memorandum he signed Tuesday. (AP Photo/David Goldman)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8edac2100004202c96c98.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- More than 16 million Americans gained health coverage because of the Affordable Care Act, mainly via the law's health insurance exchange and Medicaid expansion, according to an analysis published Monday by the Department of Health and Human Services.The government estimate is consistent with numerous surveys taken over the past two years. The Health and Human Services report issued Monday is based in part on findings from the polling company Gallup, which found the uninsured rate has fallen from 20.3 percent in October 2013, when Obamacare sign-ups began, to 12.3 percent during the first quarter of this year.The latest figures stand as more evidence that Obamacare is achieving one of its core goals of reducing the number of uninsured Americans, even as the Affordable Care Act remains embattled in Congress and faces an uncertain future at the Supreme Court.“Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act almost five years ago, about 16.4 million uninsured people have gained health coverage -- the largest reduction in the uninsured in four decades,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said in a written statement accompanying a new report from the department.These gains in the national uninsured rate could be reversed. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments this month in a lawsuit, King v. Burwell, that alleges the Affordable Care Act's tax credit subsidies are only available in 13 states and the District of Columbia, which operate their own health insurance exchange marketplaces. The federal government set up the exchanges in 34 states, and millions of residents would lose their subsidies if the high court rules for the plaintiffs. The Rand Corp. estimates this would result in 9.6 million people becoming uninsured as their health insurance becomes too expensive and the markets in those states destabilize.According to the Health and Human Services report, 14.1 million people gained health coverage by securing private insurance or signing up for Medicaid through an exchange. An additional 2.3 million young adults got coverage under an Affordable Care Act provision allowing those under 26 years old to remain on their parents' insurance policies.The second open enrollment period for the health insurance exchanges officially closed in February, and federal officials reported last week that sign-ups for private coverage had reached nearly 12 million people. Enrollment reopened Sunday in states with federally run exchanges for people who learn when they file their taxes that they owe a penalty for not having coverage last year. Most other states are also allowing people in these circumstances to access their exchanges. In addition to the millions who obtained private health insurance, almost 11 million more people are receiving coverage from Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program compared to October 2013, when the first Obamacare sign-up period began. Twenty-eight states and the District of Columbia adopted the Affordable Care Act's more generous eligibility standards for Medicaid, while the remainder have refused to do so.The federal government will spend $1.2 trillion over the coming decade expanding health coverage, the Congressional Budget Office projected this month. That's down 11 percent from a budget estimate issued in January, and even lower than earlier CBO predictions. Source: Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation"
