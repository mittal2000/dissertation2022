Navarro recognized Kohler from a HuffPost story and snapped photos of him. He said in a message through Facebook that Kohler acknowledged his identity but said, ""I do not want to be found.""HuffPost provided copies of the photos, as well as Navarro's contact information, to the LAPD on Thursday. The department then launched an investigation into the tip thereafter.Kohler, a 27-year-old visual effects producer who has worked on several films, including ""The Avengers,"" ""San Andreas"" and ""X-Men,"" had been missing since Nov. 24.According to his family, he was working at Vitality VFX in Gardena, California, when he left work that afternoon to run errands.Shortly thereafter, Kohler's vehicle was captured on surveillance video at a nearby shopping center, but authorities have been unable to determine who was actually behind the wheel. The vehicle's destination remained a mystery until Friday.“That’s basically all we knew was the photos,"" said LAPD Detective K. Thomas, when asked if the tip had helped to locate Kohler. ""The family, they observed them and said, ‘Yes, that is him’ and there is some other information we have to say that he is in fact in Mexico, but the pictures definitely helped. He has been identified down there. I have spoken with individuals who have met him face-to-face and we have some additional information to substantiate that he is in Mexico.”No further details are currently available on Kohler's safe recovery.This is a developing story and will be updated.Also on HuffPost:"

4,MEDIA,"The Grim, Sadly Busy Existence Of A Mass Shooting TV Pundit",Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mass-shooting-tv-pundit_us_5660b493e4b08e945feeb6fa,Retired FBI agent Clint Van Zandt is NBC's go-to analyst for these tragically recurring events.,2015-12-04,"“There’s been so many mass shootings that I’ve had to talk about this year, I can’t remember them,” Clint Van Zandt told The Huffington Post.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5660b503210000c9005ac40d.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Wednesday afternoon, MSNBC asked Clint Van Zandt to jump on live television and do what he’s been doing with alarming frequency in recent months -- analyze a mass shooting in America. He quickly put on a coat and tie and sat in front of the high-definition camera in his home office in Fredericksburg, Virginia, which the network installed so he could quickly address chaotic scenes like the one unfolding in San Bernardino, California. At that point, no one knew much of anything about the shooting, from the number of suspects or fatalities to whether the violence had even stopped. Over jarring images of a makeshift triage center, Van Zandt began speaking broadly about the country's spate of mass shootings, which he said were “coming now multiple times in a week.” All of which makes Van Zandt a busy man. Five days earlier, in fact, he had appeared on MSNBC during an active shooter situation at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, Colorado. In October, he joined MSNBC’s coverage of the Umpqua Community College shooting in Roseburg, Oregon. He provided analysis the morning after the June church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, speaking to ""Today"" co-host Matt Lauer as the killer remained at large.“There’s been so many mass shootings that I’ve had to talk about this year, I can’t remember them,” Van Zandt told The Huffington Post. “You give me a date and a time and I’ll say, 'Gee, I don’t remember.' Well, two, three, four, five, 10 years ago, I would’ve remembered. But today, the number is just too great.”It's an odd, dark niche he occupies in the news universe. When TV networks shift into breaking coverage of a mass shooting, there’s often little actual news to report. It’s why producers turn to seasoned TV analysts like Van Zandt, a former FBI profiler and chief hostage negotiator who now runs a threat assessment company. He can fill airtime when details are scarce and provide informed analysis as they emerge. At the same time, he'd rather not have to go on TV at all. His ubiquitous presence of late on NBC and MSNBC is a grim reminder of the mass shooting epidemic in America, where more than 1,044 of such events have occurred since a gunman killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December 2012.Before becoming a talking head, Van Zandt spent 25 years issuing “no comments” to the media. His job was to work investigations, not assess them in real time. He recalled seeing TV commentators back then with “no idea what we’re involved in.” But shortly after retiring from the FBI in 1995, he became the guy on TV discussing someone else's investigation. In December of that year, a Chicago lawyer hired Van Zandt to compare letters that one of her clients had received to the “Unabomber” manifesto that had been published weeks earlier in The Washington Post. The client turned out to be David Kaczynski, who rightly suspected that his brother Ted was the bomber evading law enforcement over 18 years. When authorities captured Kaczynski in April 1996, the media needed someone on air to talk about it. Van Zandt fit the bill, given his knowledge of the case, his newly gained freedom to speak publicly, and his proximity to Washington D.C. (which wouldn't be a factor now, given his office studio setup and the availability of Skype). In June 1996, The New Yorker profiled Van Zandt and his work in the FBI’s Behavioral Science Unit emphasizing the importance of negotiations, a strategy that gained more traction after the deadly raids in Ruby Ridge, Idaho, and Waco, Texas. An unlikely media star was born. “Investigators investigate and television experts speculate,” Van Zandt said Thursday by phone, in between MSNBC and CNBC hits on the still-emerging profiles of the San Bernardino shooters. Van Zandt said that he spent too many years as an investigator “to engage in a whole lot of speculation,” but he draws on that past experience when analyzing current events. “If something looks like a duck and walks like a duck, I can usually make that call of what kind of an animal it is,” he said.TV producers crave certainty, even in the most uncertain situations. Successful TV pundits don't have to be the best experts available, but they are often skilled at wrapping up a segment with a pithy, declarative statement or an unequivocal prediction rather than getting into mushy nuance. “We see shootings anywhere, from schools to churches to, obviously, what we saw yesterday,” Van Zandt said on Thursday of the attack at the Inland Regional Center that left 14 dead and 21 wounded. “So it’s really starting to run the gamut. And each time, of course, the question is, ‘Well, you’re a profiler, explain the unexplainable. Tell us in 10 words or less, because we only have 10 seconds. Explain to us this abhorrent behavior that none of us can really understand, but we want you to put it in perspective so we can understand it.’”Van Zandt is aware of TV outlets' expectations in the heat of breaking news, but said he tries to be cautious. His goal, he said, is ""to try to not give an answer before the question is even posed, and yet give something.""“I realize the position of Americans. I’m in the same position. We want to know,” he continued. “So it’s trying to provide kind of a framework of information, knowledge and experience that would help people to understand what’s going on, try to reassure the people that the investigators -- in this case, the FBI, the local police -- are doing a good job. The help that they always need from the public is someone providing information without contaminating that investigation.”During last week’s Planned Parenthood standoff, Van Zandt said someone mentioned on TV that law enforcement could tap into the clinic’s camera system to view what was happening inside. “That’s crazy to give up information like that,” he said. Van Zandt said he speaks on camera as if the perpetrator is watching live with “a gun to somebody’s head"" -- a situation he's familiar with from his past life as a hostage negotiator. ""Should they hear my voice, they’re not going to hear something that’s going to provoke them, but hopefully they’re going to hear me say something that will suggest safety is on the other side,” he said.While Van Zandt said he tries not to wade into the inevitable cultural or political debates surrounding mass shootings, it's perhaps inevitable that even fairly benign analysis could be interpreted by some as taking a position on hot-button issues like gun control or terrorism. He's received plenty of hate mail over the years and deleted his Twitter account as a result of negative feedback.Though viewers may be seeking an outright declaration that an event does or doesn't qualify as ""terrorism,"" Van Zandt said he's reluctant to make that call before investigators. “I can only say there are a significant number of parallels to what we’ve seen and organized terrorist attacks in the past,” he said.He's seen a lot of violence in 45 years as an FBI agent and TV analyst, not to mention earlier, during his tour in Vietnam. But sadly, he doesn't believe he's seen everything. “I hate to say there’s nothing new under the Sun, but I also know that any time I think I’ve seen the worst I’m going to see of human behavior, somebody steps up and tops that,"" he said. Van Zandt said members of law enforcement and the media “have to put your emotions in your back pocket"" in order to survey such bloody episodes, yet he recalled one time he couldn't. In 2007, NBC sent him to the campus of Virginia Tech after the killing of 32 people. While immersed in the tragedy, working a 12 to 14-hour day, Van Zandt recalled seeing three students run towards each other, appearing to recognize for the first time that their friends had survived the rampage. “I was trying to convey that on television one night, what I had seen, and the emotion in it, and what it represented,” he said. “I think I was crying on television.""Also on HuffPost:"
5,BLACK VOICES,What Happened When One High School Started An Open Conversation About Race,Rebecca Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/maplewood-high-school-race-relations-club_us_5660ad41e4b072e9d1c55755,"Creating a supportive environment for students to share their experiences “makes perfect sense for our time and place in history.""",2015-12-04,The Student Group On Race Relations during the 2014 - 2015 school year.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5661b3811b0000520129f394.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There has been no shortage of topics to discuss since Missouri's Maplewood Richmond Heights High School principal Kevin Grawer started a Student Group on Race Relations (SGORR) last year. First there was the killing of Michael Brown, a local black teen whose death took place not far away from the high school's district. Then this year, just a few hours away, protests broke out at the University of Missouri after a series of racially charged incidents. Teenage students who partake in SGORR --- a voluntary club -- unpack it all through discussions at their weekly meetings.Club discussions ""make me think twice about how I view different things or situations that are happening, in terms of who does this affect, and how is this going to affect the rest of us?"" ninth-grader Tamar Crump said.Tamar is part of a small but dedicated group of students who regularly attend SGORR meetings, which are typically student-led. At Maplewood Richmond Heights school, which has a diverse student population -- about half white, 40 percent black and 10 percent Asian and Latino -- the club allows students to dissect issues that are impacting people in the world around them, as well as in their own classrooms. Grawer started the club last year, after visiting Shaker Heights High School in Cleveland, Ohio, and watching a similar club in action. The killing of Michael Brown, which set off a wave of local protests and civil unrest, increased the urgency to start a constructive initiative in Maplewood. Grawer believes the club is having a positive impact on school culture, and he has evidence to boot. For years Grawer has distributed a school culture survey to students, and asked them if they see their school as respecting individual diversity. This year, the number of students who answered ""yes"" jumped. ""The numbers were ridiculously high -- it was something like 95 percent,"" Grawer said. ""And for any question you ask high schoolers, to get 95 percent is really rare. To get that kind of response, I think, was a reflection of our group and the fact that the kids know it's there. It's always an option for them.""The topics discussed in SGORR have ranged from this Cheerios ad featuring a mixed race family, to the protests at Mizzou, to the various stereotypes that persist about different racial groups, to the school-to-prison pipeline. For tenth-grader Lilyan Whitfield, the club has helped her unpack her identity as a biracial student. ""I am on the border of white and black ... I felt like if I talked about [my identity] from one point of view, then I would be scolded,"" Lilyan said. ""I wasn't really comfortable about it.""I used to just identify as black because that’s the race that most people at my old school used to be and it wasn’t as accepting,"" she continued. ""Now being at Maplewood I feel like I can open up about being biracial and people won't judge me for it.""Research supports the idea that educators should foster and have their own tough conversations about race. A January paper from the Discipline Disparities Research to Practice Collaborative looked at the discipline gap, where black kids are punished more harshly than white kids for the same behavior, and encouraged teachers to examine and discuss their own potential racial biases in order to help eliminate this disparity. ""For schools to begin to look at their own data [on who they suspend] is really important,"" Russell Skiba, professor in the school psychology program at Indiana University, told HuffPost at the time.“If we just present that data cold, it's very difficult for folks to have those conversations. Folks will say, 'When I see these disparities, I feel like I'm being called a racist.' That's not the point at all. The point is to say, what is creating these issues?""The second step is having some general conversations,"" he added. ""Who is disadvantaged? Where did these stereotypes come from? ... Then we can talk about specific instances like, 'This happened when I was dealing with Josh in my classroom.'""For Grawer, the idea to start a forum where students can discuss race just seemed like ""probably an obvious thing to do.""""It doesn’t seem like we’re doing anything groundbreaking whatsoever,"" Grawer said. ""It makes perfect sense for our time and place in history."" "

In the last six months alone, nine banks have announced coal-financing restrictions.They have a long way to go: Between 2009 and 2014, the world's largest banks provided $257 billion in financing to the coal industry, newly compiled data show. Look closely at the new coal policies, and you'll see the banks aren't rushing to change that. ""The biggest banks in the U.S. and Europe are also the world's biggest coal banks,"" the authors of the new report write. Those institutions are still on course to do billions more in business with the coal industry because their new policies are narrowly focused on especially noxious or already moribund sectors of the coal industry in the developed world, while failing to address the continued expansion of coal mining and coal-fired power plants in the developing world. For instance, Barclays, Bank of America, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo have each distanced themselves from or cut direct ties to mountaintop removal mining, a particularly destructive and visually shocking form of coal mining. But mountaintop removal is hardly the only way to extract coal in the U.S. or abroad. Other techniques have destroyed entire islands in Southeast Asia, but they aren't directly addressed by the banks' policies.Another example comes from Morgan Stanley, which this week said it would stop financing new coal-fired power plants in the developed world. That should be easy: Due to regulation and activism, the construction of new coal-fired power plants in the U.S. and the rest of the developed world has slowed to a crawl.Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and others have also pledged to reduce their lending to the coal industry overall. But the U.S. coal industry has been an economic disaster for more than a year -- companies bet badly on huge new demand from China, and high-profile bankruptcies and soaring lending costs have followed. Reducing funding for an industry in financial decline is what bankers do, purely from a balance sheet perspective. And as more and more U.S. coal companies go out of business, there are simply fewer firms to lend money to.In the developing world, where the coal industry is still growing, banks continue to finance that expansion. They also continue to finance utilities in the developed world that have huge fleets of already operating coal-fired power plants, so long as the additional money isn't ""for a new coal-fired power plant.""This is not surprising: Big banks finance the global economy, and the global economy burns a lots of coal.The huge reduction in coal-fired power plants in the U.S., however, shows a way to change that brutal logic. Banks have chosen to pull back where the coal industry is acting egregiously or failing economically. That means that the more the divestment movement, which has attracted over 500 institutional investors, can make coal morally objectionable and the more alternative sources of power can demonstrate their viability, the more likely it is that the financiers will walk away.In the end, banks' relationship to coal reverses the famous adage in ""Field of Dreams"": If you don't build it, they won't come with financing."

And, with heavyweights like the Rockets, Clippers and Thunder struggling, perhaps it shouldn't come as a surprise that old faithful San Antonio finds itself right back in the contenders mix despite coming off a disappointing first-round postseason exit.The 15-4 Spurs sit comfortably behind the Warriors for the two seed and yet, it's hardly been perfect. Highly touted free agent acquisition LaMarcus Aldridge has struggled to find a scoring rhythm while 33-year-old Tony Parker, a surefire Hall of Fame point guard, has looked his age for the first time during his brilliant 15-year career. But what has always made the Spurs special is the sum of its parts -- and an unrelenting dedication to team basketball on both ends of the court.Such a strategy is not unlike the Warriors' magical title run last year either. While we all focused on their splendid offensive prowess -- and rightfully so -- having the NBA's top ranked defense was ultimately the linchpin to a championship. Get stops when it matters most and a), you will close out games and b), you will survive cold shooting nights. The same can be said about San Antonio's five championships during the Gregg Popovich-Tim Duncan era that dates back to 1997. Great offense is a bonus, but great defense is a necessity, especially in dethroning the Warriors, who just set the NBA record for the most points scored through 20 games. In fact, except for the 2014 title team (which ranked eighth), not one of the other four Spurs championship teams ranked below the top five in field goal percentage allowed.The secret to the 2015 Spurs has been -- surprise -- tremendous individual and team defense once again. And it's basic stuff too: help the helper, don't allow skip passes to beat you and maybe most importantly, rotate properly on both the first and second passes out of the post double. With a hounding perimeter defender in the league's reigning Defensive Player of the Year, Kawhi Leonard, the team's go-scorer at 21.7 points per game a wing who can check multiple spots -- think Draymond Green but better -- opponent possessions consistently get broken down. Of the top 11 players in defensive rating this season, Leonard is the only non-center, according to Sports Illustrated.

Just watch songbirds woo each other.An international team of researchers recently captured incredible slow-motion footage of the blue-capped cordon bleu's courtship behavior. The clip above shows two birds bobbing and singing -- which scientists have long known they do -- and reveals a dance that hasn't been seen before, National Geographic reported.""We thought that we found a secret, as we had been puzzled by the fact that only cordon-blues (but not other Estrildid finches) made conspicuous sounds when hopping,"" said Dr. Masayo Soma, a co-author of the research published last month in Scientific Reports and an associate professor at Hokkaido University in Japan.Soma and her colleagues used a high-speed camera to analyze the courtship displays of 16 blue-capped cordon bleu songbirds. They discovered that both male and female birds appear to ""tap dance,"" and that their dancing increases in speed when a bird they're trying to mate with is perched nearby. The motions are so fast that they can't be seen by the naked human eye.The researchers concluded that the tap dancing may add attractive sounds to the birds' courtship displays, or possibly send secret signals to another bird.""Usually in songbirds, complex acoustic features were preferred as sexual signals. So, cordon-blues may add sounds using their feet,"" Soma said. ""Another idea is that signals that can be conveyed by multiple modalities are efficient. Tap dancing can serve as auditory, visual or tactile signal.""The researchers noted that more studies are needed to better understand how the singing, bobbing and dancing behaviors are all coordinated.""We still do not know why only cordon bleus show tap dancing and other related birds do not perform it,"" Soma said. ""It is even more surprising that both males and females possess the same behavioral features, given that generally males are more ornamented and show more exaggerated sexual displays.""Dr. Will Allen, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Hull in England who was not involved in the research, told BBC News the newly discovered tap dancing is a ""very cool behavior"" but that he was keen to see it explored in more detail.""We already know that several non-passerine birds perform similar elaborate, multimodal duets and that many passerines duet in song,"" he said.""What's new here is that there's a passerine species -- a songbird -- that is duetting in both song and dance,"" he added. ""This study is an important first step, but we don't know whether the receiver prefers mates that display these dancing movements, or even that the receiver is sensitive to them. There are some suggestions here that they might, but without an experimental-type design, we can't work that out.""Also on HuffPost:"
13,POLITICS,House To Vote To Increase Requirements For Foreign Visitors,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-republicans-visa-waiver-program_us_56605cf5e4b072e9d1c4e494,It’s a response to the Paris terrorist attacks that the White House might actually approve.,2015-12-03,House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said he believes the White House will support a new bill to restrict part of the visa waiver program.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56605f9f1b00003d0129f173.jpeg?cache=1ed7wdJLyd&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The House will vote next week on a bill to stiffen requirements for some foreign visitors to the U.S., an effort that Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Thursday should receive heavy bipartisan support.The bill targets the visa waiver program, which allows citizens of 38 countries to visit the U.S. for up to 90 days without applying for a tourist visa -- a process that allows for some screening, but not as much as other foreigners receive. About 20 million visitors per year enter the U.S. through the program, according to the White House.""That is obviously a huge vulnerability,"" said Rep. Candice Miller (R-Mich.), who helped author the bill. Miller, McCarthy and several other committee chairmen announced the bill at a press conference.The vote will come on the heels of last month's terrorist attacks in Paris, as the alleged ringleader and most of the attackers were citizens of western countries that are part of the visa waiver program.Under the bill, dual nationals from Syria, Iraq, Sudan and Iran -- and anyone who has traveled to those countries since March 1, 2011 -- would be excluded from the visa waiver program, but could still apply for a visa to visit the U.S.The bill would also put additional requirements on countries using the visa waiver program. They would be required to share counterterrorism information with the U.S. and report lost and stolen passports to Interpol. McCarthy said the bill would also require those participating in the visa waiver program to use e-passports, which would allow U.S. authorities to collect more biometric data and information on where the travel documents had been used previously. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) indicated in a separate press conference that Democrats will support the bill. She said Republicans and Democrats agreed to its terms on Wednesday evening. ""I think it's a good bill and strikes a balance,"" she said.The House bill also has support from the U.S. Travel Association, which represents the travel industry. Jonathan Grella, the organization's executive vice president of public affairs, said they have concerns with some aspects of the Feinstein-Flake bill, but that they think the House bill was a ""thoughtful, balanced approach.""""Without security there can be no travel, and travelers need to have the confidence to fly for our industry to thrive,"" he said told The Huffington Post. ""Strengthening the program is not considered a loss so long as we don't do things that undermine the program.""White House press secretary Josh Earnest said at a press briefing later Thursday that the bill ""would make some positive reforms"" to the visa waiver program and that they are ""encouraged"" about its bipartisan support.""This has been the subject of ongoing conversation between administration officials and leaders on Capitol Hill and we're pleased to see that those talks ... have yielded a piece of legislation that would actually make the country safer,"" he said.The White House opposed the House's last effort to respond to the Paris terrorist attacks, a bill that would make it harder for the government to approve Syrian and Iraqi refugees. That bill passed with a veto-proof majority and support from 47 Democratic votes and a veto-proof majority. Since the Paris attacks the White House and many Democrats have argued that the visa waiver program leaves the U.S. more vulnerable to a terrorist attack than accepting Syrian refugees.The Obama administration announced plans on Monday to strengthen the screening system, including by tracking more information about whether would-be visa waiver program travelers had previously visited countries that have a terrorist presence.Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) also introduced a visa waiver program bill earlier this week. It too would require visa waiver participants to have e-passports, and would block recent visitors to Syria and Iraq from participating in the program. House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Texas) said that the bill proposed Thursday would get a vote next Tuesday, but leaders did not clarify whether it would be added to other legislation. McCarthy did not rule out inserting the bill in a spending measure that needs to pass by Dec. 11, which could also include provisions on Syrian refugees. McCarthy said he was not concerned about the potential economic impact of the visa waiver program bill, though it could make it harder for some tourists to visit the U.S. He said he wants to make sure visitors can still come in to ""enjoy the freedoms, to see the attractions that we have"" but also ""make sure terrorists do not come to the United States."" ""I think this bill is the first step in the right direction,"" he continued.Update: This post has been updated to include comment from the White House and the U.S. Travel Association."

In his speech Thursday, he pointed out a number of specific legislative actions that have strong public support.“We need to significantly expand and improve background checks,” Sanders said. “Who is arguing that people who should not have guns because of a criminal background, because of mental problems, should ... be able to purchase guns? Very few Americans disagree with that.”Sanders also spoke in favor of banning assault weapons, declaring gun trafficking a federal crime and cracking down on proxies who purchase guns on behalf of those who can’t legally acquire them.“And very significantly,” he added, “we need to greatly expand and improve our mental health capabilities. These people need treatment when they need treatment, regardless of their income, regardless of their insurance status.”On the issue of mental health, Sanders finds himself in agreement with some House Republicans. In response to the San Bernardino shooting, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) also called for greater access to mental health services, pointing to bipartisan legislation that’s been proposed to address the issue.Also on HuffPost:"

Very few Americans disagree with that.”Sanders also spoke in favor of banning assault weapons, declaring gun trafficking a federal crime and cracking down on proxies who purchase guns on behalf of those who can’t legally acquire them.“And very significantly,” he added, “we need to greatly expand and improve our mental health capabilities. These people need treatment when they need treatment, regardless of their income, regardless of their insurance status.”On the issue of mental health, Sanders finds himself in agreement with some House Republicans. In response to the San Bernardino shooting, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) also called for greater access to mental health services, pointing to bipartisan legislation that’s been proposed to address the issue.Also on HuffPost:"
17,POLITICS,The Truth About Paul Ryan's 'First Big Test',Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-first-big-test_us_565fe7a2e4b072e9d1c4c9bf,"This time, the cliché might be accurate. Or not.",2015-12-03,Raul Labrador believes the No. 1 priority is to address the issue of Syrian refugees coming to the U.S.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As a Dec. 11 government funding deadline draws near, Republicans and Democrats are watching closely to see how Speaker Paul Ryan handles what is billed as his first big test: the omnibus spending bill.At this point, it's almost a media cliché to call the next trial on Ryan's docket his first real challenge, according to Brendan Buck, his chief communications adviser.""It’s well understood the media will call every issue the first test until we fail at one,"" Buck told The Huffington Post.Except this time, the ""first test"" moniker might actually be true. Sort of, at least.Ryan insists the roughly $1 trillion spending bill is in the hands of the Appropriations Committee. When a senior Democratic aide familiar with the budget talks said on Wednesday that Democrats had rejected the first omnibus offer from Republicans, Ryan's office was quick to push back against the narrative that it was the Wisconsin Republican and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) who had written the legislation.""The proposal was an Appropriations Committee offer, constructed by the Appropriations Committee,"" AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Ryan, told HuffPost. She said that Ryan is ""deferring"" to Appropriations chairman Harold Rogers (R-Ky.).Regardless of whether it's Ryan or Rogers writing the bill -- or a team of Appropriations lawmakers and staff from both sides and both chambers -- conservatives are, by and large, using the omnibus to get a sense of Ryan's negotiating style. The problem is Ryan doesn't have much of a hand to negotiate with.Asked whether House Freedom Caucus members were actually open to supporting the omnibus, Raul Labrador (R-Idaho) told HuffPost that if there are ""real victories"" on policy, then conservatives would support the bill.""The question is whether the speaker is going to fight for real victories or not,"" Labrador said.He added that Ryan should rely on Republicans, not Democrats, to pass the bill.The difficulty there is that many Republicans are already averse to a trillion-dollar appropriations bill that raises spending caps by $50 billion next year. In recent congressional history, these massive year-end appropriations bills have struggled to find even a majority of Republicans, let alone 218 GOP votes to get the bill through the House, or the 60 votes required in the Senate.Democrats are going to have to be part of the omnibus deal by virtue of the fact that there are only 54 Republicans in the Senate -- and a Democrat in the White House who could always, you know, veto the bill.But for Labrador, as for many other conservatives, if Democrats are already winning on the spending, then Republicans should be winning on the policy.""If they got something they wanted, then conservatives should get something they want,"" Labrador told HuffPost Monday night as he left a House Freedom Caucus meeting. ""And then we can talk about real compromise. Or we can talk about fake compromise.""The No. 1 priority, Labrador said at a panel discussion on Wednesday, is to address the issue of Syrian refugees. He said conservatives want, ""at a minimum,"" the language the House passed two weeks ago that would functionally halt Syrian refugees from coming to the United States.Democrats immediately balked at the inclusion of the House-passed language on Syrian refugees, though senior GOP aides told HuffPost they think there's some language that Democrats could agree to. Both sides seem to want to change the visa waiver program, which allows foreign visitors from 38 countries to come to the United States for up to 90 days, but aides said changes to that program would be more likely as a standalone bill, or as an addition to a year-end package of tax extensions.As for the omnibus, conservatives also have their eyes on three abortion riders, the most significant of which would allow states to defund Planned Parenthood. That proposal is such a tall ask that Republicans didn't even bother including it on their initial offer. ""But if those riders on Syria and pro-life issues and other issues like that are not on the bill, it's just not even worth considering,"" Labrador said.House Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said Wednesday at the panel discussion that 165 Republicans -- it was actually 167 -- had voted against the budget deal that set the spending numbers in the omnibus.""And now there's also talk of adding things that, I think, make it even worse,"" Jordan added, mentioning a McConnell proposal that would eliminate caps on how much national parties can spend on candidates and a proposal that would give additional money to insurance agencies taking on sick customers. The Freedom Caucus took official positions against both proposals Monday night, which means that at least 80 percent of the 39-member group opposes their inclusion in the omnibus.If it seems like conservatives are watching to see how Ryan treats their long list of demands. Democrats are watching just as intently.Democrats were quick to reject the first offer from Republicans on Wednesday morning, but they were also quick to send over an offer by Wednesday night. And Democrats told HuffPost that they were hopeful Ryan had only sent over that first offer Wednesday, in the words of Massachusetts Democrat Jim McGovern, ""to check that box.""""And so I get it,"" McGovern said. ""I mean, he's got to deal with a lot of hard-line, right-wingers on his side.""McGovern said that Democrats would watch to see Ryan's next moves.""And my hope is that, as we move to next week, it will be less a political document, and more a serious piece of legislation to keep the government running,"" he said.Those right-wingers, meanwhile, aren't ready to plot against Ryan if he simply relies on Democrats to pass the omnibus.""I think it's just part of the leftover from the barn-cleaning,"" Dave Brat (R-Va.) told HuffPost on Wednesday, in reference to the phrase former Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) coined when he said he wanted to leave his successor with a clean barn.Conservatives including Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) seem to think Boehner did the opposite. ""I think he left a mess in the barn,"" he said, adding that conservatives couldn't hold Ryan accountable for all their problems.Ryan has bought himself some goodwill through his other first tests. There was the highway bill, where the House took dozens of amendment votes in keeping with Ryan's promise to make the legislative process more open to amendments. And there was the GOP Steering Committee overhaul, where Ryan shook up the composition of the group that selects committee chairmen.Instead of the omnibus as the be-all and end-all test, conservatives like Massie seem to be setting up yet another, even more challenging first exam.Massie said he wanted the House to get all 12 appropriations bills done next year -- which hasn't happened since 2002 -- and he wanted it done ""in truly open fashion, where anybody can offer amendments as long as they're germane."" Massie added that he was also looking for the House to hold its ground if the Senate failed to do its appropriations work.""That's going to be my litmus test,"" he said. "

The former secretary of state called for $275 billion in new federal spending devoted to roads, highways, airports and other projects that support union construction jobs.Sean McGarvey, the labor alliance's president, said Clinton has the ""toughness"" and ""strength"" to lead the country through difficult times.""Her infrastructure plan is further proof that she understands that the state of our nation's infrastructure is a bellwether for the health of the American economy and for the economic prospects of American workers,"" McGarvey said.The Building Trades coalition includes the Teamsters, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the Laborers' International Union of North America, among others. Individual unions within the coalition still make their own presidential endorsements. (LIUNA has already endorsed Clinton on its own.) Many building trade unions skew toward white, working-class men, a demographic that some polls suggest Clinton could struggle with.Clinton has been running away with union endorsements despite Democratic presidential contender Sen. Bernie Sanders' long-running relationship with organized labor. Sanders has been one of the most vocal supporters of collective bargaining in Congress throughout his career, but some of the largest unions have already thrown their weight behind Clinton. That includes the Service Employees International Union, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and the nation's two largest teacher unions. Overall, Clinton has picked up more than a dozen national union endorsements, compared with two for Sanders -- National Nurses United and the American Postal Workers Union.Also on HuffPost:"
19,MEDIA,"Walter Pincus, About To Turn 83, Looks To The Web For His Next Act",Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/walter-pincus-washington-post_us_565fb47be4b079b2818d402e,"After four decades, The Washington Post decided not to renew veteran national security columnist's contract.",2015-12-03,"Walter Pincus, in 1971, while working as a government investigator. He returned to the Post four years later and stayed for four decades.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- In 1975, Walter Pincus and editor Ben Bradlee hashed out a deal that kept the national security journalist at The Washington Post for the next four decades.Pincus had already carved out a unique career path, weaving over two decades through the military, media and government. He served in the Army’s Counterintelligence Corps, worked for several newspapers, including a three-year stint at the The Post in the mid-1960s, and took a couple sabbaticals from journalism to lead investigations for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In the early 1970s, Pincus tried starting a newspaper, ran the New Republic and was a consultant for NBC and CBS.When he tried returning to The Post in 1975, Bradlee -- the famously gruff editor who’d recently overseen the paper’s landmark Watergate coverage -- didn't like the idea of Pincus moonlighting as a TV consultant. “So we drew up a contract for six months because he thought it would fail,” Pincus said, “and I agreed if it failed I would come back full-time.”Instead, Pincus was given a year-to-year contract, which the Graham family -- the Post’s longtime stewards who last year sold the paper to Amazon chief Jeff Bezos -- kept renewing. The Post's current management, however, recently decided not to renew it. In an interview with The Huffington Post, Pincus joked that his wife had kept telling him, “you’re the only about-to-be-83-year-old wandering around the newsroom.” (His birthday is Dec. 24). Though Pincus said he considered The Post a ""second home,"" he spoke without sentimentality about management's decision. “It’s really up to them,” he said. “It’s always been that way. All I can say is it’s their decision. The column has an audience and I want to keep doing it--as long as my head is on straight.”The Post of 2015 is not The Post of 1975 -- or perhaps even 2014. The paper under owner Bezos and executive editor Marty Baron, who took the helm early last year, continues doing ambitious, investigative journalism and has reinvigorated its political coverage. At the same time, The Post has broadened its scope beyond Washington, producing reams of stories and blog posts, many with clicky headlines ripe for sharing on Facebook and Twitter. Presumably, management didn't see Pincus's weekly ""Fine Print"" column as part of its strategy. On the morning of Nov. 25 -- the Wednesday before Thanksgiving -- The Post boasted online about becoming ""America's publication of record"" after beating the New York Times in online traffic, a validation of its efforts to extend the paper's digital and social reach. That evening, Post editors announced that Pincus would leave at the end of the year. The editors' memo landed in inboxes just after 5 p.m., when many colleagues had already begun the Thanksgiving holiday.It was a low-key send-off for a journalist editors described in the memo as a Washington ""institution."" But Pincus has also been a controversial figure in Washington, at times drawing the ire of journalists for arguing that the press shouldn't be immune from investigations, or even prosecution, following government leaks. To some, he's a CIA apologist. Post staffers were expected to honor Pincus with cake Wednesday afternoon, but after the news of a mass shooting in San Bernardino broke, the newsroom ritual was pushed to Monday. A Post spokeswoman declined to comment on Pincus' departure, instead referring HuffPost to last week's internal memo. In the memo, Baron and national editor Cameron Barr recalled several journalistic highlights, including Pincus' standout reporting on nuclear weapons, Iran-Contra coverage in the 1980s, sharing a Pulitzer prize in 2002 and reporting skeptically and presciently on intelligence claims during the run-up to the Iraq war. “By cultivating sources and earning their trust, and often by getting his hands on the kind of documents that can speak the truth,"" they wrote, ""Walter has been able to expose the perfidies and missteps of government in a way that few other reporters can match.""Post editors didn't mention why Pincus was leaving, but noted the veteran journalist planned to take his column to “a new home in the new year.”Pincus is ""talking to a couple of websites about continuing the column,"" he told HuffPost. He'll also keep teaching at Stanford University through its program in Washington, D.C., and is writing book about the effects of nuclear weapons, which expands a piece he wrote nearly four decades earlier. In 1977, Pincus reported that the U.S. government planned to produce a neutron bomb, which the Carter administration halted following a public outcry after the revelations. Looking back over more than six decades in (and out) of journalism, Pincus said he considered the neutron bomb reporting to be his most important.Just last week, Pincus showed off rare photos of the first atomic bomb in a Post web series examining the more than 60 boxes of files he has in the basement, which need to be sorted through as the paper relocates to a new headquarters.""Apparently they found a piece I wrote for The Post on the front page before I was an employee, from 1960,” he said. “My run at The Post has been quite long. It was a second home.""Pincus has been unapologetic over the years about maintaining friendships with Washington’s power elite and considers his work in government essential to understanding how the system works from the inside.It’s Pincus’s close relationship with the CIA that led him to sources skeptical of the Bush administration’s case for war in Iraq. But such ties have also prompted criticism that he is overly sympathetic to the CIA, even after revelations of the agency’s torture program. In May 2013, Pincus wrote that The Associated Press was ""part of a crime"" after the news organization reported on a CIA operation in Yemen, a story that prompted the government’s widely condemned seizure of journalists' phone records.A week later, Pincus -- who also earned a law degree from Georgetown in 2001 --- questioned the need for a journalist shield law, considered by many to be a potential safeguard against the government compelling journalists to reveal sources. He alleged the next month that Glenn Greenwald was working with WikiLeaks following the journalist's reporting on surveillance disclosures from NSA whistleblower Edwards Snowden, a column that The Post later corrected. Pincus acknowledged some his views on the press and secrecy aren’t widely held among journalists, but said he’d been lucky that management at The Post generally left him alone to write his columns as he saw fit. He said he’s working on a longer piece on the subject that is expected to be part of a future book -- that’s in addition to the nuclear weapons book, teaching at Stanford and ideally, keeping the column going online. He has no plans to retire. Pincus said both his parents lived until the age of 95 and his father's decision to retire in his early 60s, with a third of his life still to come, has served as a cautionary tale.“Watching him convinced me that you just have to keep going,” he said."

But it's easy to offset those emissions if you give money toward support projects that halt deforestation, install renewable energy sources in your home, or promote energy efficiency.

The BFFs just released a new promo clip for their film ""Sisters,"" which pokes fun at the pandemonium surrounding the release of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"" and it's great. The promo reminds moviegoers that they don't have to choose between the two films -- both come out Dec. 18 -- because they can #goseethemboth. (Crazy concept, isn't it?) The clip, called ""Sisters: The Farce Awakens,"" begins with Fey and Poehler explaining how exciting their film's release is going to be, while behind-the-scenes shots flash on the screen. They even use British accents for emphasis. ""We're not British. We're just using these accents to cover our buzz,"" Fey notes. ""We're really drunk,"" Amy adds. Fellow ""Sisters"" stars Ike Barinholtz and Maya Rudolph also make some standout appearances in the clip. Barinholtz, throwing a fun jab at ""Star Wars"" and its fanbase, says, ""Growing up, I had a 'Sisters' lunchbox. I had all the 'Sisters' toys."" And then Rudolph attempts a Chewbacca impression. (Key word: attempts.) It's priceless. This is comedic gold right here. (And, dare we say -- gasp! -- we might even want to see ""Sisters"" more than ""Star Wars"" now ... ).

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) says he would limit the use of immigrant detention.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Immigrant men on a hunger strike protesting their detention now have the backing of two Democratic presidential candidates. The campaigns of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley said Thursday they support the effort by more than 150 asylum-seekers to draw attention to the immigrant detention system.The statements came as protesters gathered outside the campaign headquarters of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, asking that she and Sanders express support for the hunger strike. Clinton Latino outreach director Lorella Praeli met with the protesters on Thursday. A campaign spokesman, Jorge Silva, later issued a statement reiterating Clinton's support for immigration reform and for curbing immigrant detention. The statement didn't say whether Clinton supports the hunger strikers.""We listened to their stories, and are inspired by the important role that activism plays to implement change on behalf of immigrant families,"" Silva said of the meeting. ""Hillary Clinton believes our immigration enforcement and detention system must be humane, and ensure the dignity, safety, and well-being of every human being."" The hunger strikers are asking to be released from detention as they plead their case for asylum to remain in the U.S., based on fear of returning to their home countries. Some of the men participating in what activists are calling the #FreedomGiving hunger strikes claim detention center workers have retaliated against them for refusing food.Clinton, Sanders and fellow Democratic candidate former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley all have said they would limit detention by using alternatives and ending contracts for private prison companies to run the holding facilities.The Sanders campaign, which announced an ambitious immigration reform plan last week, issued a statement on Thursday in support of the hunger strike. Sanders' Latino outreach director, Arturo Carmona, said the senator ""is committed to a humane and secure immigration policy, which includes ensuring that people escaping violence and severe poverty are given a fair opportunity to present their claims."" ""These aspiring Americans should not be criminalized, subjected to dehumanizing solitary confinement or indefinitely detained,"" Carmona said. ""The United States must meet our international responsibilities to families seeking refuge."" O'Malley, who was not targeted in the protests, has been outspoken on detention, particularly of women and children, and says in his immigration platform that he would use detention only in limited circumstances. He talked about previous hunger strikes by mothers in detention at a Texas Tribune forum last month, saying they were happening because the U.S. was ""interning"" people ""without charge, and without due process."" Gabriela Domenzain, O'Malley's senior adviser on immigration, said he supports the message of the latest hunger strikes, which she said is that ""we have to end immigrant detention, period. ""This is a symptom of the larger problem, which is that we are inhumanely detaining, without due process, thousands of immigrants that should not be in those conditions,"" Domenzain said. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has pushed back on the claim that detainees are being mistreated, and said in a statement on Monday that the agency ""takes very seriously the health, safety, and welfare of those in our care and we continue to monitor the situation"" during the hunger strike.This article has been updated to include a statement from Clinton's campaign.Also on HuffPost:"

We do not know their motivations,"" Obama said in a statement given from the Oval Office on Thursday.Obama said he's spoken with San Bernardino Mayor Carey Davis about the incident and thanked law enforcement officers for their efforts. But the president also emphasized that every American has a part to play in reducing gun violence.""So many Americans sometimes feel as if there's nothing we can do about it,"" Obama said. ""We can't just leave it to our professionals [in law enforcement] to deal with the problem of horrible killings.

Wednesday's shooting was the deadliest in the United States since the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012, when 20 children and six adults were murdered at an elementary school in Connecticut.Related:"

John Sarbanes (D-Md.) and Ted Deutch (D-Fla.) are circulating a letter among Democrats calling on congressional leaders to oppose the inclusion of a provision that would allow political parties to spend unlimited money on coordinated expenditures with candidates. The letter, which will be sent to McConnell, along with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.), House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), has 113 signatures so far.The effort comes one year after Republicans and Senate Democrats greatly expanded political party contribution limits through a provision inserted in the 2014 omnibus budget bill that received no prior debate.“As negotiations over the omnibus agreement continue, we urge you to resist any attempt to include a controversial campaign finance provision relaxing political party coordination limits,” the letter states. “This change would be a travesty coming on the heels of last year’s erosion of the limits on big donor contributions to the parties. Americans have a right to expect that political parties and candidates will answer to them, but this change in the law would only further surrender the party apparatus to the influence of millionaires and billionaires.”Supporters of the provision believe it will help parties balance out the power assumed by outside groups following the 2010 Citizens United decision. But many of the biggest spenders among these outside groups are those controlled by party leaders and their allies. Opponents believe that without other reforms empowering small donors and reforming outside spending, unlimited party and candidate coordination will just serve to empower big donors.The Sarbanes and Deutch letter also notes that ""the 114th Congress has not held one hearing, commissioned a single study, nor investigated in any serious way the impacts of changing the current coordination rules governing political party spending.""Republicans in the right-wing Freedom Caucus have also voiced their opposition to the unlimited party coordination measure. The insurgent group of about 40 House members routinely clashes with party leaders in the legislative process and elections. They oppose any increase in the centralization of power within the Republican Party.""It is designed to help elect candidates who will toe the party line in Washington rather than stand up for the people they were elected to represent,” Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), chairman of the Freedom Caucus, told Politico.The party coordination provision is not the only rider that looks likely to appear in the omnibus budget bill.There is also likely to be a provision prohibiting the Obama administration from implementing an executive order requiring contractors to disclose political spending, including contributions to politically active nonprofits that do not disclose their donors. Other provisions would prevent the Securities and Exchange Commission from implementing a rule requiring publicly traded companies to similarly disclose their political spending, and keep the Internal Revenue Service from drafting new rules for nonprofits requiring them to disclose certain contributions.Read Sarbanes and Deutch's letter below:"

The Panthers, led by quarterback Cam Newton, are still five wins away from an undefeated regular season. On this week's ""The Second Half"" podcast, HuffPost sports reporter Travis Waldron and NFL veteran Donté Stallworth wonder whether Carolina might just be able to do it (Steph Curry is a believer).The Panthers haven't started talking publicly about an unblemished regular season, but with a relatively weak remaining schedule, it's at least starting to look possible. Even if they do stumble, Carolina could clinch the NFC South as soon as this Sunday, and they have a two-game advantage on Arizona in the race for home field advantage in the playoffs. So, the Panthers are looking pretty good and having a ton of fun in the process.Also on this week's podcast: Sports reporter Jessica Luther discusses ""The Hunting Ground,"" a documentary that explores sexual assault on college campuses and focuses on a case involving former Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston (that starts at 24:00).

32,SPORTS,This Lakers Season Is Driving Me Crazy,Maxwell Strachan,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lakers-ahhhh-what-to-think_us_566065e4e4b079b2818d6a54,This is what an existential crisis looks like.,2015-12-03,The moment when he proved once and for all that he does not have a fearful bone in his body.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"The Lakers are horrendous this year. But if they want to get anything out of this season besides memories of Kobe Bryant entering visiting arenas to raucous cheers and then immediately air-balling a three-pointer, the team needs to be really, really horrendous.The Lakers’ first-round pick in the 2016 NBA Draft is top-three protected, meaning if they do not end up with one of the top three picks in the draft, the pick will instead go to the tanktastic Philadelphia 76ers, and the Lakers will not have anything to show for the horrible record they are in the process of accumulating.The rules of the lottery are complicated, but suffice it to say that the worst teams usually get the highest picks, unless one to three teams with better records are able to jump up into the top three slots during a ball-bouncing lottery. That means if the Lakers end up with the fourth worst record in the league, they need to rely on a lucky bounce of the balls and a leap of faith on lottery night. End up with the third worst record, and the team will need only one team to leapfrog them and crush their dreams. In reality, the Lakers need the first or second worst record to really enter lottery night feeling something close to good about their chance of capturing a solid pick and the chance at a franchise player. And since the 76ers are still a team that we are all just pretending is a professional one, the Lakers are really hoping to finish second-worst.Lots of fans and analysts entering the year didn’t think it would happen. They assumed that the Lakers would be forking over the pick come lottery night. They thought the Lakers would be bad this year, but few thought they would be “embarrassment to the sport of basketball” bad. They have young prospects, mid-career veterans and Kobe Bryant! Yet here we are, 18 games into the season, and the Lakers have the second worst record in the league. It's a goddamned miracle for those Lakers fans who want to see their team rise back to title contention in the near future. But combined with you-know-who’s farewell tour, it’s making a lot of us also lose our goddamned minds. People are acting like the Kobe farewell tour began on Sunday against the Indiana Pacers, but anyone who has been paying attention could sense there has been a hush-hush understanding for at least months now. For Lakers fans, it’s made for a viewing experience that can be described as bizarre at best, mind-melding at worst.Has there ever been a situation like this in NBA history? The team needs to be impossibly bad to keep its pick, so we need the team to lose, but we also want to develop our three young guys -- D’Angelo Russell, Jordan Clarkson and Julius Randle -- and we want to see a few more moments from Kobe. We want Byron Scott to keep coaching the team into the ground, but we also want to see the greatest franchise in NBA history show some pride. We want to see Kobe hit a few more late-game shots, but we also want to watch him shoot us out of the game. Thankfully, he's done more of the latter.It's made the process of watching a Lakers game a truly existential and maddening experience. What do we truly want out of these games? What do we want out of our season? Why are we here on earth? What does it mean to be human?We want it both ways. We want to appreciate Kobe in his final season. He’s been an imperfect and often frustrating player to root for his entire career, but he’s still the first or second greatest Laker of all time, and it feels wrong to root for him to airball yet another turnaround three, even though we have every incentive to do so, and even though it’s hilarious. But we need to lose. We really need to lose, guys.The last two games against the 76ers and Washington Wizards have really been the best- and worst-case scenarios for this Lakers team, respectively. The 76ers game on Tuesday was the perfect 2015-2016 Lakers viewing experience. It was fun, funny and even a tad touching. There was a sentimental ceremony for Kobe, and there were some throwback Kobe moments.There were also some hilarious 2015-2016 Kobe moments. You know the type by now. But, most important, the Lakers lost. And even better, the 76ers won. So really, the game had everything Lakers fans could want: some nostalgia, some comedy and in the end, an improved chance at keeping the 2016 pick.Wednesday night against the Wizards, on the other hand, was the sort of game that makes Lakers fans want to feel awful this year. Kobe went off for 31 points. At times, he looked genuinely good.Randle played well, too. Too well. Everything went too well, and instead of Kobe chucking up an airball with the game on the line -- the team’s patented 2015-2016 tanking move -- it went in. The Lakers won on Wednesday, so they also sort of lost.Should Lakers fans be happy or sad after a game like Wednesday night's? There is no right answer. You can choose to celebrate Kobe and ignore the fact that we might lose out on a franchise player as a result of his heroics. Or you can choose to be angry at the Laker who helped bring the team five championships. Perhaps we can only stare into the void and ponder questions like, ""What is truth?"" But on the same night, an LSU freshman by the name of Ben Simmons had 43 points on 75 percent shooting with 14 rebounds, seven assists, five steals and three blocks. That brings everything a bit more into focus, doesn't it? We need that goddamned pick. Also on HuffPost:"
