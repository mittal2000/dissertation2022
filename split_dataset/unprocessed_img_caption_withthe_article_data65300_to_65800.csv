(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Joseph AxNEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York City police officer charged with fatally shooting an unarmed black man in an unlit Brooklyn stairwell took the stand at his manslaughter trial on Monday, tearfully describing what he portrayed as a tragic accident.Peter Liang was entering a pitch-black stairwell inside a public housing project with his gun drawn on Nov. 20, 2014, when he said a noise startled him, causing his body to tense and his finger to pull the trigger of his service weapon.He and his partner argued briefly over whether to report the shot, with Liang saying he was going to be dismissed from the force. Moments later, Liang headed downstairs and realized the bullet had ricocheted off a wall and into the chest of 28-year-old Akai Gurley, one floor below.""His eyes were rolled back,"" Liang said, his voice breaking. ""He was just laying there very still.""Prosecutors have accused Liang of misconduct and criminal negligence for failing to report the shot immediately and for having drawn his weapon in the first place. They have also said he did not offer Gurley medical aid despite having CPR training.But Liang, now 28, said he understood that officers have the discretion to unholster their guns if they are worried about their safety.The shooting added to tensions across the United States over the use of force against minorities by police officers, though Liang, who is Chinese-American, has not been accused of deliberately firing at Gurley.The defense has emphasized the dangers inherent in patrolling crime-ridden public housing buildings. That argument was underscored last Thursday night, when two officers were shot during a similar patrol inside the stairwell of a Bronx public housing complex.Jurors will weigh Liang's account with versions offered by Melissa Butler, Gurley's girlfriend, who described frantically trying to administer aid while Liang stood by, and Liang's partner Shaun Landau, who testified under an immunity deal.Liang, who was a rookie officer, said he felt it was more important to summon help on the radio than to try to assist Gurley himself.""I was panicking,"" he said. ""I was in shock and disbelief that someone was actually hit.""Liang was forced to leave the courtroom to compose himself during his direct testimony, which lasted about half an hour. As cross-examination began, Assistant District Attorney Joseph Alexis pointed out that Liang had received extensive firearms training.The trial is expected to end early this week.(Reporting by Joseph Ax; Editing by Scott Malone and Dan Grebler)"

4,POLITICS,"Jeb Bush Raised $100 Million, But Now He's Mad About Citizens United",Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeb-bush-citizens-united_us_56b8f1a6e4b01d80b2475655,"If only his campaign had those $1 million checks, instead of his super PAC.",2016-02-08,Jeb Bush's call to overturn Citizens United is not the usual reformer's cry.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56b8f3c91800006f0080b808.jpeg?ops=crop_25_225_4330_2557%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush wants to get rid of the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision, but it's not because he's worried about too much money in the political system.No, he wants to let all those wealthy donors to super PACs just send their unlimited checks directly to the candidates' campaigns.""If I could do it all again, I'd eliminate the Supreme Court ruling,"" Bush told CNN on Monday. ""This is a ridiculous system we have now where you have campaigns that struggle to raise money directly and they can't be held accountable for the spending of the super PAC that's their affiliate.""The former Florida governor's statement might sound odd since he has likely benefited more from the Citizens United decision than any other presidential candidate. He directly raised some $100 million for his Right to Rise USA super PAC while pretending not to run for president last year. Most of that money came from donors giving well in excess of the $5,400 limit on contributions to official campaign committees -- such as Bush's once he formally acknowledged he was running in June 2015.Once he'd announced his official candidacy, Bush was no longer able to dictate strategy to his super PAC -- although he had already helped staff the group with aides who knew his campaign strategy. Now, decisions about spending that $100-plus million rest with the man running Right to Rise USA: Mike Murphy, Bush's former aide.""The ideal situation would be to overturn the Supreme Court ruling that allows for ... unregulated money for the independent and regulated for the campaign,"" Bush told a lunch crowd in Nashua, New Hampshire. ""I would turn that on its head if I could.""""Turning that on its head"" means a campaign finance system with no contribution limits at all. In other words, Bush would have been able to raise those six-, seven- and eight-figure checks directly for his campaign. His campaign could have raked in the $10 million contribution that C.V. Starr & Co. gave to Right to Rise USA in December.Unlike the Republican presidential campaigns buoyed by super PACs, the two Democratic Party candidates -- Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders -- have raised large sums for their campaigns within contribution limits. They've demonstrated that it is entirely possible to raise sufficient funds under current rules.Perhaps Bush's complaint is more a statement of regret over his choice to focus early fundraising efforts on his super PAC rather than invest time and money in collecting sufficient funds for his campaign.There is another angle to Bush's irritation with the post-Citizens United landscape: He lamented the kind of rougher super PAC attacks for which it's hard to hold the candidates accountable. In particular, he pointed to a mailer sent out by Sen. Marco Rubio's Conservative Solutions PAC that made a veiled hit on Barbara Bush, Jeb's mother.""I mean, I just saw a mailing that attacked me through my mother with one of the super PACs,"" Bush told CNN. ""C'mon, man, that's a pretty low blow.""Polls show that Republicans, Democrats and independents all support overturning the Citizens United decision by wide margins. But those who back campaign finance reform generally do not like the idea of ending all campaign contribution limits.""Republicans and Democrats alike are responding to an electorate fed up with a broken political system that too often favors wealthy special interests at the expense of everyone else,"" David Donnelly, president of the campaign finance reform group Every Voice, said in a statement. ""Yet voters should not be fooled by Jeb Bush's support to overturn the unpopular Citizens United decision because he followed it up with a call for unlimited donations to candidates that would completely undermine any progress made by overturning Citizens United.""Donnelly suggested that Bush should instead push proposals to give ordinary Americans more of a voice in politics. ""For example,"" Donnelly said, ""he should back small-donor solutions including modernizing the presidential public financing system that both his brother and father used to get to the White House.""Donald Trump, the Bush campaign's chief antagonist, had another message:Also on HuffPost:"

Really, though, they just love Bernie Sanders more.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PORTSMOUTH, N.H. -- When former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright scolded young women who support Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Saturday for taking for granted the notion of a woman president, the bluntness of her language caught people off guard.“There’s a special place in hell for women who don’t help each other!” Albright said.Pledging eternal damnation for a good swath of Sanders' backers seemed a bit harsh. In reality, though, Albright's line was just a repetition of one she's uttered so many times before that it's adorned the side of a Starbucks cup. The far more interesting aspect was that she directed the remark only toward young female Sanders supporters. After all, if you stroll to campaign events in New Hampshire, it is quite apparent that there is a robust universe of elderly women who support Sanders too. And they do so despite feeling a deep sense of conflict over potentially not -- as Albright would put it -- seeing the job through. ""I’m a 65-year-old woman. A Democrat. I've always voted Democrat,"" said Maryclaire Heffernan, a Sanders supporter from Candia, New Hampshire. ""It’s a tough one. I voted for Obama twice. So I’ve already not voted for Hillary once ... If Hillary is the nominee I would absolutely support her. However, I am concerned about where we are and think if we don’t think big, we have to stop thinking around the edges or holding the edges in place.""""I do feel bad about it,"" she added, a tinge of pain visible on her face. ""And I have dear friends who would kill me for saying that out loud.""At Sanders' rallies here in New Hampshire, you meet plenty of women just like Heffernan. They are emotionally invested in electing a woman president. They know that the glass ceiling needs to be cracked. But they aren't convinced Clinton is the one to do it. Liz Wilson, 37, of Epping, New Hampshire, is among the skeptics. She believes strongly that ""women leadership brings a better approach to the job"" and said a Clinton election would ""mean a lot to me as a mother."" But she also said this from the middle of a monster Sanders rally where both she and her child were wearing baby blue Bernie T-shirts. She was 90 percent certain she'd end up casting her vote for the Vermonter. ""On Tuesday, I will still be torn a little bit,"" she explained. ""I admire experience and service. But Bernie’s approach to policy is more in line with my personal approach.”Part of the reason these women have gravitated toward Sanders is, simply, that they view him as a feminist too. And for good reason. At the campaign stop at Portsmouth on Saturday, his loudest applause lines included calls for paid family leave. In a riff about how Obamacare hadn't gone far enough, he made sure to note one distinct accomplishment in the law: that it ended the discrepancy in what women and men pay for insurance. He made a specific ask for men to stand up alongside woman in the cause for pay equity. And as he detailed his plans for job creation, two of his points emphasized sectors that predominantly employ women: hiring teachers and expanding child care services.It's that approach, combined with an anti-establishment track record, that's won over people like Elise DeMichael, 67, of Milford, New Hampshire. DeMichael said she originally intended to support Clinton; she even had two bumper stickers on her car: one for Clinton and a smaller one for Sanders. But after hearing Sanders speak last spring, she changed her mind. ""I was just blown away by his passion and integrity. And of course, I loved what he said. But it's really hard for me. I know Hillary has fabulous experience, she's worked hard and she's smart, smart,"" said DeMichael, who was attending a Bill Clinton rally in Milford Sunday just for fun.Soon, the Clinton bumper sticker was gone, replaced with a second Sanders one.For the Clinton campaign and its supporters, there is a certain level of frustration over these defections. Albright's comment was the most sharply enunciated of that sentiment, but it was hardly the only one. Gloria Steinem, the famed feminist, journalist and political activist, blamed adolescent attraction to boys for the reason that women were supporting Sanders' candidacy (the attraction being to his young male supporters, not Sanders himself). She subsequently apologized for the remark. Several of Clinton's female supporters, meanwhile, copped to feeling bewildered that their friends weren't swayed by the potential history to be made in her candidacy. Claire Walsh, 69, of Deep River, Connecticut, said that at a recent retreat of Democratic women, she ""almost fell off the chair"" after hearing all her peers gush about Sanders. ""How can you do this? How can you not support a woman who has been dragged through the mud for so long for so many decades?” she said.Every female Sanders supporter interviewed for this piece agreed that Clinton has faced sexism and double standards throughout her career. And they also felt that it was because of those roadblocks that she'd had to adopt what some perceive to be not-so-appealing political traits (ambition and firmness being the two terms most frequently used). Their empathy for her was made even deeper by the fact that many had faced sexism in their careers.""Nothing can be tougher than having your boss tell you you can't have the raise you deserve because the other guys are married and have kids,"" said Joni Salvas, 74, who was volunteering at Clinton's Manchester office and had worked in manufacturing.""Hillary has been through that too, absolutely. But not as bluntly as I have,"" she added. She said she eventually left that field because, ""I don't have a military pension, I don't have a penis and I'm getting the hell out of this joint.""But although they related to Clinton, they also felt comfortable compartmentalizing their own experiences from their political choices. Whereas the prospect of having the first female president is ever-present at Clinton's events, it is very much secondary, if not tertiary, at a Sanders rally. This was especially true among younger women, who, according to the polls, support Sanders over Clinton by large margins. ""I think that is counterintuitive,"" said Megan Smilikis, 18, of Massachusetts when asked if female voters should consider gender when weighing Clinton's candidacy. ""Feminism isn’t about making a woman the same or better than a man. Just to support someone because she is a woman isn’t what that is about. Just to put someone in office because they are a woman is a step back.”In the end, the roughly 20 women interviewed for this article all said that they feel a woman would bring a valuable perspective to the White House -- one that has been sorely missing. ""So far the guys have messed it up pretty good,"" said Leslie, 70, from New York City, who is supporting Sanders and declined to offer her last name. “I do think that [it would be different to have a woman’s perspective in the White House],"" said Ellen Myers, 54, of New Jersey, who is likely voting for a Republican in Tuesday's primary. ""If she were of the age of having her period, she would get a whole lot done in a short period of time.”""It's incalculable the difference it would make to have a woman president of the United States,"" Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood, told The Huffington Post at a Clinton canvassing kickoff event Sunday afternoon in Manchester, adding, ""It's not only that she would be the first woman president, but it's that she brings decades of experience in foreign policy and domestic policy and advocacy.""But for the Bernie backers, there is no real sense of urgency to get that female voice in the Oval Office; no rush to break that final glass ceiling. After all, there is another potential woman president waiting in the wings. “We will get there,"" said Meghan Frazier, 45, of Massachusetts. ""Elizabeth Warren. She is this close. When she is ready to pull the trigger, it will happen.”"

""And I have dear friends who would kill me for saying that out loud.""At Sanders' rallies here in New Hampshire, you meet plenty of women just like Heffernan. They are emotionally invested in electing a woman president. They know that the glass ceiling needs to be cracked. But they aren't convinced Clinton is the one to do it. Liz Wilson, 37, of Epping, New Hampshire, is among the skeptics. She believes strongly that ""women leadership brings a better approach to the job"" and said a Clinton election would ""mean a lot to me as a mother."" But she also said this from the middle of a monster Sanders rally where both she and her child were wearing baby blue Bernie T-shirts. She was 90 percent certain she'd end up casting her vote for the Vermonter. ""On Tuesday, I will still be torn a little bit,"" she explained. ""I admire experience and service. But Bernie’s approach to policy is more in line with my personal approach.”Part of the reason these women have gravitated toward Sanders is, simply, that they view him as a feminist too. And for good reason. At the campaign stop at Portsmouth on Saturday, his loudest applause lines included calls for paid family leave. In a riff about how Obamacare hadn't gone far enough, he made sure to note one distinct accomplishment in the law: that it ended the discrepancy in what women and men pay for insurance. He made a specific ask for men to stand up alongside woman in the cause for pay equity. And as he detailed his plans for job creation, two of his points emphasized sectors that predominantly employ women: hiring teachers and expanding child care services.It's that approach, combined with an anti-establishment track record, that's won over people like Elise DeMichael, 67, of Milford, New Hampshire. DeMichael said she originally intended to support Clinton; she even had two bumper stickers on her car: one for Clinton and a smaller one for Sanders. But after hearing Sanders speak last spring, she changed her mind. ""I was just blown away by his passion and integrity. And of course, I loved what he said. But it's really hard for me. I know Hillary has fabulous experience, she's worked hard and she's smart, smart,"" said DeMichael, who was attending a Bill Clinton rally in Milford Sunday just for fun.Soon, the Clinton bumper sticker was gone, replaced with a second Sanders one.For the Clinton campaign and its supporters, there is a certain level of frustration over these defections. Albright's comment was the most sharply enunciated of that sentiment, but it was hardly the only one. Gloria Steinem, the famed feminist, journalist and political activist, blamed adolescent attraction to boys for the reason that women were supporting Sanders' candidacy (the attraction being to his young male supporters, not Sanders himself). She subsequently apologized for the remark. Several of Clinton's female supporters, meanwhile, copped to feeling bewildered that their friends weren't swayed by the potential history to be made in her candidacy. Claire Walsh, 69, of Deep River, Connecticut, said that at a recent retreat of Democratic women, she ""almost fell off the chair"" after hearing all her peers gush about Sanders. ""How can you do this? How can you not support a woman who has been dragged through the mud for so long for so many decades?” she said.Every female Sanders supporter interviewed for this piece agreed that Clinton has faced sexism and double standards throughout her career. And they also felt that it was because of those roadblocks that she'd had to adopt what some perceive to be not-so-appealing political traits (ambition and firmness being the two terms most frequently used). Their empathy for her was made even deeper by the fact that many had faced sexism in their careers.""Nothing can be tougher than having your boss tell you you can't have the raise you deserve because the other guys are married and have kids,"" said Joni Salvas, 74, who was volunteering at Clinton's Manchester office and had worked in manufacturing.""Hillary has been through that too, absolutely. But not as bluntly as I have,"" she added. She said she eventually left that field because, ""I don't have a military pension, I don't have a penis and I'm getting the hell out of this joint.""But although they related to Clinton, they also felt comfortable compartmentalizing their own experiences from their political choices. Whereas the prospect of having the first female president is ever-present at Clinton's events, it is very much secondary, if not tertiary, at a Sanders rally. This was especially true among younger women, who, according to the polls, support Sanders over Clinton by large margins. ""I think that is counterintuitive,"" said Megan Smilikis, 18, of Massachusetts when asked if female voters should consider gender when weighing Clinton's candidacy. ""Feminism isn’t about making a woman the same or better than a man. Just to support someone because she is a woman isn’t what that is about. Just to put someone in office because they are a woman is a step back.”In the end, the roughly 20 women interviewed for this article all said that they feel a woman would bring a valuable perspective to the White House -- one that has been sorely missing. ""So far the guys have messed it up pretty good,"" said Leslie, 70, from New York City, who is supporting Sanders and declined to offer her last name. “I do think that [it would be different to have a woman’s perspective in the White House],"" said Ellen Myers, 54, of New Jersey, who is likely voting for a Republican in Tuesday's primary. ""If she were of the age of having her period, she would get a whole lot done in a short period of time.”""It's incalculable the difference it would make to have a woman president of the United States,"" Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood, told The Huffington Post at a Clinton canvassing kickoff event Sunday afternoon in Manchester, adding, ""It's not only that she would be the first woman president, but it's that she brings decades of experience in foreign policy and domestic policy and advocacy.""But for the Bernie backers, there is no real sense of urgency to get that female voice in the Oval Office; no rush to break that final glass ceiling. After all, there is another potential woman president waiting in the wings. “We will get there,"" said Meghan Frazier, 45, of Massachusetts. ""Elizabeth Warren. She is this close. When she is ready to pull the trigger, it will happen.”"

Of the 41 commercials that did feature women, 56 percent didn’t give those women a chance to speak. Motto also discovered that in 64 percent of the 55 total commercials, women didn't have speaking roles. The problem may have something to do with the lack of female directors behind these spots. Motto confirmed that 50 out of the 55 commercials were directed by men.At least the halftime show proved what women are truly capable of.

9,POLITICS,Marco Rubio's Struggle To Be More Than A Talking Point Machine,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marco-rubio-talking-point-machine_us_56b80a36e4b04f9b57da24d9,His debate performance gave even his supporters pause.,2016-02-08,Marco Rubio tried to shore up his support in New Hampshire on Sunday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"MANCHESTER, N.H. -- With a solid debate performance over the weekend and a strong showing in New Hampshire Tuesday, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio had a chance to put the rest of the GOP establishment on borrowed time. Instead, there is a real danger for Rubio that a Granite State stumble could turn into a national fall.He could still relegate the other mainstream Republicans to the fringe with a decisive victory here in the first-in-the-nation primary Tuesday. But following his third place performance in Iowa, Rubio faces a dangerous electoral concoction: a combination of high expectations and the possibility that another establishment candidate, such as Ohio Gov. John Kasich, could beat him.If a Rubio rally on Sunday was any indication, the senator’s exchange with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in Saturday night's debate that pointed out his propensity to repeat the same talking points is actually giving Rubio’s supporters, long-standing ones and the prospective kind, pause.“Rubio got a little beat-down,” Will Stewart of Manchester said at an event that was billed as a Super Bowl watch party with Rubio.“The whole talking point issue is concerning,” Stewart, who is undecided, continued. “You hope there’s a little more depth there.”New London resident Paul Licari -- who said he was deciding among Kasich, Rubio and Christie -- described the exchange this way: “Christie was on it.”Even Rubio’s strongest allies were a little taken aback by the Florida senator resorting to the same canned line criticizing President Barack Obama after Christie called him on doing just that.Eddie Foye of Hookset told HuffPost he has been impressed with Rubio since the first time he heard him speak as a senator, and he’s been a Rubio supporter from early in the presidential race. And even though Foye came away from the debate exchange disliking Christie more, he admitted he was surprised at how poorly Rubio had handled the situation.“Marco was a little unprepared for his answers,” he said.Al Nunes of Wilmot, who said he was a Rubio supporter “more or less,” called the Christie-Rubio exchange interesting.“It was fair,” Nunes said. “The way I look at it is, if you can’t -- I mean, you got to get through these debates, you got to get through the process.”Rubio defended his response and said he would continue to repeat the same point.“It’s funny people keep saying it’s a bad thing. I’m going to keep saying it over and over again,” he said.Rubio was able to break from his stump script a bit more than usual Sunday, cracking jokes about the Super Bowl and delivering some witty repartee with the audience.When Rubio told the crowd that former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had said there's a special place in hell for women who don't vote for Hillary Clinton, a woman in the back of the athletic training facility, where the event was being held, shouted that she was going to hell then.“Well here's the good news, ma'am: You don't have to,” Rubio said, thinking on his feet. “You can vote against her and still find salvation.""While many attendees thought they were coming to watch the Super Bowl with Rubio -- it was, after all, billed as a watch party -- Rubio seemed to accomplish what he needed to in a speech that was roughly 20 minutes and then, after taking some photos, departed before the game began.And that seemed to be enough for Granite Staters on the fence. “His response was that he stands by what he says,” Nunes told HuffPost after the event. “I’m comfortable with it. He showed me that he’s comfortable with himself. It was not like it’s being portrayed as talking points. He said what he meant.”Nunes, who was still hedging before the speech, said Rubio had locked down his vote.Samantha-Jo Roth contributed reporting."

12,BUSINESS,The White House Tries To Get Tough With Dodgy Colleges,Shahien Nasiripour,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/education-department-white-house-college-fraud_us_56b8c859e4b08069c7a81963,"The administration's ""aggressive action"" to root out wrongdoing may be little more than a branding effort.",2016-02-08,Acting Education Secretary John King Jr. with President Barack Obama in the White House in 2015. King announced a new department oversight unit on Monday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56b8c8931a00009c01ab2310.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Obama administration will create a new enforcement unit within the Department of Education to crack down on colleges suspected of fraud, acting Secretary John King Jr. announced with great fanfare on Monday.But student loan borrowers shouldn't rejoice just yet. In reality, the department is simply reorganizing its oversight efforts, combining various teams and giving the combined entity a new name. It's simply an “evolution,” King admitted Monday. And that's not the only problem with the move: The enforcement division, critics warn, may have a serious conflict-of-interest problem.This is at least the third time in five years that the Education Department has slapped a new name on its existing oversight efforts. In 2011 it formed the “Publicly Traded and Large Schools Workgroup,” a team that in the following three years failed to regularly meet, according to a critical report by the Education Department’s inspector general.A few years later, in the wake of criticism that it was asleep at the wheel when disgraced for-profit chain Corinthian Colleges Inc. ran into financial trouble, the Education Department formed a “multi-regional review team” that is responsible for monitoring large and publicly traded school groups, according to its most recent annual report.The latest ""new"" unit is supposed to allow the Education Department to “respond more quickly and efficiently to allegations of illegal actions by higher education institutions,” it said in a news release. While the department’s Federal Student Aid office, which oversees colleges and the government’s student loan program, has long had subpoena power, “we haven’t leveraged that,” James Runcie, who runs the FSA, said Monday. The department also announced that the White House would request an additional $13.6 million from Congress for the enforcement team.The enforcement team could use the money. Thousands of former students have petitioned the department to cancel their federal loans, citing allegations that their schools defrauded them into taking on the debt. The reorganized enforcement team, after years of missing alleged abuses, will now rule on those applications. If the Education Department's enforcement team rules in favor of borrowers, it'd effectively be admitting the department missed the fraud in the first place. Some consumer advocates argue this arrangement represents a conflict of interest.To Robert Shireman, a former senior Education Department official under President Barack Obama now at the Century Foundation, the move represents ""a very important culture shift at the Education Department, from seeing the colleges as friends who need help 'complying' [with the law] to a policing-the-market mentality that has been so sorely lacking.""In recent years the Education Department has sat on the sidelines while the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general all separately sued giant for-profit colleges accusing them of defrauding hundreds of thousands of students by advertising false job placement and graduation rates.Those lawsuits came despite years of regular audits and exams by the Education Department, which allowed the schools to collectively reap billions of dollars in taxpayer cash in the form of student loans and grants from students who mostly didn’t graduate. The colleges have denied wrongdoing.Democratic lawmakers, the department’s inspector general, the Government Accountability Office, and consumer and student advocacy groups have persistently criticized the Education Department’s oversight of the higher education industry, from its lackluster policing of dodgy colleges that defraud students to its close ties with loan companies and debt collectors that mislead borrowers hoping to repay their loans.Monday’s announcement marks the latest attempt by the Education Department to rehabilitate its battered image. Last month it hired Rohit Chopra, formerly the nation’s student loan watchdog at the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.The department’s enforcement unit will be led by Robert Kaye, formerly of the Federal Trade Commission. Kaye will report to Runcie, who oversees the student loan program. Congressional Republicans blasted Runcie in November for running an organization that to them rewards failure.""It is clear that FSA can not administer this program,"" Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.) said that month. She told Runcie: ""You are harming the people you are supposed to be helping, and that has to stop."""

""I basically got a standing ovation,"" he said.Bush also received a climate change question during his Saturday town hall in Bedford, New Hampshire. This one was from Cindy Lerner, mayor of Pinecrest, Florida. She and 14 other mayors -- a bipartisan group -- recently wrote to Rubio and Bush and asked to meet with them about climate change. ""What we're seeing in Florida and around the country is a very strong, green economy with renewable energy and energy efficiency. And we'd like to see leadership from our next president on this,"" Lerner said to applause.""Look, the climate is changing. We have billions of people that live on the planet. We clearly have an impact. To deny it doesn't make sense,"" Bush replied to more applause, adding that he'd like to meet with the mayors when he's back in Florida. New Jersey Gov.

He just didn't swing at all.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56b74c751800002d0080b6b4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It seems odd to recall now, but former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty was fairly well-positioned to win the Republican presidential nomination in 2012.He had been on the short list to be the party's vice presidential nominee in 2008. He was a Republican governor of a Democratic-leaning state. He had crafted an image as a blue-collar conservative. And he had hired the most sought-after campaign manager in the business.But Pawlenty’s campaign never really took off and ended soon after it began.In the latest episode of ""Candidate Confessional,"" Pawlenty said he flamed out quickly because he didn’t have enough money and couldn’t settle on a sharp message that resonated with the public.The other issue was that Pawlenty, to borrow a hackneyed term, was too Minnesota Nice. Nothing better exemplifies this than the moment that has come to define his candidacy: his inability to directly attack GOP front-runner Mitt Romney during a debate.While the moment itself has taken its place in the annals of campaign flubs -- ""I just botched the answer,"" Pawlenty said -- the behind-the-scenes story is less known.Pawlenty told ""Candidate Confessional"" that he came up with the idea of using the term “Obamneycare” as a way of pointing out that Romney’s health care plan in Massachusetts had been the model for President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act -- which, of course, conservatives have attempted to repeal countless times. His staff liked the awkward term. He had tried it out in a couple of speeches and a Sunday morning interview. Pawlenty planned to use it again during the debate. But the question ended up coming from a member of the audience -- not the moderator -- which complicated those plans. In debate prep, political consultants had instructed the governor that he had to do three things with each answer: 1) tailor his response to the person asking the question; 2) attack Obama; and 3) get around to answering the question, presumably by attacking Romney. He had to do all three things within the given time limits and look natural doing it.As Pawlenty worked his way through the three steps, the moderator, CNN's John King, started to grow audibly impatient. “I wasn’t through my three-point checklist yet,"" Pawlenty recalled. “[King] and I get in this back and forth. I’m off my three-point, you know, checklist and I should have just blurted out -- you know, yelled in the microphone -- yes, damnit, Obamneycare!""Instead, Pawlenty blinked. A lot. He repeated his criticisms of Obama, but he never did bellow the phrase. He came across looking, well, too Minnesota Nice.In the moment, Pawlenty didn’t fully appreciate how badly his flub stood out.“I thought the answer wasn’t great but I didn’t think it was awful,"" he said. ""But I remember during a break I was going to the bathroom or back to the dressing room for something ... I remember Nick [Ayers], my campaign manager, who I like a lot, was ashen standing back by one of the doors.""""And he’s like, 'You know you gotta fix this,'"" Pawlenty said. ""I’m like, ‘Fix what?’ He’s like, 'You know, the Obamneycare answer.'""But the topic didn't come up again. Instead, pundits and viewers were left with the image of Pawlenty hesitating to attack the man who would become the GOP nominee.Listen to the podcast above, or download it on iTunes.

Jeb Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), weighed in on the topic.“I have to admit, as I was sitting there listening to that conversation, my reaction was, ‘Are you guys nuts?’” Cruz said, according to Politico. “Listen, we have had enough with political correctness, especially in the military. Political correctness is dangerous. And the idea that we would draft our daughters to forcibly bring them into the military and put them in close combat, I think is wrong, it is immoral, and if I am president, we ain’t doing it.""At Saturday's Republican debate in Manchester, Bush, Christie and Rubio all indicated support for women registering with the Selective Service if necessary.""I have no problem whatsoever with people of either gender serving in combat so long as the minimum requirements necessary to do the job are not compromised,"" Rubio said. ""I support that. Now that that is the case, I do believe Selective Service should be opened up for both men and women in the case a draft is ever instituted.""Cruz says he opposed the notion of a draft for women because of his two young daughters.""I'm the father of two little girls. I love those girls with all of my heart. They are capable of doing anything their hearts' desire. But the idea that their government would forcibly put them in a foxhole with a 220-pound psychopath trying to kill them doesn't make any sense,"" he said.Last year, Cruz said he was open to reinstating the ban on openly LGBT military members known as ""don't ask, don't tell,"" which was repealed by the Obama administration.""We shouldn't view the military as a cauldron for social experiments,"" he said"

""After last night's debate, [people said], 'Oh, you said the same [thing] three or four times.' I'm going to say it again. The reason these things are in trouble is because Barack Obama is the first president, at least in my lifetime, that wants to change the country. Change the country! Not fix it, not fix its problems,"" Rubio told a crowd at a town hall event Sunday morning.It was his first public event since Saturday night's ABC News debate, where Rubio found himself a target after his third-place finish in the Iowa caucuses. It was a tough night for him. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), in particular, went after Rubio and questioned whether he has the experience necessary to be president. Christie called Rubio out for using the same attack over and over: ""And let's dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing.""""There it is. There it is. The memorized 25-second speech. There it is, everybody,"" Christie said, mocking him.At one point, the audience booed Rubio for using the same line over again. The Democratic super PAC American Bridge also did some of their own trolling of Rubio Sunday morning. A couple of staffers dressed as robots and stood outside his event and said, ""Domo arigato Marco Roboto!"" and repeated Rubio's debate line.Rubio also defended his repetition in an interview on ABC's ""This Week,"" saying he was fine that Democrats were highlighting his remarks.""Well, actually, I would pay them to keep running that clip because that's what I believe passionately,"" he said on the show Sunday morning.

Gloria Steinem made a misguided comment on Bill Maher's ""Real Time With Bill Maher"" on Friday night when discussing why many millennial women seem to be #FeelingTheBern. ""When you’re young, you’re thinking, 'Where are the boys?' The boys are with Bernie,"" she said.Let's assume that Steinem -- as a feminist icon who has spent much of her career lifting up the voices of younger women -- doesn't actually believe that millennials are only supporting a candidate to get a date. But regardless, the comment was tone-deaf, and as Mashable's Juana Summers pointed out, ignored young women who have zero romantic interest in men. (Update: Steinem has since apologized, saying she ""misspoke,"" and clarifying that, ""Whether they gravitate to Bernie or Hillary, young women are activist and feminist in greater numbers than ever before."")The rhetoric about women who support Sanders' Democratic opponent isn't any better. Many have implied that women of any age who support Hillary only do because of their gender. (And despite Sanders' 19-point lead among millennial women, there are still plenty of vocal young women who believe in Clinton's candidacy.) As Susan Sarandon said while campaigning for Sanders last month, ""I don't vote with my vagina.""But the idea that women who support Clinton are only moved to do so by their vaginas is just as absurd as the notion that young women who support Sanders are only moved by their libidos. In either scenario, young women are stripped of their agency as individuals with political opinions, interests and priorities. Sadly, the idea that young women voters are silly girls who can't be trusted to make thoughtful political decisions is a familiar trope. Fox correspondent Jesse Watters dismissed young, unmarried women as ""Beyoncé Voters"" in July 2014, saying that ""they depend on government because they’re not depending on their husbands."" In October 2014, Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle suggested that young women shouldn't vote at all because they ""don't get it.""The young women I know -- Democrat, Republican and Independent alike -- have fierce political convictions. And those who are considering where to place their votes in the Democratic primary race are carefully weighing their options.Some young women are resolute in their choices, like radio host and writer Jillian Gutowitz, who eloquently wrote in The Huffington Post about why she supports Clinton:Here's a woman -- Hillary -- who has spent years in the White House, has proven herself a powerful politician, and has the knowledge, platforms, passion, perspective and qualifications to back it up. She supports gay marriage, racial equality, narrowing the nation's wealth divide, Planned Parenthood, access to safe, legal abortions, eradicating the wage gap -- and she wants to rebuild and empower the middle class. Those are all the qualities I personally am looking for in a president.And Elite Daily writer Kelli Boyle, who did the same explaining her support for Sanders:[Sanders] wants to take down big banks, create a constitutional amendment that will eliminate the super PACs, make public colleges tuition-free through taxing stock transactions and provide paid maternity leave, just to name a few. I don’t know about you, but all of that sounds pretty f**king ideal.Others, myself included, are genuinely torn. There are things about Sanders that are incredibly appealing: His support of universal health care. His history of fighting to close the gender pay gap. And to a generation who came of age (and into the workforce) in the midst of a financial crisis, Sanders' brand of democratic socialism doesn't sound half bad. There are also things about Clinton that appeal to me. She has strong foreign policy experience. She has been a vocal opponent of the Hyde Amendment and a vocal proponent of gun control. She's been endorsed by Planned Parenthood. And, yes, she would make history as the first woman president of the United States in a world where representation really, truly matters. But regardless of how millennial women cast their votes, I feel confident that those decisions aren't being made lightly. (Or at least not any more lightly than the voting decisions made by the other men and women in this country.) Ultimately, candidates, their high-profile supporters and political commentators would be better served focusing on the needs of millennial women rather than making ignorant statements about their political motivations. Because -- newsflash! -- us ""Beyoncé voters"" are a pretty influential bunch. Also on HuffPost:"

Wade before she takes office -- something it may very well do by the end of June.And he did not ask for Clinton’s opinion of the recent indictment of the Center for Medical Progress in a case that began as an investigation of Planned Parenthood prompted by the dubious anti-abortion group’s misleading video.Nor did the ABC host ask Clinton to explain why she supports repealing the Hyde Amendment, a law prohibiting the use of federal funds for abortions that many advocates argue disproportionately harms low-income women.Instead, Stephanopoulos asked Clinton whether, as Sen. Rubio (R-Fla.) alleged Saturday night, she supports a woman’s right to get what conservatives call “partial-birth abortions” -- abortions involving dilation and extraction. Congress passed a law prohibiting the method in 2003 and the Supreme Court subsequently upheld the ban.Clinton, who as a senator voted against the 2003 law banning the procedures, initially did not answer the question, attacking Rubio instead for using the line of questioning to undermine reproductive rights more broadly.“It's really quite sad to see what Sen. Rubio is becoming in this campaign,” Clinton said. “Everybody understands that he is diving as far right as he possibly can. You know, I've been on record for many years about where I stand on abortion, how it should be safe and legal and I have the same position that I've had for a very long time.”Pressed again to clarify her position, Clinton appeared to confirm that she does not support restricting abortions of any kind. She cited her own experience meeting women who have undergone the procedures and the often difficult circumstances that led them to that decision.“You know, when he raises the, you know, very, very difficult issue of late-term abortion, he conveniently overlooks the fact that there are medical reasons, there are health-related reasons,” she said. “I've met women who have had to face this excruciating choice. This is not something that anyone that I've ever met with enters into without the deepest thought, the most careful consideration.”If Clinton’s answer was awkward, however, it may be because she was asked to discuss the Democratic priority of reproductive rights on distinctly Republican terms.Given that most late-term abortions remain illegal under federal law -- and even when they were legal, they made up a tiny fraction of all abortions performed -- it is not normally a topic at the forefront of the public agenda. Republicans like Rubio enjoy bringing it up, because it is the most controversial part of Clinton's and many other Democrats’ abortion rights platforms.There is nothing wrong with that. It is the nature of politics.What is surprising is that Democrats may have themselves to thank for having to field abortion questions that play to their weaknesses rather than their strengths.None of the Democratic candidates has brought up abortion or reproductive rights in any of the five presidential debates they have had so far.That has given Republicans an opening to set the terms of the discussion, as Stephanopoulos’ interview with Clinton shows.It is not as if Clinton is not speaking about reproductive rights in her stump speech. For example, she called for repealing the Hyde Amendment at a televised campaign rally in New Hampshire in January.But that just makes it all the more glaring that she has not brought the issue up unprompted during one of the debates when she had a chance to do so before an even bigger audience.Also on HuffPost:"
29,POLITICS,Clinton Interview Shows How Republicans Are Setting The Terms Of The Abortion Debate,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-interview-late-term-abortions_us_56b7723ee4b08069c7a79ff1,So-called partial-birth abortions are a topic of conversation again.,2016-02-07,"<span class=""big""><strong>MYTH:</strong></span> Abortion is dangerous.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55d355f41700006e00567c56.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"George Stephanopoulos asked Hillary Clinton to respond to Marco Rubio’s criticism of her record on ""partial-birth abortions"" on ABC’s “This Week,” reinserting reproductive rights into an election race dominated by other themes.But Stephanopoulos’ exchange Sunday with the Democratic presidential hopeful about abortion was most notable for what it did not cover.Stephanopoulos did not, for instance, ask about the fact that many women in Texas now must travel hundreds of miles to access an abortion -- a phenomenon that has driven up the rates of dangerous self-induced abortions.He did not ask how Clinton would respond if the Supreme Court significantly weakens Roe v. Wade before she takes office -- something it may very well do by the end of June.And he did not ask for Clinton’s opinion of the recent indictment of the Center for Medical Progress in a case that began as an investigation of Planned Parenthood prompted by the dubious anti-abortion group’s misleading video.Nor did the ABC host ask Clinton to explain why she supports repealing the Hyde Amendment, a law prohibiting the use of federal funds for abortions that many advocates argue disproportionately harms low-income women.Instead, Stephanopoulos asked Clinton whether, as Sen. Rubio (R-Fla.) alleged Saturday night, she supports a woman’s right to get what conservatives call “partial-birth abortions” -- abortions involving dilation and extraction. Congress passed a law prohibiting the method in 2003 and the Supreme Court subsequently upheld the ban.Clinton, who as a senator voted against the 2003 law banning the procedures, initially did not answer the question, attacking Rubio instead for using the line of questioning to undermine reproductive rights more broadly.“It's really quite sad to see what Sen.

30,POLITICS,Marco Rubio's Super PAC Takes Aim At 90-Year-Old Barbara Bush In Provocative Mailer,Scott Conroy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marco-rubios-super-pac-barbara-bush-mailer_us_56b77d75e4b04f9b57d9fb79,"Apparently, not even the candidates' moms are off-limits in New Hampshire.",2016-02-07,"A Marco Rubio super PAC mailer takes aim at Jeb Bush's family, including his 90-year-old mother. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56b77e081f00000d012177ce.jpeg?cache=At3FbxwUzH&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BEDFORD, N.H. -- The Republican presidential race has gotten so heated that not even the candidates’ moms are off-limits anymore. With two days to go until the New Hampshire primary, a voter who lives in this heavily Republican town provided HuffPost with a jarring direct mailer that he received from Conservative Solutions PAC -- the super PAC that is backing Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.).The mailing features a photo of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) wearing a superimposed golden crown and pictured next to the bejeweled and white-haired Queen Elizabeth II, who bears an obvious resemblance to the candidate’s mother, Barbara Bush.And in case the intended link between the current queen of England and former first lady wasn't clear enough, the mailer includes an old quote from Jeb Bush's mother below the photo of Queen Elizabeth: ""'We’ve had enough Bushes.' --Barbara Bush.""The provocative mailer -- which is headlined ""What happened to the ‘Coronation’ of Jeb Bush?’"" -- also features images of Henry VIII and the Burger King mascot. The suggestion that these two characters are stand-ins for Jeb Bush’s father and brother -- both former presidents -- is equally clear.“Most pundits claimed Bush/Clinton general election match up was inevitable,” reads the back of the Rubio super PAC mailer. “They said the 2016 election would be a choice between these 2 dynasties.”The mailer then lists what it refers to as Jeb Bush’s “failed policies” and “liberal ideas from the past.”Barbara Bush, 90, was in New Hampshire last week to campaign for her son. She powered through a snowstorm and handed out Bush bumper stickers from the pouch of her walker as she took some shots at Donald Trump.“Cute,” Bush communications director Tim Miller said when shown the Rubio super PAC mailer. “But after all his whining about negativity, you’d think Marco would at least have some respect for a woman who has served this country with such distinction.”""To say these famous monarchs and fast food legends symbolize real people requires a leap of royal proportions,"" Conservative Solutions PAC spokesman Jeff Sadosky said.A Rubio campaign spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.This story has been updated to include comment from Rubio's super PAC.Update 2/8 -- During an appearance on “CBS This Morning” on Monday, host Norah O’Donnell asked Rubio about the mailer.“Senator, should Barbara Bush’s 90-year-old mother be off-limits in this campaign, and do you denounce that mailer that your PAC sent?” O’Donnell asked.“Sure,” Rubio replied. “Well, first of all, I haven’t seen that mailer. And second of all, it’s not from my campaign. And the third thing I would say: We’re now at a stage where I’ve had, I don’t know, $35 million of attack ads run against me, many from Jeb Bush’s super PAC. We’re down to the final moments here. I have tremendous respect for the Bush family.”"
31,POLITICS,Everyone Ganged Up On Marco Rubio At Saturday's GOP Debate,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-debate-new-hampshire_us_56b6ae10e4b01d80b24696c4,And Rubio didn't do himself any favors.,2016-02-07,Marco Rubio was a target among GOP candidates at Saturday night's debate in New Hampshire.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56b6bf1e1a00002d00ab2238.jpeg?cache=fwuPPi5npL&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Marco Rubio doesn’t lead in any of the polls, but that didn’t stop his presidential rivals from going after the Florida senator during Saturday night's debate as the candidates battled to be the GOP establishment’s less crazy alternative to Donald Trump.In one of the sharpest back-and-forths of the entire 2016 campaign, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie pilloried Rubio for his over-reliance on canned talking points -- and the attack was super-effective.When Christie went after the senator for a lack of accomplishments, Rubio criticized Christie’s record as governor and then, as he often does, moved to a broader argument against President Barack Obama.The moderators were ready to move on, but Christie wasn't having it.""You see, everybody, I want the people at home to think about this. That's what Washington, D.C., does,"" Christie said. ""The drive-by shot at the beginning with incorrect and incomplete information, and then the memorized 25-second speech that is exactly what his advisers gave him.” The crowd went nuts.Rubio responded with a shot at Christie for his reluctance to return to New Jersey for a snowstorm that then turned into a criticism of Obama, and Christie pointed out that, once again, Rubio had proved his point.“There it is,” Christie said. “There it is. The memorized 25-second speech.”Incredibly, Rubio fell into Christie’s trap for a third time and, after some spirited crosstalk, Christie concluded that Rubio “gets very unruly when he gets off his talking points.”It was undoubtedly Christie's strongest moment in any debate -- and Rubio's weakest.Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush also landed some shots against Rubio, presenting his fellow Florida Republican as too inexperienced.""Look, let's be clear,"" Bush said. ""Marco Rubio is a gifted, gifted politician, and he may have the skills to be a president of the United States, but we've tried it the old way with Barack Obama, with soaring eloquence and we got -- we didn't get a leader; we got someone who wants to divide the country up.""While candidates repeatedly swung at Rubio, they largely ignored Trump. The dirty secret for this round is that most in the field can extend their campaigns if Trump wins in New Hampshire. But if Rubio were to overtake the reality TV star, it would be a signal that Republicans have finally coalesced behind a candidate, and a cue for the others to get out of the race.When the moderators started off the debate by giving Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas) a minute to criticize Trump’s temperament -- something Cruz has subtly done on the campaign trail time and time again -- the lawmaker largely passed on the opportunity, saying the temperament question is something voters have to ask themselves.Cruz deferred from attacking Trump so much that Trump ended up attacking Cruz for not answering the question.Bush did clash with Trump, as he has done in many previous debates, but his attacks continued to be less about trying to win over prospective Trump voters and more about appealing to voters who are already fiercely against Trump’s brash style and offensive policies.The most direct exchange between the two men came on eminent domain, an issue of some concern to voters in a state whose motto is “Live Free Or Die.” Trump defended the practice of the government taking over private land so that public works like roads or the Keystone XL pipeline could be built. But Bush attacked Trump for using eminent domain to build “limousine parking lots” for his casinos.In a reversal of their normal roles, Trump seemed uncharacteristically rattled by Bush, and he ended up attacking the crowd, calling out the Republican National Committee for loading the audience with rich donors who opposed him.The bizarre strategy only drew more boos from the crowd as Trump moved from bullying his fellow candidates to a new era in the race, where Trump isn't the singular news, even if he's bashing voters.In his return to the stage after sitting out the Fox News debate, Trump wasn't the center-ring circus show that he's normally been during Republican debates. Instead, the Rubio-Christie exchange dominated the night.The other candidates on the stage struggled to deliver a memorable moment in the final days before the New Hampshire primary. Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who is polling between second and fourth in the state, stayed mostly positive Saturday night. And other candidates in the establishment lane refused to go after Kasich, even when the moderators lobbed them easy opportunities.Presented with negative comments from Kasich about Christie's record, the New Jersey governor praised Kasich.""He deserves credit for his record on jobs,"" Christie said. ""He's done a very good job as governor of Ohio.""Cruz, fresh off his Iowa win but still a good 20 percentage points behind Trump in New Hampshire polls, also struggled to find a breakthrough moment during the debate. Cruz continued to face criticism from retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who has been hitting Cruz for dirty tactics in Iowa. Carson characterized the Cruz campaign phone calls just before the Iowa caucuses that claimed Carson was suspending his campaign as ""Washington ethics.""Cruz once again apologized for the calls -- ""Ben, I'm sorry"" -- and then largely blamed his misinformation on CNN's reports about Carson, even though the network had only reported Carson was taking a break before New Hampshire.Jennifer Bendery contributed to this report.Read the latest on the GOP debate below:"
