Suddenly, the comparisons to Stephen Curry are flying in hot and loud. As unfair as it is to link a 22-year-old shooting guard to the reigning NBA MVP, it'd also be a disservice not to adorn him with comparisons as well.After all, in some ways, Hield is having a better NCAA Tournament run than Curry did during his own iconic turn as a sophomore at Davidson in 2008, when he dropped 40, 30, 33 and 25 points against Gonzaga, Georgetown, Wisconsin and Kansas, respectively, nearly leading his Cinderella squad to the Final Four.While Curry was amazing, Hield's run is even more impressive once you consider how efficiently he has played. In that respect, he has eclipsed 2008 Curry, which is especially impressive considering 2016 Curry is eight games away from posting the most efficient NBA season ever.When comparing Hield's 2016 March Madness performances against Curry's 2008, there's not much separating the look of their games and their top-line numbers. Their quick strokes and similar games let them score in comparable bunches -- 32 points per game for Curry in 2008 and 29.3 points per game for Hield so far this tournament. On Saturday, Hield also became the first player since Curry to score 100 points and hit over 15 3-pointers before the Final Four, and the first player to average over 25 points per game going into the Final Four since 1990 -- a distinction Curry would have earned had his Wildcats not fallen to Kansas 59-57 in the Elite Eight. Look at the numbers behind the numbers, however, and you'll begin to appreciate just how efficient Hield has become. Curry shot 46.7 percent from the field and 44.8 percent from three in 2008 -- impressive numbers on their own, but slightly less gaudy when compared to the 56.7 percent from the field and 47.5 percent from three that the unconscious Hield is currently shooting. To appreciate the percentages, we have to get away from them: Curry took 90 shots to score 128 points in his four games, while Hield's taken only 67 shots to hit 117 total points. A difference of 23 shots is nearly an entire game's worth of shooting, and it has led to almost a 10 percent difference in the pair's true shooting percentage, a metric that accounts for all of a player's shot attempts. Hield, possessing some sort of robotic shooting stroke, has a true shooting percentage of 72.8 percent, while Curry's 2008 percentage was 63.1; an impressive percentage, but again, nothing compared to Hield's.To put that into perspective, that 9.1 percent gap is the difference between shooting like Kevin Durant and shooting like Zach LaVine.There are a few simple explanations for Hield's superiority. Compared to Curry, he gets to the free-throw line a bit more (28 attempts for Hield against Curry's 24), makes more of his 3-pointers and shoots way fewer of them -- Curry took 12 more 3-point shots in 2008 (52 versus Hield's 40), but Hield has only made three fewer in total (19 versus Curry's 22 makes).But individual basketball statistics are also a product of how one functions within a team, and that's where we should give Curry some credit. Hield has playmakers like Jordan Woodard and Isaiah Cousins to his left and right, while Davidson relied heavily on Curry for the bulk of their shot attempts, with guard Jason Richards providing the only other outlet on the perimeter in the 2008 Wildcat offense. With a better team around him, Hield can one-up Curry in another big way: by winning a National Championship. By necessity, Curry had to do more, but Hield's efficiency is also a credit to his improved ability off the bounce and inside the paint. Just look at how he made his defender short-circuit on Saturday before draining this jumper: This is where we should note that there are really more similarities between the two players than differences. To even reach these lofty March Madness heights and shed presumptive overachiever tags, Hield and Curry have had to maximize their talent through logging long hours in the gym. Both are undersized for their position and have seen their respective NBA prospects slighted by so-called experts. For Curry's part, his shot has gotten better every year of his career. Hield, who was an atrocious 23.8 percent 3-point shooter as a freshman, reportedly puts up 500-700 shots a day after practice -- the kind of work ethic that gets you noticed by notorious workout warrior Kobe Bryant. In many ways, they are more alike than different. Much like Curry in the 2009 NBA Draft, Hield's seemingly week-to-week improvements have bumped him from a borderline first-round pick and future D-Leaguer into draft lottery consideration.Who knows where Hield's NBA career will go. But even if he doesn't become the next Stephen Curry in the NBA, he's already become it in college -- and then some."

For 30 days, inmates and staff at Pugsley Correctional Facility squared off with those at the Oaks Correctional Facility in Michigan in a contest to collect the most water for the students at Genesee County's Intermediate School District in Flint. The contest recently ended and altogether, the facilities collected a whopping 29,000 bottles for the students. And though Pugsley Correctional Facility collected more water, they weren't the true winners. ""It wasn't us that won. It wasn't Oaks that won. This is going to those kids at ISD in Genesee County. They won,"" Robert Gauthier, general office assistant at Pugsley who came up with the idea, told UpNorthLive.com. James Dawson, an administrative assistant at Pugsley, told The Huffington Post that staff members contributed by reaching out to people in the community for water donations. They also got a local grocery store involved to add to the drive. Inmates at the facility donated money, contributing a total of around $600 toward the initiative -- a huge amount, especially considering their income. ""It's a lot of money when you're making $1.17 a day or making $.26 an hour,"" Gauthier told UpNorthLive.com of the inmates' contribution. ""So from that end of it they dug deeper than [we did].""In addition to assisting with the project financially, prisoners also helped load water onto trucks to be stored in a warehouse until the bottles are sent to the schools. The prisons had collected so much water by the end of the contest that the school district didn't have enough room to take on the enormous donation, so the facilities are sending their water to the schools in shifts. The success of the contest, Dawson said, shows that the inmates truly wanted to look out for those going through this rough time. ""I think the numbers speak for themselves. To have $600 dollars collected from them when they had very limited money and resources -- that speaks volumes,"" Dawson said. ""[It shows] that they're willing to give back to the community instead of themselves."" Oaks Correctional Facility sent the water it collected to the school district last Thursday, while Pugsley will be sending its haul on April 12. "

Users are surrounded by 3D cameras and then given HoloLens, or specialized headpieces that allow them to see other users in real time, explains Partner Research Manager Shahram Izadi in a video tutorial the company posted to YouTube last week. In a four-minute demonstration, Izadi first is visited by an assistant's 3D image. They interact with each other directly -- even move to give each other a high five -- although their bodies are in different rooms.Next, a 3D image of Izadi’s daughter appears. In real life, she is playing with dolls in another room. She can't see her dad because she isn't wearing a HoloLens, but she can hear him and respond to him -- and he can plainly see the image of her and her toys as if they're in the room with him. After saying goodbye to his daughter, Izadi shows off one more element of the technology: Not only can he replay their interaction, but he can shrink down the 3D images until they look like tiny, moving figurines.Excited YouTube users were quick to comment on the vast possibilities of using holoportation, with many bringing up how it could change porn in the future. The one catch, however, is that users can't touch each other — for now, at least."

Calamari of the Securities and Exchange Commission said in a release.Caspersen was fired on Monday and PJT was cooperating with law enforcement after reporting the scheme to prosecutors, the company said in a statement. Until last year, PJT had been part of private equity giant Blackstone’s advisory business.A lawyer for Caspersen did not immediately return calls for comment. PJT and Blackstone also did not return calls for comment.Caspersen’s alleged scheme was basically a cartoon version of Wall Street fraud: Authorities say he told an unidentified hedge fund employee that he was raising money for an $80 million fund for private equity firms that wanted to buy investors' stakes in other private equity funds. He allegedly said he had already raised $30 million.The hedge fund employee wired over $24.6 million from the hedge fund’s charity and another $400,000 in personal funds. When Caspersen got the money, he reportedly used $8 million to try to cover up funds he had taken without authorization from PJT and moved the rest into his personal brokerage account -- and in less than two months, seemingly lost it all trading stock options.After a few months, authorities say, Caspersen asked for another $20 million from the same hedge fund's charitable foundation. He also allegedly created a fake email address connected to a fake domain name for a fake employee at a real private equity firm that Caspersen falsely said was using his fake fund.The hedge fund investor called the private equity firm in question and was informed that the invented employee didn’t work there. Separately, Caspersen reportedly tried to get another private equity firm to invest $50 million in his fake fund, which it declined to do.By the time the hedge fund foundation asked for its money back, it was gone, and the fund has not yet received any payment. Caspersen “will now have to answer to federal securities and wire fraud charges,"" said Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York."

5,SCIENCE,Manmade Earthquakes Are Putting Even More Of The Country At Risk,Lydia O'Connor,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/human-induced-earthquake-report_us_56f959a0e4b014d3fe239339,You're more likely to experience a damaging earthquake this year if you live in Oklahoma than if you live in California.,2016-03-28,"Gary Landra stands on a crack across his basement floor that he says was caused by an earthquake in Prague, Oklahoma. A new report from the USGS says that north-central Oklahoma has the country's highest risk of experiencing a damaging earthquake in 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56f98b88150000ad000b352d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This is the first USGS hazard report to factor in manmade earthquakes.Millions of Americans live in areas that could be affected by manmade earthquakes in the next year, according a new assessment from the U.S. Geological Survey. The oil and gas industry's wastewater disposal methods are putting about 7 million people at risk, the federal agency announced Monday in an earthquake hazard report. It's common for companies to dispose of a drilling byproduct called wastewater by injecting it underground. This practice puts additional pressure on faults in the ground and drives them apart, scientists have observed. ""By including human-induced events, our assessment of earthquake hazards has significantly increased in parts of the United States,"" Mark Petersen, chief of the USGS National Seismic Hazard Mapping Project, said in a call with reporters Monday. This was the first USGS report to consider risks posed by both natural and human-induced quakes. Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas are the states most at risk, he added. California has long been considered the nation's earthquake capital. However, factoring in manmade quakes gives north-central Oklahoma the highest risk of experiencing a damaging earthquake this year, with a 12 percent chance. A 5.1-magnitude earthquake already struck the area last month, although it's unclear whether wastewater injection triggered the quake. However, wastewater injection did lead to a 5.7-magnitude quake in the area in 2011, the USGS determined. The risk shouldn't come as a surprise to residents in most of these regions. The report notes that the rate of earthquakes first began increasing in the Central and Eastern United States in 2010 -- a phenomenon other studies have linked to increased wastewater injection in deep disposal wells in those regions. Most of the shaking would cause only slight damage or cracking, Petersen said, but there is a chance that the 21 areas they identified could face more extensive damage.While current research suggests that these human-induced quakes may have lower maximum magnitudes than traditional quakes, some scientists think these manmade quakes could contribute to larger earthquakes on natural fault lines. ""We are using the best available data and principles to determine when, where and how strong the ground could shake from induced earthquakes,"" Petersen said in a release accompanying the study. ""Of course there is a level of uncertainty associated with this and all hazard maps, as we are still learning about their behavior and can only forecast with probability—instead of predict with certainty—where earthquakes are likely to occur in the future. Testing these maps after a year will be important in validating and improving the models."" "

The last time we saw the Fines and Sheffields together was in the Lifetime's 2004 special, ""A Nosh to Remember,"" so it's been 12 years too long without Drescher's iconic cackle. Thankfully, Shaughnessy shared some photos of the reunion on social media to celebrate Taylor's 83rd birthday. ""An evening with the mother in law! Happy Birthday Renee!!"" he captioned a pic of himself, Drescher and Taylor smiling together. He later shared two more photos to commemorate the occasion. Shaughnessy and Drescher last shared the screen in Drescher's now defunct sitcom ""Happily Divorced,"" where the British actor guest starred as a love interest for her character. In fact, the TV Land series often paid tribute to ""The Nanny"" including former cast members like Shaughnessy and Taylor, as well as regular winks and nods to Drescher's former role. For Drescher, however, ""The Nanny"" remains a high point in her career, not only because it secured her a spot in the sitcom hall of fame (Is that a thing? It should be a thing), but because the series allowed Drescher to put her many talents to use. ""I like doing more than just acting. I like to write, I like to produce, I like to have opinions about sets and casting and costumes. Everything,"" she told Biography in 2015. ""What was extremely gratifying for me was that I was able to make a contribution on all those levels and, ultimately, the success of the show itself.""Ah, Fran, how we've missed you. "

While we've updated to iOS 9.3 on an iPhone 6S without issue, we did experience the problem on a regular iPhone 6. Links in Apple's Messages app, the Safari browser and the basic Mail app do nothing when tapped following the update. Restarting the phone doesn't fix the problem, and apps appear to be freezing and crashing more than normal.Many users are experiencing problems like this following the iOS 9.3 update, The Next Web noted Sunday. It's not clear why the issue affects some devices and not others. Apple did not respond to requests for comment from The Huffington Post. But a HuffPost employee experiencing the glitch on a personal device talked to Apple tech support and was told that a fix should be coming in the next few days. Until that happens, you'd probably be wise to avoid updating your iPhone or iPad.That's kind of a shame -- it's usually best to update your smartphone's software when you can, because those updates bring new features and security fixes. Holding off on updating your iPhone can lead to problems, as apps will eventually require the latest version of iOS to function. If you're too far behind the update cycle when that happens, updating can be a miserable, lengthy affair.Of course, that's not to say it's a great system. Updates are partially to blame for your phone slowing down after a couple of years, which helps steer you toward buying an entirely new device. And, as we're seeing now, these updates sometimes contain flaws that need to be patched up later.The best practice? Update your phone, but not right away: Give everyone else a week or two to test the new version out so you can avoid glitches like this one.

Government employees, a la Kim Davis, could refuse to file official forms for same-sex couples.Supporters of the bill have said it's meant to protect religious freedom, and Deal was careful not to disparage the bill's advocates. But he clearly had frustrations with people on both sides of the debate. The bill drew tremendous backlash from businesses, athletic organizations, people in the entertainment industry and people of faith nationwide. Companies like Salesforce and Disney, the latter of which brings in hundreds of millions of dollars to the state's economy, had vowed to take their business elsewhere if the bill became law.""For those in the religious community, some of whom have resorted to insults that question my convictions and my character, and to those within the business community, some of whom -- not all by any stretch -- have resorted to threats of withdrawing jobs from our state, they should know, I do not respond very well to insults or threats,"" he said.Deal said the bottom line was that he didn't think the bill was necessary. He said he wasn't aware of ""a single instance"" where someone's religious freedom was threatened by a same-sex couple seeking service from a taxpayer-funded organization.""The people of Georgia deserve a leader who will make judgments based on solid reasons that are not inflamed by emotion, and that is what I intend and have tried to do,"" he said. ""As I stated before, I do not think that we have to discriminate against anyone to protect the faith-based community in Georgia.""People who had criticized the bill spent Monday morning celebrating on Twitter. Marc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce, even offered a cartoon version of himself.Conservative leaders, meanwhile, vowed to keep fighting to pass similar legislation.UPDATE: March 29 -- The White House said Tuesday that Deal made the right decision.""The citizens of Georgia, advocates and business leaders across the state made their voices heard regarding the potential harmful impact of this legislation on LGBT Americans. Governor Deal listened to those concerns and made a well-informed decision,"" White House spokesman Jeff Tiller said. ""We will continue to revere religious freedom and insist that Americans be afforded the equal protection of the law and treated equally, regardless of who they are or who they love."""
13,POLITICS,Bernie Sanders’ Campaign Claims He Didn’t Compete In States He Actually Competed In,Samantha Lachman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-campaign_us_56f98f5ae4b0a372181aa375,He spent time in states his team says he didn't really contest.,2016-03-28,Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) says he will stay in the Democratic presidential primary all the way to the convention this summer. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56f98fd61e000095007117cf.jpeg?ops=crop_0_602_3360_1638%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign press call Monday was billed as one to discuss his “path forward” to the Democratic nomination, but his team made some dubious claims about why he’s trailing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton among delegates in the process. Clinton currently leads the Vermont senator by 268 pledged delegates, 1,243 to 975. Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ campaign manager, said on the call that their campaign chose not to compete in eight of the 32 states that have held primaries or caucuses so far. Weaver identified Texas, Alabama, Virginia, Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, Georgia and Louisiana as the states where they didn’t mount a challenge to Clinton, who swept all of the Southern contests; he said the Sanders campaign did not broadcast television advertisements in those eight states or have “a big campaign presence.” “Almost all of Secretary Clinton’s delegate lead come from states where she faced little or no competition,” said Tad Devine, Sanders’ senior campaign strategist. “Her grasp now on the nomination is almost entirely on the basis of victories in states where Bernie Sanders did not compete.” Devine and Weaver's claim depends on one’s definition of the word “compete” during the Southern primaries, where Clinton netted over 300 delegates. Sanders held rallies in Austin and Dallas. He held multiple events in Virginia. He held rallies in Atlanta, Georgia. He also visited Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. His campaign had field offices in most of those states. If he wasn’t actually competing in the South, where his campaign always acknowledged he faced an uphill battle because of Clinton’s popularity among African-American voters, then why bother visiting? Devine pointed to Sanders’ victories in the Hawaii, Alaska and Washington caucuses on Saturday to advance their argument that Clinton’s delegate lead isn’t as significant as it seems. “Last weekend is a testament to the fact that where we compete with Hillary Clinton, where this competition is real, we have a very good chance of beating her in every single place that we compete with her,” he said. “In states where both campaigns have competed, Secretary Clinton has an edge in delegates but only a slight edge.”His campaign’s dismissal of his losses in the Southern primaries also doesn’t account for Clinton’s wins in Ohio, South Carolina, Massachusetts, Arizona, North Carolina and Florida, which Sanders visited multiple times and where his campaign ran television ads.The rhetoric about not competing in the South is at odds with Sanders’ own argument that the Democratic Party should advance “a 50-state strategy” and Sanders’ comment after the Nevada caucus that his campaign would “be competing in 11 states all across this country on Super Tuesday.” Weaver said on the call that “reports of our death are greatly exaggerated” and that the campaign would be making “a big commitment” to delegate-rich states like New York, which holds its primary next month. “People are going to look very closely at this competition, and look at whether Hillary Clinton has proven to be a very strong nominee,” Devine said. “If you want to be the nominee of the Democratic Party, you have to consistently prove to the Democratic Party your strength, your ability to coalesce the party behind your candidacy.” Clinton’s campaign rebutted Weaver and Devine’s comments in a call with reporters Monday afternoon. “I seem to recall him campaigning quite a bit in Texas,” said Joel Benenson, Clinton’s chief strategist and pollster. “If you want to write off states that are battleground states, like Florida and North Carolina, if you don’t want to compete in battleground states like those and Virginia that are essential to winning an electoral college, to me that’s not how you set yourself up to win a general election. You compete hard in the states that are going to be the toughest for us to win in a general election because you want to get your people mobilized, you want to get them engaged.” Benenson argued that Sanders’ victories in most of the states that hold caucuses are less significant because turnout in those states tends to be lower than in primaries. “She has won in 17 of the 21 states where more than 7 percent of eligible voters turned out, when voters are coming out to the polls she has been dominating,” he said. “I think Sen. Sanders admittedly has had significant wins in caucus states, but in a lot of those states the turnout has been lower than primary states, and in many of those states they are less diverse than the rest of the country and less diverse than the coalition Democrats have to assemble to succeed in November.” "

Starting Monday, about 500 employees of the Qatar-backed company will be laid off.In a statement on Sunday, Al Jazeera described the mass layoffs as a “workforce optimization initiative” in response to “the ongoing transformation of the media landscape.”“While our decision is consistent with those being made across the media industry worldwide, it was difficult to make nonetheless,” said Mostefa Souag, acting director general of Al Jazeera Media Network. ”However, we are confident it is the right step to ensure the network's long-term competitiveness and reach.”The layoffs will impact employees worldwide, but the “majority” of the cuts will be at the company’s headquarters in the Qatari capital of Doha.According to CNN Money, the cutbacks were “a result of budget cuts ... tied to the falling price of oil,” as Qatar is “highly dependent on oil and gas revenues.”“The Qatar government is much leaner than before,"" one staffer in Doha told CNN.In January, Al Jazeera America said it would be shutting down its operations in the United States by the end of April. “It’s journalism, so everything’s unstable and you kind of roll with it,” one stunned employee told HuffPost at the time. “But there was no indication that this sort of thing was coming.”The shuttering of Al Jazeera America will reportedly result in the elimination of about 700 jobs. Combined with the layoffs announced on Sunday, the company will be losing about a third of its staff. "

Shah, 40, died from his injuries after he was stabbed in what Scottish police are calling a ""religiously prejudiced"" attack. A 32-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the death. Both Shah and his alleged assailant are Muslim, BBC reported.On the day of the attack, Shah had posted a message on Facebook wishing his ""beloved Christian nation"" a happy Easter and Good Friday. Community members mourned Shah in two separate vigils over the Easter weekend in Glasgow's Shawlands district, where his shop is located. Hundreds of people came to pay their respects, including Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon. Jen Bannerman, a woman who says she regularly visited Shah's shop and knew him well, set up an online fundraiser with her friends to support the family he tragically left behind. ""He was a warm and [friendly] man and he always went out of his way to make time to talk to you -- he was more than just our local shopkeeper. He was a friend to many,"" Bannerman wrote, noting all funds raised will be transferred to Shah's family soon. ""We know money will never make up for his loss,"" she wrote, ""but this is our way of showing our support for him, and showing his family how much he was cared for in our [community]."" As of Monday afternoon, more than 4,000 friends and strangers had donated to the fundraiser. Several people left touching messages about Shah. ""I don't know why or how anyone could ever want to hurt you, you were the most gentle, loving, compassionate and happy person I've ever known,"" wrote a donor named Jonathan Shirley. ""I used to come into your shop for my gran to pick up messages for her and no matter how long I hadn't been in for you'd always remember me.""Beyond Shah's friendly nature, many people remembered him for his dedication to his faith and his religious tolerance.""We spoke a number of times about faith and it was always very clear that his Islamic faith meant the world to him,"" wrote Graham Richmond, another donor. ""However, it was also very clear that he had deep respect for the faith of others, an attitude that is a lesson for everyone in this city where religious intolerance borders on a national sport at times.""Two days after Shah was killed, Humza Yousaf, Scotland's only Muslim minister, tweeted a damning message about sectarianism. Support for Shah and his family has also flooded Twitter in the days following his death. The hashtag #ThisIsNotWhoWeAre was created to honor Shah's legacy of respect for people of all faiths and religions."
