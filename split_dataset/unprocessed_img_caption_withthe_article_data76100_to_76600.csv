Estimates suggest that among women who know they are pregnant, 15 to 20 out of every 100 will miscarry. Furthermore, 1 out of every 160 deliveries in the United States ends in stillbirth. And yet many parents grieving the loss of a pregnancy or new baby report feeling utterly alone. ""Women are reporting feeling a sense of shame, self blame, guilt and definitely isolation after experiences of pregnancy and infant loss,"" mom and psychologist Jessica Zucker, the creator a line of empathy cards for families who've experienced a loss, recently told The Huffington Post. Here, in honor of Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Month, are three other incredible organizations helping families cope with the tragedy of losing a baby and, hopefully, feel a little less alone. Molly BearsIn late May, 2010, Bridgette Crews noticed she had not felt her usually very active daughter-to-be kick her in hours. That night, she went to the hospital to ensure that her baby girl -- whom she planned on naming Molly -- was doing well. Instead, Crews and her husband received the devastating news that Molly had died from a knot in her umbilical cord. Crews was 34 weeks pregnant at the time.After Molly's death, one of Crews' friends -- whose mother worked for a San Diego hospice and who understood the physical longing new moms feel toward their babies -- brought her a teddy bear that weighed three pounds. Desperate to feel the precise weight of the baby she'd dreamt of cradling in her arms, Crews stuffed the bear with rice until it weighed four pounds, nine ounces -- just as Molly had. That night, Crews was able to get some sleep for the first time in weeks, holding the bear close.""I'm sure she had no idea just how powerful and inspirational her gift would be,"" Crews told The Huffington Post. ""It's because of her gift, and my need for exactly 4 pounds, 9 ounces to be in my arms, that Molly Bears came about.""Crews officially launched Molly Bears -- a nonprofit that makes custom, weighted bears for families who've lost a baby -- in August 2010. To date, the group has created nearly 10,000 bears for families coping with a loss, and have roughly 1,000 bears on their waiting list, Crews told HuffPost. (Molly Bears opens up for a limited number of new orders on the 30th of every month. Orders cost $20, though the average cost of each bear, including shipping, generally runs around $45, the organization says. It relies on donations to help with things like shipping costs.)""Families cuddle with them, take family pictures, bring them on vacation [and] display them proudly in their homes,"" said Crews who, at the time she spoke with HuffPost, was carrying twins for one of Molly Bears' volunteer bear makers. ""These bears give families a truly tangible way to represent their babies.""StillbirthdayStillbirthday aims to be a global network offering many avenues of support to families coping with a loss, but its primary effort is to train doulas -- essentially, assistants who provide women with physical and emotional support before, during and after birth -- in the art of bereavement care. Its founder, Heidi Faith, had been a practicing doula prior to losing her own pregnancy in her first trimester.""Even [with my training], I was ill-prepared,"" Faith told HuffPost.""When you find out that your baby is not alive, every moment feels impossible,"" she continued. ""How do you get up from the ultrasound table? It's impossible. How do you breathe? How do you tell your spouse? How do you drive home? It's impossible. I can't even convey it.""Stillbirthday's website provides practical information for women and families, tackling issues like what a birth plan might look like for a woman experiencing pregnancy loss, how to announce a birth and death and how to handle the fact that many women still lactate after losing a pregnancy or baby. It also helps connect them with doulas who have completed the eight-week training needed to receive the group's certification. The training provides them with what Faith calls the ""skilled love"" required to help women and families throughout the process, and after. The doulas tend to come from two camps, Faith told HuffPost: birth professionals, such as doulas, midwives, doctors, ultrasound technicians who want to learn more about helping women and families in this difficult time; and women who have experienced the loss themselves. (The group has an affiliation with Christian Services LLC and Faith, herself, is a Christian, but Stillbirthday-trained doulas are autonomous, and Faith said the group caters to all faiths and backgrounds.)And while doulas can help women and families with many practical, day-to-day challenges, Faith said the ultimate goal runs far deeper -- granting them the permission to go slow in a moment of crisis and chaos. ""When you go through something like this, you feel like, 'I need you to literally carry me into the next moment, because I can't move,'"" Faith said. ""That's what we do. We bring all of it, everything, to a screeching halt ... the medical community sometimes hits fast forward, and says, 'This is what we're going to do now that your baby is not alive.' We say, 'It's OK to go slow.'""Now I Lay Me Down To SleepOne of the more prominent non-profits working in the area of pregnancy and infant loss, Now I Lay Me Down To Sleep provides free, professional photo portraits to parents suffering the loss of a baby. In February, 2005, co-founder Cheryl Haggard's son, Maddux Achilles Haggard, was born with a condition known as myotubular myopathy, which prevented him from breathing or moving on his own and led to his parents' wrenching decision to pull him from life support six days later. Fortunately, his parents had the foresight to ask a professional photographer -- Sandy Puc -- to come in and capture images of their beloved baby before and after he was removed from the hospital machinery. Several months later, Haggard and Puc started Now I Lay Me Down To Sleep, which now has 1,700 volunteer photographers throughout the United States and the world. Photographers are generally available to families within just a few hours, though it can take up to 12 hours in some cases, the non-profit says. Photographers donate their time and services, so there is no cost to families for the photos, which are often the few images families have of their children.""We have photographed more than 30,000 families over the last 10 years,"" Gina Harris, the organization's CEO told The Huffington Post. ""Usually the nurses offer the services or the parents know about us from the media or social media.""""I was unsure if I wanted images due to the great emotional pain I was in,"" one couple says on the organization's website, ""[but] the private portrait session was done with the utmost care, patience, sensitivity and love. No one ever felt as though someone was there to just take ‘pictures’ ... you were there with us during the last moments while we held our daughter in our arms.""Also on HuffPost:"

3,POLITICS,One Reason Paul Ryan Is Reluctant To Run For House Speaker: His Kids,Marina Fang,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-speaker_us_56171cfee4b0e66ad4c745b8,Ryan said last month the speaker's job would require too much time away from his wife and three children.,2015-10-09,"Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan (C) with his wife Janna Ryan (2nd R), mother Betty Douglas (R) and children Sam, Charlie and Liza wave after Ryan's speech at the Tampa Bay Times Forum in Tampa, Florida, on August 29, 2012 during the Republican National Convention.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56171d7b1400002b003c7d7c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) abruptly withdrew from the race to replace outgoing Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) on Thursday, many GOP representatives turned to Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) as their only hope to unite the party.But Ryan, the Ways and Means chairman and 2012 vice presidential nominee, insisted he's not interested. One reason that he has frequently cited: his kids. Ryan has three young children and goes back to his hometown of Janesville, Wisconsin, every weekend to spend time with his family.Even as rumors swirled on Thursday night that Ryan was reconsidering, his colleagues said a major hurdle was strains that the notoriously rigorous job would place on Ryan's family.“He’s got small kids. He’s a family guy. He goes home every weekend. And that job is really, really tough and very demanding,” Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) said.“This is a job where you are expected to be on the road about a hundred days a year,” Ryan said in September. “Our kids are 10, 12 and 13, and I’m not going to do that.”Ryan already has more responsibilities than the average congressman, due to his position as chair of one of the most influential committees. But he spends more time in Wisconsin than other members of his state's congressional delegation, according to USA Today.“He takes being a dad to his young kids pretty seriously, and I think he recognizes that the job of speaker would pull him away from his family way more than he would like to be,"" fellow Wisconsin Rep. Reid Ribble (R) said on Thursday.Also on HuffPost:"
4,POLITICS,Obama: Backing Away From Immigration Reform Is 'Not Leadership',Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/barack-obama-republicans-immigration_us_5617022de4b0082030a1eb1a,"Ahem, Marco Rubio.",2015-10-09,President Barack Obama criticized GOP candidates for lack of leadership on immigration.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama reserved his harshest criticism on immigration Thursday not for GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump, but for the other Republican candidates who he said know what's right, but are bending to politics.Obama didn't use names during his speech to a 2,000-person crowd at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute gala. But some of his references were obvious, particularly to Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who helped draft a comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013 and has since tied himself in knots over whether he still supports it. ""Some of the very same Republican politicians who championed reform, some of whom sponsored these efforts, suddenly they want nothing to do with it,"" Obama said, with a dramatic pause. ""Hmm.""""In these circumstances, I always say, 'Don't boo, vote,'"" he continued. ""They can't hear the boos, but they can hear your vote."" The Latino vote helped Obama win in 2012, and may do the same for the 2016 Democratic nominee. Latinos lean Democratic, and there are even more eligible voters in the next election than in the last, meaning the GOP candidate may need to attract more than 47 percent of them in order to win the presidency.On immigration, though, most Republican candidates don't seem to be heeding the lessons of 2012, when Mitt Romney was widely condemned for calling for undocumented immigrants to self-deport. Instead, Republicans have been eager to say they're tough on immigration, whether by calling for a border wall or decrying amnesty. Like Rubio, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has said he does not support a path to citizenship, and stirred controversy for using the term ""anchor babies."" ""That's not leadership, turning against what's right the moment the politics of your base gets tough,"" Obama said. ""Leadership is not fanning the flames of intolerance and then acting all surprised when the fire breaks out. Saying clearly inflammatory things and then saying, 'Well, that's not what I meant,' until you do it again, and again, and again."" Obama said the American people need to decide whether they will stand up to bigotry -- a common theme of the evening. Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute Chairwoman Linda Sanchez (D-Calif.) told members of the crowd earlier that they must show they will organize against candidates who disrespect Latinos. ""We can't just sit on the sidelines hoping that things will get better,"" Sanchez said. For most of the conference, the top target was Trump, one of the only 2016 candidates not invited to speak because of his statements on Latinos, which include calling for mass deportation, a border wall and an end to birthright citizenship for babies born in the U.S. He also has claimed Mexico is sending rapists and other criminals into the U.S.""We need people who will stand up to this ugly rhetoric and extreme thinking, who will say with our words and our actions, basta, enough,"" Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton said.A 22-year-old undocumented immigrant activist, Juan Carlos Ramos with the advocacy group United We Dream Action, stood during Clinton's remarks to protest her for taking contributions from lobbyists for private prison companies, which operate many immigrant detention centers. It was not clear whether Clinton heard the man, and she continued speaking.Obama was interrupted by an immigration activist at last year's CHCI gala, which took place about a month after he put off plans for executive action on immigration until after the 2014 election. This year, things were decidedly friendlier for the president. He promised to continue fighting for the sweeping deportation relief he announced last November, which has been blocked by courts. ""Although it is taking us longer than we hoped, I know we are on the right side of the law,"" Obama said. ""We are going to keep fighting to prove it.""Also on HuffPost:"
5,POLITICS,The Republican Leadership Crisis May Have Just Saved The Export-Import Bank,Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/export-import-bank-house-vote_us_56180228e4b0e66ad4c7c94c,Democrats and centrist Republicans pulled together to force a House vote.,2015-10-09,House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's Democrats got something done with moderate Republicans' help in the midst of the House leadership vacuum.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=crop_15_46_4257_2484%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"The Republican House leadership crisis and a seldom-used congressional procedure may bring the newly controversial and recently expired Export-Import Bank back to life. A coalition of 218 Democrats and centrist Republicans reached critical mass on Friday to file a discharge petition for legislation reauthorizing the bank. A discharge petition brings a bill out of committee and to a vote on the House floor without without requiring committee approval. Under House rules, the bill is guaranteed to receive a floor vote soon, and with 218 backers, it already has enough support to pass.The government-run Ex-Im Bank helps U.S. businesses by giving cheap loans to foreign corporations to buy American products and services. Shutting it down has become an intense focus for both conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats in the last year. Reauthorization of the bank expired in July.Democrats were thrilled with what they pulled off Friday. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Financial Services Committee, said she knew that committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) wanted to kill the Ex-Im Bank. But Democrats were able to get around him.""We know he does not like it,"" Waters said. ""But we're past that now.""House passage of the reauthorization bill would bounce the issue back to the Senate. An Ex-Im reauthorization measure passed the Senate in July as part of a broader highway bill, but that legislation never passed the House. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has said he won't take up a standalone Ex-Im bill, and his spokesman Don Stewart said Friday that the latest bill isn't going anywhere. ""The Senate is not going to spend a week on a bill that the leader doesn't support,"" Stewart said.But House Democrats remain optimistic. ""I think they will,"" said Waters.Rep. Denny Heck (D-Wash.) told reporters that it was ""easy"" for Senate leadership to say that before ""they had a vehicle in their pocket. Strike vehicle, insert the word 'warm turd.' They've got it in their pocket now. If it dies, it's on them."" Heck noted that the House bill is ""exactly"" like the Ex-Im measure introduced in the upper chamber by Sens. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.). House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said that he talked to Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) on Friday afternoon about the next steps and that she pledged to work on persuading McConnell to give the bill a vote. The measure had a lot of support when the Senate last voted on it; 64 senators voted to attach it to the highway legislation.""I would hope that Senator McConnell, under those circumstances, would facilitate bringing a bill that has already passed his house by almost two-thirds to the floor,"" said Hoyer.The Ex-Im effort comes in the middle of a Republican House leadership vacuum, following the Sept. 25 resignation announcement from Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Thursday's surprise withdrawal from the race to succeed him by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).McCarthy's decision to pull out is ""what really lit a fire under"" moderate Republicans, Heck said. Rep. Stephen Fincher (R-Tenn.) said they had thought about using a discharge petition before Boehner's resignation, but that they believed they ""had the votes either way.""

Subscribe to get our updates directly via Facebook or email, or share your own wisdom.On their first night in class, the students receive alarming news. They have only nine months to live.The news is fictional. But the nine-month course, titled ""How To Live This Year As If It Were Your Last,"" helps students consider the myriad ways their lives would change if the timeline were real.The series is offered by New York's Zen Center for Contemplative Care, founded by two charismatic Buddhist monks, Robert Chodo Campbell and Koshin Paley Ellison. In addition to public courses and direct care for patients who are dying, the Center offers training programs for physicians and caretakers in contemplative end-of-life care. Partners include major medical centers like Mount Sinai and Beth Israel.Students often make profound changes after taking the course, Chodo said. ""We've had one woman, halfway through the nine months, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She had a double mastectomy. At the end of the nine months, she said, 'I always promised my sister that when I retired I would go live with her in Hawaii.' And she said, 'I'm not waiting. I'm leaving at the end of this year.' She was like 50. And she did. She quit her job. She moved to Hawaii. We got a postcard a few weeks later saying, 'I'm here. Thank you so much. I have no breasts. And I'm in Hawaii.'The annual gala for the Zen Center for Contemplative Care takes place on October 19. Earlier this year we spoke with Koshin and Chodo about finding personal fulfillment, how to think about death, and the moving experiences they've had with their patients and students.Can you talk about what happens in your ""How To Live This Year As If It Were Your Last"" course? What kind of changes do you see in people? Chodo: We just finished a course recently. It was incredible in so many ways. We had people from all walks of life, professionals on Wall Street, a couple of nurses, house wives. Mainly the age range, though, was 40s to 60s.On the first evening of the program, we meditated. I did a guided meditation, a visualization of being in a doctor's office. You're sitting there, you'd been in for your checkup, and you're waiting to see the doctor the next week. You're just hanging out reading the magazines. You come into the doctor's office, and he says, ""I have some really serious, bad news for you. You have nine months to live."" This is the meditation that they're contemplating.From that moment, we ask, what do you intend to do for the next nine months of your life? If this were real, how would your plans change?Some of the exercises that we did over the course of the nine months were to make sure they had their advance directives and their living wills in place. Most people don't have that. It's shocking. When we're in a roomful of people, even with a roomful of doctors, we ask, ""How many of you have your advance directives in place?"" It's a very low percentage. So we get that sorted out.We go through the process, through the months, building up to the final month. I ask them to write letters, to make reparation with anyone that they need to make reparation with. I ask that they visit a funeral home, so they can find out how much it actually costs to bury someone so that they can, if they want, pay for all the expenses up front before they die. This way they have chosen the casket, they have chosen the memorial service.We ask them to write a list of all the people they want to be with them when they die, and the people that they don't want there when they die. It's surprising when you ask people, ""Who do you actually want there?"" The number of people that say, ""Well, you know what? I really don't want my children there, because I don't want to be leaving them in such sorrow. For whatever reason, I don't want them there.""We ask people, ""Do you want to die suddenly? Do you want a lingering death?"" It's surprising the number of people that want a death that is slow, pain free, so that they are able to have their friends, their relatives, their children present. Those that choose not to have their children or their spouses present -- they want a heart attack. They want to go out like that [snaps fingers]. When you actually ask people to think about these things, it's kind of surprising what people come up with.During the course of the last four or five years doing this, we've had people get divorced. We've had one woman, halfway through the nine months, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She had a double mastectomy. At the end of the nine months, she said, ""I always promised my sister that when I retired I would go live with her in Hawaii."" And she said, ""I'm not waiting. I'm leaving at the end of this year."" She was like 50. And she did. She quit her job. She moved to Hawaii. We got a postcard a few weeks later saying, ""I'm here. Thank you so much. I have no breasts. And I'm in Hawaii.""We had a couple of married couples. One of the married couples, he said, ""You know what? I'm buying that fucking Harley Davidson. I don't care what she says."" The wife was sitting next to him. She said, ""Go for it."" They were in their 60s, late 60s. She said, ""Honey, go for it. And you know what? I'm going to Paris without you."" So, you know, it's such a wonderful, enlivening experience.We have them write their obituaries. How many times do we read an obituary and think, ""Oh, god. Is that who they really were? It's not really telling you much."" When you actually sit down to write your own obituary -- it's pretty amazing the stuff that I want people to know about me that maybe Koshin or my brothers or whoever wouldn't even think to put out there. And the stuff that they do put out there, it's not important to me. I want people to know I did this, this, this, and this.Our last evening together, we have a big celebration, because we all made it through, and we're alive. I have everyone give me their favorite song. We have a memorial playlist. We have them bring in objects that they would like on their altar at the memorial. We set up the room. There are all these beautiful photographs and mementos of their life. There's music, all their favorite songs playing in the background, and food. And it's just a party. It's like, if I go out like this, I'll be just fine. It's beautiful.It's always struck me as unfortunate that the people who have died don't get to enjoy their memorials. Is there a better way to allow people at the end of their lives to celebrate their lives before they've passed?Chodo: Absolutely. Actually, a good friend of Koshin and myself -- she's a well-known analyst. Her husband was a renowned analyst and writer. When he knew he was dying, in his last months, he hosted his own memorial service. All his friends came to this beautiful home. They all came up to him, paid their respects, told him what they loved about him, what they didn't like about him. They had this incredible meal and drinks. And it was a party. He knew very well that he was not going to be around for another month or so.It was such an incredible experience for someone to be so wholeheartedly looking at their ultimate ending, their death. It's like, here I am. I've had a great life. I'm going to die. Let's celebrate. And that was it.So at the time of death, there was no need for a memorial service or any kind of eulogies. Very simple burial with the family, and that was it. How amazing is that?I think many people are appreciative, maybe even envious, of the way that you approach your lives, but perhaps are skeptical that they can be mindful in the midst of their hectic, busy days. How do you manage that?Koshin: For me, it's the practice of doing what you're doing now -- and of not doing the next thing while you're doing what you're doing. So, I'm talking to Nico until I'm not talking to Nico, and then I'm going to the next thing, because that's what the next thing is.We have a fantasy of busyness. ""Oh, I'm so busy. I'm so crazy."" We hear that all the time. It's becoming the thing to say, as if it's a badge of honor. ""I'm busy, so it must mean I'm important or my life has value because I'm busy."" What I keep learning about busy is that it's really painful. No one's actually in their experience, they're already on to the next thing.Our friend Marie Howe, she's the poet laureate of New York state, and a marvelous person. She has a great line about busy people. She says, we have this fear from the science-fiction movies that robots are going to take over. Well, they already have, just not how we thought it was going to happen. [laughter]So to me, throughout my day, say when I'm walking on 23rd Street in Manhattan, or doing whatever, it's about noticing where I am.What I love about doing that is that you start to notice that there are some other people on the street who actually are present, too. It's so sweet, because then you actually recognize each other. ""Oh, there you are."" There's like this little glint. ""We're here."" And everyone else, you see just masses of people, and they're vrroooom.Our cat is dying right now. He is such a wonderful creature. The depth of our love for our animals sometimes... in our culture, we have a tendency to trivialize people's relationships with their pets. But they're beings that populate so much of our life.So being with him and understanding, rather than the idea of his dying or the idea of his death, actually, it's being with him. This morning, there he was on the pillow, like, ""Hello,"" you know.In some ways, the insight is that our life is just these moments where incredible intimacy is possible, if we're attentive and caring and not caught up by our distractions. Whether it's being with our cat or being with our partners or being with the people that are on the street, to me, all of these things are reminders that it's not going to last. They are continual reminders that are both inspiring and heartbreaking and gorgeous.You and Chodo led a session where you asked people to turn to a stranger and stare into their eyes for several minutes. What's the purpose of this exercise?Koshin: Our life is all about relationships, allowing us to connect to each other. For much of my life, I was avoiding that. Actually, I used my Zen practice to retreat from engaging.And yet the practice of Zen, for me, has become about intimacy. It is about me looking at you and actually allowing you to enter me, and for me to see you, to really have that experience.One striking aspect is how much we're busy turning away. This experience of looking at another person -- it's not about staring. It's about allowing ourselves to be that open, even vulnerable, to experience the part of us that wants to turn away. The part that makes you say to yourself, ""Oh, my god, I feel so uncomfortable.""Look at how busy we are moving away from what is intimate, moving away from what is natural, moving away from what is possible. We're so into preserving ourselves and not trusting the moment, not trusting that what is here is perfect and complete, just as it is. We want to believe all of our old shit. So much of our life is built on protecting and controlling and distrusting. It's very moving to allow yourself to have an experience that lets you give that up.So looking into someone's eyes, we can begin to look at another and just say, ""Oh, who are you in this moment? I've never seen you in this moment, Nico."" You know? You're different than when we first met a few minutes ago. And so am I.Are there any books that have had a profound impact on your intellectual development, on the course of your thinking about these topics?Koshin: I would say two books, if I were sent away on an island. One is ""Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind"" by Suzuki Roshi, Shunryu Suzuki. The other one is ""Appreciate Your Life"" by Taizan Maezumi. Those are two of the most exquisite Zen books. They're really just about life. Basically: this is it; are you going to show up? Because what is here is exquisite.The other book I love is Edith Hamilton's book, ""Mythology"". Those stories tell the human story, and about how it can be so challenging. I love those stories so much. I turn to them to realize that our challenges today -- the busyness, the difficulty, the strife, the beauty, the courage, the fear -- have been around forever. Seeing ourselves in these larger stories is always such a delight to me.Is there an important matter in life about which you have changed your mind?Chodo: That's a big question, Nico. For many years, I was living with addiction. This was in my teens, 20s, and early 30s, and I was thinking, ""What's the point of this life? Let's just get fucked up. Let's do as many drugs as we can. Let's drink as much as we can and party down. Because it's not that important."" This was me speaking from my own experience of my own life, not life in the big picture, but my own life.When I got sober, which is now 28 years ago, I began to see that actually I could have a more spiritual approach to my life. And then when I began my Buddhist practice, which was 25 years ago, I realized the importance of my life, that there was a reason for my addictions. If it were not for those behaviors and that path, that particular path I was on in my early years, I wouldn't be where I am now, doing this work.If you'd have asked me at 25 what I was going to be doing for the rest of my life, it certainly wouldn't have been accompanying the dying, or educating people around this topic. It would be like, ""Yeah, man. Who gives a fuck? I want to be dead. I have a needle in my arm, some coke up my nose, hanging out, having a party.""What has changed is my respect for life and how precious it is. We have a chant in our practice every evening, which is: ""Let me respectfully remind you, life and death are of supreme importance. Time swiftly passes by, and opportunities are lost. Each of us should strive to awaken. Do not squander your life.""That is something that I chant every evening. It's so important for me to remember not to squander my life. I did that for a long time. So when I was given the opportunity, or the opportunity presented itself, to see it differently, thankfully I took that path of sobriety.It is possible to think too much about death, to be overly concerned with it. Is there an approach to thinking about death that you recommend?Chodo: Death is always imminent. In Zen, our practice is the understanding that at each moment, we're born and dying. In meditations, we talk about with each in breath, I'm bringing life. You know [inhales] this is life. Each out breath is like a mini death. We all die on the out breath. It's the last thing we do.And moment to moment, we have no idea the extent of our lifespan. There could be a tornado heading for this building right now, or a 747 jet. We just don't know.So death is always imminent. When we're living with that appreciation of life, we don't have to get so caught up in the morbid thoughts of, ""Oh, my god. When's it going to happen? When am I going to get sick? How am I going to die?"" Because it probably is not going to turn out the way I thought it would.Koshin: Most younger people don't think about it often. But then again, most older people don't think about it. Mostly, everyone's busy trying not to think about it. There's this idea that it's actually morbid to think about death, which is ironic.To me, the only reason it's helpful to think about it is to appreciate this moment. From a Zen perspective, we talk about the birth and death or happening moment by moment. This moment that we're having right now will never happen again, because it will die. In a Zen perspective, it's always happening. There's no future moment. There's only this constant stream of moments.So to me, it's about using death to help you to be here and to realize that this is it. The reason I love working with dying people is that it's actually not depressing, as many people think. People who are dying always remind me: ""I can't believe I wasn't here for most of my life."" That's probably one of the most common things I hear, and the biggest regrets. Many people have not actually inhabited their life, because they're just waiting for other moments. Whether you're young or old, it seems to be across all the values this desire to think that you're preparing for your life and then it's going to be great. Actually, this is it. The more you can actually be alive and attentive and aware that this is it, it is very energizing.It's like the great energy drink. Who needs Red Bull?You've said before that caretakers need to be taught how to care for themselves so that they can care for others. What do you mean by that?Chodo: The first thing that we have to understand is that doctors and nurses are incredibly dedicated to their profession, that in most cases they go into the profession because they want to make a difference in how people are cared for, how they're treated when they're in times of illness.And yet it's only recently that some medical schools have had end-of-life conversations in the curriculum, how to care for the dying, from more of a personal relational standpoint.What we try to do is in our education is to convince doctors and nurses and social workers that there doesn't have to be this veil between them and the patient. You often hear stories from them: ""If I don't have this wall up, I'm going to burn out.""Well, there are many studies now that show that the clinicians who are most empathetic to their patients are the ones that suffer less with burnout. Because they're able to really separate from what's yours and what's mine. I can journey with you, and I can companion you on your journey. But it's you that's going through the process of dying of this illness right now. I'm bearing witness to it. I don't have to get so enmeshed, but I do want to be with you. Does that make sense? It's like, I can be with you. I can journey with you. And I don't have to get enmeshed.If I can really see that -- on the one hand, in Buddhism there's no separation between you and I. The paradox is, you're the one that's in the hospital bed right now. I'm not.You've spoken about expanding the idea of medical ethics in the context of contemplative care.Koshin: Western bioethics are wonderful and important; issues of autonomy and all of those important things to consider. What we bring in, in addition to that, is looking at, for instance, what does it mean to harm? How am I causing harm to myself or others with my decisions, my actions, and my thoughts? For instance, most physicians speak 75 percent of the time during a patient visit. Is that appropriate? Or can they be a little bit more receptive?Like everyone else in the culture, caretakers talk about how busy they are. The average patient visit with a physician in the hospital is three minutes. So we look at what they can do in three minutes in terms of ethics, in terms of how they want to hold the space, how they reflect on how they use their time. These are things that we work with the physicians on, helping them get back to their own values.You have some very emotional interactions with people who are dying, or whose loved one is dying. Have there been any memorable recent experiences?Koshin: There was a patient recently who really wanted to talk about her sorrow. She kept talking about how sorrowful she felt, to the entire clinical team. This was a young woman, she was 35 and had metastatic cancer and was dying. Everyone kept talking about how she was so sorrowful.I said, ""Well, what's she sorrowful about?"" And people said, ""Oh... I don't know."" It made me realize how rarely we actually take in what someone says, and let them know that we hear them, and are curious about it. ""You're sorrowful? What are you sorrowful about?""When that question was brought to her, she was so delighted. So thankful. She said, ""I really appreciate you asking me. And I would like to talk about it.""She realized she was never going to go home again and be able to see her dog. And because we were able to talk about it with her, we were able to make arrangements for her to visit with her dog before she died.I have a friend who is a wonderful physician. She often says that her first question to her patients is, ""Who are the people who really know you and you feel received by? Before we work together as patient and doctor, I want to know about your life and who are the people you can really depend on, who really hear you.""She talks about how diminishing those numbers have been in her practice, that sometimes people look embarrassed or sad. Maybe they can think of one person who really can just hear whatever they have to say.It goes back to the question of: how do we sit with ourselves? How do we have the courage to be ourselves? How do we look at each other? These are, to me, the most healing.We've been talking about contemplative care, but sometimes we play with this idea of contemplative medicine. How are you contemplating what is healing for you in your life? And how are you using that medicine, or how are you moving away from it?The Zen Center for Contemplative Care will celebrate its 10th anniversary soon. You seem to be broadening your focus. What are the next challenges you hope to take on?Chodo: When we began this journey, when Koshin and I first met, we had both read a book by a man called Issan Dorsey, who was a Buddhist monk. He was a homosexual, drag queen, drunk, drug addict, in the '50s and '60s. Turned his life around and really created the first Zen hospice in San Francisco for men who were dying of AIDS. Out of his passion for that particular population grew this amazing project in San Francisco, the Zen hospice in San Francisco.When Koshin and I first met, we had both just finished reading that book. We talked about how incredible it would be to build a Zen hospice in New York. So that was the impetus in the beginning for our journey into chaplaincy and this whole work that we're doing now, educating clinicians and caregivers.My hope for the next 10 years is that we would eventually have a building that could house not only our education programs, but also end-of-life suites for folks who are dying, that we could use our students as volunteers in the end-of-life suites, and that we are able to get doctors, clinicians, social workers to rotate through our organization as part of their learning.So you have doctors who are in residence or, you know, coming through, doing three months in our place, to really be with people who are dying and to be with spiritual caregivers, so it could all be under one roof. For me, my dream for the next 10 years is to really manifest that.I think it's so important that we, as a culture right now -- and it's happening -- begin to really, really appreciate the fact that people are dying in ways that are not necessary. We don't have to be hooked up to machines. We don't have to be dying in hospital beds. We can go back to a more relational, connected way of ending our lives, or facing our lives' end.In the course of spending so much time with people who are dying and who are reflecting on their lives, has that given you a different perspective on what makes up a good life? If someone asks you now what makes up a good life, do you have an answer.There's a guy that I meet every morning on the way to the center outside of Starbucks who is homeless. He sits there every morning. Wonderful man. And he's there all summer. He's there all winter, you know, asking people for a buck. He has the most engaging qualities about him. He's bright. He has his demons. I think he's probably schizophrenic. But he's incredibly intelligent.Every morning we engage in dialogue. I always give him like $2, or I buy him a hot chocolate, whatever. I asked him one day -- I'll call him Christopher, that's not his name. I say, ""Now, Chris, why don't you get off the streets? You're smart. You have great ideas. You're presentable.""He said, ""You know what, Chodo? I'm perfectly happy. I don't have a home. I have my storage container with my belongings, which is like two backpacks and a bike. I don't want to live in the shelters, because everybody in the shelters is crazy, or they're going to steal all my shit. I'm really, really happy. I sit here on 7th Avenue, and I watch the entire world unfold before me every single day. Sometimes it sucks because it's cold, and sometimes it sucks because it's hot. But I love it.""And here's me thinking, you know, my own value judgments. If he just got a job, he could start to earn some money, go move into like an SRO. Then he'd get an apartment and -- ""No. I don't want that.""So I don't know what a good life is. I know what a good life is for me. There was a time when I had a home in the Hamptons with a swimming pool and a couple of cars and dogs and a great career. This is all what I was, before I got sober, I was in a world of fashion and glamor. And I was incredibly miserable.I came from England when I was 30. I wanted the American dream. I wanted the house in the Hamptons, apartment in New York City and this and that. You know what? I was so unhappy with the whole thing.When I left that life and moved towards what I'm doing now, it's the happiest I've ever been. A one-bedroom apartment. Have to pay rent every month. Don't have a car. I don't have a swimming pool.The joy in my life is my practice, and the fact that I'm awake to who I am. So I guess, in a nutshell, a good life is being awake to who you are and the life that you have; appreciating your life, whatever it is.Transcription services by Tigerfish; now offering transcripts in two-hours guaranteed.

""It is cruelty pure and simple to keep large, intelligent, complex and social sea mammals in tiny tanks and force them to entertain consumers whose dollars would be better spent on conservation of orcas in the wild.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"""It's cool to see them, but it's not the right thing to do,"" said 10-year-old Zoey Lambe-Hommel. Zoey, dressed in a killer whale costume, was one of the hundreds of people who gathered on Thursday to protest SeaWorld’s orca exhibit at a meeting of the California Coastal Commission.""I want to protect the orcas. They're living animals, they're not pets,"" she told CNN.It seems the commission agrees with her.After listening to hours of speeches by both SeaWorld opponents and supporters, the state agency said that while it approved the company’s $100 million plan to double the size of its killer whale habitat, it was banning the breeding of captive orcas at their California facility.""I can approve this project but only with conditions,"" said Dayna Bochno, one of the commissioners, per The Los Angeles Times. Bochno said captivity is harmful to the whales. SeaWorld San Diego is currently home to 11 orcas, who are star attractions at the facility. Thanks to the no-breeding vote, these animals could be ""the last 11 orcas there,"" PETA lawyer Jared Goodman told the Associated Press after Thursday’s meeting.""No more orcas will be condemned to a nonlife of loneliness, deprivation and misery,"" the animal rights group added in a statement.An estimated 650 SeaWorld supporters and critics gathered at the Coastal Commission hearing in Long Beach, reports CNN.The company was seeking approval from the agency, which has authority over construction projects along California's coast, to build a ""bigger, better home"" for their orcas. It says it plans to expand the current orca habitat from a 5.8 million gallon pool to a 9.6 million gallon one for a new exhibit called ""The Blue World.""SeaWorld San Diego President John Reilly said the issue was ""a land use decision."" Animal activists, however, urged the panel to consider the negative impact that captivity has on orcas.""SeaWorld is a sea circus, and the orcas are its abused elephants,"" said PETA in a statement.SeaWorld’s treatment of captive orcas has come under enhanced scrutiny since the release of the 2013 documentary “Blackfish,” which suggested that the stress of captivity can provoke violence in orcas.SeaWorld insists, however, that its whales are neither stressed or depressed.""We care for these animals as if they were family,"" veterinarian Hendrik Nollens told the panel on Thursday, per AP. ""We have nothing but the whales' best interest at heart.""But the agency appeared to disagree.""[Orcas] don't belong in captivity,"" said Commissioner Bochco.The Coastal Commission said that SeaWorld San Diego could go ahead with their tank expansion plans, but they cannot populate their pools ""with orcas caught in the wild and cannot use genetic material from wild orcas to breed killer wales in captivity,"" according to CNN.Activists celebrated the decision, hailing it as the beginning of the end of killer whale captivity at the San Diego ocean park. SeaWorld, however, lamented the vote.""We are disappointed with the conditions that the California Coastal Commission placed on their approval of the Blue World Project and will carefully review and consider our options,"" the company said in a statement, according to the Orlando Sentinel. ""Breeding is a natural, fundamental and important part of an animal’s life, and depriving a social animal of the right to reproduce is inhumane.""According to CNN, there are 56 orcas in captivity worldwide, with 24 of them under SeaWorld's care at its parks in San Diego, San Antonio and Orlando.Earlier on HuffPost: "

The veteran reality star joined forces with Barefoot Wine & Bubbly to kick off Atlanta Gay Pride this week, and she'll also be a recurring guest star on E!'s ""Fashion Police"" this season.HuffPost spoke to Leakes on Thursday about her Barefoot partnership, her upcoming projects and, of course, her feelings on her old ""Celebrity Apprentice"" boss, Donald Trump.You’re hosting the Barefoot Wine Bear Garten event tonight in honor of the gay community. What is it about the gay community that you connect with so deeply?I’ve always loved supporting the LGBT community. I grew up with a couple of gay guys. Besides loving the gays personally myself, I feel like they influence everything, from nail polish to high heels to lip gloss to everything you can think of. I’ve been a supporter of the LGBT community for a very, very long time, and tonight is another reason for me to go out and support. I always participate in gay pride. If I can go out and show up, I always do.The trailer for this coming season of ""Real Housewives of Atlanta"" came out a couple days ago, and it looks drama-filled, per usual. How are you feeling as the show prepares for its return to TV? Any nostalgia? Any regrets?No, I don’t have any regrets. I’m not the kind of girl that looks back. I love Bravo. They are my family. I will always work with them in [a] certain capacity. I have not seen the trailer. I wish all the girls the best. That’s all I can say. The only feeling that I really had over leaving the show was that I started the show and I’ve done it for a very long time so I wanna have my hand in it somehow. I want it to stay successful.While we're discussing ""RHOA,"" Kim Zolciak recently suffered a mini-stroke. Have you been in touch with her? How is she doing?I did visit her when she was in the hospital. As far as I know, she’s doing good, she’s doing fine. She brought awareness to this medical issue that I don’t think a lot of young women think of, you know?No, I don’t know, because I don’t know what her medical issue is. I just heard her saying something about a blood clot, and that doesn’t have an age on it. So, you know, when people speak out and say things like, ""I never thought I would because I’m 37"" -- I mean, really? Blood clots have no age. You keep your foot in a cast long enough, you can get a blood clot from that. You see people walking around with these boots on their foot and you don’t let your foot get circulation, you can get a blood clot from that. We’re in 2015. I think it’s a little crazy when people are like, ""I’m 20, I didn’t know I could have a heart attack."" Well, ya know, really?That's true. I meant more in terms of giving this condition visibility, but you're correct -- blood clots are an ageless ailment. It is an ageless ailment. Pivoting to another TV show you've starred on, ""The Apprentice."" You've spoken kindly of Donald Trump since your run on the show. Would you vote for him?I think Donald’s doing a great job. I think he’s gaining a lot of momentum, and he knows how to work that press, and I’ll tell you what – I’ve never looked at a debate before and I’ve been watching. It’s so interesting. He’s so funny to me. I like Donald, I like working with him and all those things. But actually, I’m not a Republican.So you wouldn't vote for him.I am not a Republican.Got it. How's working on ""Fashion Police"" been?Working on ""Fashion Police"" has been amazing. I love fashion. I love just critiquing these girls’ fashions and having fun with it because I think it’s all about having fun. I don’t feel like we’re tearing anybody down. I feel like in the past it’s been a little bit negative, but I think we’ve found a way right now to make it really fun and funny and just say, ""Oh, she’s so gorgeous, but I don’t think that dress was right for her body type."" And it’s only our opinion – it’s not like the world’s opinion. We’re only having fun with fashion because we all love it.Have you ever had [""Fashion Police"" co-star] Brad Goreski style you?Brad hasn’t styled me, and I don’t really need a stylist. To me, using is a stylist is not showing your own personal style. I like to show my own personal style. I know what works for my body better than anybody. And lastly, Halloween's right around the corner. What are you dressing up as?I might dress up as the queen bee. ... I love to be the queen and [my husband] Greg to be the king. I don’t like to do the scary costumes, you know? Maybe I’ll be Donald Trump. That’ll be pretty good. [Laughs] Yeah. Maybe I’ll be Donald Trump for the day.This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.Also on HuffPost:"

Trying to help, Rogelio (Jaime Camil) tweets about Mateo's kidnapping making the Villanueva family targets of the paparazzi.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5617fc601400002a00c7997c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"LOS ANGELES -- Jane Gloriana Villanueva is a dreamer. But even the “Jane The Virgin” protagonist's wildest fantasies are no match for what some of the show's actors can envision for the series' upcoming second season. The Huffington Post caught up with both the creator and cast of the hit CW series in late August, following a lively table-read of the second season's premiere episode. As we walked from the show's set to Gina Rodriguez’s red Vespa, I asked the actress and her co-star Jaime Camil (who portrays Jane’s over-the-top father, Rogelio de la Vega) if they'd consider using their real-life musical talents for an on-screen duet.The two immediately latched onto the idea, and described an elaborate dream sequence that they quickly decided would have to happen inside Rogelio's more melodramatic mind.""Your fantasies would be amazing,” Rodriguez said. “Somehow I’ll be rapping…”“...Of course,” Camil said, finishing her sentence. “With feathers, flamingos...” “Exactly, we’re flying…” she added. Then Camil jumped into a pirouette.You can’t blame the actors for their active imaginations given that the show’s executive producer and creator Jennie Urman is known for keeping her cast in the dark when it comes to plot.“It was just a choice I made early on to try and keep it fresh and to try to keep everyone pointed at where they’re going in each episode, so that surprises can unfold naturally and we don’t foreshadow them too much,” Urman told HuffPost later. “And I just think the actors have a real nice spontaneity when they’re playing the scripts, because in life you don’t know what’s coming next.”“Jane The Virgin” fans certainly understand that feeling of uncertainty, particularly after the traumatic experience of watching Jane and Rafael’s newborn son, Mateo, be kidnapped by Sin Rostro during the final seconds of season one.Urman has promised the swift return of baby Mateo, and said she’s mostly looking forward to starting new plot lines in season two.“We launch a new mystery that will involve a lot of our people,” she revealed. She added that she was eager to “wrap up a lot of stuff early on so that we could embark on fresh drama.”That said, Urman told me that Jane’s love triangle with Rafael and Michael will continue for a bit longer, but the wait will be relatively short. Jane will get married in one of the two weddings planned for this season, though Urman failed to reveal if the protagonist will choose between her two current suitors or if there will be a third love interest.“We’ve left Jane in a place where she has to make a choice but she had something giant happen to her, so you don’t just go back to your romantic feelings right away,” Urman said. “There’s going to be twists and turns along that path, but [the wedding] is what we’ll build to eventually. That said, that is one of her focuses.”Urman said another big focus in season two will be motherhood, particularly how Jane will keep her “sense of self while suddenly becoming responsible for someone else” and continue with her dreams of becoming a writer.Jane’s future wedding also brings up the the titular character’s personal commitment to protect her virginity until marriage -- something Jane considered losing in season one. For her part, Urman said she has no intention of keeping Jane a virgin longer than necessary.“With Jane’s virginity we’re only invested in so far as: she has made a vow to wait until she gets married to have sex,” Urman said. “So that’s my investment in it.”“I want her to achieve what she set out to achieve because it’s important to her,” she continued. “So beyond that I’m not too concerned, we always have twists and turns -- without saying too much -- if and when she loses her virginity we’ll just keep [the show’s] title and put a line through the ‘Virgin.'” Those “twists and turns” not only successfully keep “Jane The Virgin” fans on their toes but push Urman to continually go bigger and bigger plot wise -- that is, without going too far. “The show has to be grounded in that Jane has to respond to things as we would respond. And have at least one or two smaller stories that are relatable and are on a more human emotional scale,” Urman said of the show, which was loosely adapted from the Venezuelan telenovela “Juana La Virgen.”“But that said, the show itself is a telenovela -- a meta telenovela, maybe -- so it has to have bigger parameters,” she added. “It’s that balance that I spend a lot of time thinking about and worrying about.” One way the show manages to stay grounded is by channeling some of its wilder moments into dream sequences, much like what stars Gina Rodriguez and Jaime Camil visualized for Mateo’s lullaby. “We have some really fun magical realism elements this year,” Urman said. “We have a puppet show, we have just all different types of fantasies I’m excited about.”And she’s definitely on board with having Jane and Rogelio perform a duet on-screen, though perhaps in a less theatrical way. “I think that would be amazing: Jane’s lullaby for Mateo,” she said, adding that audiences can look forward to hearing Jane rap again in the show’s sophomore season. “I want them to be singing to that baby at some point and I want a little bit more music in the show, it just has to come in organically through the lens of Jane.”More music seems inevitable considering this season's upcoming celebrity cameos, including Britney Spears as Rogelio’s rival, Adam Rodriguez as Jane’s writing teacher (and love interest?) and Kesha as Jane’s neighbor who has an aversion to babies.Urman told HuffPost that Kate del Castillo, whose guest appearance was recently announced, will portray Rogelio's first ex-wife.“[She’s] a beautiful hoarder, a little bit of a female Rogelio,” Urman said of del Castillo’s character. “Her signature color is not lavender but it is violet.”But it was the news of Spears coming to set that made Rodriguez literally fall out of her chair. The actress told HuffPost she has idolized the pop star since she was a teen.“You know what I want to do? I totally wanna recreate [""Baby One More Time""] and re-shoot it on set with her,” Rodriguez said, describing Spear’s iconic music video for the single. “‘Baby One More Time’ and baby Mateo is in it! How hysterical would that be?”""Jane The Virgin"" premieres Oct. 12 at 9 p.m. on The CW. Also On HuffPost: "

And have at least one or two smaller stories that are relatable and are on a more human emotional scale,” Urman said of the show, which was loosely adapted from the Venezuelan telenovela “Juana La Virgen.”“But that said, the show itself is a telenovela -- a meta telenovela, maybe -- so it has to have bigger parameters,” she added. “It’s that balance that I spend a lot of time thinking about and worrying about.” One way the show manages to stay grounded is by channeling some of its wilder moments into dream sequences, much like what stars Gina Rodriguez and Jaime Camil visualized for Mateo’s lullaby. “We have some really fun magical realism elements this year,” Urman said. “We have a puppet show, we have just all different types of fantasies I’m excited about.”And she’s definitely on board with having Jane and Rogelio perform a duet on-screen, though perhaps in a less theatrical way. “I think that would be amazing: Jane’s lullaby for Mateo,” she said, adding that audiences can look forward to hearing Jane rap again in the show’s sophomore season. “I want them to be singing to that baby at some point and I want a little bit more music in the show, it just has to come in organically through the lens of Jane.”More music seems inevitable considering this season's upcoming celebrity cameos, including Britney Spears as Rogelio’s rival, Adam Rodriguez as Jane’s writing teacher (and love interest?) and Kesha as Jane’s neighbor who has an aversion to babies.Urman told HuffPost that Kate del Castillo, whose guest appearance was recently announced, will portray Rogelio's first ex-wife.“[She’s] a beautiful hoarder, a little bit of a female Rogelio,” Urman said of del Castillo’s character. “Her signature color is not lavender but it is violet.”But it was the news of Spears coming to set that made Rodriguez literally fall out of her chair. The actress told HuffPost she has idolized the pop star since she was a teen.“You know what I want to do? I totally wanna recreate [""Baby One More Time""] and re-shoot it on set with her,” Rodriguez said, describing Spear’s iconic music video for the single. “‘Baby One More Time’ and baby Mateo is in it! How hysterical would that be?”""Jane The Virgin"" premieres Oct. 12 at 9 p.m. on The CW. Also On HuffPost: "
16,POLITICS,Bernie Sanders Has One Pro-Wall Street Vote,Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-wall-street_us_5617f634e4b0dbb8000e5a58,His vote to deregulate derivatives doesn't fit his broader voting record.,2015-10-09,Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders consistently voices his support for breaking up too-big-to-fail banks and increasing Wall Street regulation.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5617f86b1400002200c79970.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Bernie Sanders' campaign message is built around a central theme -- wresting economic power away from Wall Street and returning it to working people. It's a message that closely tracks the voting record of the self-described socialist senator from Vermont.But there is one significant blemish on that record. In 2000, Sanders voted for the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, a landmark bill that blocked federal agencies from regulating credit default swaps -- the complex contracts at the heart of the 2008 financial crisis. The CFMA's chief architect was then-Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas), a die-hard deregulator who joined Swiss banking giant UBS after leaving the Senate. Today, he's essentially the rhetorical opposite of Sanders, appearing in congressional hearings to literally bemoan the low pay of multimillionaire CEOs.By 2000, Sanders was already an unpopular figure with big banks. The prior year, he had vigorously opposed the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, a Depression-era law which barred conventional banks from engaging in risky securities trading. Its repeal is widely viewed as fueling a merger binge that made companies massive and complex -- a catalyst for the banking collapse. In a speech on the House floor, then-Rep. Sanders hammered the repeal bill for creating new ""taxpayer exposure to potential losses should a financial conglomerate fail."" ""It will lead to more megamergers, a small number of corporations dominating the financial service industry and further concentration of economic power in this country,"" Sanders added.Yet a year later, Sanders voted in favor of legislation to exempt whole swaths of the banking sector from regulation. The discrepancy appears to be due in part to sloppy voting by Sanders, and in part to Gramm's legislative guile.""No one has a stronger record on reforming Wall Street and breaking up too-big-to-fail banks than Senator Sanders,"" said Warren Gunnels, senior policy adviser to Sanders. ""He strongly spoke against repealing Glass-Steagall because he was afraid that it could cause a financial crisis like the one we saw in 2008. And he's going to do everything possible to break up the too-big-to-fail banks.""When Sanders voted for the House version of the CFMA in October 2000, the bill was not yet a total debacle for Wall Street accountability advocates. The legislative text Sanders supported was clearly designed to curtail regulatory oversight. The GOP-authored bill was crafted as a response to a proposal from ex-Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Brooksley Born to ramp up oversight of derivatives. But the version Sanders initially voted for was more benign than the final, Gramm-authored version, and it didn't draw any of the protests that the 1999 repeal of Glass-Steagall did. In October 2000, the bill passed the House by a vote of 377 to 4 (51 members didn't vote), and then sat on the shelf for weeks. But in December, Gramm -- after coordinating with top Clinton administration officials -- added much harder-edged deregulatory language to the bill, then attached the entire package to a must-pass 11,000-page bill funding the entire federal government. After Gramm's workshopping, the legislation included new language saying the federal government ""shall not exercise regulatory authority with respect to, a covered swap agreement offered, entered into, or provided by a bank."" That ended all government oversight of derivatives purchased or traded by banks. He also created the so-called ""Enron Loophole,"" which barred federal oversight of energy trading on electronic platforms. This was an era in which voting against funding the federal government was considered a major governance faux pas. The bill sailed through both chambers of Congress, with few lawmakers even aware of the major new deregulatory changes. Sanders has since hammered the CFMA, its architects and specific provisions in Senate hearings and on the Senate floor. He helped push through legislation to close the Enron loophole in 2008. He voted against the bank bailouts of 2008, and has cried foul on heavy Wall Street speculation in the derivatives market for oil, saying it needlessly drives up gas prices. He has voted to break up the largest banks, and supports reinstating the Depression-era firewall between conventional lending and risky securities trading.Wall street watchdogs sing his praises. With one exception."

Clearly, campaigns and these semi-secretive organizations do the one big thing they are not ever supposed to do, according to what we'll very loosely call ""campaign finance law"": coordinate with one another.In fact, the inefficacy of any oversight agency to prevent -- and unwillingness to even notice -- abuse and corruption is the buried lead of almost every story about dark money, except for the ones I write because I put it in a rather pointed second paragraph to draw attention to it.Many other news organizations, of course, stare with some degree of naive, starry-eyed wonder on these new arrangements. The latest is The Associated Press, which on Thursday reported on presidential aspirant and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and the way he is ""benefiting in unprecedented ways"" from an arrangement with a ""nonprofit group funded by anonymous donors"" called the Conservative Solutions Project.It's really a neat relationship in which Rubio and this organization find themselves. Very symbiotic, indeed. According to the AP, the organization is responsible for every ""pro-Rubio television commercial so far in the early primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina,"" as well as a Rubio-centric direct-mail campaign in those states. It goes on to note that the nonprofit, which by law is ""barred from making political activity their primary purpose,"" has nevertheless -- and surely, purely by coincidence -- ended up repeatedly coming through in the clutch for Marco Rubio:Rubio is legally prohibited from directing the group's spending, and he has said he has nothing to do with it. But there's little doubt that Conservative Solutions Project is picking up the tab for critical expenses that the campaign itself might struggle to afford.And the coincidences hardly end there. In fact, here is the most hilarious one:Although [the Conservative Solutions Project] shares a name and key personnel with the Rubio-focused super PAC, Conservative Solutions PAC, its mutual spokesman, Jeff Sadosky, said the two are ""very separate and distinct groups.""Oh, sure. These two groups? My, my, they couldn't be more different! Take it from the guy who serves as the spokesman for both groups, because he'd obviously know better than anybody!Back in April, in the course of reporting on the way former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's presidential campaign was planning on handing the bulk of its ""central functions"" to its Right To Rise super PAC, the AP described this arrangement as one that gave a ""makeover"" to the ""traditional campaign,"" while expressing a general wonderment about it, because of course campaigns can't coordinate with these organizations, so wow ... how is this supposed to work?The media tends to depict this new wilderness of unaccountable money funding unaccountable campaign activity as one in which the candidates are innovating, or taking bold chances, in the face of the non-coordination restrictions, as if these restrictions were an actual thing that mattered to anyone. It's taking them awhile to catch up to the reality that they don't matter, and the only ""innovation"" is the candidates' simple acknowledgement that there's no agency capable of holding them accountable for violating these laws, and so there are no consequences for flouting them. What follows from there should be no surprise to anyone. If it seems like it's going to be hard for a candidate's super PAC to perform the activities they are performing without coordinating with the campaign, the obvious answer is that this coordination is happening.The AP eventually gets around to winkingly acknowledging there are an awful lot of coincidental similarities between the aims of these Rubio-focused organizations and the interests of the Rubio campaign. But no amount of shade-throwing will make up for the fact that the sentence that describes ""the Federal Election Commission and the Internal Revenue Service"" as being ""less than aggressive in pursuing potential violators"" of campaign finance law comes 12 paragraphs below the sentence where the reporter just takes Rubio's word for it when he says ""he has nothing to do with"" the nonprofit that has his back in the early primary states. This corrupt system depends on that sort of timidity to function the way it does.So, hey, just to remind you: Your 2016 candidates disregard the law and coordinate with these campaign finance organizations all the time, despite what they tell you. And Marco Rubio is no different."

But he said he was not aware until early September that a ""defeat device"" had been installed in nearly 500,000 VW diesel vehicles in the U.S.The devices, which were actually code contained within the vehicles' software, allowed the cars to meet emission requirements while they were being tested but far exceed them in regular use. Horn said that while the company offers its ""sincere apology"" for the use of the defeat devices, corporate leadership in Germany believes that the installation of these devices was the work of a few rogue engineers. The company is ""conducting a worldwide investigation,"" said Horn, and ""responsible parties will be identified and held accountable.""""To my understanding, this was not a corporate decision, this is something individuals did,"" said Horn. He also said that to his ""best knowledge today,"" no one in company's U.S. operations knew about the defeat device until last month, after a group of scientists at West Virginia University brought the issue to light.Subcommittee Chair Timothy Murphy (R-Pa.) told Horn he found it ""amazing"" that the university's testers discovered the defeat device while VW's ""army of brilliant engineers and mechanics didn't know something was amiss.""Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas), pointed out that the company is known for being well-run.""I agree, it's very hard to believe, and personally I struggle as well,"" said Horn. Earlier in the hearing, Horn said the revelations ""do not reflect the company that I know and to which I have dedicated 25 years of my life.""Rep.
