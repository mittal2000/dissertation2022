At least that‚Äôs what one young woman did. In her poem ‚ÄúBread Thread,‚Äù 23-year-old Emily Weitzman talks about a time she was slut-shamed on an anonymous online forum when she was a freshman at Wesleyan University. She performed the poem at the 2016 Women of the World Poetry Slam this past March, but it was only recently uploaded to YouTube by Button Poetry. Weitzman describes logging on to the school‚Äôs anonymous online confession board in 2011, which was called ‚ÄúCollege ACB,‚Äù to find that the top post on the homepage was named ‚ÄúEmily Weitzman is a huge fucking slut.‚ÄùThe only way to move the article off the page was to create a new post that would populate to the top of the page as more people commented. So Weitzman‚Äôs friend created the Bread Thread, rightfully named: ‚ÄúI fucking love bread.‚Äù‚ÄúThe first post begins I fucking love bread,‚Äù Weitzman tells the crowd. ‚ÄúSomeone else adds, ‚ÄòI thought no one could relate to my obsession with bread.‚Äô Soon people were getting into friendly debates on what‚Äôs the best bread spread and playing games like fuck, chuck, marry with different types of bread.‚ÄùHer poem talks back to her bully with wit and perfectly-placed puns.‚ÄúListen up honeybun, my body is not your store-bought sour dough,‚Äù Weitzman says, referring to her anonymous bully. ‚ÄúAnd as for your slut-shaming I will have plain naan of it. Even if you were gluten-free I wouldn‚Äôt call you a prude. My body is no one else‚Äôs bagel, my hips are my buttered croissants, my breasts are my two loaves of ciabatta, my heart is my scone, my vagina my waffle.‚ÄùIn a truly fantastic ending, Weitzman likens bread to sex and shuts her slut-shaming hater down for good: Like my bread, I‚Äôll take my sex however I like it. Some days I want to fuck like a sweet muffin, other nights more like a twisted pretzel. But you should not be concerned with my preferences in bread. My body is not your ingredient.Weitzman told The Huffington Post she didn‚Äôt write the poem until last year.‚ÄúIt was really cathartic and empowering to perform this poem and reclaim power over my body and sexuality through humor and bread,‚Äù she said, adding: ‚ÄúPlus I really do fucking love bread!‚ÄùSo, how do you deal with trolls? Kill them with kindness... or bread. "

African school and university curricula traditionally haven‚Äôt contained a lot of East Asian history, literature or geography. Because of colonialism African education was generally focused on Europe, and later the U.S., and after the end of the colonial era, there were attempts to counter this bias by focusing a lot more on Africa. That hasn‚Äôt left a lot of energy or resources to focus on Asia. This means that Africans simply know less about China as compared to say France or the U.K.In second place, despite the fact that Africa has been the victim of the way the colonialists divided the world into ‚Äúcivilized‚Äù and ‚Äúuncivilized‚Äù zones, Africa has also been strongly influenced by Western views of East Asia. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, Western people have portrayed Asia as strange, exotic, disturbing, decadent and so on. Some of this bias has stuck in Africa. We frequently see remnants of this European colonial view of Asia popping up in African discussions about East Asia as a whole and China in particular.Another reason is simply the fact that people are simultaneously impressed and freaked out by how successful China has been.

4,BUSINESS,"Companies Should Be Forced To Disclose Climate Risk, Unilever CEO Says",Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/unilever-climate-risk_us_577e74b2e4b0344d514e261f,‚ÄúWe must hold each other to account on #ParisAgreement.‚Äù,2016-07-07,"Paul Polman, chief executive officer of Unilever Plc, speaks during a session on the final day of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Jan. 24, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577e8afe1a00002700dd005f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Unilever chief Paul Polman said Wednesday that all companies should be forced to disclose to shareholders any risk that climate change might pose to their business.‚ÄúClimate change reporting should be mandatory for businesses,‚Äù Polman wrote in a tweet that linked to a Brookings Institution talk on delivering on the goals of the Paris climate accord. ‚ÄúWe must hold each other to account on #ParisAgreement.‚Äù Polman‚Äôs call for regulation on this issue fits into a larger pattern of growing pressure ‚Äï especially on firms in heavily polluting industries ‚Äï to tell investors about any risks posed to their business by climate change and by efforts to curb it.More than half of the 20 largest U.S.-listed energy and industrial companies don‚Äôt disclose information about the potential costs they might suffer as a result of climate change, according to a report published last November. Since then, more than 180 countries signed a historic climate treaty in Paris to limit climate change, new research found that sea levels are rising at a faster rate than in the last 28 centuries, and state attorneys general began investigating companies that allegedly withheld information about the dangers of climate change.Left unchecked, climate change could upend human civilization within the next century, swallowing coastal cities as sea levels surge, displacing millions of people and unleashing destructive storms as weather becomes more extreme and less predictable. That poses a risk to virtually every business. Meanwhile, efforts by lawmakers to combat climate change pose yet another risk to companies, like oil firms, that make money from products that pollute the environment.A few of the world‚Äôs biggest oil companies ‚Äï including U.S. giants Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Valero Energy ‚Äï are starting to tell investors that their businesses could take a hit from climate change, according to a review of recent public filings with securities regulators.It‚Äôs notable for the chief executive of a company with a market capitalization of about $142 billion to advocate for more stringent rules for reporting financial information. Polman has come to be known for his aggressive advocacy on corporate sustainability, so it‚Äôs not clear whether his latest remarks will make much of a splash. But he provides a model for other executives who might want to reject a Milton Friedman-esque, profit-above-all mindset and instead embrace a worldview that recognizes the need for long-term sustainability, even if it costs money in the short term. The 59-year-old Dutch executive is not exactly the tree-hugger type. Polman, who spent 27 years at Procter & Gamble and is rarely seen without a suit, is as corporate as they come. He started out as a cost analyst at P&G before joining Nestl√© in 2006 as chief financial officer. Three years later, he jumped ship to Unilever, the consumer goods giant behind Axe body spray, Dove soap and Hellmann‚Äôs mayonnaise. He‚Äôs been chief executive of Unilever since then. A year after coming to Unilever, Polman set up the Sustainable Living Plan, a strategic blueprint aimed at doubling the size of the business while halving its environmental footprint. To achieve that, the company aims to use 100 percent renewable energy to power its operations by 2030 ‚Äï a goal its North American and European factories have already met. It‚Äôs also reworking products to reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills. Polman, today a firebrand of corporate sustainability, can often be found stumping for better industry practices at major gatherings of business leaders. ‚ÄúHe wants to transform corporations such as his from the Aunt Sallies of environmental and social campaigners ‚Äï from being the bad guys who run sweatshops and ransack the rainforests ‚Äï into good guys who improve both working conditions and the environment,‚Äù Fred Pearce wrote in a profile of Polman for The Telegraph in 2013. ‚ÄúAnd he believes there is money in altruism.‚ÄùSo far, it appears to be working. Shares of Unilever hit a record high in 2015, and the business ranked 41st on Fortune‚Äôs list of most admired companies this year. The firm saw its profits rise 6.8 percent last year despite slumping sales in emerging markets, particularly China.But Unilever still has a long way to go. Almost exactly a year ago, the company became the target of a viral parody of Nicki Minaj‚Äôs ‚ÄúAnaconda‚Äù skewering the firm for exposing people in Kodaikanal, India, to toxic mercury contamination from one of its factories. The spill was linked to at least 45 deaths. Unilever did not respond to a request for comment Thursday."

7,THE WORLDPOST,Marshall Islanders Set To Become Climate Refugees Before International Law Can Catch Up,"Renee Lewis, Refugees Deeply",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marshall-islands-climate-refugees_us_577e7996e4b01edea78cc4bc,"As warming seas climb their shores, Marshall Islanders face becoming climate refugees before the international community",2016-07-07,A woman and a child walk through knee-deep water to reach their home during a king tide event on Kili in the Marshall Islands in January 2015.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As warming seas climb their shores, Marshall Islanders face becoming climate refugees before the international community can decide what rights, if any, that status confers.Sandbags surround the Majuro airstrip while hurriedly-built bridges span flooded sections of road, and many Marshall Islanders have built seawalls to protect their homes on this remote nation in the Pacific Ocean.The Marshall Islands are made up of five main islands and 29 coral atolls spread across three-quarters of a million miles of ocean, but they amount to just 70 square miles of actual land. And even that is now at the mercy of the seas, which are rising thanks to climate change.The United Nations has predicted sea levels will rise by up to three feet by 2100 if global carbon emissions continue unchecked, and a recent paper published in the journal Nature said this estimate should be doubled to more than six feet because of ice melt in Antarctica.The Marshall Islanders seem destined to become climate refugees as the whole country threatens to disappear below sea level by the end of the century. And the seas are rising faster than international law can adapt. There is no international recognition of people displaced by climate change as refugees, leaving them without legal protection or rights.The average elevation in the Marshall Islands is six feet, with many areas just above sea level. In recent years the ‚Äúking tides‚Äù ‚Äì two especially high tides that come each year at around the same time ‚Äì have swept through the streets of the capital, Majuro. King tides never used to swamp the atoll; now they do.Entire rows of damaged and abandoned homes can be seen in some areas of the atoll. About 170 miles southwest, Kili island has been flooded so regularly that its residents are thinking about leaving for good.‚ÄúIf we lose our islands, we would become aimless refugees,‚Äù said Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, a Marshallese poet and climate activist who lives in Majuro. ‚ÄúWe could be the first to leave our entire country, our entire home.‚ÄùTwo years ago, Jetnil-Kijiner was invited to speak at the United Nations Climate Summit in New York, where she called on world leaders to take action to save her island nation.

And even that is now at the mercy of the seas, which are rising thanks to climate change.The United Nations has predicted sea levels will rise by up to three feet by 2100 if global carbon emissions continue unchecked, and a recent paper published in the journal Nature said this estimate should be doubled to more than six feet because of ice melt in Antarctica.The Marshall Islanders seem destined to become climate refugees as the whole country threatens to disappear below sea level by the end of the century. And the seas are rising faster than international law can adapt. There is no international recognition of people displaced by climate change as refugees, leaving them without legal protection or rights.The average elevation in the Marshall Islands is six feet, with many areas just above sea level. In recent years the ‚Äúking tides‚Äù ‚Äì two especially high tides that come each year at around the same time ‚Äì have swept through the streets of the capital, Majuro. King tides never used to swamp the atoll; now they do.Entire rows of damaged and abandoned homes can be seen in some areas of the atoll. About 170 miles southwest, Kili island has been flooded so regularly that its residents are thinking about leaving for good.‚ÄúIf we lose our islands, we would become aimless refugees,‚Äù said Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, a Marshallese poet and climate activist who lives in Majuro. ‚ÄúWe could be the first to leave our entire country, our entire home.‚ÄùTwo years ago, Jetnil-Kijiner was invited to speak at the United Nations Climate Summit in New York, where she called on world leaders to take action to save her island nation. She read one of her poems that describes the threat that faces the Marshallese people.‚ÄúTell them we are a proud people toasted dark brown as the carved ribs of a tree stump.Tell them we are descendants of the finest navigators in the world.Tell them about the water, how we have seen it rising.Tell them what it‚Äôs like to see the entire ocean level with the land.‚ÄùIf displaced because of rising seas, the Marshall Islanders ‚Äì like anyone put in this position by climate change or natural disaster ‚Äì would find themselves in legal limbo.

Her public backing for the real estate mogul comes after her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, who originally led the party, expressed his support for Trump in February.‚ÄúIf I were American, I would vote Donald Trump,‚Äù he wrote on Twitter Saturday in French. ‚ÄúBut may God protect him!‚Äù Political analysts have previously compared Trump and Le Pen over their extreme views on migration, Christian values, climate change and patriotism. A New Yorker headline in December 2015 declared that ‚ÄúDonald Trump is now America‚Äôs Marine Le Pen.Le Pen voiced her rejection of the comparison to Trump, however. ‚ÄúI am not American,‚Äù she told the news channel BFMTV. ‚ÄúMe, I‚Äôm not [former French President] Nicolas Sarkozy, OK? I am not American. I am French. I defend in France all the French, whatever their origin, whatever their religion.‚ÄùThe French nationalist has called for putting an end to the reception of migrants in France and for tightening border controls.‚ÄúWhatever the European Union might say, it is essential that France recover the control of its national borders, once and for all,‚Äù the populist said following November‚Äôs terror attacks in Paris. ‚ÄúWithout borders, neither security nor protection are possible.‚ÄùLe Pen has gleefully and publicly supported Britain‚Äôs exit from the EU. She hopes that the move commonly called a Brexit would bolster her eurosceptic agenda in France. In a YouGov survey carried out in March for HuffPost France, 32 percent of French respondents said they believed Le Pen to be the political figure who most resembled the American billionaire, far ahead of political rivals Sarkozy (10 percent) and Bernard Tapie (9 percent).A version of this piece was originally published on HuffPost France. It has been translated into English and adapted for a U.S. audience.Editor‚Äôs note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ‚Äï 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ‚Äï from entering the U.S."

I‚Äôm afraid there may be another war if we irritate Russia further with our talk that we want to become a NATO member,‚Äù said Avtandil Maisuradze, a 69-year-old pensioner in Tbilisi.Georgia is a test case for how Western governments will treat Ukraine, which, like Georgia, wants to join NATO and the European Union but is also jealously regarded by the Kremlin as part of its sphere of influence.IMPATIENCEU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, on a visit to Tbilisi this week before he travels to the NATO summit, urged Georgians to be patient.‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt view this as a moment of despair, moment of setback, I would view this as a continuing process,‚Äù Kerry said.NATO continues to say Georgia is on a path to membership. The alliance has opened a training center in Georgia as a part of a package of measures to boost Georgia‚Äôs defense capabilities, and Georgia takes part in joint exercises with troops from NATO member states.But for some Georgians, anything short of a timetable for accession is not enough.‚ÄúThe frustration is widespread, as the false expectations on fast track NATO integration created by the political elites did not materialize,‚Äù said Kornely Kakachia, a director of the Georgian Institute of Politics.Opinion polls conducted by the National Democratic Institute show steady growth in support for Georgia joining the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union ‚Äî up to 20 percent in March 2016 from 11 percent in August 2013.Political forces that are openly pro-Russian have a good chance of winning seats the Georgian parliament in an election to take place in October this year - something that was unimaginable few years ago.In local elections in 2014, several pro-Russian parties, including the Alliance of Patriots and the Democratic Movement, between them received around 20 percent of the nationwide proportional vote.Nino Burjanadze, the leader of Democratic Movement, which is campaigning on giving Georgia neutral ‚Äúnon-bloc status‚Äù, said disillusionment with NATO membership was helping boost her support.Burjanadze used to be a senior ally of former president Mikheil Saakashvili, who set Georgia on its pro-Western path. But she since changed tack. She visited Moscow for talks with Russian officials three times over the past year.‚ÄúThe Georgian authorities and a significant part of the country‚Äôs political elite act pursuant to the interests of NATO and the United States, instead of in Georgia‚Äôs interests,‚Äù said Burjanadze.(Additional reporting by Robin Emmott in Brussels; Editing by Christian Lowe and Richard Balmforth)"

In an interview with the Financial Times, International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde said Britain‚Äôs vote last month to leave the European Union already threatens to stymie economic growth. And the sorts of tariffs and trade barriers pushed by the presumptive Republican presidential nominee ‚Äï including pledges to shred major trade pacts, like the North American Free Trade Agreement ‚Äï would make things much worse. ‚ÄúI think it would be quite disastrous actually,‚Äù Lagarde told the Times. ‚ÄúWell I don‚Äôt think I should say disastrous because that is an excessive word and I should refrain from excessive words. But it would certainly have a negative impact on global growth.‚Äù Trump laid out his trade policies in a speech in Pennsylvania at the end of June. He put forward a seven-point plan that he said would help American workers, arguing that they‚Äôve been let down by weak politicians who are happy to see manufacturing jobs move to other countries. Trump is far from the only politician who has been critical of trade. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has frequently questioned U.S. trade agreements with developing countries. And three of Trump‚Äôs seven policy points were proposed months ago by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee.But Trump is the only candidate to offer such a starkly mercantilist vision for America ‚Äï promising to put a massive tariff on Chinese goods imported into the U.S., build a wall at the Mexican border and deport the country‚Äôs 11 million undocumented immigrants.Lagarde pointed out that in the past, ‚Äúwaves of protectionism‚Äù ‚Äï which she said ‚Äúhurts growth, hurts inclusion and hurts people‚Äù ‚Äï had also ‚Äúpreceded many wars.‚Äù ‚ÄúI hope it is not a 1914 moment and I hope that we can be informed by history to actually address the negative impact of globalization in order to leverage the benefits that it can deliver,‚Äù Lagarde said, alluding to the outbreak of World War I. ‚ÄúBecause it has historically delivered massive benefits and it can continue to do so.‚ÄùIndeed, concern over the possibility of another world war is on the rise amid a number of simmering regional conflicts in which major global powers are involved. Two years after war broke out in Ukraine between the government in Kiev and Russian-backed (or, reportedly, Russian) forces, the death toll continues to mount. The civil war in Syria, where Russia- and U.S.-backed factions are battling each other, Islamic State extremists and the government of Syrian President Bashar Assad, is well into its fifth year. China continues to jockey for power in the South China Sea, building fortified islands and flexing its growing naval muscle at U.S. allies like the Philippines and Japan. Editor‚Äôs note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ‚Äï 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ‚Äï from entering the U.S."

But they can change.,2016-07-07,Grocers and retailers throw more than half of their food waste in the trash.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577d63b41900002400219a97.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Supermarkets seem like an unlikely agent of social change. But they will be critical allies in the fight to get a handle on the United States‚Äô food waste problem.This crisis is at the center of The Huffington Post‚Äôs ‚ÄúReclaim‚Äù campaign, which launched last week to highlight the scale of food waste issues and work with our audience to address them. Despite one in seven U.S. households struggling to afford regular, healthful meals, the country throws away 40 percent of all food produced. Supermarkets tossed out 43 billion pounds of food, worth about $46.7 billion, in 2010 alone, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The problem spans all sectors of the food industry, but change at the grocer level can ripple outward in two directions ‚Äï back along the supply chain, to the farmers, and forward toward shoppers, whose buying habits are the ultimate catalyst for reform.It‚Äôs worked before. Last year, the cage-free egg movement reached critical mass as chain after chain of restaurants vowed to stop using eggs laid by hens kept in cramped battery cages. Activists said the next turning point would come when supermarkets started to ban non-cage-free eggs from their shelves. Sure enough, Walmart ‚Äï the nation‚Äôs largest grocer by far ‚Äï announced plans in April to rid its supply chain of cages by 2025.David Coman-Hidy, executive director at animal welfare nonprofit The Humane League and a driving force behind the cage-free egg campaign, declared Walmart‚Äôs move a ‚Äúhistoric‚Äù decision that symbolically delivered ‚Äúthe closing argument on the era of battery-cage confinement.‚ÄùPlus, there‚Äôs already a model that could be imported from Europe to address food waste in supermarkets. In February, the French Senate unanimously voted to ban large grocers from throwing away food that‚Äôs approaching its expiration date, instead requiring the retailers to compost or donate unsold and nearly expired goods to charity. Soon after, the politician who backed the legislation began work on getting the European Union to pass a law to limit food waste across the 28-country bloc. In March, Italy followed suit with a similar law.Though nowhere near as comprehensive as the European legislation, several bills recently introduced in Congress aim to reduce the amount of food that supermarkets toss in the trash.The Food Recovery Act, introduced by Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine) in December, would beef up federal ‚Äúgood Samaritan‚Äù laws, which protect grocery stores that donate unsold food to food pantries from being sued if recipients get sick. A Senate version of this bill was introduced by Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) in June.In addition, the Food Date Labeling Act, introduced by Pingree and Blumenthal in May, would establish a uniform system for setting expiration dates on food. There are currently no federal laws regulating food date labels, and the labels that grocery shoppers find on their food can be confusing. As a result, people end up tossing perfectly good food that they think has gone bad.If passed, the proposed legislation would require food producers to mark food with a label indicating quality (‚Äúbest if used by‚Äù) or one indicating safety (‚Äúexpires on‚Äù). Ideally, standardization would create more clarity for shoppers who struggle to understand what labels mean. Experts estimate that making date labels uniform could save up to 398,000 tons of food every year.‚ÄúI think we have a moment right now with [the Food Recovery Act] and with the date labeling act,‚Äù Emily Broad Leib, director of Harvard‚Äôs Food Law and Policy Clinic, told HuffPost last month. ‚ÄúIt feels like there‚Äôs a real opportunity to make progress and I‚Äôm hopeful that we won‚Äôt miss this opportunity.‚ÄùThere are other ways supermarkets could cut down on waste. The problem is that grocers don‚Äôt have a uniform system of measuring the amount of food thrown out along the way from the farm or food manufacturer to store shelves.‚ÄúOne of the challenges is that measuring food waste is still pretty nascent,‚Äù said Meghan Stasz, senior director of sustainability for the Grocery Manufacturers Association, an industry group that represents food brands like Nestl√© and Campbell‚Äôs. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like the early days of carbon emissions or energy use. It‚Äôs not a standard industry-wide business practice to measure your food waste yet.‚ÄùAs such, grocers are notoriously reluctant to release any internal data. To address that, Stasz and her group set up the Food Waste Reduction Alliance, a consortium under the GMA umbrella, to encourage companies across the industry to begin quantifying their waste.There are three main ways to do this. A company, particularly a restaurant or catering firm, could hire a relatively affordable service like Portland, Oregon-based LeanPath, which provides tools and software to log and track food waste. On the more expensive side, there are waste management companies that run a full audit of a store‚Äôs trash. Then there‚Äôs the cheap, low-tech option: emptying a dumpster and performing an amateur audit.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre encouraging companies to get started in some way, even if that‚Äôs turning over a dumpster,‚Äù Stasz said. ‚ÄúOnce companies are confident in the accuracy of their data, they‚Äôll be much more willing to report it publicly. Right now, it‚Äôs a lot of extrapolation.‚ÄùMore stories like this: We Waste An Insane Amount Of Food. Here's What You Can Do About It. "

Clinton used a private email server for some of her official business as secretary of state, which may have compromised sensitive information. Petraeus, who resigned in disgrace from the CIA in 2012, knowingly shared classified information ‚Äï war strategies, intelligence capabilities, conversations with President Barack Obama ‚Äï with Paula Broadwell, his lover and biographer.‚ÄúThe Petraeus case, to my mind, illustrates perfectly the kind of cases the Department of Justice is willing to prosecute,‚Äù Comey said.Petraeus initially lied to the FBI about his violations, but then confessed to them as part of a plea agreement. The Justice Department ultimately charged him with a misdemeanor violation, despite the FBI recommending he be prosecuted.‚ÄúIn that case, you had vast quantities of highly classified information ‚Ä¶ not only shared with someone without authority to have it, but we found it in a search warrant, hidden under the insulation in his attic, and then he lied to us about it during the investigation,‚Äù Comey said. ‚ÄúSo you have obstruction of justice.

He stood by the agency‚Äôs yearlong investigation that found Clinton to be ‚Äúcareless‚Äù with her emails but not guilty of something that warrants criminal charges.‚ÄúMy conclusion was and remains no reasonable prosecutor will bring this case ... in 100 years, on gross negligence,‚Äù Comey said. ‚ÄúI know that‚Äôs been a source of confusion for some folks.

Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.) contrasted Capitol custodians' speedy reaction with lawmakers' inaction on national water infrastructure problems exposed by the water crisis in Flint, Michigan. ""I understand the concern that my colleagues and their staffers have expressed,"" Kildee, who represents Flint, said in a statement. ‚ÄúBut for Flint residents, who have had high levels of lead in their water for two years, it is long past time that Congress get serious about this serious health threat.""Flint has had high lead levels since 2014, when the state government changed the city's water source and failed to account for the corrosiveness of the new water, which leached massive amounts of lead from the city's old pipes. Eighteen months later, a local pediatrician discovered lead levels had spiked in the blood of the city's kids, forcing the government to admit its mistake and tell people not to drink the water. Legislation to help Flint and other cities replace lead pipes stalled in the Senate earlier this year. ""Helping Flint families ought to be as much of a priority as ensuring safe water and health for those who work on Capitol Hill,"" Kildee continued.Lead is a poisonous metal that can cause miscarriages, stunt children's growth and damage their brains. Water in the Cannon House Office Building exceeded the Environmental Protection Agency's 15 parts per billion threshold for lead, the AOC reported last week. The agency told lawmakers and their staff not to drink the water.The EPA's threshold is based not on health but on regulatory feasibility, since there are as many as 10 million lead pipes in American cities and little political will to pay for removing them. Instead, federal regulations require public water systems to treat water to reduce its corrosiveness. Scientists say there is no safe amount of lead exposure. The AOC said in a statement Wednesday that it hadn't yet identified the source of the lead but that it would ramp up its water sampling efforts throughout the Capitol complex. Water lead typically comes from service lines that connect buildings to water mains or from a building's internal plumbing. It's not clear yet why Cannon would have high lead levels but other buildings on the Hill wouldn't.""Careful analysis of the water testing data, identification of the source of the lead, and making appropriate corrections will take time,"" the AOC said.

The UT flagship, in Knoxville, Tennessee, announced a settlement of $2.48 million on Tuesday to eight women who sued the school, claiming it mishandled sexual assault cases. All of the women remained anonymous, but several of them accused student athletes of assault and argued the university was biased in favor of its celebrated football and basketball players. It‚Äôs up to the plaintiffs‚Äô law firm to figure out how much each plaintiff will receive.In exchange, the plaintiffs agreed to drop the suit. They also agreed not to sue again over these claims, and neither they nor their lawyers will say anything to cast the university ‚Äúin a negative light.‚Äù The women also cannot contact any member of the football or basketball team for the next three years unless it‚Äôs for a court proceeding. The university said it likewise will instruct employees not to speak unfavorably about the plaintiffs, and that student athletes should avoid any direct contact with the women who sued UT. Within 60 days, the university must appoint a commission full of ‚Äúindependent, unaffiliated, nationally recognized‚Äù experts on federal compliance to help reform how UT handles sexual misconduct.But the settlement does not obligate the university to provide advocates for rape victims or experts in sexual violence, making it more likely the university would hire consultants instead. Given the stipulation that the experts must be ‚Äúnationally recognized,‚Äù it‚Äôs likely UT may pick Pepper Hamilton, a law firm that recently conducted a scathing review of Baylor University‚Äôs handling of football players committing rape, or the NCHERM Group, another firm frequently hired by colleges for sexual misconduct policies.The school could choose other consultants ‚Äï like S. Daniel Carter, who is well-respected by advocates, and lobbies on Capitol Hill ‚Äï but it‚Äôs unclear what credential would meet the settlement‚Äôs requirement for prominence.The settlement agreement did stipulate a couple specific changes to address charges of bias in favor of football team members. UT will no longer provide a list of possible lawyers for student athletes accused of misconduct, like rape or assault, ‚Äúeven though the practice did not violate any law or NCAA rule,‚Äù the settlement states. The university may refer accused student athletes to a local bar association instead. Additionally, students will no longer be appointed to serve on disciplinary hearing boards in sexual assault cases unless both the accuser and accused agree to it, but this policy will need to be approved by the Tennessee legislature‚Äôs joint government operations committee before it can be fully implemented.The settlement agreement says nothing about whether athletes will be able to delay hearings in order to finish athletic seasons and transfer, as the original lawsuit alleged the school was allowing.

A related measure aimed at punishing repeatedly deported immigrants also failed.Though the issue of immigration has raged on the campaign trail, neither measure won the simple majority needed to advance in the upper chamber.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) brought the two bills to the floor ‚Äï the sanctuary cities legislation, authored by Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), and the other to establish a five-year mandatory minimum sentence for repeatedly deported immigrants who try to return to the U.S., offered by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas).Toomey has leaned into the immigration debate heavily during his re-election campaign. Ahead of Wednesday‚Äôs vote, he reminded the Senate that both bills were inspired by the ‚Äúhorrendous‚Äù shooting of 32-year-old Kathryn Steinle last year in San Francisco. Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, an undocumented immigrant who had previously been deported five times, was charged in Steinle‚Äôs murder.‚ÄúNow, why in the world would the San Francisco law enforcement folks release a seven-time convicted felon, five-time deported person who was known to be dangerous and in the face of a request from the Department of Homeland Security? Why would they release such a person?‚Äù Toomey asked. ‚ÄúBecause San Francisco is a sanctuary city.‚ÄùDemocratic Senate candidate Katie McGinty, who is challenging Toomey, criticized the incumbent over the bill, claiming it would have cut nearly $40 million in federal funding for Philadelphia ‚Äï another sanctuary city.Supporters of sanctuary cities argue that they actually increase public safety: Undocumented immigrants are more likely to bring information to local police when they don‚Äôt fear they‚Äôll be outed to federal authorities. Other Democrats assailed the Republican leadership for bringing the bills to floor when they‚Äôd failed in the past, accusing them of crafting a schedule to boost presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump ahead of the Republican National Convention.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no reason to waste more time on Trump‚Äôs agenda,‚Äù Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said.Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) piled on, asking why the Senate needed to vote on the sanctuary cities legislation when it had voted on the same issue just last October.‚ÄúThey need them before the convention,‚Äù Durbin said. ‚ÄúThe U.S. Senate should not have its members serve as extras in a Trump campaign ad.‚Äù"

Trump began courting the party‚Äôs wealthy elite in the final week of May, soliciting donations for the Trump Victory and the Trump Make America Great Again joint fundraising committees. Those two committees collect contributions for the Trump campaign and the RNC. The Trump Victory committee also solicits money for a handful of state party committees.Trump raised $26 million online and through direct mail and an additional $25 million at high dollar events. The candidate also contributed an additional $3.8 million of his own money to the campaign, a Trump press release stated.The division of funds between the Trump campaign and the RNC is unknown at this time.These totals are short of the $68.5 million that Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, raised for her campaign and the Democratic Party in June. Clinton also started June with a massive cash on hand lead of $42 million.That vast disparity has allowed the Clinton campaign to fund a staff of hundreds of organizers in key swing states and run over 20,000 television advertisements. Trump, meanwhile, has only just begun to cobble together an outreach and organizing program and has run exactly zero ads since the end of the primary campaign.After reporting a paltry cash on hand total entering June, Trump issued a statement declaring that his campaign's fundraising was ""incredible"" and that he continues ‚Äúto see a tremendous outpouring of support for Mr. Trump and money to the Republican Party.‚ÄùThe campaign did not report how much cash it had on hand at the end of June.Trump will require an unprecedented surge in fundraising to come close to catching up with the well-funded and well-oiled Clinton machine in the coming months. His June haul should be a good start, but it vastly trails the amount raked in by 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney after he secured the nomination.June was also Romney's first full month as the presumptive Republican nominee. He raised $68.3 million for the Romney Victory committee -- which shared money with his campaign, the RNC and four state parties -- and an additional $24.3 million exclusively for his campaign. On top of that, the RNC raised $12.7 million independent of Romney‚Äôs fundraising efforts. That means Romney and the committees he raised money for raked in $105.5 million in June 2012 alone -- more than double what Trump has raised in his first month on a general election campaign.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

But Blair can't shirk responsibility.,2016-07-06,British former prime minister Tony Blair's preferred reading of history overlooks one of the key findings of the Chilcot inquiry: that the risk of violent militancy was clear back in 2003.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577d32f61500002a006c9e1f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Tony Blair, Britain's former prime minister and George W. Bush's chief ally in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, spent Wednesday playing defense after a damning government inquiry blasted his decision to go war. The 2.5 million-word Chilcot report that was years in the making accused Blair of trusting flawed intelligence, demonstrating bad judgment and resisting peaceful alternative ways to deal with Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. Relying on previously undisclosed documents and seven years' worth of research, the inquiry offered a resounding critique of Blair's approach to Iraq.What did the former prime minister offer? Platitudes and attempts to evade responsibility.He began with a written statement that tried to shirk responsibility for British casualties in the war. Blair suggested that the official report proved he was acting in good faith when he chose to join former U.S. President George W. Bush in arguing for the invasion. Soldiers' families aren't likely to buy that: They said in a news conference after the release of the inquiry they remain committed to legal recourse and will scour the lengthy report for further basis for their case.The once-popular politician then tried to dodge blame for another consequence of his push to topple Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein: The current state of Iraq. Blair insisted in his written statement and a later appearance that he does not believe the invasion caused the current terrorism devastating countries in the Middle East.This claim is equally egregious -- and a lot easier to disprove, given the mounds of evidence of the invasion's impact. Blair got a couple of things right. Hussein was himself a source of terror for millions of his own people, particularly the U.S.-friendly Kurds and Iraq's vast Shiite Muslim community. The dictator also sheltered and promoted militants active in the West, Israel and Iran. His deliberate deepening of sectarian divides in Iraq and development of paramilitary organizations with ultra-conservative ideological views are largely overlooked reasons for why Iraq became an incubator for organizations like the so-called Islamic State, also known as ISIS. And Iraq today, after his fall, is one of the few quasi-functioning democracies in the Middle East.But Blair, Bush and other cheerleaders of the Iraq War played a critical role in making the country less stable and helping foment terrorist groups like ISIS. Western mismanagement of Iraq after 2003 encouraged thousands of skilled Iraqis to take their expertise to the anti-American insurgency that eventually became the Islamic State group, according to most Middle East watchers.And Blair's preferred reading of history overlooks one of the key findings of the Chilcot inquiry: that the risk of violent militancy was clear back in 2003.Hussein had at that point effectively controlled Iraq for more than 30 years. First tasting great power as the country‚Äôs intelligence and internal security chief, he invested heavily in making Iraq a police state, with loyal, well-trained agents of his Baath Party government as numerous in the country as conspiracy theories about their activities. He also focused on making his army a formidable force, appointing Sunni Arabs ‚Äî members of his own sect of Islam and a minority in Iraq ‚Äî to leadership positions. Hussein‚Äôs rule forced those soldiers and officials to become even closer to the despot, because they, like many other people in the centralized quasi-socialist state that was Iraq, were reliant on government salaries, subsidies and favor.Bremer quietly left the country 14 months later, handing over power to an interim government in which 85 percent of Iraqis said they lacked confidence. Much of their discontent back then had to do with Iraq‚Äôs security problems. U.S. officials told The Washington Post Bremer‚Äôs decision to disband the Iraqi army exacerbated this situation.One of the men who lost his job was a key architect of the Islamic State, according to a major report in the German magazine Der Spiegel.Der Spiegel published a story last year based on captured documents that appear to belong to ISIS. Those documents discuss a man known to the militants as Haji Bakr. His real name ‚Äî by which he was known when he served in Hussein‚Äôs air force intelligence services ‚Äî was Samir Abd Muhammad al-Khlifawi.Der Spiegel spoke about Bakr with Iraqi researcher Hisham al-Hashimi, who has advised the Iraqi government. Hashimi said that Bremer‚Äôs move left the onetime Hussein loyalist, already possibly radicalized under the Iraqi dictator during the 1990s, tilt toward conservatism, ‚Äúbitter and unemployed.‚ÄùThe report continues: Bakr, a top adviser to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, died in 2014. Bakr had firmly established Baghdadi‚Äôs pre-eminence within the group, helped them seize key towns in Syria and played a major role in the group‚Äôs split from the central al Qaeda leadership in Pakistan and its affiliate in Syria by then, according to Der Spiegel‚Äôs story and an analysis of Islamic State comments in The Long War Journal.That last move was central to the Islamic State‚Äôs claim to statehood and global leadership over Muslims. It is also thought to have enhanced the group‚Äôs prestige among radicalized youth from around the world, thus making it more attractive to potential recruits.A Washington Post investigation confirmed the importance of former Hussein figures like Bakr in the overall Islamic State structure.‚ÄúEven with the influx of thousands of foreign fighters, almost all of the leaders of the Islamic State are former Iraqi officers, including the members of its shadowy military and security committees, and the majority of its emirs and princes, according to Iraqis, Syrians and analysts who study the group,‚Äù the Post reported."

The new plan, announced by her campaign Wednesday, incorporates a major plank of Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-Vt.) platform and is a direct result of the private meeting Clinton had with the Vermont senator in June, the campaign said. Clinton's new proposals move her beyond previous statements that she would try to make college ""as debt-free as possible"" and toward making ""debt-free college available to all.""Clinton is adding three features to her plan for higher education policy, called the ""New College Compact."" They include eliminating tuition at in-state public universities for families making under $125,000 by 2021 and restoring year-round Pell Grant funding so students can take summer classes to finish school quicker. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley (D) proposed a similar plan of making college debt-free within five years when he was still running for the Democratic nomination as well. Year-round Pell Grants would also help students who must pay tuition to get credit for internships that are required for graduation, including unpaid ones that typically happen during the summer. The year-round grants were cut as part of a 2011 budget deal, but the White House has since pushed to restore funding for them. Pell Grants, which do not have to be repaid and go to lower income students, already cover the smallest portion of the cost to attend college in their four-decade history.Americans owe more than $1.3 trillion in student debt, larger than any other type of consumer debt aside from mortgages. The share of borrowers who are more than 90 days late on their student loan payments doubled in the past 12 years.Clinton also promises to issue a three-month moratorium on federal student loan payments as an executive order once she gets into office. The ""time-out"" from paying back federal loans will give borrowers time to work with the U.S. Department of Education to set up income-based repayment and debt forgiveness options. The Obama administration has faced criticism that too few borrowers were using existing options to reduce federal student loan debt.Clinton's embrace of one of the most popular parts of Sanders' platform comes as she is trying to get his core supporters -- including many young people worried about college debt -- to enthusiastically support her candidacy in November.Sanders gained huge support among young voters by pushing for tuition-free public colleges nationwide, and Clinton now says she would do that for families making less than $125,000.Sanders welcomed Clinton's announcement Wednesday, calling it a ""bold initiative.""‚ÄúThis proposal combines some of the strongest ideas she fought for during the campaign with some of the principles that I fought for. The final product is a result of the work of both campaigns,"" he said. ‚ÄúLet me be very clear. This proposal, when implemented, will revolutionize the funding of higher education in America, improve the economic future of our country and make life immediately better for tens of millions of people stuck with high levels of student debt.""Her shift is also reassuring to many progressives who were concerned that she may moderate in the general election as she tries to win over independent or Republican-leaning voters who may be turned off by Republican Donald Trump. Sanders is technically still in the race and has not yet endorsed Clinton, although he said he will support her.A national goal of debt-free college was outlined in a white paper by Demos, a left-leaning think tank, and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, an advocacy group. Over the past year the idea has gained widespread support among Democrats. Last year, a group led by Sens. Brian Schatz (Hawaii), Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) and Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) introduced a resolution seeking to ensure that students who attend public colleges and universities can graduate without debt. And currently, there's legislation to advance that goal."

This is just one of many anecdotes in Rolling Stone's new feature on the brilliant host who has taken late-night television by storm.The feature profiles Bee's journey from rebellious Toronto schoolgirl to ""Daily Show"" badass correspondent to where she is now: arguably the ballsiest and most devastating host on late-night television. The fact that she's ""female as f*ck"" in a sea of dudes doesn't hurt, either. ""I remember being terrified,"" she told Rolling Stone's Alex Morris, of joining ""The Daily Show"" as a correspondent in 2003. ""I had no idea what the job actually entailed, and no one really has time to baby-step you."" But Bee ultimately settled into a role on the show that would prepare her for the gutsy work she does now on her own weekly series: traveling around the country to obscure locations to interview the likes of gas-industry experts, tobacco farmers, and criminologists (like the interview below, in which she discusses police shootings).But another major benefit of being on ""The Daily Show"" was working with writer Jo Miller -- who is now the head writer for ""Full Frontal."" According to Bee, when Jon Stewart announced that he would be leaving ""The Daily Show"" in early 2015, ""Jon loved Jo and believed in her for sure, but I don't know how imminently anyone was ready to offer her up her own show."" But that's exactly what Bee did. And when it came to hiring the rest of her writing team for ""Full Frontal,"" she took the same approach. Bee said:I have literally filled my office with people who have been underestimated their entire careers. To a person, we almost all fit into that category. It is so joyful to collect a group of people who nobody has ever thought could grasp the reins of something and fucking go for it.According to Rolling Stone, she made the job application accessible to those who might not have had a background in TV writing, and used a ""blind application process."" Hiring a team of writers that actually represents the country whose stories she's telling has -- take note, Hollywood -- delivered remarkable results. And so has having a platform to deliver her fierce monolgoues and biting interviews on subjects ranging from gun control to online harassment of women.

""The Classic has long surpassed the average lifespan for a smartphone in today‚Äôs market,‚Äù Pini said. ‚ÄúWe are ready for change so we can give our customers something better.‚ÄùBlackBerry devices like the Classic have long been the smartphone of choice for business executives and world leaders for their security and full keyboard.The Classic, just one of three remaining phones in BlackBerry's stable that has a full QWERTY keyboard, was released in 2014 with high expectations. As the smartphone landscape became dominated by touchscreen-only devices, the Classic was aimed at snapping up traditional keyboard fans. Before the market domination by the touchscreen-only Android and iPhone, BlackBerry phones stood out with their proprietary instant messaging application and full QWERTY keyboard; flip phone and bar phone users at the time were left sending clunky text messages with T9 typing. Yet even amid the high expectations for the Classic, BlackBerry's prospects as a phone manufacturer were already in trouble. At its peak in 2011, the company shipped 52.3 million devices, according to Reuters; Apple, meanwhile, sold 72 million iPhones that same year. Six months after the launch of the Classic, BlackBerry's overall market share of mobile phones was just 0.3 percent, according to market research analyst IDC.""If they‚Äôre going to base their turnaround on anything, it‚Äôs probably not going to be on devices,‚Äù said Will Stofega, an analyst with IDC. BlackBerry's signature security features were part of its undoing and ultimately undermined their device sales, according to Andrew McDonnell, vice president of security for the information technology and security firm AsTech Consulting.Secure information on BlackBerrys could be accessed with an encryption key, McDonnell explained. ""That means once the key is out in the wild, it could be used over and over again for anyone who has it. And the key can‚Äôt be redesigned.""McDonnell said that kind of built-in ""permanent back door"" caused concern among users, particularly given situations like the FBI's recent attempts to compel Apple to break into the iPhones belonging to the San Bernadino shooters. Around 2010, governments in countries like Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Russia wanted the ability to monitor BlackBerry data in their countries, purportedly for national security purposes. To gain a foothold in foreign markets that had banned their products, BlackBerry (then known as Research In Motion) ultimately acquiesced and gave encryption keys to several foreign governments. ""The fact there was essentially a back door, from a security perspective, was doomed to be unusable in the long term,‚Äù McDonnell said. ""BlackBerry could help governments or anyone else eavesdrop.""And while security was a selling point to users who traded in sensitive information, it's practically a non-issue to average smartphone users who would rather have access to the latest apps than encryption service, Stofega said. ""The average [smartphone] user tends to think security is putting a passcode on their screen lock,"" Stofega said. ‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt really think about it until the worst thing happens.""Meanwhile, BlackBerry's shrinking market share offered little incentive for developers to make new apps -- or even adapt popular ones like Snapchat -- to the BlackBerry platform. ""Developers are swayed by markets. They want the biggest exposure for their applications,"" Stofega said.These days, he added, Android and iOS are the biggest games in town by a wide margin. ""If BlackBerry is going to make a comeback, it‚Äôs going to be on software and services and the ability to leverage some of the stuff they had from the old days."" "

Take the opening paragraph of today‚Äôs lengthy Vanity Fair feature on actress Margot Robbie:She is 26 and beautiful, not in that otherwordly catwalk way but in a minor knock-around key, a blue mood, a slow dance. She is blonde but dark at the roots. She is tall but only with the help of certain shoes. She can be sexy and composed even while naked but only in character. As I said, she is from Australia. To understand her, you should think about what that means.If you‚Äôre reading those sentences and thinking, hmmm, I know what those words mean separately but I don‚Äôt understand them strung together in that order, you‚Äôre not alone. Vanity Fair‚Äôs Rich Cohen is just one in a long line of male writers who seemingly become truly befuddled when confronted with the conventional beauty of a famous woman ‚Äï and subsequently take it upon themselves to ‚Äúfigure her out.‚ÄùCohen‚Äôs profile traces Robbie‚Äôs path to Hollywood fame from Aussie soaps and looks forward to her role as Harley Quinn in the upcoming ‚ÄúSuicide Squad.‚Äù But those stories are obscured by descriptions of Robbie ‚Äúwander[ing] through the room like a second-semester freshman,‚Äù and the way her hair fell ‚Äúaround those painfully blue eyes.‚Äù Six paragraphs in, we get a mention of her ‚Äúambition‚Äù but only in the context of how it was ‚Äúmasked‚Äù by her ‚Äúbeauty and speed of ascent‚Äù into fame.Everyone wants to read a celebrity profile with a little color ‚Äï after all, these pieces are meant to give us some insight into who these famous humans actually are beyond the glamorous Instagrams and publicity-driven soundbites. But what does a writer‚Äôs lust for an actress‚Äô ‚Äúpainfully blue eyes‚Äù really tell us about that actress?The thing is, we know what Margot Robbie looks like! She stars in movies! She is photographed frequently! Those photographs appear on the covers of magazines ‚Äï like Vanity Fair!Flowery, borderline skeezy descriptors about the looks of female celebs have practically become de rigueur for these types of long-form profiles ‚Äï Sky Ferreira ‚Äúlooks like a dirtier Madonna‚Äù with ‚Äúkiller tits‚Äù (LA Weekly), Megan Fox is ‚Äúa screen saver on a teenage boy‚Äôs laptop, a middle-aged lawyer‚Äôs shower fantasy‚Äù (Esquire), Sofia Vergara has ‚ÄúColombian curves‚Äù (also Esquire). And yet, it‚Äôs something we rarely see employed when exploring the lives and psyches of famous men.As a thought experiment, writer and editor Donna Dickens swapped out Alexander Skarsgard‚Äôs name for Robbie‚Äôs.‚ÄúYep. Still creepy,‚Äù she tweeted. Famous women are expected to be beautiful at a bare minimum. When a female celebrity is young, that beauty is a puzzle to be solved by the men who gape at it. When she ages, it‚Äôs something she has lost, or worse, something she has attempted to hold onto by other means, in which case we accuse her of losing herself. (See: Renee Zellweger.)So, major magazines who commission these celebrity profiles: Next time you have the opportunity to dive into the life of a fascinating famous women, hire a writer who cares to see past the subject‚Äôs eyes.

The former ‚ÄúFox & Friends‚Äù co-host alleges that Ailes fired her for rejecting a sexual relationship with him. Similar stories echo through Gabriel Sherman‚Äôs 2014 biography of the media magnate, titled The Loudest Voice in the Room.When television producer Randi Harrison interviewed with Ailes for a job at NBC in the 1980s, she said he offered her an extra hundred dollars a week if she agreed to have sex with him whenever he wanted, according to Sherman. Ailes, then president of CNBC, also reportedly made a pass at producer Shelley Ross while interviewing her for a job. She accepted the position after he apologized. Ailes later called her a ‚Äúmilitant feminist‚Äù when asked about the interview. People on set with Ailes recalled him demanding that on-air female personalities show more skin. One unnamed Fox News senior executive told Sherman that Ailes wanted ‚ÄúCrier Report‚Äù host Catherine Crier to stop wearing pantsuits and start showing off her legs, as Ailes had bought her a glass desk explicitly for that purpose. Fox News anchor Bob Sellers told Sherman that he once heard Ailes make similar comments about co-anchor Kiran Chetry when a laptop was blocking her legs from view.Fox News has dismissed Sherman‚Äôs book, claiming it was ‚Äúnever fact-checked with Fox News.‚Äù But you don‚Äôt have to rely on his book alone. Ailes has been open about sexualizing his female employees.He told The Associated Press in 2011 that he hired former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin ‚Äúbecause she was hot and got ratings.‚ÄùIn an interview the same year with Esquire, Ailes bragged about transforming Amy Kellogg from a woman with ‚Äúglasses or something,‚Äù ‚Äúthe wrong hair,‚Äù ‚Äúno makeup‚Äù and ‚Äúfunny clothes‚Äù into an acceptable on-screen reporter:‚ÄúI saw through all of it and I said, ‚ÄòAmy, you‚Äôre very attractive.

In 2004, host Bill O‚ÄôReilly settled out of court after one of his female employees allegedly recorded him sexually harassing her. And the network has repeatedly run segments defending cat-calling and critiquing women‚Äôs clothing choices.‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need a full trial to know that Fox News, as an institution, is ideologically geared towards minimizing, defending, and even promoting sexual harassment and the objectification of women,‚Äù Salon writer Amanda Marcotte wrote on Wednesday. ‚ÄúUnder Ailes‚Äô leadership, Fox News has put a premium on protecting a man‚Äôs ‚Äòright‚Äô to harass and demean women.‚ÄùIn the hours since Carlson‚Äôs lawsuit was announced, ‚Äúat least ten‚Äù other women have contacted the law firm representing her to speak about Ailes‚Äô treatment, a spokesman for the firm told CNN.Fox News‚Äô parent company has announced both its confidence in Ailes and its decision to begin an internal review."
44,POLITICS,Feds Move To Block North Carolina From Enforcing 'Bathroom Bill',Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-carolina-bathroom-bill_us_577d2b2de4b09b4c43c1cc7b,"The Department of Justice called the anti-trans law ""state-sanctioned discrimination.""",2016-07-06,"The federal government has countersued North Carolina to halt enforcement of parts of House Bill 2, which dictates which bathrooms transgender individuals can use.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577d2eb9150000ed026c9e10.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The U.S. Department of Justice has asked a federal judge to block North Carolina from enforcing parts of H.B.2, the controversial law requiring people to use public bathrooms corresponding to the sex on their birth certificate.‚ÄúH.B. 2 denies transgender people access to sex-segregated bathrooms and changing rooms consistent with their gender identity unless they can produce an amended birth certificate,‚Äù wrote lawyers for the department in the motion, filed late Tuesday, which contends that enforcement of the law violates federal civil rights statutes.The voluminous filing ‚Äï which was accompanied by dozens of exhibits and declarations from experts and trans people affected by the law ‚Äï is the latest in the federal government‚Äôs legal pushback against North Carolina, which began with a stern letter from DOJ to Gov. Pat McCrory (R) in May.H.B. 2 has also sparked a number of competing lawsuits, all of which will probably take years to resolve. DOJ, in its Tuesday filing, asserted that the interests North Carolina and its agencies have pushed in following through with the so-called bathroom bill ‚Äï including concerns for privacy and protection against sexual predators ‚Äï ‚Äúare factually baseless and legally insufficient to justify this discrimination.‚Äù ‚ÄúAs the record shows, transgender people in North Carolina have long used bathrooms consistent with their gender identity in private facilities and, before H.B. 2, in public facilities, without precipitating criminal conduct or widespread complaints about the invasion of privacy,‚Äù the lawyers wrote.‚ÄùH.B. 2 is not merely a solution to a non-existent problem; it is state-sanctioned discrimination that is inflicting immediate and significant harm on transgender individuals,‚Äù they added.The battle over H.B. 2 is seen as the latest frontier in the ongoing struggle over strengthening rights and protections for LGBT people, which scored its biggest win yet last year when the Supreme Court recognized that gay couples have a constitutional right to marry.But certain states and supporters of the bathroom bill also regard the fight as the Obama administration‚Äôs newest push for federal agencies ‚Äï such as the Department of Education and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ‚Äï to adopt an aggressive reading of anti-discrimination laws, which forbid discrimination on the basis of sex but don‚Äôt squarely address transgender discrimination.To that end, DOJ pointed in its Tuesday filing to a watershed ruling that agreed with the federal government‚Äôs reading of the ‚Äúsex‚Äù provision of Title IX, one of the laws at issue in the litigation, as encompassing discrimination against trans individuals. That ruling came from the federal appeals court that covers North Carolina.The department said that the ‚Äúcontrolling logic of that decision‚Äù and other rulings on the proper meaning of sex discrimination mean the federal government will likely win its challenge against H.B. 2.Whether the federal judge in this particular case agrees will be known soon. In the meantime, the same issues are coming to a head elsewhere in the country.On Wednesday, Texas and 12 other states filed their own motion ‚Äï in another federal court ‚Äï asking a judge to block the federal government from using civil rights laws to protect trans individuals."
45,POLITICS,Democrats Were Never All That Concerned About The Clinton Email Scandal,Samantha Neal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-email-scandal-poll_us_577d1857e4b09b4c43c1bd7b,Polls show that Democratic voters are largely unaffected by the investigation.,2016-07-06,"Hillary Clinton attends a campaign rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Tuesday, the same day the FBI announced it would not recommend charges against her over her email practices as secretary of state. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577d18f41800002500fa4244.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Despite belief that Hillary Clinton's email scandal would be calamitous for her presidential prospects, polling suggests that Democratic voters' perception of Clinton has not been significantly impacted. The incident instead seems to register most saliently with Republican voters.Over half of all voters considered Clinton‚Äôs use of a private email address on a personal server while secretary of state ‚Äúunethical,‚Äù according to a Morning Consult poll. When the data is broken down by party, however, only 36 percent of Democrats called it ‚Äúunethical,‚Äù compared to an overwhelming 85 percent of Republicans. According to the same poll, only 24 percent of Democrats perceived the scandal as ‚Äúa major problem,‚Äù whereas over three-fourths of Republican voters did.This partisan divide naturally translates to voting tendencies. According to a poll by Suffolk University/USA Today conducted at the start of the investigation into Clinton‚Äôs private email server, 74 percent of Democrats said Clinton's actions did not matter in their vote, whereas 79 percent of Republicans said it did matter. Less than half of independent voters said that it impacted their vote.Polls also suggest that Democrats do not consider the email scandal a relevant indicator of Clinton's ability to govern effectively. According to a CNN/ORC poll conducted directly after the scandal broke, 46 percent of all voters said that the way Clinton handled her email while serving as secretary of state was an important indicator of her character and ability to serve as president, while 52 percent said it was not relevant. When the data is represented by party identification, however, the results are not nearly as split: three-fourths of Democrats said the incident was not ‚Äúrelevant to character,‚Äù whereas more than 6-in-10 Republicans said that it was.Although Clinton‚Äôs gradual decline in favorability ratings suggests that she failed to escape the FBI investigation unscathed, she still retains a 5-point lead against Trump, according to our HuffPost Pollster average. However, traces of the scandal are still reflected in public opinion.The words ‚Äúliar/dishonest‚Äù were ranked highest overall by voters to describe Clinton in a Suffolk/USA Today poll. But this characterization also had a partisan flavor. Among Republicans, these words were indisputably ranked highest -- 73 percent of GOP voters said this was an apt description, whereas only 8 percent of Democrats agreed. Among Democrats, however, the adjectives ranked as best describing Clinton were ‚Äúsmart/intelligent/knowledgeable.‚ÄùFBI Director James Comey announced Tuesday that ‚Äúno charges are appropriate"" in Clinton's case, formally ending the bureau's investigation into her handling of classified emails on a private server. However, Republicans in Congress are now calling for new independent counsel to probe the former secretary of state's practices once more. The lasting impact of the email scandal on Clinton's public perception remains to be seen. "
