0,POLITICS,Fixing Our Food System Shouldn't Be A Partisan Issue,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/food-system-a-libertarian-case_us_57e54614e4b0e80b1ba1907a,Addressing some of our nation's most pressing food issues isn't about establishing a nanny state.,2016-09-23,A cow stands in a barn on a Wisconsin dairy farm. There are many problems with America's food system -- and new food rules may not be the key to fixing them.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e580831a00002c005b43ff.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Whether it’s the massive amount of food we waste, the burden large agribusinesses places on our environment or the staggering number of children who go to bed hungry every night, the American food system is obviously quite far from perfect.The question of how to address the above failures is, of course, a tough one. In fact, it’s a question so tough it’s gone mostly ignored, so far, in the presidential contest.The answers that some call for involve the implementation of further regulations for farmers, food manufacturers and consumers alike, and advances in these areas are often touted as successes by “good food” activists like Michael Pollan, author of Food Rules and The Omnivore’s Dilemma.But not all food rules are good food rules, and many regulations concerning the American food supply have actually had a negative impact on food producers, particularly small ones, while incentivizing instead the sort of practices preferred by larger, corporate producers.Such is the argument laid out by food writer, attorney and professor Baylen J. Linnekin in his new book, Biting the Hands that Feed Us, out this month.In just one example, Linnekin points out how the cosmetic standards laid out by the EPA and USDA and adhered to by many retailers result in countless pounds of “ugly” but otherwise delicious produce — an estimated half of all the produce grown in the U.S. — going uneaten.The book makes a strong case that the biggest issues facing our nation’s food supply are ones deserving of bipartisan solutions — and that those solutions might actually entail fewer, better food laws instead of a spate of new ones.The Huffington Post recently spoke with Linnekin.What was the inspiration behind your new book? Who did you write it for?Obviously, I would never have written the book if I didn’t think sustainability in our food system wasn’t an important goal. But I think people look at sustainability as something that must be supported always by stricter and stricter, more and more, greater and greater regulations. I think that would turn off anyone who identifies as a conservative or libertarian and I think that’s too bad. As I point out in the book, this is not the case.I think I’m appealing to the people on the ideological right to recognize that there are ways to have a sustainable food system that don’t involve the government telling us everything to do. I’m also pointing out the ways that some on the right, like Michele Bachmann, the former representative of Minnesota, are big recipients of farm subsidies and are hypocrites on these issues. And to the people on the left, I’m suggesting that not all regulations are bad. The book is about how some regulations are bad, and if we’re unwilling to repeal the bad regulations that harm the food system you want to exist, I think you need to take a long, hard look in the mirror.This is, essentially, a conservative case for fixing our food system. Would you agree with that assessment?I should stress that I identify as a libertarian and not a conservative. There are people that I portray in the book, like Thomas Massie, a more libertarian-minded member of Congress who raises grass-fed beef on his farm in Kentucky, who has co-sponsored legislation with Chellie Pingree, a stalwart liberal member of Congress who is, likewise, an organic farmer who lives on an island off Maine. I think that’s a great example of the actual food movement, the people who really care about the small farmers on the ground and the individuals that want to make their own food choices, rather than the sort of politicized food movement. They recognize that so many regulations value large producers over small ones, wasting food and getting in the way of people growing fruits and vegetables in their own yards.None of these are political issues that belong to either the Democratic or Republican or Green or Libertarian Party. These are issues everyone can, should and does care about. I’m not trying to discourage people from getting too “political” about their food, but I think that when some of the ideology gets in the way of recognizing that there is room for collaborating with people who you don’t agree with on some issues to create meaningful change, you’ve got blinders on. I hope this book will be a way to look at food regulations and food sustainability in a different way such that people will come to see others, whether they be Republicans or Democrats, as a partner on food issues instead of this sort politicized enemy.In your book you discuss food waste reduction efforts as a promising example of bipartisanship on this. Could food waste activism provide a model of collaboration going forward?We certainly need less partisanship on issues like this. Some of the good food rules I cited in the book are ones that have tackled food waste. The Emerson Act was named after a Republican congressman who passed away before that law took effect and was sponsored during the Clinton administration, which was not exactly an era of cooperation, but was very successful in the Republican House, and President Clinton signed it gladly. The PATH Act was sponsored by [Republican] John McCain and several Democrats. Those are both efforts to increase food donations with the ultimate goal of reducing both hunger and food waste.I think food safety is another area where there’s a divide, particularly on the left, between supporters of local food and supporters of increased food safety. I don’t know exactly how to bridge that schism between people like Pollan who identify as local food supporters and people like Marion Nestle who are more aligned with food safety rather than local food. I think my appeal would be for food safety supporters to rally support for regulations that actually make our food safer.You do criticize some individuals and programs typically revered by the food movement — not only Pollan, but also the Michelle Obama-backed Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, as two examples. Were you nervous to air these critiques of folks held dear by many who would be considered your book’s target audience?I wasn’t the least bit nervous. I think that disagreement and debate is healthy. I’m certainly not lashing out at Pollan [for his support for the Food Safety Modernization Act] or calling him names. I think it’s important to add to the discourse and constructively dialogue with one another. With the first lady and the National School Lunch Program, it’s important to point out that the idea that the first lady created food waste in the program is absurd, but it’s worth noting that food waste has increased due to some of the measures in the act.There is obviously a lot of work to be done to get both these “bad” food laws repealed and “good” ones passed. What do you think all of us can do, as consumers and eaters, to speed up progress?Some of the things I talked about in the book include the role of consumers in, say, ugly fruits and vegetables. The regulations the USDA and EPA have established make wasting the “ugly” fruits and vegetables often times easier than actually picking them at the farm and trying to sell them. The government’s at fault there, full stop. But it’s also incumbent upon consumers to change their behavior and recognize that.Now, I’m not a food anarchist and this is not a book about eliminating all rules. This is about eliminating the bad ones, but also changing our own behavior and expectations to also improve the food system and make it more sustainable.Are you optimistic that we are on a path toward a better food system?I think I am optimistic. I think there is a growing interest and understanding about food and sustainability, and people increasingly care about this even if it’s not sort of traditionally in their political or ideological wheelhouse. I think that trend will only continue.If you look back maybe 10 years — even 5 years — food waste, for example, was an issue very few people were talking about and now it’s very much at the forefront of the food system. As I note in the book, if food waste were a country in terms of how much waste it contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, it would be the third largest country in the world, behind the U.S. and China in terms of its GDP. I think that shows the potential impact reducing our food waste from the 40 percent we currently waste to even cutting it in half would have on both the food issue and climate change.If readers take one thought away from reading your book, what do you hope that will be? I hope that people who are skeptical of sustainable food because they think it’s a system that requires billions of new regulations will read this book and come to embrace sustainability in food not as something that requires this huge new regulatory structure, but as something that would actually benefit from deregulation in many ways.And I hope supporters of sustainable food who I think are sometimes guilty of thinking we just need more rules will instead recognize that the people arguing against more regulations aren’t always wrong and that perhaps these two groups can meet somewhere in the middle and hold hands and eat a sustainably raised, grass-fed hamburger.This interview has been edited for length and clarity. ―-Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food and water.

Although he drew on his gay friend’s experience in writing “Rise Now,” he added, “I decided to make it more universal so that anyone could relate to it.” Kassam was born in Ivory Coast and spent several years in Paris before he relocated to New York. His international background has influenced what he calls a “multifaceted” sound, which is also inspired by Michael Jackson, Queen and Chaka Khan. Noting that his mission is about “world commitment” and “striving for global equality,” he told The Huffington Post that the LGBT community has “accepted me for who I am, and I can relate to their struggle.” “Rise Now,” he added, has personal resonance, too. “As ironic as it was, I realized this song was also about me coming forward as an artist and owning my music,” he said. ​Head here to read more about Jamil Kassam.

2,ENTERTAINMENT,'Network' Came Out 40 Years Ago And Trump Is Proof It Still Matters,Jenna Amatulli,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/network-came-out-40-years-ago-and-trump-is-proof-it-still-matters_us_57e48e36e4b0e80b1ba156af,"Decades after the award-winning film first hit screens, we continue to be mad as hell ... and are still taking it.",2016-09-23,"Actor Peter Finch as television news anchor Howard Beale in ""Network.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e4954b1800002d009a47be.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The relationship we have with the media is a complicated one. We binge, hate-watch, cry, and laugh with characters familiar and unfamiliar. We equally suspend our disbelief and get all swept up in it. Few films have summarized (and satirized) this relationship as well as the movie “Network” ― a shocking feat when you remember that the film came out in 1976.Still, “Network” remains a provocative and influential film that acts as both a timepiece and a terrifying crystal ball.  The film follows respected anchorman Howard Beale, who we’re introduced to just as he gets fired from the network he works for, UBS. Distraught, Beale announces that he’s going to kill himself on air à la Christine Chubbuck, sending ratings through the roof. The black dramedy then takes many wild turns beginning with the ratings-hungry TV executives keeping Beale on the air as he mentally breaks down night after night. Other plot points include the beautiful, albeit heartless, reporter Diana Christensen (played by Faye Dunaway) thriving off Beale’s personal downfall, seducing another TV executive before getting him fired, and hiring a pseudo-Symbionese Liberation Army-type group to murder Beale on air as a way of kick-starting their next serialized program. The story is unbelievable and entrancing, while also nausea-inducing.It feels absurd but somehow possible because as far-fetched as it seems, it also hits a little too close to home. In the 40 years since the film came out, we’ve seen the live broadcasts of ISIS beheading journalists, “Survivor” contestants well up with tears as they ingest live insects, and Donald Trump, the real estate mogul and one-time host of “The Apprentice,” running for the president of the United States (with an alarming amount of support).“Network” is and will always be successful for its ineffably on-point prediction of how far television, media, and even our political climate could go.  Director and writer Aaron Sorkin brought up a salient point when discussing the film with the Times: “You wish Chayefsky [the writer of ‘Network’] could come back to life long enough to write ‘The Internet.’”There’s no question that Paddy Chayefsky’s take on 2016’s social media-obsessed, screen-covered world would make Orwell’s “1984” look primitive. “Network” personifies the ‘70s well ― highlighting the era’s counterculture, anti-establishment and leftist feelings, fixations on Patty Hearst and the Mansons, hippies. Despite all of this, it shines the most when highlighting the perversion viewers feed off of as they watch television ― a perversion that has now extended to surfing the web and scrolling through our phones. That inimitable feeling of enticing viewers by constantly asking the question: “How far will they go?” “Network” is an articulate indictment of American audiences.It’s easy to recognize the fictional UBS station in the film in major stations like today’s FOX, particularly when you think of the absurdity FOX has housed over the years. From reality and talk shows to all of the other types of variety programming, the station has put out a slew of questionable broadcasts. Shows like “American Idol” or “The X-Factor” highlight the obsession we have with becoming famous. Those are tame by comparison to shows like “I Want To Marry Harry,” where women were rallied and tricked into thinking they were vying for the love of Prince Harry, or even “Nanny 911,” which brought a British nanny into the homes of parents with “unruly children” and had her harshly calling out their ineptitude for rearing children, all while millions of other families relished in it. Schadenfreude is what drives so much of our media consumption, and “Network” plays with that fact in glorious ways.Today, Howard Beale’s iconic “mad as hell” speech isn’t a joke or an exaggeration anymore. It’s real. People are dying in the streets and we’ve been apathetic, but Trump is convincing so many Americans to get mad.Our current political climate has its very own Beale in Trump.Trump’s wall and reality star-cum-politician career path sounds insane to many of us because he’s a real-life Beale. A fact that is only solidified when people describe him like this:“Every critic, every detractor, will have to bow down to President Trump. It’s everyone who’s ever doubted Donald, who ever disagreed, who ever challenged him. It is the ultimate revenge to become the most powerful man in the universe.” ― OmarosaTo describe our media landscape, as a whole, is to say that it is seductive, entertaining, divisive, corrupting and desensitizing. “Network” is a didactic work of art that reminds us of the media’s wiles, making it the sort of film that should be brought into classrooms around the world. Whether you’re of the generation that adored “Dr. Strangelove” or “The Colbert Report” or “Black Mirror,” one that preferred the movie star Ronald Reagan in the White House over the racist, apoplectic Donald Trump, “Network” unpacks a media that has only grown more exploitative as years have gone on and will surely have viewers new and old walking away wondering why we’ve only veered closer to that dystopia.David Foster Wallace summed up the movie’s great thesis, without ever intending to. Particularly if you think of “TV” standing in for film, news channels and the internet. During a 1993 interview pertaining to his essay “E Unibus Pluram,” he said: “TV’s ‘real’ agenda is to be ‘liked,’ because if you like what you’re seeing, you’ll stay tuned. TV is completely unabashed about this; it’s its sole raison… It’s seldom acknowledged that viewers’ relationship with TV is, albeit debased, intricate and profound.”Will you stay tuned?"
3,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Endorsed By Campaign Finance Reformers,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-campaign-finance_us_57e45147e4b0e28b2b532700,Every Voice is backing a presidential candidate for the first time.,2016-09-23,Hillary Clinton picked up an endorsement from the campaign finance reform group Every Voice.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e452751700002a00ac685a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The campaign finance reform organization Every Voice made its first endorsement in a presidential election on Friday, backing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.Every Voice, which used to be known as Public Campaign Action Fund, has endorsed candidates from both parties in congressional and state elections in the past, but never before has it inserted itself into a presidential race.David Donnelly, CEO of Every Voice, told The Huffington Post the group is endorsing Clinton because of her platform to reform campaign finance.Clinton’s reform platform includes support for legislation to create a public campaign financing system for congressional elections, disclosure legislation or, in the meantime, executive orders or actions to increase transparency of independent money, and appointing judges who support reform principles. She has also promised to propose a constitutional amendment overturning Supreme Court decisions deregulating campaign finance, including the 2010 Citizens United ruling.“If you look at all the different aspects of what’s wrong in our campaign finance system, there’s no one silver bullet policy that addresses all those different things,” Donnelly said. “You need a comprehensive approach to tackle the myriad of problems and she does that.“She does it by addressing increased participation through a small donor matching system,” Donnelly continued. “She does it through either through a constitutional amendment or appointing judges who will help to revisit the decisions in this area. She does it through more transparency and better administration of campaign finance laws. She really has covered the waterfront in terms of the breadth of her policies.”Republican nominee Donald Trump routinely bashes the role of donors and special interests in politics, but has so far offered no policies or solutions. Instead, the Republican Party platform calls for the repeal of many existing campaign money limits.Every Voice has in the past spent money directly to help elect candidates for the House and Senate. The reform group will work to get Clinton elected, Donnelly said, but he wouldn’t elaborate.Recent history is filled with presidents who have promised to reform campaign finance in some form or another and failed to deliver. President Jimmy Carter promised to fix the campaign finance landscape after the Supreme Court’s historic 1976 Buckley v. Valeo ruling limited what the government could do to control election spending. He failed to act quickly and was ultimately rebuffed by a disinterested Congress. In 1992, President Bill Clinton ran on a platform in support of reducing political action committee spending. While Clinton met with members of Congress early in his administration, there was no consensus for reform and other issues quickly took precedence.President Barack Obama famously ran on overturning the normal order of special interest favors in Washington. His administration has instead seen the near complete breakdown of normal order on campaign finance. He launched a new era of big money in elections by becoming the first nominee in a presidential election to turn down public funding for the general election in 2008. During the 2012 election, both Obama and GOP opponent Mitt Romney raised and spent over $1 billion. The Supreme Court’s Citizens United ruling ― no fault of his own ― unwound certain limits on corporate election spending and led to skyrocketing spending from nonprofits and the creation of super PACs. The Federal Election Commission, never the most operational agency, broke down amid deep ideological division. And despite pressure from numerous activist groups and their members, Obama has not signed an executive order to increase disclosure of independent spending or appointed commissioners to the Securities and Exchange Commission in favor of a rule requiring publicly traded corporations to disclose their election spending.Clinton comes into the role of campaign finance reform proponent with suspicion from some quarters. She will likely raise more than $1 billion by Election Day and relies on super PACs to a greater degree than Obama did in 2012. Her fundraising from billionaires, lobbyists and corporate executives was one of the biggest criticisms of her during her primary fight with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) ― whose campaign finance proposals were nearly identical to Clinton’s.Donnelly, a veteran of many of these reform fights, is well aware of the history and promises. He said Every Voice’s endorsement is not “a blank check.” Clinton, he noted, “has long participated in” the campaign finance system, but “we need to see political leaders who will stand firmly on the side of voters for far-reaching reform, even as they work within the current rules.”“We’re very explicit in this statement that while we are fully 100-percent supportive in getting Hillary Clinton elected and helping to advance her platform ― which is our platform― in the next administration, we also won’t shy away from holding her accountable for falling short,” Donnelly said.He pointed to Clinton’s promise to introduce a campaign finance-related constitutional amendment within the first 30 days of her administration as a “pretty clear and pretty hard-and-fast pledge.” Every Voice’s endorsement is not entirely about Clinton and her platform. The group’s involvement at the presidential level is also driven by what Donnelly called the exclusionary rhetoric of Trump.“American democracy is one of inclusion,” Donnelly said. “It is the march towards expanding and broadening the franchise and expanding the role of everyday Americans in the decisions that impact our lives, and his language about religious groups is worse than dog-whistle politics. Outwardly using rhetoric that is racist and xenophobic and misogynistic compels us to say that this is not a leader of American democracy that we want to see have power in the White House. It’s broader than money in politics.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

6,POLITICS,Eric Trump Laughably Claims His Dad Built Business From 'Just About Nothing',Mollie Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/eric-trump-just-about-nothing_us_57e56515e4b0e80b1ba1cf3e,Donald Trump received major financial help from his own father.,2016-09-23,"Eric Trump thinks his father is the ""epitome of the American dream.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e56bc81700002a00ac6b46.jpeg?cache=8VKhyuUT7h&ops=crop_0_810_5184_2646%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump’s son Eric claimed Friday that his father built the Trump Organization from “just about nothing,” conveniently leaving out the fact that the GOP presidential nominee received significant investments and other support from his own father, real estate mogul Fred Trump.Eric Trump was asked on Fox News’ “Outnumbered” why he thinks millennials would relate to his father.“He’s been an entrepreneurial guy,” the younger Trump said. “He’s built an amazing company. He’s become the epitome of the American dream. He’s gone from just about nothing into, you know, a man who ...” “Nothing? He got a million bucks,” said co-host Julie Roginsky, referencing a loan from Fred Trump to his son to build a hotel in the 1970s. “Wait, come on.”“Listen, he’s built an unbelievable empire. He’s epitomized what America is all about ― opportunity and working hard and being able to achieve your dreams,” Eric Trump replied. “It’s no different than a Zuckerberg, who went out with a great idea like a Facebook and developed this idea and built it and grew it and grew it. That’s achieving something, right?”The claim that Donald Trump built his company from scratch is one that the GOP nominee himself has made.“It has not been easy for me, it has not been easy for me,” Trump said during a NBC town hall event last year. “And you know I started off in Brooklyn. My father gave me a small loan of a million dollars.”Aside from the fact that few would consider a million dollars a “small loan,” Trump’s retelling leaves out critical information on how his father helped him. As a Washington Post fact check laid out earlier this year, Donald Trump benefited greatly from his father’s connections.Fred Trump brought his son into an already successful family business, which he later took over. The elder Trump set up a trust that his son later borrowed against, helped him secure tens of millions of dollars in bank loans and provided other loans himself to his son. He once helped his son make an interest payment on an Atlantic City casino by buying up $3.5 million in gaming chips that he had no intention of using (that was later deemed an illegal loan).H/T: Associated Press’ Steve PeoplesEditor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

It came in the weeks after he delivered his famous “Red America, Blue America” speech at the Democratic convention in 2004. And the theories had nothing to do with his place of birth ― they had to do with his religion. In the summer of 2004, the conservative website Free Republic picked up a press release alleging that the up-and-coming state senator from Illinois was secretly Muslim. Obama’s office was aware of the post’s existence. But as Tommy Vietor, Obama’s aide at the time, noted, they treated it as a “subterranean issue,” the type that sparked more eye-rolls than intrigue. The assumption was that few would take it seriously.Twelve years later, those assumptions seem quaint. Conspiracy theories about Obama’s biography have morphed and persisted. And with Trump’s ascendance in the Republican Party and his years of unwillingness to firmly disavow the myth that Obama was not born in America, it’s clear to these same aides that the smears they tried to dismiss in 2004 and kill thereafter will likely never fully die.“I never imagined it would go this far and be taken seriously by credible people ― if you consider Donald Trump to be a credible person,” said Ben LaBolt, an aide in the 2008 campaign and the press secretary in 2012. “It is like Glenn Close in ‘Fatal Attraction.’ You think it is gone, but it keeps popping up in the craziest places.” The story of birtherism is not a story about Obama, since birtherism is a lie. It is a story about the difficult, often futile attempts to dispel a myth in an online age when there are more means and incentives to spread it. For those who have worked with the president, it is a nagging, demoralizing and often-shifting battle defined by its racist undertones. Birtherism began not as Trump asserts ― as an effort by Clinton’s 2008 campaign to delegitimize Obama ― but by those on the conservative fringe who were taken aback by the speed of Obama’s political trajectory. The setting was, initially, the 2004 Senate race. And the person doing the peddling was Andy Martin, a lawyer and occasional candidate known for feeling a bit more comfortable than most in the fever swamps of Illinois politics. Martin himself doesn’t deny the role he played. “When Obama gave the speech about the red states and blue states, there was something about him that didn’t ring true,” he recalled in an interview with The Huffington Post. “I had my old investigator’s hat on. I said, ‘I’m going to look into this guy.’ I picked up the phone and called my operation in London and said, ‘Do what you can to find dirt on Obama.’” But Martin stresses that he wasn’t questioning ― then or now ― Obama’s Hawaiian birth. Instead, he said, his goal was to pick apart other elements of Obama’s biography, including his father’s story and his religious upbringing. Obama’s aides were aware of it all. But those in the 2004 campaign were hardly distracted by the smears. Obama won in a landslide, one of the few Democratic bright spots that cycle. The real noise came three years later, as then-Sen. Obama launched his White House bid. This time, the rumors weren’t just about Obama’s religion (though a “Fox & Friends” segment alleging that he attended a madrasa remains a searing memory for veterans of that campaign) ― but about his origins, too. Martin, once again, was a catalyst. In 2007, he says, he wrote stories suggesting that Obama may have been born with Kenyan and American citizenship. He and others began calling for documentation of Obama’s origins.“Even though you know somebody was born somewhere, there may be something on a birth certificate,” Martin said. The conspiracy spread. Campaign staffers recall being forwarded email exchanges asserting their boss’ Kenyan birth. They were informal threads, the type passed along to relatives or within church groups. But it was enough to set off alarms, since the very instrument that had proved beneficial to the campaign ― the ability to galvanize people online ― was becoming a source of poison. Eventually, birtherism began showing up as a voter concern in the campaign’s internal polling. “I remember one morning ... we were talking it through in the meeting, that we had to go hard at it with every piece of pushback we have,” said Vietor.The campaign set up a website called “Fight The Smears,” which furnished information people could send back in response to the birther threads. It dispatched its research director, Shauna Daly, to compile a dossier of evidence to use for pushback against birthers. Eventually, the site posted Obama’s birth certificate online. But Martin, along with others, didn’t relent. He appeared alongside Sean Hannity (an appearance that would later play a pivotal role in the campaign) and filed a lawsuit in Honolulu to get a judge to release Obama’s birth certificate. But the percentage of people questioning Obama’s birthplace gradually diminished. In November, Obama was elected president and the world largely moved on. “It faded to the background when we got to the White House,” recalled Dan Pfeiffer, Obama’s former communications director. “The president was sued by Orly Taitz [another prominent birther] over this issue and I had to go to some meetings where [White House counsel] Bob Bauer would brief us on it. But it was not a real thing.”And then, Trump made it a thing again. The first step Trump took into that particular nether region came during a speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 10, 2011. Openly flirting with a presidential run, he declared that none of Obama’s former schoolmates could actually recall him as a classmate. The crowd loved it. A month later, Trump went on “The View.” “Why doesn’t he show his birth certificate?” he asked. Then, on the “Today Show”: “His grandmother in Kenya said he was born in Kenya and she was there and witnessed the birth.” On CNN, Trump announced that he was sending investigators to Hawaii. Later, he teased forthcoming revelations. Inside the White House, the news cycle went from comical to alarming to suffocating. “I remember that period very well, because there was a lot of real serious shit happening in the world, a European financial crisis, and the economy was in a bad place,” said Pfeiffer. “But Donald Trump kept going on TV and he would make these claims, and it was treated as: ‘Well, Trump says this.’ It wasn’t with great scrutiny. He was being given a bullhorn to shout racist shit without being called on it.” As it happened, Obama was at his home in Chicago during this period, staying overnight after a fundraiser. The president went through some boxes and found what he thought was his long-form birth certificate. It was a souvenir copy ― the type given out by hospitals ― and not an official document. But when he was back in Washington, he instructed Bauer to request the original version in “whatever quiet way a president could,” as Pfeiffer put it. Before the document arrived from Hawaii, Obama huddled in the Oval Office with his top aide, David Plouffe, along with Bauer and Pfeiffer, to plot out how to present the document. He wanted to make a statement. But it had to be to the full press corps, and they needed to keep it secret out of fear that cable news would start a countdown clock for a big reveal. They decided to make the announcement in the Brady briefing room and hand out photocopies of the long-form birth certificate beforehand. The appearance was originally planned for a Thursday, but events got in the way, Pfeiffer said. So they settled on Friday. “I know that there’s going to be a segment of people for which, no matter what we put out, this issue will not be put to rest,” Obama told the frantically gathered reporters. “But I’m speaking to the vast majority of the American people, as well as to the press. We do not have time for this kind of silliness. We’ve got better stuff to do. I’ve got better stuff to do.”Later that day, Trump landed his helicopter in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, still considering a White House run. He took credit for getting the long-form certificate made public.What the real estate mogul likely didn’t know then was the extent of the humiliation in store for him for spreading this conspiracy theory. Days earlier, Obama’s speechwriters had finished writing the remarks for the upcoming White House Correspondents’ Association dinner. It contained an extended roast of Trump and his persistent birtherism. Since Obama had already put out his long-form birth certificate, the writers worried that they’d have to ditch the concept. Instead, they revised a part the speech that involved a scene from “The Lion King” and refined a riff on “Celebrity Apprentice” that was written with the help of director Judd Apatow and blessed by Obama himself.Days later, Obama delivered the speech. The moment is now a part of political lore: A sardonic twisting of the knife, Trump sitting stoically during the roast, a slight grimace on his face. It was exactly what White House aides designed it to be: A public humiliation of Trump in a room full of people whose admiration he craved. “I was hoping he got annoyed,” said Jon Favreau, one of Obama’s speechwriters, who had the luxury of watching it play out from a table right behind Trump’s. “Because we were all annoyed with Trump. He had done this entire birther thing and made it an issue. We thought he was a fucking goofball.” The White House Correspondents’ Dinner of 2011 stunted birtherism’s resurgence. It would come up here and there on the campaign trail, with former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney even attempting a painfully forced joke. But having dismissed the conspiracy theory with a heavy dose of ridicule, Obama felt comfortable enough to co-opt it as well. His team sold coffee mugs with a copy of his birth certificate on it.“It became a rallying cry for our supporters to say, ‘This is how crazy the Republican Party has gotten,’” said LaBolt. Like most conspiracy theories, however, birtherism didn’t fully die. Nor, in that moment, did Obama effectively cast off Trump as a loony rumor monger. In fact, Trump’s associate, Roger Stone, said the 2011 dinner convinced him to run for office in 2016. The real estate mogul talked about his birther theories less frequently. But they continued to populate his Twitter feed and public statements, feeding fantasies and paranoia. It distinguished him in a crowded Republican primary in 2016, which he won, and followed him into the general election. One week ago, Trump finally stated his belief that Obama was born in America, without ever actually apologizing for perpetuating the myth ― only to later admit that he was merely trying to move the conversation to more friendly topics. The relentless fact-checking, the primary documents, and the dismissive, sarcastic put-downs had muted him. But it had not killed the conspiracy itself.  “It’s so funny,” said Favreau. “I’ve told the story of the correspondents’ dinner speech for many years afterwards, and before this election, I would always say, ‘And we never heard from Donald Trump again.’ That, clearly, proved not to be true.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Human Rights Council on Monday.The hard-hitting criticism - drawing a comparison between modern police behaviour and mob killings of blacks in the 19th and 20th centuries - comes at a time of renewed racial tension in the United States.This week Charlotte, North Carolina, saw street riots over the shooting of a black man, Keith Scott, by a black police officer. On Friday, a white police officer who fatally shot an unarmed black man turned herself into authorities in Tulsa, Oklahoma.“Contemporary police killings and the trauma that they create are reminiscent of the past racial terror of lynching,” said the report by the U.N. Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent.Most lynching victims died by hanging. A 2015 report by a non-profit organisation, the Equal Justice Initiative, said 3,959 black people were killed in “racial terror lynchings” in a dozen southern states between 1877 and 1950.The U.N. expert report was based on a visit to the United States in January by a five-member group chaired by Filipino law professor Ricardo A. Sunga III.Since the visit, anger over police tactics has risen as their fatal encounters with African-Americans, many of them unarmed, have sparked protests and unrest across the country.RACIAL LEGACYAlthough the United States has made efforts at reform, the group said it remained “extremely concerned” about the human rights situation of African-Americans.“In particular, the legacy of colonial history, enslavement, racial subordination and segregation, racial terrorism and racial inequality in the United States remains a serious challenge, as there has been no real commitment to reparations and to truth and reconciliation for people of African descent.“Impunity for State violence has resulted in the current human rights crisis and must be addressed as a matter of urgency.”Police killings go unpunished because initial investigations are usually conducted by the police department where the alleged perpetrator works, because prosecutors have wide discretion over presenting charges, and because the use of force is not subject to international standards, the experts’ group said.They recommended the United States create a reliable national system to track killings and excessive use of force by law enforcement officials, and end racial profiling, which is “a rampant practice and seriously damages the trust between African Americans and law enforcement officials”.To improve race relations, education should be “accompanied by acts of reconciliation” to overcome bigotry and past injustices, while federal and state laws should recognise the negative impact of enslavement and racial injustice, the report added.(Reporting by Tom Miles; editing by Stephanie Nebehay and Mark Trevelyan)"

Mehmet never left custody.Both will face trial “for trying to overthrow the government or prevent it from carrying out its duties,” media outlets said.Turkey has detained more than 100 journalists since July 15, when soldiers commandeered tanks and fighter jets, bombing parliament and other key buildings in an attempt to seize power.The brothers, outspoken critics of President Tayyip Erdogan, allegedly disseminated “subliminal messages suggestive of a coup attempt” during their TV appearance on July 14, the state-run Anadolu Agency said at the time of their first detention.Ahmet Altan, former editor-in-chief of the now-defunct Taraf newspaper, has denied the charges in a post on P24, calling them “nonsense”.The government blames followers of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen for masterminding the coup, but he denies involvement.Some 100,000 police, soldiers, judges and civil servants have also been sacked or suspended on suspicion of links to Gulen, drawing criticism from rights groups and Western allies who fear a wider attempt to silence dissent. Tens of thousands of civil servants are in custody.Turkish officials reject the criticism, saying the extent of the crackdown is justified by the gravity of the threat to the Turkish state on July 15. Those found not to have links to the coup plot will be released, officials have said.Left-leaning Taraf, one of dozens of media outlets closed since the coup attempt, was once supportive of Erdogan’s policies and his ruling AK Party. It has denied financial links with the Gulen movement.More than 200 writers worldwide, including Margaret Atwood, Russell Banks and JM Coetzee, and other public figures have signed a petition protesting against the arrests of the Altan brothers.(Writing by Ece Toksabay; Editing by Ayla Jean Yackley and Andrew Heavens)"

Her presence was significant, considering that the U.N. General Assembly dedicated this year’s summit to addressing the largest refugee crisis since WWII. After days of high-level meetings at the U.N., along with squeezing in training sessions at a local YMCA, the teen talked with The Huffington Post on Wednesday before she headed out for her flight to Berlin.Mardini said she is well aware of the magnitude of her task. She knows that “refugee” is considered an “ugly” word and how opposed so many communities are to allowing them into their countries. But for Mardini, who helped drag a dinghy for over three hours from Turkey to Greece after the engine died, there’s very little that intimidates her.When asked how she feels about people who fear refugees and want to close their borders to them, Mardini didn’t demur.“It’s OK,” she said. “I will change that.”Mardini is also well aware of how close she came to just being another statistic in the rising death toll of fleeing refugees. As of May, 2,510 people had died this year after their vessels capsized in the Mediterranean Sea. But due to her unique set of skills, her will to live and some sheer luck, Mardini survived a terrifying journey last year. She says she knows that her triumphant story now holds the power to change people’s perceptions.Mardini grew up in Damascus where she had a typical childhood and swam competitively. However, she said when people hear “refugee” they often presume she’s from some remote, disconnected place and wouldn’t even know what an iPhone is.Everything changed for her when the war broke out more than 5 years ago. In 2012, Mardini’s home was destroyed. In August of last year, she’d had enough. Together with her sister, Mardini flew to Beirut, Lebanon and then to Istanbul, where they met up with smugglers. They joined up with about 20 refugees in Izmir, Turkey and boarded a boat meant for about six people and began their journey to the Greek island Lesbos.When the engine died 20 minutes into the journey, Mardini, her sister and two men jumped in the choppy frigid water and began pulling the vessel along. Even after the men quit, Mardini and her sister kept going. More than three hours later, they arrived safely in Lesbos. But that was just the beginning of their trek.Over a total of 25 days, she traveled through six countries before arriving to a refugee camp in Berlin.Once there, Mardini said she spent about 12 hours a day waiting on lines to get her asylum papers.It was when she finally got the chance to start swimming again – ironically enough, at the pool built by Nazis for the 1936 Olympics – that Mardini began to feel hopeful again.Then, in March, the International Olympics Committee (IOC) began putting together its first-ever refugee team for the games in Rio. When Mardini’s trainer, Sven Spannekrebs, suggested she reach out to the IOC, the teen was initially reluctant.“First, you feel like, the word refugee is not really easy, it’s ugly at the beginning,” she said. “They don’t think you left your home. They think you have nothing.”After considering the opportunity, though, Mardini realized she could help reshape the way people understand the term and make it “stronger.”Mardini was one of 10 members of the refugee team and competed in the 100-meter freestyle event.While competing was a dream come true, what Mardini appreciated most was feeling a sense of belonging.“Sport is the only thing can bring all people together,” she said. “As we saw in the Olympics, when you’re an athlete no one can ask, ‘where you’re from?’ You’re an athlete.”When Mardini heads back to Berlin, she plans on resuming her grueling schedule.

Her presence was significant, considering that the U.N. General Assembly dedicated this year’s summit to addressing the largest refugee crisis since WWII. After days of high-level meetings at the U.N., along with squeezing in training sessions at a local YMCA, the teen talked with The Huffington Post on Wednesday before she headed out for her flight to Berlin.Mardini said she is well aware of the magnitude of her task. She knows that “refugee” is considered an “ugly” word and how opposed so many communities are to allowing them into their countries. But for Mardini, who helped drag a dinghy for over three hours from Turkey to Greece after the engine died, there’s very little that intimidates her.When asked how she feels about people who fear refugees and want to close their borders to them, Mardini didn’t demur.“It’s OK,” she said. “I will change that.”Mardini is also well aware of how close she came to just being another statistic in the rising death toll of fleeing refugees. As of May, 2,510 people had died this year after their vessels capsized in the Mediterranean Sea. But due to her unique set of skills, her will to live and some sheer luck, Mardini survived a terrifying journey last year. She says she knows that her triumphant story now holds the power to change people’s perceptions.Mardini grew up in Damascus where she had a typical childhood and swam competitively. However, she said when people hear “refugee” they often presume she’s from some remote, disconnected place and wouldn’t even know what an iPhone is.Everything changed for her when the war broke out more than 5 years ago. In 2012, Mardini’s home was destroyed. In August of last year, she’d had enough. Together with her sister, Mardini flew to Beirut, Lebanon and then to Istanbul, where they met up with smugglers. They joined up with about 20 refugees in Izmir, Turkey and boarded a boat meant for about six people and began their journey to the Greek island Lesbos.When the engine died 20 minutes into the journey, Mardini, her sister and two men jumped in the choppy frigid water and began pulling the vessel along. Even after the men quit, Mardini and her sister kept going. More than three hours later, they arrived safely in Lesbos. But that was just the beginning of their trek.Over a total of 25 days, she traveled through six countries before arriving to a refugee camp in Berlin.Once there, Mardini said she spent about 12 hours a day waiting on lines to get her asylum papers.It was when she finally got the chance to start swimming again – ironically enough, at the pool built by Nazis for the 1936 Olympics – that Mardini began to feel hopeful again.Then, in March, the International Olympics Committee (IOC) began putting together its first-ever refugee team for the games in Rio. When Mardini’s trainer, Sven Spannekrebs, suggested she reach out to the IOC, the teen was initially reluctant.“First, you feel like, the word refugee is not really easy, it’s ugly at the beginning,” she said. “They don’t think you left your home. They think you have nothing.”After considering the opportunity, though, Mardini realized she could help reshape the way people understand the term and make it “stronger.”Mardini was one of 10 members of the refugee team and competed in the 100-meter freestyle event.While competing was a dream come true, what Mardini appreciated most was feeling a sense of belonging.“Sport is the only thing can bring all people together,” she said. “As we saw in the Olympics, when you’re an athlete no one can ask, ‘where you’re from?’ You’re an athlete.”When Mardini heads back to Berlin, she plans on resuming her grueling schedule. She trains five hours a day, six days a week and is focusing on learning German. Her goal is to continue speaking out on behalf of refugees and develop projects that empower them.“I want to send a message that refugees are normal people who can achieve, who can create, who can work hard,” she said. “We were born in the same world, but we had some bad situations, which made us even stronger.”"

Just try to imagine the feelings those shocking remarks can have on a nation that has just faced death. … If Brooklyn Bridge was taken over by terrorists or Capitol Hill was shelled, this [would be like what] happened in our country.”Tanks appeared on the Bosphorus Bridge in Istanbul during the attempted overthrow, and coup-plotters bombed Turkey’s Grand National Assembly using American-made fighter jets. More than 250 civilians were killed and at least 2,000 were injured.Erdogan’s speech, delivered to a Harvard Club audience that included Turkish business leaders and influential Americans like media figure Tina Brown, was a fresh sign that the government of her husband, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is emboldened by goodwill it’s gained at home and abroad after resisting the coup. The Erdogan government seems increasingly willing to stand up to the U.S., which many Turks criticized for taking hours to condemn the plot and some even accused of supporting it.At times like the crisis, “friends’ actions speak louder than enemies’,” the first lady said. Her speech also underscored how views of Turkish politics by outsider observers and pro-government Turks have become sharply polarized.In the West, news coverage has focused on Erdogan’s purge of suspected coup supporters in the military and government, as well his effort to repatriate an exiled Turkish cleric, Pennsylvania resident Fethullah Gulen, whose followers Erdogan blames for the plot. Analysts warn that Erdogan’s campaign against the Gulenists could fundamentally reshape how Turkey functions, with competent professionals suddenly leaving mid-level government jobs and losing their household incomes for flimsy reasons like appearing on the subscriber list of a pro-Gulen newspaper.  Other international news stories about Turkey mostly relate to its role in Syria, where it supports groups fighting opposed to dictator Bashar Assad and the self-styled Islamic State, and has had tensions with U.S.-aligned Kurdish militias fighting ISIS.The narrative from the Turkish state elevates other concerns. Speeches from Erdogan, her husband’s minister for family and social policies, and prominent Turks at Thursday’s event echoed messages about celebrating the resistance to the coup and educating the world about the dangers of Gulen.“We are still in pain,” the first lady said. “The failed coup of July 15 is a turning point in the history of our country. A nation that 15 years ago couldn’t prevent the removal of an elected prime minister has now faced down tanks for democracy.”Family minister Fatma Betül Sayan Kaya, the only woman in Erdogan’s cabinet, said the world failed to appreciate “that Turks are democratic to the bone.”Both women frequently called coup-plotters “traitors,” and Erdogan repeated her husband’s message to the United Nations General Assembly that the Gulen movement should be seen as a major threat to all nations.This is a striking claim that few outside Turkey give any credence to. But it’s one to which the Erdogan government and its supporters appear deeply committed. Attendees at the lunch received a 22-page booklet describing Gulen’s history and alleged crimes. “In order to defeat this new type of terrorism, international solidarity is highly crucial,” the document concludes.By encouraging this view and presenting themselves as guardians of the Turkish state, the Erdogans seem to be winning new support, a big feat for a political force that has won less than half the votes in Turkey’s elections. Only a few of the attendees at Thursday’s event seemed to share the political Islamist ideology of the Erdogans’ AK Party. Instead, many simply spoke of supporting their nation and its leader at a time of crisis ― a helpful line of thinking for Erdogan that neatly ignores controversies about his approach to human rights, his country’s Kurdish minority and his sometimes outlandish statements.Speaking after the first lady, CNN Turk reporter Hande Firat said she spent the night of the coup worried for her country and her child’s future. Fellow journalists had warned her to be more neutral, she said, and suggested she was too warm toward Erdogan, who’s been notoriously unsupportive of press freedom, during a FaceTime interview of him the night of the coup.“If it happened today, I would do it again,” Farat told the audience."

But for the first time in Obama’s presidency, Congress has the votes to overrule him ― and it will next week.Obama issued a lengthy statement as he vetoed the bill, known as the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act. In it, he said he has “deep sympathy” for the families of 9/11 victims and is “strongly committed” to helping them seek justice. But his concern is that the bill departs from longstanding practices relating to foreign governments’ reliance on immunity from judicial processes.“The 9/11 attacks were the worst act of terrorism on U.S. soil and they were met with an unprecedented U.S. Government response … I have continued and expanded upon these efforts, both to help victims of terrorism gain justice for the loss and suffering of their loved ones and to protect the United States from future attacks,” he said. “The JASTA, however, does not contribute to these goals, does not enhance the safety of Americans from terrorist attacks, and undermines core U.S. interests.”Here’s his full statement:The White House has been protesting the bill for months, but even Democratic leaders disagree with Obama on this one. The bill prevents Saudi Arabia and other countries with alleged ties to terrorist groups from invoking their legal immunity in U.S. courts. It overrides the 1976 Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which grants immunity to countries that aren’t designated state sponsors of terrorism.Saudi Arabia denies any role in the 9/11 attacks, though 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi citizens.Administration officials say the bill puts Americans overseas at legal risk, and leaves the United States vulnerable to bogus lawsuits ― and hefty bills ― in court systems around the world. The European Union and former top executive branch officials have urged Obama to stop it. Saudi Arabia has threatened to retaliate against such a law by selling off hundreds of billions of dollars in American assets.Lawmakers haven’t been swayed, though. They say the warnings are overblown and that 9/11 victims deserve justice. The bill sailed through the House and the Senate without a single “no” vote.“If the Saudis did nothing wrong, they should not fear this legislation. If they were culpable in 9/11, they should be held accountable,” Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), one of the bill’s lead sponsors, said in a statement. “The families of the victims of 9/11 deserve their day in court, and justice for those families shouldn’t be thrown overboard because of diplomatic concerns.”The House and Senate are both prepared to vote to override the veto next week, aides to GOP leaders told The Huffington Post on Friday.Obama’s not ready to throw in the towel yet.White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said administration officials are still lobbying lawmakers to reject the bill. He said that, behind the scenes, many are actually sympathetic to the White House’s concerns.“One of the particular challenges of counting votes in this instance is the frequency with which we hear private concerns expressed that don’t match the public votes that are cast,” Earnest said in his Friday briefing. “We continue to make a forceful case to members of Congress that overriding the president’s veto means that this country will start pursuing a less forceful approach in dealing with state sponsors of terrorism, and potentially opens up U.S service members and diplomats and even companies to spurious lawsuits in kangaroo courts around the world.”He brushed off the significance of Obama preparing to be rebuked by Congress in a way he’s never been before.“This president has gone longer in his tenure in the White House than just about any other president in modern history before facing the prospect of having his veto overridden,” Earnest said.A group of 9/11 survivors and family members expressed disappointment with Obama’s decision to veto the bill.“We are outraged and dismayed at the President’s veto of JASTA and the unconvincing and unsupportable reasons that he offers as explanation,” reads a statement from the group, called 9/11 Families & Survivors United for Justice Against Terrorism.“No matter how much the Saudi lobbying and propaganda machine may argue otherwise, JASTA is a narrowly drawn statute that restores longstanding legal principles that have enjoyed bipartisan support for decades,” reads the statement. “We are deeply grateful for the unanimous bipartisan support that JASTA has in Congress, and we look forward to the Senate and House fulfilling their commitments by quickly overriding this veto.”This story has been updated with language from Obama’s statement and a statement from 9/11 Families & Survivors United for Justice Against Terrorism."

The leadership of the FARC have so far been coy on policy details but are expected soon to transition to a party rooted in Marxist ideals.“The war is over, long live Colombia, long live peace,” said FARC commander Ivan Marquez in a statement to reporters alongside fellow members of the rebel leadership.“We inform the country and the government and the governments and people of the world that the rebel delegates of the congress have given unanimous backing to the final accord.”Colombians will vote on the peace accord in an Oct. 2 plebiscite, the final go-ahead for rebels to demobilize. Polls show the accord will easily pass.Two-hundred delegates from FARC units around the country gathered at the Yari site, five hours by rutted road from the nearest provincial town, to review the accord and discuss re-organization in peacetime.Although both leadership and rank and file fighters say they will prioritize political activism as civilians, the group has so far not provided examples of specific policies.“Our initial platform is the implementation of the Havana accords,” Pastor Alape, a member of the FARC’s secretariat and a negotiator at the talks in Cuba, told Reuters at the congress. “Our political proposals will have to come from the suggestions of our base.“We started our political efforts clandestinely and now we aspire, legally, to open our initiatives, together with all sectors of society, to concretely cultivate the political space we are given,” Alape said.The five-point peace accord covers agricultural reform, an end to the illegal drugs trade, victims’ reparations, FARC political participation and demobilization.The FARC may find an electoral foothold among poor farmers and committed leftists, but manyColombians are wary that ex-fighters will join gangs or a smaller rebel group, the National Liberation Army.(Reporting by Julia Symmes Cobb; Editing by Helen Murphy and Dan Grebler)"
24,MEDIA,Fox News Gives Donald Trump A Pass On Birther Crusade It Helped Fuel,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fox-news-donald-trump-birtherism_us_57e54a06e4b08d73b830d54e,"The cable network, like the GOP nominee, seems to want to move on.",2016-09-23,Donald Trump isn't getting questions on Fox News about his birtherism reversal. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e54a481b00002d00ef1b13.jpeg?cache=40vj7zLMvm&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― Since Donald Trump finally admitted last week that President Barack Obama was born in the United States, the Republican nominee has done more than two hours of interviews with Fox News and Fox Business hosts.Yet the toxic crusade that Trump pushed for five years, and which was amplified through several appearances on Fox News in early 2011, hasn’t come up. Trump briefly acknowledged on Friday, Sept. 16, that Obama was born in the U.S., a fact long clear to anyone who was not a fringe conspiracy theorist. He did so that morning only after promoting his new Washington, D.C., hotel and ceding the microphone to a stream of veterans praising him ― a spectacle the cable networks carried for more than 20 minutes before any actual news was made.Reporters, who had been given the impression that Trump would take questions at the event, were left shouting their queries to no avail. Trump’s remarks that day left several unaddressed issues, including why he kept peddling the birther lie in interviews and on social media for five years after Obama released his long-form birth certificate in April 2011. Reporters would’ve presumably also asked about his now charging Hillary Clinton with starting the birther conspiracy during her 2008 presidential race, a claim that’s been shot down by fact-checkers.Trump stormed across the airwaves during the Republican primary, but since becoming the party’s nominee, he has largely avoided media scrutiny. He hasn’t held a press conference since late July and mainly turns to Fox News and sympathetic hosts like Sean Hannity and the crew on “Fox & Friends” when looking to speak out. He hasn’t sat down lately with some of the more adversarial hosts on Fox News, such as Shepard Smith, who ripped apart Trump’s hotel event and his claims about Clinton.During a week in which journalists had plenty of questions for Trump on the birther issue, all six of his national TV interviews went to Fox News and Fox Business.The birther question didn’t come up in an interview with Fox News “MediaBuzz” host Howard Kurtz that aired this past Sunday. Although it had been taped on Sept. 15, the day before Trump’s birther admission, the issue had been percolating in the media for several weeks.On Monday morning, the bombings in New York and New Jersey were the biggest news, but the hosts on “Fox & Friends” managed not to get around to Trump’s birther remarks during a nearly 26-minute phone interview. That night, Fox News host Bill O’Reilly ― who had raised the birther issue with Trump just two weeks earlier ― didn’t acknowledge it during a 15-minute interview.Sean Hannity taped an hour-long event with Trump on Wednesday, which will now air Friday night after being pre-empted for Charlotte protest coverage. Reporter Sopan Deb, who exhaustively covers Trump for CBS News, noted that Hannity didn’t ask about birtherism. The issue did come up Wednesday when Trump gave an interview to a local ABC affiliate. He described publicly coming around on Obama’s birthplace as a way “to get on with the campaign,” a remark that raised questions about his sincerity. But “Fox & Friends” hosts didn’t ask about Trump’s latest comment during a 14-minute phone interview on Thursday. Fox Business host Lou Dobbs didn’t either when Trump called in for six minutes that night. The dearth of questions about Trump finally giving up birtherism stands in contrast to how Fox News hosts gave the real estate mogul repeated opportunities to question the legitimacy of the first African-American president on air, without proof, during his earlier flirtation with running for the White House. “Why can’t he produce a birth certificate?” Trump asked during a March 28, 2011, segment on “Fox & Friends.” Co-host Steve Doocy asked Trump why the “mainstream media” were portraying him as crazy for simply raising the issue, teeing up a chance for Trump to criticize the press. That night, Trump again questioned Obama’s birthplace in an interview with then-Fox News host Greta Van Susteren. Trump promoted birtherism in several additional interviews on Fox News in the weeks that followed and his false claims often went unchallenged, according to progressive watchdog Media Matters.On April 15, 2011, Trump claimed on “Hannity” that he had investigators digging into Obama’s records in Hawaii. (The New York Times recently reported that “Trump apparently never dispatched investigators or made much of an effort to find the documents.”) Three days later, Doocy backed up Trump’s call for Obama to present his long-form birth certificate by saying the president “could end it, simply ― just show it to us.”But like Trump, some Fox News hosts apparently still weren’t satisfied with what the president released on April 27, 2011. “This thing isn’t a pure copy from a book, a ledger from Hawaii,” Eric Bolling said that night on Fox Business. “This thing has been altered.” Bolling brought on leading birther Pamela Geller, who said the document needed additional digital forensic analysis. She also praised Trump as “the first mainstream guy” to bring attention to the issue. Now that Trump wants to move on, it appears Bolling is ready to do so, too. “He dismissed it appropriately in 25 seconds,” Bolling said on the night of Sept. 16 on Fox News. “It’s done. It’s gone.” Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
25,POLITICS,Donald Trump's Properties Were Sued At Least Eight Times For Disabilities Violations,Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-disabilities-violations_us_57e44c0be4b08d73b8307075,Trump dragged some cases out for years.,2016-09-23,"The Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York City on May 31, 2016. In 2004, a disabled Purple Heart veteran sued the property, alleging it lacked proper handicapped-accessible emergency exits, guest rooms and restrooms. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"At least eight times over the last 19 years, GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump’s properties have been subject to lawsuits for violating the Americans with Disabilities Act, court records show. Additionally, a federal inspection found ADA violations at one of his properties.Only once did Trump come close to winning, in a suit that was dismissed at the request of both sides. Five of the cases were settled, while two ended in consent decrees requiring building modifications and one met its end in a Trump property bankruptcy. When a disabled Purple Heart veteran filed a lawsuit in 2004 alleging that the Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York lacked proper handicapped-accessible emergency exits, guest rooms and restrooms, Trump dragged the case out for three years. He tried to get the lawsuit dismissed and counter-sued his own architects to try and shift liability to them, but a judge dismissed that attempt. Trump eventually settled and agreed to make changes to the hotel.“What was so striking and frankly appalling was the way he tried to fight [the violations],” said Helena Berger, the president and CEO of the nonprofit American Association of People with Disabilities. “That, I think, is really telling.”Still, after Trump mocked a New York Times reporter with arthrogryposis last November, the reality TV star defended himself by pointing out how much money he’d spent on accessibility in his hotels. “I spend millions a year, or millions of dollars on ramps,” he said in July, “and get rid of the stairs and different kinds of elevators all over and I’m gonna mock? I would never do that.”Spending that money is a legal requirement: The Americans with Disabilities Act, which became law in 1990, requires that buildings and spaces used by the public meet specific disability access standards. “It is the policy at all of our properties to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act,” Christine Da Silva, a Trump Hotels spokeswoman, told The Huffington Post. “This handful of cases, many of which are over ten years old, are not representative of our organization’s strong record of ADA compliance.”Still, the cases do show that Trump has, at times, been less than enthusiastic about spending money to bring his buildings into compliance with federal law.For example, in 2001, two wheelchair users alleged that the wheelchair lift at Trump International was kept locked, and the employee who eventually unlocked it couldn’t operate it. In court records, one of the plaintiffs, Robert Levine, said the experience made him feel like a “second class citizen.” The other plaintiff, Frieda Zames, said it was like being a “grade school child asking permission to go to the restroom.”As in the 2004 lawsuit, after a judge denied Trump’s motion to dismiss the case, Trump counter-sued his architect to try to shift liability. Trump “amicably settled” the 2001 case in 2009, when both he and the plaintiffs agreed to dismiss the complaint.Emily Munson, a disability rights lawyer, told HuffPost that she understands the building owner’s perspective in ADA cases. The requirements are exhaustive and violations can be very technical, compared to more substantive problems, Munson said. “On the other hand,” she added, “businesses have had over a quarter century to come into compliance with the ADA.”Trump, she said, “clearly sees people with disabilities as sick or in need of charity and pity, rather than people with rights who deserve to be out and about and accessing the community.”Trump’s Atlantic City Plaza Hotel has also come under fire for its basic and serious deficiencies in accessibility. In a 1997 suit, James Conlon, who is paraplegic, said that even though he stayed in a designated handicapped-accessible room at the hotel, the toilets and showers were unusable for someone in a wheelchair, and the public restrooms were so inaccessible that he had to ask strangers to help him use them. Trump settled the case a year later, agreeing to pay Conlon’s legal fees and renovate the hotels rooms and public restrooms to comply with federal law. But a year after that, Conlon told the judge in the case that the renovations Trump had agreed to hadn’t been done. Two additional complaints were brought against the Plaza Hotel in 2007 and 2008. The plaintiffs in the former agreed to dismiss the case, and the latter case was terminated by Trump’s company’s 2009 bankruptcy.Conlon also brought a case in 2003 alleging that the bus between New York and the Atlantic City, New Jersey, casino wasn’t accessible and that wheelchair access could only be provided with one week’s notice. Trump tried counter-suing the bus provider, but eventually settled Conlon’s case.Another Trump hotel in Atlantic City, the Trump Taj Mahal, settled with the Department of Justice in 2011 after an inspection by the U.S. Attorney’s Office showed numerous violations, including not posting signs on some disabled parking spots. But the cases aren’t limited to Trump’s tri-state area properties. In 2011, a guest at the Trump International Miami ― which the reality star doesn’t own but licenses his name to ― alleged that his designated accessible room had accessibility problems. The case was confidentially settled. And in response to a lawsuit in 2014, the Trump National Doral Miami golf course said making its pool accessible to disabled users would be “impose an undue burden.” Trump and the plaintiff agreed to enter into a consent decree four months after the suit was filed.

Each participant received either a dose of oxytocin or a placebo, administered through a nasal spray.Researchers found that those who received oxytocin were more likely to report feeling that spirituality was important in their lives and that life has meaning and purpose. They were also more likely to give higher ratings to statements like, “All life is interconnected” and “There is a higher plane of consciousness or spirituality that binds all people.”Participants also listened to a guided meditation, after which those who received oxytocin reported experiencing more positive emotions like awe, gratitude, hope, inspiration, interest, love and serenity than those who received a placebo.The study’s results held true regardless of whether the participant reported belonging to an organized religion or not, and they remained consistent a week after the hormone and placebo were administered.Van Cappellen noted that the results of the study could only be applied to men given that the research subjects were all males. Oxytocin produces slightly different results in men and women, she said, and thus further studies should investigate the hormone’s role on women’s spirituality.Even among men, the effect might not be uniform. The study also showed that oxytocin has a stronger spiritual effect on people with a particular variant of the CD38 gene, which regulates the release of oxytocin from hypothalamic neurons in the brain.“Spirituality is complex and affected by many factors,” Van Cappellen said. “However, oxytocin does seem to affect how we perceive the world and what we believe.”But Van Cappellen isn’t alone in her findings. Previous studies have shown oxytocin to have a profound impact on spirituality, as well as generosity, altruism, and empathy. Oxytocin has also been shown to play a role in experiences of spiritual transformation.But it has a dark side, too.A 2010 study of Dutch males out of the University of Amsterdam found that male subjects who received a dose of oxytocin were more likely to express ethnocentric prejudice and xenophobia than those who received a placebo.Luckily, spirituality isn’t bound by hormones alone. It’s how we choose to define our spirituality ― whether as a connection to all creation on our global home or loyalty only to those who look, act and believe as we do ― that makes all the difference."

28,POLITICS,Rakeyia Scott's Slip Of The Tongue Is A Window Into The Poignancy Of Police Shootings,Ryan Grim and Julia Craven,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rakeyia-scott-video-call-the-police_us_57e59706e4b0e80b1ba22256,"""Did y'all call the police?"" Keith Scott's widow asked officers as her husband lay dying.",2016-09-23,"In this image taken from video recorded by Keith Lamont Scott's wife, Rakeyia Scott, on Tuesday, Charlotte-Mecklenburg officers squat next to Keith Lamont Scott as Scott lies face-down on the ground.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. ― When Rakeyia Scott saw cops surrounding her husband, Keith Scott, she immediately worried they might shoot him. She pulled out her cell phone camera.The horrifying video she captured has now been seen millions of times. One poignant moment, however, stands out.As officers huddle around her dying husband, she shouts out: “Did y’all call the police?”Call the police. It’s what one does, or is supposed to do, when a crime has been committed, when someone is in need of help. The idea that the police exist to protect and serve is so powerful that it broke through the reality of what she had just witnessed: police shooting her husband to death.She quickly caught her mistake. “I mean, did y’all call the ambulance?”Given the nonchalant attitude officers betrayed as Keith Scott lay on the pavement bleeding, she didn’t wait for an answer and took it upon herself to call 911.The reaction of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg officers to a man dying at their feet was strikingly familiar. The ubiquity of cellphone, dashcam and surveillance video has transformed the way the public understands police violence. But as scene after scene unfolds on shaky screens and in grainy contours, another element of the violence is beginning to come into focus: the pattern of officers seeming to show no concern for the person they have shot, often fatally.The nonchalance around the injured and the dying is stunning in its own way.Set aside the question of whether any particular shooting was justified, either legally or morally. Perhaps it was. Perhaps the officer had no other choice. Even in such a situation, though, the officer has just exercised the most terrifying of powers ― the use of lethal force against another human being. And yet no care seems to be taken of that human being.Consider another recent police shooting caught on video: that of Charles Kinsey, who survived. Kinsey, a black behavioral therapist in North Miami, Florida, was trying to help a man with autism who was sitting in the street blocking traffic. A cellphone video shows Kinsey himself lying on the ground with his hands in the air. He was trying to explain to police that the other man had a toy truck and not a gun, contrary to what a 911 caller had reported.One of the officers fired three times, hitting Kinsey in the leg. Then Kinsey said he was handcuffed and left bleeding on the street for 20 minutes before an ambulance arrived.And this was a case in which the police understood, right from the start, that the man they shot was the victim.Letting the body lie where it falls is a fairly common trend in these high-profile police shootings. After Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police shot and killed Alton Sterling, a 37-year-old black man, on July 5, the officers appeared rattled by what had happened. But as for Sterling, they said to “just leave him,” according to a witness. In Ferguson, Missouri, officers left Mike Brown’s body in the street for four hours, an indignity that protesters have referred to often.Cedrick Chatman was shot four times, within 10 seconds, as he ran from officers on the south side of Chicago. Then they handcuffed the dying teen, and an officer placed his boot on top of him.After officers shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Cleveland, the child was still alive. Even when police realized he was just a kid with a toy gun, they still failed to offer basic medical assistance. (They have since said they thought his toy gun was real and were afraid for their lives.) Instead, when his 14-year-old sister, T.R., ran toward him crying out, “My baby brother, they killed my baby brother,” one of the officers tackled her. She tried to get up and crawl toward her dying brother, but the second officer dragged her down. She was handcuffed and put in the backseat of a car, left to watch her brother continue to bleed while the officers did nothing.“When Tamir’s mother, Samaria Rice, heard about the shooting and rushed to the park, the officers refused to release T.R. into her custody and told her she had to choose between going to the hospital with her fatally wounded 12-year-old son and staying with her handcuffed 14-year-old daughter, who was in the back of the car with the very same officers who had shot her son,” the Rice family’s lawyers have since written.On Dec. 28, an Ohio grand jury chose not to indict the officer who fatally shot Tamir.When a Tulsa, Oklahoma, reserve deputy accidentally shot 44-year-old Eric Harris, he was already being subdued by other officers. “Oh shit, he shot me!” Harris says in the video. “I’m losing my breath.”“Fuck your breath,” one officer says in response, among the last words Harris would ever hear.If black lives truly mattered, police would make an attempt to save the dying. If black lives truly mattered, the dead would be afforded more dignity. It is this lack of caring for a fellow human being in his last moments, over and above the violence itself, that reinforces the belief that black lives don’t matter.After shooting LaQuan McDonald, Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke can be seen in video meandering about the crime scene. When North Charleston, South Carolina, police officer Michael Slager shot and killed Walter Scott, he casually walked toward his body. Later, more officers stand around Scott, and it takes some time for any of them to check for a pulse.Videos of police behaving nonchalantly after shooting white people have also come to light. Andrew Thomas, driving drunk, flipped his car and his passenger was thrown from the vehicle. Paradise, California, police officer Patrick Feaster witnessed the crash and pulled up behind them. Instead of attending to the passenger or helping Thomas out of the car, he simply drew his weapon, aimed, fired and struck Thomas in the neck, all in a matter of seconds. Then he radioed that the driver was refusing to exit the car, not mentioning for 11 minutes that he had shot him.Almost instantly after confronting Kajieme Powell in St. Louis, police shot him. Then they rolled over his body to put him in handcuffs. “They’re putting him in cuffs. He’s dead. Oh my God,” one bystander can be heard saying in a video. “Now they cuffin’ him, he’s already dead.”In fact, in reviewing nearly every publicly available video of a police shooting over the past year or so, it is close to impossible to find footage of an officer aiding the person who has been shot.Video of 25-year-old Freddie Gray’s arrest shows him screaming out, possibly in pain, as he is placed in the back of a Baltimore police van. Knowledge of what happened inside the van is limited, at best. But prosecutors argued in cases against several of the six officers charged in Gray’s death that not buckling his seatbelt was a mistake, whether intentional or not, that contributed to the severity of his injuries. William Porter, whose first trial ended in a mistrial, has also been accused of failing to ensure that Gray was provided immediate medical assistance once he requested help.That lackluster response, as much as the rough ride, might have cost Gray his life.It’s this nonchalance that gives weight to claims that too many police officers are operating more like law enforcement warriors than like public servants dedicated to the protection of others. Couple this with officers’ unwillingness to publicly shoulder any moral responsibility in these deaths, and we can only conclude that they believe those on the receiving end of police violence have invited death upon themselves.When social activists like Colin Kaepernick protest police violence against black people, the black-on-black crime rate is often raised in response. But Rakeyia Scott’s powerful slip of the tongue ought to show people who couldn’t see it before why that response is so offensive, and why police violence itself carries a unique resonance. The police are supposed to be the ones you call for help. Learning that they are, instead, the perpetrators of violence, flips everything upside down. If police officers want to convince the public they value black lives as much as any others, they need to start acting like the life they just took matters to them. They need to call the police.

Mike Lee, who quickly said thanks, but no thanks.",2016-09-23,Donald Trump's list of nominees-in-waiting: The greatest ever.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e5205c1700002a00ac69f2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump wants to show he’s serious about the Supreme Court.To prove it, he unveiled on Friday 10 additional candidates to complement his original list of hopefuls to occupy a seat on the nation’s high court, according to a statement posted on his campaign website.The GOP nominee insisted that the latest batch of names were the final tweaks to his not-so-short list and that he would not add any more names to the roster of 21 candidates.“This list is definitive and I will choose only from it in picking future Justices of the United States Supreme Court,” he said.At the top of Trump’s new list sits Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), who now joins his own brother Thomas Lee, a Utah Supreme Court justice, for a shot at the pinnacle of the legal profession. The state judge made the first round of pre-pre-vetting.Through spokesman Conn Carroll, the senator brushed off his inclusion in Trump’s list and said he “already has the job he wants.”“This new list does not change Sen. Lee’s mind about Trump in any way whatsoever,” the spokesman said. Lee has staunchly refused to endorse Trump and once said of him, “He scares me to death.”But for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Trump’s onetime rival for the GOP nomination, the mogul’s updated list and the inclusion of his dear friend from Utah convinced him to vote Trump in November.“For some time, I have been seeking greater specificity on this issue, and today the Trump campaign provided that, releasing a very strong list of potential Supreme Court nominees — including Sen. Mike Lee, who would make an extraordinary justice — and making an explicit commitment to nominate only from that list,” Cruz wrote on Facebook Friday afternoon in an endorsement of Trump.Other jurists pre-selected as pre-nominees for pre-vetting by the public and the press include four state supreme court justices ― from Iowa, Michigan, Florida and Georgia ― as well as federal judges from various levels and areas of the judiciary.These include Neil Gorsuch, a federal appeals judge who has clerked for Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy; Justice Charles Canady of the Supreme Court of Florida, a former congressman who was a big player in the impeachment of then-President Bill Clinton; and Margaret Ryan of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.The list is rounded out by Edward Mansfield of the Iowa Supreme Court; Keith Blackwell of the Supreme Court of Georgia; Robert Young of the Supreme Court of Michigan; Timothy Tymkovich of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit; and Amul Thapar and Federico Moreno, federal judges in Kentucky and Florida, respectively. The GOP nominee’s original wish list was unprecedented ― and object of some ridicule ― because presidents, let alone candidates, often closely guard the names in their Supreme Court vetting lists.But Trump is not a conventional operator, displaying during the course of his campaign a lack of regard for constitutional issues and the role of the courts. These stances have alarmed Republican thinkers and scholars, some of whom have preferred to look the other way and insist that the future of the Supreme Court is reason enough to surrender to Trump.And the former reality TV personality likes to remind the Republican base of that.“Even if you can’t stand Donald Trump, even if you think I’m the worst, you’re going to vote for me. You know why? Judges,” Trump told the crowd at a rally in Virginia last month.Trump probably knows very little, if anything, about legal conservatism or originalist thought, so it’s fitting that his campaign would turn to “conservative brain trusts” like The Heritage Foundation, The Federalist Society and the Jones Day law firm for pre-selection advice.These overtures to establishment conservatives, in turn, delight advocacy groups such as the Judicial Crisis Network, which have sought to normalize Trump’s candidacy by effusively praising his court pre-nominees ― all the while lobbying hard to stonewall the nomination of Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama’s choice to fill the high court vacancy.Garland, for his part, is still waiting to be confirmed. Since his nomination in March, the judge has become the longest-waiting real nominee from a real president to await an actual confirmation hearing.This story has been updated throughout."

Most Americans are concerned about Donald Trump’s rhetoric. And white working class voters feel left behind. This is HuffPollster for Thursday, September 22, 2016.NATIONAL POLL HAS GOOD NEWS FOR CLINTON - The first NBC/Wall Street Journal poll of likely voters, released Wednesday evening, shows Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump by 6 points, 43 percent to 37 percent, in a 4-way matchup, and by 7 points, 48 percent to 41 percent, in a head-to-head ― among the best results for Clinton reported in September. The poll finds Clinton and Trump’s supporters about equally enthusiastic about voting, although Clinton supporters are more likely to say their vote is “for” her, rather than against Trump. HuffPost Pollster’s model gives Clinton about a 4-point edge over Trump in a two-way matchup, and a 3-point edge with third party candidates included. [NBC, national chart]SWING STATE SURVEYS ARE A MIXED BAG:-New Hampshire - A Monmouth University released Wednesday also delivered good news for Clinton, giving her a 9-point lead over Trump in the Granite State, 47 percent to 38 percent. Democrats fared less well in the survey’s Senate matchup, which gave Republican incumbent Kelly Ayotte a 2-point edge over Maggie Hassan. Pollster’s model puts Clinton up by 6, and shows Ayotte and Hassan nearly tied. [Monmouth, NH presidential chart, NH Senate chart] -Wisconsin - The latest Marquette Law School poll finds Clinton with just a 2-point edge over Trump, 44 percent to 42 percent ― little changed from the end of August, but down from a double-digit lead immediately after the conventions. Democrat Russ Feingold continues to enjoy a comfortable margin over incumbent senator Ron Johnson, whom he leads by 6 points. Pollster’s model gives Clinton a lead of nearly 6 points, with Feingold up 8. [Marquette, WI presidential chart, WI Senate chart]-North Carolina - There’s less positive news for Clinton in North Carolina, where a Fox News poll from Wednesday night shows Trump ahead 45 percent to 40 percent. A Thursday morning New York Times Upshot/Siena College poll shows her faring better ― tying with Trump at 41 percent ― and finds Republicans struggling with white, college-educated voters in the state. HuffPost Pollster’s model also currently shows Clinton and Trump to be effectively tied. [Fox, NYT, NC presidential chart]-Nevada - The second of three battleground polls from Fox gives Trump a 3-point advantage, 43 percent to 40 percent, over Clinton. The Republican, who lagged in the state for most of the summer, has narrowly won all four of the most recent surveys there. HuffPost Pollster’s average puts both candidates at around 42 percent. [Fox, NV presidential chart]-Ohio - The third survey from Fox also found Trump leading in Ohio, with a 5-point lead, 42 percent to 37 percent. While several polls this month have shown Clinton in the lead, the majority ― including recent surveys from Bloomberg, Suffolk and CNN ― also showed Trump ahead. HuffPost Pollster’s average finds the race again tied at about 42 percent. [Fox, OH presidential chart] A BIG MAJORITY OF VOTERS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT TRUMP’S RHETORIC - Mark Murray: “A combined 69 percent of American voters say they have concerns about Donald Trump’s comments and language on women, immigrants and Muslims, including more than half who have “major” concerns, according to a new national NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. That’s compared with a combined 64 percent of voters who say they have concerns about Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state. Asked which problem concerns them the most about Trump, 33 percent say it’s not having the right temperament to be commander-in-chief; 27 percent say it’s his controversial comments about women, immigrants and Muslims; and 13 percent say it’s his praise for Vladimir Putin.” [NBC]THE BIGGEST FACTOR IN CANDIDATE SUPPORT IS DISLIKE OF OTHER CANDIDATE - Carroll Doherty, Jocelyn Kiley and Bridget Johnson: “Voters who support Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump offer a variety of reasons why they do so, ranging from the candidates’ issue positions to their personal backgrounds. But a major factor for both groups, beyond their candidate’s attributes, is who they are not: Asked in an open-ended format, 33% of Trump supporters and about as many Clinton supporters (32%) frame their vote at least partially in opposition to the other candidate, often using harsh language. Among Clinton supporters, only her experience, at 32%, is mentioned as frequently as opposition to Trump. For Trump supporters, opposition to Clinton is among the most frequently cited factors for supporting their candidate, with nearly as many citing his status as a political outsider (27%) or his policy stances (26%).... Many voters have unqualified praise for their preferred candidate…. Yet sizable shares in both camps focus at least partly – or in many cases exclusively – on the flaws or shortcomings of the opposing candidate. Several voters, including a 41-year-old woman who is supporting Clinton, describe their choice as ‘the lesser of two evils.’ A 49-year-old man who backs Trump says: ‘As bad as he is, I think Hillary is worse for our country.’” [Pew] WORKING CLASS WHITES SEE AN ECONOMY LEAVING THEM BEHIND - Jennifer Agiesta: “The biggest story of the 2016 election is undoubtedly the rise of Donald Trump, and behind the Republican nominee is a group in its last throes as the biggest force in politics: The white working class. A new survey from CNN and the Kaiser Family Foundation delves deeply into this pivotal group... Contrary to many assumptions about this group, the poll finds working class whites generally happy with their lives, and mostly satisfied with their personal financial situation. Just 18% say they are angry about the way things are going in their own lives, and 44% think America’s best days lie ahead…. But the white working class harbors deep concerns about the country’s economy, the amount the government is doing to help the working class and their own ability to influence politics. A majority, 53%, say they are very dissatisfied with the country’s economic situation and 84% say their views are not well represented by the government in Washington... About 6 in 10 white working class people say it’s gotten harder for people like them to get ahead financially and two-thirds say it’s harder to find good jobs. Many are concerned about what the next generation will face: 50% say they expect their children to have a lower standard of living than they currently have.” [CNN]HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

Obama told Goodwin that he did it “all the time.”“I will write a response—a full rant,” he told Goodwin in an interview that appears in the November issue of Vanity Fair. “And then I’ll crumple it up. Every once in a while, my team here will hear me go on a rant. Generally speaking, people who know me will tell you that my public persona is not that different from my private persona. I am who I am. You sort of get what you see with me. The two exceptions are that I curse more than I should, and I find myself cursing more in this office than I had in my previous life.”“And fortunately both my chief of staff and my national-security adviser have even bigger potty mouths than me, so it’s O.K. And the second thing is that I can be much more sarcastic and, I think, sometimes withering in my assessments of things than I allow to show in my public life,” he continued.Occasionally, Obama admitted, those unrestrained feelings slip through to public life. One example of that may have been last year, when the president was asked about his strategy for combatting ISIS.“If folks want to pop off and have opinions about what they think they would do, present a specific plan,” he said.In the wide ranging interview, Obama addressed his legacy and the challenges of communicating at a time when Americans can turn to whichever media sources best align with their beliefs.Obama also admitted that as president he hasn’t always been able to speak out on issues in the way he might if he were a private citizen.“There are institutional obligations I have to carry out that are important for a president of the United States to carry out, but may not always align with what I think would move the ball down the field on the issues that I care most deeply about,” he said.As Obama has campaigned for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, he has consistently attacked the judgement and qualifications of Republican nominee Donald Trump.“Everybody can tweet, but nobody actually knows what it takes to do the job until you sit behind the desk,” he said at a Clinton rally in July."

The bill would take effect in time for this year’s presidential election in a state where Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed he will be the victim of voter fraud. He has provided no evidence to back that accusation. Raging Chicken Press, a progressive website focused on Pennsylvania politics, reported that the bill was being swiftly pushed through the state’s GOP-controlled House of Representatives. The bill would “allow Trump supporters from around the state to ‘watch’ over the polls in minority communities throughout the state,” the website noted. On Wednesday, the bill was sent to the state’s appropriations committee to determine how much it would cost to implement.Pennsylvania Democrats warned that the measure could lead to voter intimidation.Poll watchers can intimidate voters by raising constant challenges at polling places, ProPublica reported.“There’s actually a risk that, in a more disorganized way, people are going to be showing up to the polls, they won’t know the law, and they’ll be engaging in discriminatory challenges,” Adam Gitlin, counsel for the Democracy Program of New York University School of Law’s Brennan Center for Justice, told ProPublica. “That can create the potential for a lot of disruption, longer lines because each voter takes longer to vote and potentially discouraging and intimidating voters from coming to the polls.”Trump and his supporters have repeatedly made allegations of voter fraud and called for volunteers to “Stop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election!” “The only way we can lose, in my opinion, I really mean this, Pennsylvania, is if cheating goes on,” Trump claimed last month, despite being consistently behind in the polls there. The current HuffPollster model has him down 6 points in the Keystone State, which hasn’t voted for a Republican for president since George H.W. Bush in 1988. Advancement Project, a civil rights organization, has published a guide explaining what poll watchers are allowed to do ― and what they’re not allowed to do ― in Pennsylvania, which is available here.“If you are challenged on Election Day, do NOT leave without voting. At the very least, vote a provisional ballot.”On Wednesday, the bill was sent to the state’s appropriations committee to determine how much it will cost the state to implement.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
36,POLITICS,Senate Democrats Are Mercilessly Trolling Trump Over His Tax Returns,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-democrats-trump-tax-returns_us_57e41285e4b0e28b2b52bbe9,"""It's obvious he’s been ethically compromised in most everything he’s ever done.""",2016-09-22,Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) is not pulling any punches when it comes to Donald Trump.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57e413521800002f0031672b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― When it comes to attacking Donald Trump, congressional Democrats are pulling out all the stops.The party’s lawmakers are following the lead of Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) who has made a sport out of poking the GOP nominee for, among other things, failing to release his tax returns. Now, they’re working to get a law on their side.Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and Ben Cardin (D-Md.) joined Reid at a press conference Thursday to tout legislation Wyden introduced that requires all presidential nominees to release their tax returns.At the event, the Democrats showed themselves just as capable of employing the kind of idle speculation and clever epithets that fueled Trump’s rise.Absent the release of Trump’s returns, the senators argued, one can only assume he is either not paying taxes, profiting from Russian business interests, violating tax charity laws or all of the above.Reid, speaking first, delivered the most stinging remarks.“Why has he not released his tax returns? Because it’s obvious he’s been ethically compromised in most everything he’s ever done,” he said.Trump’s returns would shed new light on the massive tax breaks and other public benefits the mogul has received for his lucrative business projects, Reid ventured.“He is a welfare king. He is king of the welfare kings ― a freeloader who’s made his way in life by feeding off other people’s hard work,” he said.Murphy, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, argued that the returns might show that Trump’s plans to ease sanctions on Russia would benefit him financially.“It is likely that those tax returns will show major income for Trump and his family from Russia ― from Russian business interests, from Russian oligarchs,” Murphy said. “It will show that the decisions he will make on whether to turn on or off sanctions against Russia could have a multi-million dollar impact on his net wealth.”Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, introduced the Presidential Tax Transparency Act in May. (Stabenow and Cardin are also members of the committee, which is responsible for tax-related legislation.)Wyden claimed conversations with Republicans led him to believe the bill would pass very quickly if it were brought for a vote. He and fellow Democrats tried to force a vote on the bill last week.Of course, the Republicans who control the Senate are almost certain not to allow such a vote. Instead, the bill creates a plum opportunity for Democrats to hammer the GOP presidential nominee and, in the process, boost their chances of regaining control of the upper chamber.Their counterparts in the House have used their public perch to slam Trump on the issue as well. Several members hijacked a hearing with Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen on Wednesday to pepper him with questions about whether a tax audit would prevent someone from releasing their returns. (An ongoing audit is among the many reasons Trump has cited for not releasing his own.)Every GOP presidential nominee since 1980 has released his tax returns well before the election; Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has released hers going back to 1977.Reid, who is retiring this year, has said he plans to campaign against down-ballot Republican candidates in the hopes of tying them to Trump, who remains unpopular in many states with tight Senate and House races.The minority leader showcased that approach on Thursday in a broadside at his Republican colleagues for preventing a vote on Wyden’s bill.Requiring the tax returns’ release is “a kind of good government policy we should all be able to agree [on], but Republicans refuse to apply basic standards of decency to their swindler-in-chief,” he said.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
