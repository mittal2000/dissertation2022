Who doesn’t love the image of a big dusty space snowball careening through the skies?Unfortunately, comets don’t smell as ethereally lovely as one would hope. Scientists discovered in 2014 that at least one comet -- 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko-- gave off an odor reminiscent of rotten eggs, horse poop, ammonia (read: cat pee) and formaldehyde.But that didn’t stop members of the Rosetta mission team -- the people responsible for landing a probe on the comet -- from asking UK-based scent firm The Aroma Company to make a perfume based on the comet’s fragrance.New Scientist reporter Jacob Aron had the misfortune of testing out the new perfume. He described it as having a “sharp, unpleasant scent” that he could feel “as a physical presence inside my skull.” As he smelled more and more, however, Aron started coming around to the scent, writing that it’s “not actually as foul as my first impression led me to believe” and that he could even detect “a few floral notes.” Either that, or the horrible stench was just starting to make him delirious. Unfortunately — or maybe fortunately? — the fragrance doesn’t appear to be available commercially at this point. The Rosetta team will be handing out postcards with the scent at London’s Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition in July.Since we haven’t sniffed this stuff ourselves, we’ll have to hold further judgment. But really, could it be much worse than perfume that smells like zombies? H/T Gizmodo"

Now, Republican mega-donor and casino mogul Sheldon Adelson wants to bring an NFL team to Vegas too -- and he wants $750 million in taxpayer money to make it happen.The $750 million, financed with municipal bonds that would be paid off by hotel taxes, would go toward a new domed football stadium Adelson and a development group have proposed, according to Bloomberg. That figure would surpass the $620 million Indianapolis spent on a new stadium for the Colts, making it the biggest public contribution toward a stadium in American history, based on figures compiled last year by the Taxpayer Protection Alliance.Adelson, who now owns the Las Vegas Review-Journal, is pitching the stadium as a means of enticing the Oakland Raiders to move to Vegas. The Raiders and owner Mark Davis have sought a new publicly funded stadium from the city of Oakland, but Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf has said that while she is confident the city can keep the team, it won't subsidize a new stadium with public money.In January, Davis tried to relocate the Raiders to Los Angeles, where the team played from 1982 to 1994, but the St. Louis Rams beat him to the punch. He's also visited San Antonio and other cities in an effort to either find a city that will give him hundreds of millions in taxpayer money for a new stadium, or to exert leverage on Schaaf and Oakland to do the same.The NFL, like America's other pro sports leagues, has been reluctant to consider moving a franchise to Vegas in the past, given its obvious association with legalized gambling. But this is a league that loves little more than pressuring cities to get what it wants -- its current stadiums have cost taxpayers more than $7 billion, according to the Taxpayer Protection Alliance -- so if there's anything that can assuage the NFL's Vegas fears, it may just be the chance to take even more money from the public for the benefit of its wealthy owners and billionaires like Adelson."

I acted in a way that was rude, childish, and totally inappropriate.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576d499c15000030001bb3e4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Andrew M. Seaman(Reuters Health) - Women in cardiac arrest in the U.S. are less likely than men to receive life-saving treatments, and less likely to survive, a study found.Compared to men, fewer women received cooling therapy to prevent brain damage, imaging studies known as angiography or treatment for blocked arteries.""Traditionally women have not been treated as aggressively as men,"" said lead author Dr. Luke Kim, of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City.Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart's electrical system malfunctions and the heart suddenly stops working, according to the American Heart Association.More than 300,000 cardiac arrests occur outside of hospitals in the U.S. each year, the researchers write in the Journal of the American Heart Association. Survival rates after out-of-hospital cardiac arrests have risen from about 6 percent in 2005 to about 8 percent in 2012.For the new study, the researchers reviewed data from 2003 to 2012 on nearly 1.44 million cardiac arrests. Some of the patients had been in the hospital when their heart stopped. Others had survived long enough after a cardiac arrest out in the community to be brought to a hospital.About 45 percent of the patients were women, who tended to be older and sicker than the men.Over the course of the study, in-hospital deaths fell from about 69 percent to about 61 percent in women and from about 67 percent to about 57 percent in men.Overall, roughly 64 percent of women died in the hospital after cardiac arrest, compared to about 62 percent of men, according to the report.Women were 25 percent less likely than men to undergo coronary angiography. They were also 25 percent less likely to have an angioplasty procedure to open blocked arteries and 19 percent less likely to undergo therapeutic hypothermia, which cools the body to prevent brain damage.Their lower rates of these treatments aren't the only reason women are more likely to die in hospitals after cardiac arrest, Kim and his colleagues say.A subset of women who received the appropriate treatments still had worse survival, they found.It could be that women are less likely to have cardiac arrests that respond to treatment with a defibrillator and less likely to have cardiac arrests in the presence of other people who can call for help, the authors suggest.Dr. Leslie Cho, director of the Women’s Cardiovascular Center at the Cleveland Clinic, emphasized that the women in the study tended to be older and sicker than the men.""Sometimes the difference can be due to older patients being less likely to want more aggressive procedures,"" said Cho, who was not involved with the new study.She was surprised, however, that women were less likely to be treated with cooling therapy, because that is a decision made by doctors - not patients.""We need to treat both men and women aggressively,"" Cho said.She advises women to watch for signs of heart trouble, including chest pressure or tightness and increasing shortness of breath.""It again speaks to the fact that if you feel like something is wrong with you, it’s important to be seen"" by a healthcare provider, Cho said.SOURCE: http://bit.ly/28Pp9uy Journal of the American Heart Association, online June 22, 2016."

9,POLITICS,HUFFPOLLSTER: How Brexit Polls Fared Depends On Which Surveys You Look At,"Natalie Jackson, Ariel Edwards-Levy, and Janie Velencia",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brexit-polls-compared-to-results_us_576d271fe4b0f16832393171,"Telephone polls favored “remain,” while internet polls correctly pointed toward a win for “leave.”",2016-06-24,"Internet Brexit polls showed ""Leave"" ahead of ""Remain""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576d27af1500002a0073c605.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A late swing toward “remain” in the Brexit polls helped make the “leave” win seem unexpected. Older voters favored “leave” much more heavily than their younger counterparts. And back in the U.S., voters see their own parties as divided. This is HuffPollster for Friday, June 24, 2016. MIXED PERFORMANCE FOR BREXIT POLLS - HuffPollster: “British news networks have called the United Kingdom referendum on membership in the European Union for 'leave' in a narrow victory that took most of the night to shake out….Polls had indicated the vote would be very close, but most last-minute surveys showed 'remain' leading….The average of all surveys conducted prior to the polls opening on Thursday showed that 'remain' was up by 0.5 percentage point over 'leave.'...Throughout the campaign, the polls diverged, based on whether they were conducted online or by telephone. The internet poll average estimated a 1.2-point lead for 'leave,' while live phone polls had 'remain' up by 2.6 percentage points….That doesn’t mean all internet polls were reliable predictors and all telephone polls were unreliable. A couple of internet polls showed 'remain' with a substantial lead in their final surveys....There were warnings that the polls could have it wrong. There are considerable challenges in polling referendum votes, chiefly that there isn’t any recent history to help determine what voter turnout would look like....[I]t’s clear yet again that there isn’t a reliable 'gold standard' for conducting pre-election polls.” [HuffPost]Polls always showed a close race; “leave” vote shouldn’t be surprising - Nate Cohn: The polls consistently indicated that there was a very real chance that Britain would vote to leave. Polling averages even showed 'Leave' with a lead for most of the last month; over all, 17 of the 35 surveys conducted in June showed the Leave side with the edge, while just 15 showed Remain ahead. Yet at the same time, betting markets indicated that Remain was a clear favorite. The arguments for making Remain a favorite were understandable, but in retrospect, some look more like wishful thinking than a fair-minded assessment of the data... Betting markets showed that Remain was favored, and again, there’s plenty of evidence that betting markets are a fairly reliable predictor of election results…. Finally, the late polls really did break toward Remain, especially after the British Labour Party member Jo Cox was killed on June 16. Over all, Brexit led in just four of the final 11 pre-election surveys — enough to give Remain a 0.5-point lead in the Huffpost Pollster average…. One could certainly argue that the polls were “wrong” in the sense that they tended to show a slight Remain advantage heading into the vote count. But it was clearly a distinct possibility that Brexit would win, based on the available survey data…. If there’s a lesson here, it’s a fairly straightforward one: Don’t get too confident in contests when the polls show a very tight race.” [NYT]Last poll conducted showed voters were divided by age - Louise Ridley: ""An age breakdown of EU Referendum polling shows young voters overwhelmingly supported Remain while older people backed Brexit, leading to claims that baby boomers were 'screwing the younger generations over yet again'. 75% of people aged 18-24 claimed they voted for Remain in the YouGov survey after voting closed, a figure that falls as age increases. In comparison, just 39% of those aged 65 and over backed a vote to stay, causing commenters to say it was 'infuriating' that 'young people.. have a future without the EU and it’s one they don’t want.'” [HuffPost] Why there weren't any exit polls on the referendum - Jenny Anderson: ""There [were] no official exit poll results...because this referendum is such an anomaly that there is no way to design a reliable exit poll. Regular exit polls are run by asking people at a sample of voting booths across the country how they voted, and then comparing the results with surveys from the same locations in previous elections. 'The changes can be projected to build up a national picture,' the Independent explains. But since Britain is voting on whether or not it will stay in the EU, a topic that has not been part of a general election, there is no baseline….Patterns of voting in the referendum will in no way reflect general election preferences: Both of the country’s traditional parties are split on whether to stay in, or leave the EU, with all sorts of strange iterations. 'This is a unique vote, which will be reported by local authorities that do not tally geographically—or demographically—with general election voting wards,' explained the Week."" [Quartz] -The Guardian provides a breakdown of the votes cast in each region and the corresponding demographics. [Guardian] DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS SEE THEIR PARTY AS DIVIDED - Mark Blumenthal: ""At this point in the campaign, perceptions of the degree to which the two parties are divided or unified are something of a paradox.

10,POLITICS,HUFFPOLLSTER: How Brexit Polls Fared Depends On Which Surveys You Look At,"Natalie Jackson, Ariel Edwards-Levy, and Janie Velencia",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brexit-polls-compared-to-results_us_576d271fe4b0f16832393171,"Telephone polls favored “remain,” while internet polls correctly pointed toward a win for “leave.”",2016-06-24,"Phone Brexit polls showed ""Remain"" ahead of ""Leave.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576d282d2200002d00f82c78.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A late swing toward “remain” in the Brexit polls helped make the “leave” win seem unexpected. Older voters favored “leave” much more heavily than their younger counterparts. And back in the U.S., voters see their own parties as divided. This is HuffPollster for Friday, June 24, 2016. MIXED PERFORMANCE FOR BREXIT POLLS - HuffPollster: “British news networks have called the United Kingdom referendum on membership in the European Union for 'leave' in a narrow victory that took most of the night to shake out….Polls had indicated the vote would be very close, but most last-minute surveys showed 'remain' leading….The average of all surveys conducted prior to the polls opening on Thursday showed that 'remain' was up by 0.5 percentage point over 'leave.'...Throughout the campaign, the polls diverged, based on whether they were conducted online or by telephone. The internet poll average estimated a 1.2-point lead for 'leave,' while live phone polls had 'remain' up by 2.6 percentage points….That doesn’t mean all internet polls were reliable predictors and all telephone polls were unreliable. A couple of internet polls showed 'remain' with a substantial lead in their final surveys....There were warnings that the polls could have it wrong. There are considerable challenges in polling referendum votes, chiefly that there isn’t any recent history to help determine what voter turnout would look like....[I]t’s clear yet again that there isn’t a reliable 'gold standard' for conducting pre-election polls.” [HuffPost]Polls always showed a close race; “leave” vote shouldn’t be surprising - Nate Cohn: The polls consistently indicated that there was a very real chance that Britain would vote to leave. Polling averages even showed 'Leave' with a lead for most of the last month; over all, 17 of the 35 surveys conducted in June showed the Leave side with the edge, while just 15 showed Remain ahead. Yet at the same time, betting markets indicated that Remain was a clear favorite. The arguments for making Remain a favorite were understandable, but in retrospect, some look more like wishful thinking than a fair-minded assessment of the data... Betting markets showed that Remain was favored, and again, there’s plenty of evidence that betting markets are a fairly reliable predictor of election results…. Finally, the late polls really did break toward Remain, especially after the British Labour Party member Jo Cox was killed on June 16. Over all, Brexit led in just four of the final 11 pre-election surveys — enough to give Remain a 0.5-point lead in the Huffpost Pollster average…. One could certainly argue that the polls were “wrong” in the sense that they tended to show a slight Remain advantage heading into the vote count. But it was clearly a distinct possibility that Brexit would win, based on the available survey data…. If there’s a lesson here, it’s a fairly straightforward one: Don’t get too confident in contests when the polls show a very tight race.” [NYT]Last poll conducted showed voters were divided by age - Louise Ridley: ""An age breakdown of EU Referendum polling shows young voters overwhelmingly supported Remain while older people backed Brexit, leading to claims that baby boomers were 'screwing the younger generations over yet again'. 75% of people aged 18-24 claimed they voted for Remain in the YouGov survey after voting closed, a figure that falls as age increases. In comparison, just 39% of those aged 65 and over backed a vote to stay, causing commenters to say it was 'infuriating' that 'young people.. have a future without the EU and it’s one they don’t want.'” [HuffPost] Why there weren't any exit polls on the referendum - Jenny Anderson: ""There [were] no official exit poll results...because this referendum is such an anomaly that there is no way to design a reliable exit poll. Regular exit polls are run by asking people at a sample of voting booths across the country how they voted, and then comparing the results with surveys from the same locations in previous elections. 'The changes can be projected to build up a national picture,' the Independent explains. But since Britain is voting on whether or not it will stay in the EU, a topic that has not been part of a general election, there is no baseline….Patterns of voting in the referendum will in no way reflect general election preferences: Both of the country’s traditional parties are split on whether to stay in, or leave the EU, with all sorts of strange iterations. 'This is a unique vote, which will be reported by local authorities that do not tally geographically—or demographically—with general election voting wards,' explained the Week."" [Quartz] -The Guardian provides a breakdown of the votes cast in each region and the corresponding demographics. [Guardian] DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS SEE THEIR PARTY AS DIVIDED - Mark Blumenthal: ""At this point in the campaign, perceptions of the degree to which the two parties are divided or unified are something of a paradox. Partisans on both sides are mostly unified around the two likely nominees, yet they perceive their respective parties as still divided (though they see the divisions as greater for the Republicans, and growing). More specifically, Clinton’s lead in the matchup against Trump results partly from her winning slightly more support from Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (90%) than Trump wins from Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (86%).

'Upfront fares' for all!""On Thursday, the ride-hailing service quietly scrapped the much-reviled ""surge multiplier."" The figure determines how much a ride will cost, fluctuates based on the supply of drivers versus the demand from riders and has been responsible for some wildly expensive trips.But that doesn't mean it's going away, exactly. Riders just won't see it anymore.In its place, Uber has implemented what it's calling ""upfront fares,"" which is exactly what it sounds like. Instead of seeing the somewhat cryptic lightning bolt icon along with a multiplier of, say, ""1.7x,"" riders will enter their destination's address ahead of time and see the actual fare they'll pay for the ride.""These are not the surge multipliers you are looking for.""""When fares go up due to increased demand, instead of surge lightning bolts and pop-up screens, riders are given the actual fare before they request their ride,"" Uber product managers Arundhati Singh and Dennis Zhao explained in a blog announcing the changes.""Upfront fares are calculated using the expected time and distance of the trip and local traffic, as well as how many riders and nearby drivers are using Uber at that moment,"" they continued.Just because Uber has covered over surge pricing with a new veneer doesn't mean the practice of what they call ""dynamic pricing"" is going anywhere soon.In May, citing an interview with Uber engineering lead Jeff Schneider, NPR reported that the company viewed surge pricing as a ""market failure"" and hoped to kill it one day using machine learning. Uber hurriedly clarified that the report didn't mean it was ending the practice.""We have no plans to end dynamic pricing,"" the company said in a statement. ""While we understand that no-one likes to pay more for the same trip, it’s the only way to ensure that passengers can always get a ride when they need one.” Note: The Huffington Post’s Editor-in-Chief Arianna Huffington is a member of Uber’s board of directors, and has recused herself from any involvement in the site’s coverage of the company."

He ended up swamping his opponent, Mitt Romney, by almost a 3 to 1 margin among Latino voters, who now make up around 12 percent of the U.S. electorate.The court's decision ""just adds fuel to the fire that's already raging,"" said Brad Bannon, a Democratic strategist. ""Each of these events raises the intensity and the Latino turnout even more.""But Rev.

14,POLITICS,"Bernie Sanders Would Be A Popular Vice Presidential Pick, New Poll Says",Samantha Neal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-vice-president_us_576d761ee4b0dbb1bbba7942,Americans are still feeling the Bern.,2016-06-24,About half of voters in one poll say they'd rather see Hillary Clinton select a different running mate than Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576d7a291500002f001bb4ab.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Thirty-nine percent of voters nationwide said they would be more likely to vote for the Democratic ticket if Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders were on it, according to a new poll from Monmouth University.The poll tested six potential Democratic and six potential Republican vice presidential picks, and Sanders was the only name to stand out from the pack. Among undecided voters, a whopping 50 percent said they would be more likely to support the Democrats if it’s a Clinton-Sanders ticket. That could be a substantial number of voters — the HuffPollster model indicates that 9.8 percent of voters are undecided.Although voters would like Sanders as the vice presidential nominee, the Clinton campaign reportedly does not view a Clinton-Sanders ticket as an option. Sources told the Wall Street Journal that Hillary Clinton is not considering Bernie Sanders as a running mate.Clinton’s campaign is instead exploring other alternatives and has reportedly begun to narrow its VP shortlist. Among the floated names are Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro of Texas.In the Monmouth poll, Warren is the second-place finisher among vice presidential options — 24 percent of voters said they would be more likely to vote Democratic if Warren were on the ticket. A recent CNN/ORC poll shows that 34 percent of the Democratic electorate believes Clinton should select Warren, while 54 percent said they would rather see someone else on the ticket.Kaine mobilizes a low level of voter interest — a mere 5 percent of likely voters backing Clinton in a recent Bloomberg Politics national poll say that Clinton should select Kaine as her running mate. Only 9 percent of all voters nationwide say they would be more likely to vote Democratic with Kaine on the ticket, according to the Monmouth poll.Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University polling institute, attributes Kaine’s and Warren’s low impact on voters in part to lack of name recognition. According to a Morning Consult poll, almost half of voters don’t know who Kaine is, and about a quarter haven’t heard of Warren. On the GOP side, the only clear standout is former Alaska governor and 2008 vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin -- but she would be a liability on the ticket. The Monmouth poll shows that 42 percent of all voters would be less likely to vote Republican if Trump chooses Palin as his running mate.Other viable hopefuls could make some voters more likely to vote Republican. Twenty-seven percent would be more likely to vote Republican with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio on the ticket. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich could attract 24 percent of voters. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie might entice about one in five voters, and Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions would make just under 10 percent consider the Republican ticket more carefully.Trump has made it clear, however, that Marco Rubio is not under consideration for the vice presidency. And Chris Christie’s plummeting public approval ratings suggest that he might not be a beneficial addition to the ticket.The CNN/ORC poll also asked the Republican electorate what qualities they desire in a vice presidential candidate. Results overwhelmingly show the electorate largely wants to see Trump select someone who can either boost his military or political credentials (47 percent and 43 percent, respectively).At a rally in Tampa earlier this month, Trump floated three names for the VP pick: Newt Gingrich, Jeff Sessions, and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Rice later stated she was not interested.However, the actual impact of the running mate selection has historically proven to be marginal. “They usually do not have a significant impact on the national electorate,” says Monmouth University polling institute director Patrick Murray. “At best, they can help with a specific constituency or in a key state. At worst, they can demonstrate poor decision-making on the part of a person who aspires to be a leader of the free world.”The Monmouth University poll of 803 registered voters nationwide was conducted June 15-19, 2016. Respondents were reached by both landline and mobile telephone. Results have a margin of error of +/- 3.5 percentage points."

The idea was that within the zone, people would need a permit to protest and that those demonstrations would be restricted to specific times and areas out of sight of the Republican delegates. But critics argued that the event zone was far too large, sweeping through parts of Cleveland that have nothing to do with the convention. Gwin, who delivered his opinion orally according to Cleveland.com, cited multiple concerns over the city's plan, including the “unduly large” zone, tight restrictions on the use of public parks, and time and space limits on would-be protesters.The city's rules would limit each permit-holding protest group to a single 50-minute window along a designated parade route. The American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio, along with progressive and conservative activists, said the route was too far from Quicken Loans Arena, the main site of the convention. Delegates would be unlikely to see the demonstrators, which would negate the point of demonstrating. In court filings, the ACLU called the restrictions ""draconian"" and ""arbitrary"" and said they would effectively preclude the plaintiffs ""and thousands of others from making their individual and collective voices heard.""The city had previously indicated it would appeal Gwin's order. As of Thursday afternoon, however, the two sides were locked in mediation at the court's behest, according to Steve David, communications manager for the ACLU of Ohio. Dan Williams, Cleveland's director of media relations, declined to give details, citing a city policy against discussing ongoing litigation. The ACLU of Ohio had filed suit against Cleveland on behalf of three plaintiffs: Citizens for Trump, a grassroots group that supports the presumptive Republican presidential nominee; Organize Ohio, a progressive activist group; and the Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless, a nonprofit. “This is one of those examples where you see how those regulations are making no discrimination regardless of people’s political affiliations,"" David said. Cleveland officials expect the Republican National Convention, which runs July 18 to 21, to attract an estimated 50,000 additional visitors to the city. Both party and city officials are bracing for potential chaos in light of the routinely violent encounters between protesters and supporters at Donald Trump's rallies and the candidate's own predictions there would be ""riots"" if GOP leaders deny him the nomination. Notably, guns would be allowed in the event zone, as Cleveland cannot overrule Ohio state laws on open and concealed carry. (The Secret Service has already prohibited guns inside Quicken Loans Arena.)Items that would be banned in the event zone include metal-tipped umbrellas, coolers, drones, long knives, sabers, swords, nunchucks, bicycle locks and chains, gas masks, canned goods and tennis balls. The restrictions even specify a precise width and thickness for the wooden or plastic sticks of protest signs.The ACLU noted that the city was even banning soapboxes: The rules prohibit “use of a podium, platform, pedestal, stand or similar object to make a public speech.” ""Instead, the speakers are allowed to compete to use the single 'official' Speakers Platform, which the city will assign by permit for 30-minute increments during limited hours in a park blocks away from the convention,"" the ACLU said in court filings.The event zone would encompass three major sports stadiums -- Quicken Loans Arena, the Cleveland Browns Stadium and Progressive Field -- as well as the Port of Cleveland, the Cleveland State University campus and a swath of public housing.The city said that people who have a legitimate need to carry banned items in the zone -- including the homeless -- would be exempt from enforcement.""Unfortunately, that requires a lot of discretion on the part of law enforcement. We want to minimize unnecessary contact with police as much as possible,"" David said, noting that the Cleveland Police Department is still under court supervision following a damning report by the U.S. Department of Justice over civil rights violations. Chief among the ACLU's requests is that the city shrink the size of the event zone. ""The fact that Cleveland felt the need to institute this 3-mile zone flies in the face of what they claim to be the 'least restrictive convention rules' that we’ve seen,” David said.The ACLU has pointed out that the 2004 Republican convention in New York City had a smaller secure or ""hard"" zone but no buffer or event zone beyond it and that the security zone outside the 2008 Democratic convention in Denver was about 0.14 square miles. The largest security zone to date was at the 2012 Republican convention in Tampa, Florida -- it encompassed 2.7 square miles, roughly three-quarters the size of Cleveland’s. With less than a month to settle the dispute, the hope is that the city and the activists can find common ground in mediation. Cleveland could also appeal the judge's ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit."

19,SPORTS,NBA Draft Winners And Losers From The First Round,Jordan Schultz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nba-draft-winners-and-losers-first-round_us_576c85dbe4b0dbb1bbba1cf4,Because it's never too early.,2016-06-24,Marquese Chriss fits in very well with the Suns' uptempo attack.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576d27aa1500002a0073c602.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Draft grades might be impossible to navigate. After all, isn't a draft determined three or four years down the road? That's why we have our winners and losers from the 2016 NBA Draft. It's hardly foolproof, but we've been fairly accurate in the past.My previous sleeper picks include Klay Thompson, Steph Curry, Elfrid Payton, Kenneth Faried, Dennis Schroder, Giannis Antetokounmpo and C.J. McCollum. Previously profiled busts include Anthony Bennett, Michael Carter-Williams, Shabazz Muhammad and Nerlens Noel.Let the fodder begin.WinnersPhoenix SunsThe Suns and their incredible cap flexibility entered draft night with three picks. They made a huge splash by nabbing 7-foot-1 Croatian product Dragan Bender, only to then make a deal with Sacramento to acquire fellow 18-year-old Washington freshman Marquese Chriss. Both of these prospects are oozing with potential: Bender is a natural four man -- a fluid pick-and-pop man who can run -- while Chriss, at 6-foot-10, can become a two-way three because of his elite athleticism. Recently extended head coach Earl Watson has told HuffPost that he wants to run and he wants flexible players. Bender and Chriss fit perfectly.Chicago BullsDerrick Rose is gone, and now Gar Forman -- who says the Bulls are retooling -- pairs All-Star Jimmy Butler on the perimeter with do-everything wing Denzel Valentine. Valentine improved dramatically throughout his brilliant four-year career in East Lansing, coming in as a complete non-shooter only to shoot over 44 percent from 3 as a senior. He is a splendid playmaker (7.8 assists) and thinker of the game who can play both on and off the ball. The knee concerns appear valid, but he's worth the risk at 14, particularly given his vastly underrated defense.Thon Maker Reports surfaced on draft day that Maker -- thought to be 19 years old -- might actually be 22. Then, rumors swirl that the 7-foot wing could slide into the second round.But the Bucks nabbed Maker at 10, an infinitely intriguing prospect who's as green as he is talented. He will be paired next to Giannis Antetokounmpo and a Bucks team that has four guys with 7-foot-plus wingspans. Oklahoma City ThunderWhether the Thunder can lock up Kevin Durant remains to be seen, but general manager Sam Presti -- by trading Serge Ibaka to Orlando -- gets a rapidly developing two-way wing in Victor OIadipo while also acquiring 20-year-old Gonzaga big man Domantas Sabonis. Sabonis will already bang more and create more position than Ibaka ever has. In fact, the son of NBA Hall of Famer Arvydas, Domantas was tied for fifth nationally by collecting 23 double-doubles last season. Minnesota TimberwolvesKris Dunn -- the reigning two-time Big East Player and Defensive Player of the Year -- goes to a head coach in Tom Thibodeau, who values defense perhaps more than anyone. Dunn, who recently caught up with The Huffington Post, can start immediately. Now all of a sudden, the dormant Wolves have a trio of potentially dominant defenders in Dunn, Andrew Wiggins and Karl-Anthony Towns, the league's previous two Rookie of the Year selections. Better yet, Wiggins, at 21, is the oldest. Plus, the pick-and-roll combo of Dunn and Towns could become lethal. This Wolves roster is overflooded with young talent.LosersBoston CelticsJaylen Brown is a super talent and taking him at 3 isn't crazy. He can guard three spots and will always rebound from the guard spot. It's just that Buddy Hield was the ideal fit here -- a knockdown 3-point shooter who can space the floor with ease next to All-Star triggerman Isaiah Thomas. The real mistake by Danny Ainge -- who will have about $35 million in cap -- is 20-year-old French national Guerschon Yabusele, who has been labeled by many scouts as lazy and green. He's undersized at 6-foot-8 and the Celtics have had issues with Jared Sullinger, another undersized four.Freshmen BigsSkal Labissiere, Cheick Diallo, Diamond Stone and Deyonta Davis were all blue chip recruits. None of them lived up to the hype. And now none of them went as high as they all would have hoped. For Labissiere -- the only one of the quartet to go in the first round -- it's about the lack of physicality and overall production. For Diallo, it's about him being a total project. For Stone, it's about the inability to shoot it, along with character concerns.And for Davis it comes down to the motor, or lack thereof. It would have behooved all three to return for their sophomore campaigns. Sacramento KingsAnother wasted draft night for Sacramento, which took enigmatic Syracuse freshman Malachi Richardson, a scoring wing whose meteoric rise up draft boards occurred during a magical March Madness run. Richardson isn't a great athlete and shot just 39 percent from two. In other words, he has some shades of failed shooting guard experiment Ben McLemore -- a previously overdrafted collegiate freshmen. This is not a good thing. Oh, and don't forget about trading down to select 7-foot-2 Greek center Georgios Papagiannis and then 7-foot Kentucky product Skal Labissiere, despite a roster already featuring DeMarcus Cousins, Kosta Koufos and Willie Cauley-Stein.In the words of Mr. Cousins...Go here to read about the five safest draft prospects and here to read about the five riskiest.

Lawmakers spent more than 24 hours occupying the well of the chamber, and left ""feeling like something had fundamentally changed in Congress and even in America when it comes to this issue,"" Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Texas) told ""So That Happened,"" the HuffPost Politics podcast.Civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), who started the sit-in on Wednesday, described what Democrats had gained in metaphorical terms. ""We’ve crossed one bridge but we have other bridges to cross,"" Lewis said at the Capitol. On ""Bloody Sunday"" in 1965, he and dozens of other demonstrators were brutally beaten by police after crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Alabama.Though the House adjourned without taking the vote Democrats demanded, O'Rourke and others said things would be different moving forward. ""We are going back to our congressional districts -- we are going to engage our constituents on this subject, and we will not allow this body feel as comfortable as in the past,"" Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) said Thursday. ""On July 5, we will return, and at that time we will be operating on a new sense of a purpose.""As for the actual legislation Democrats had proposed -- one item would have restricted gun purchases for people on a secretive terrorist watchlist -- O'Rourke allowed that it was not ideal. Civil liberties activists have condemned the ""no fly, no buy"" proposal, which gained traction in the wake of the mass shooting by a terrorist sympathizer in Orlando, Florida. O'Rourke, however, praised it for dramatizing the underlying problem of easy gun access.""Perhaps at a higher level it calls attention to how absurd our gun laws are that you would have a list of people this country feels are too dangerous to board a plane,"" he said, ""but they're not too dangerous to own a killing machine to wipe people out in a school or a nightclub.""“So, That Happened” is hosted by Jason Linkins, Zach Carter and Arthur Delaney.

At least 1 million people have signed petitions calling for Perksy's removal from the bench in Santa Clara County, California, and even members of Congress have suggested the judge lose his job. Turner was found guilty of three felony sexual assault offenses in March for attacking an unconscious woman on the campus of Stanford University. On June 2, Persky sentenced Turner to six months in jail, despite a request from prosecutors for six years in state prison. Sajid Khan, a public defender in Santa Clara County and the lead organizer behind the letter supporting Persky, understands people are upset with the sentence, but believes a recall effort is not the right course of action. ""If there is a concern about his sentence, that should be taken up with the state legislature rather than by seeking to remove the judge for doing his job, exercising discretion and showing compassion,"" Khan told The Huffington Post.Indeed, some California lawmakers are proposing to change the legal definition of rape, which could result in stiffer penalties for convicted offenders. This week, another proposed bill put forward would change state law to require prison time for sexual assaults of unconscious people, like in Turner's case. [Related: Brock Turner Was Not Expelled From Stanford]But Khan worries these efforts to essentially implement mandatory minimums could have unintended consequences if a judge can't assign a sentence consistent with the facts of a case or a guilty person. ""This lack of discretion that comes with mandatory minimums will perpetuate policies that have previously resulted in mass incarceration,"" Khan said. ""Such policies will disproportionately impact the underprivileged and minorities in the criminal justice system and in our communities.""The letter was organized after attorney Laurie Ellen Park contacted Khan about a blog he wrote tying Turner's case to the culture of mass incarceration. Khan and Park wondered if they should start a petition in support of Persky. Park and Khan decided to draft an open letter, crafted with help from public defender colleagues Avi Singh and Jennifer Redding, and collected signatures from other attorneys in the area. [Related: If You Don’t Get Why Campus Rape Is A National Problem, Read This]They initially placed the open letter as a petition on MoveOn.org, but said it was taken down without explanation. MoveOn.org's terms of service state it reserves the right to remove a petition that is ""inconsistent with the goals, objectives, philosophies, and/or purpose"" of the liberal organization. The organizers reposted it on Change.org and have collected 279 signatures so far. Khan said he doesn't know of a similar firestorm in recent decades over a single sentence in California. It'd be ""refreshing"" to see outrage when judges impose too harsh of sentences for a particular crime or offender, he added. ""Unfortunately,"" Khan said, ""the countless defendants who have suffered relatively harsh sentences in our state fall below any headline.""Below is the entire open letter in support of Judge Persky:_______Tyler Kingkade is a national reporter, focusing on higher education and sexual violence, and is based in New York.

Marco Rubio worried gun control advocates have a point?,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58740e371200002d00ad68fc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- A top aide to Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) directed staff not to let a prominent gun control advocate get on the phone with the senator to discuss a bill that would bar suspected terrorists from buying guns -- less than two weeks after the worst mass shooting in U.S. history took place in the senator's state.Emails went back and forth Thursday between Rubio's office and Americans for Responsible Solutions, the gun violence prevention group led by former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.) and her husband Mark Kelly, a retired astronaut and U.S. Navy captain. Kelly was interested in talking to Rubio about the prospect of the senator supporting the legislation. Rubio's shop declined the call and offered to have a staffer talk to Kelly. An Americans for Responsible Solutions associate said no and suggested a staff-to-staff level conversation.Then, J.R. Sanchez, Rubio's senior policy adviser and director of outreach, weighed in, apparently not realizing that the gun control group was still on the thread: ""Then let it be staff. I would not expose SMR to this type of call or meeting.""Here's a copy of the exchange obtained by The Huffington Post:The exchange comes in the midst of a heated Capitol Hill debate about gun violence, driven by anger and sorrow over the massacre at a gay club in Orlando, Florida. On Monday, the Senate took up -- and promptly rejected -- four bills that would have tightened the background check system and barred guns for people on terrorist watch lists. Midweek, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) put forward a bipartisan bill that would bar a smaller set of people on terrorist watch lists from buying guns. That bill needs a few more GOP supporters to pass the Senate, which is why Kelly reached out to Rubio.Asked why the senator wouldn't take a call from Kelly, Rubio spokeswoman Olivia Perez-Cubas said the emails presented ""only a partial and incomplete picture of the routine and private discussions"" among staff about other people's requests for Rubio's time. She suggested that the senator is game to talk to Kelly.""Our office is still in the process of setting up a call between Senator Rubio and Captain Kelly,"" Perez-Cubas said in an emailed statement. ""While they share different views on how to best confront the real issue of gun violence in America, Senator Rubio respects Captain Kelly and Rep. Giffords' commitment to public service. Senator Rubio welcomes the opportunity to talk to Captain Kelly, as he's done with constituents and advocates on both sides of the Second Amendment debate throughout his time in office.""She added, ""Feel free to use this response on the record, and please note that we disagree with the premise of your question since it is inaccurate.""An Americans for Responsible Solutions spokeswoman declined comment.Backers of Collins' bill see Rubio as a prime target in their efforts to whip up more support. He has called the mass shooting in his home state ""the new face of the war on terror"" because the gunman, Omar Mateen, pledged his allegiance to ISIS right before killing 49 people and injuring dozens of others. Mateen was also on the FBI's terrorist watch list in 2014, although his name came off later.Intelligence officials, however, are ""increasingly convinced"" that the motive for the shooting had little, if anything, to do with ISIS, according to NPR. It may have had more to do with Mateen's struggles with his own sexuality."

""Dark vortices coast through the atmosphere like huge, lens-shaped gaseous mountains,"" Berkeley research astronomer Mike Wong, who led the team that analyzed the Hubble data, said in a news release. ""And the companion clouds are similar to so-called orographic clouds that appear as pancake-shaped features lingering over mountains on Earth.""A dark vortex on Neptune is a high-pressure system that usually is accompanied by bright ""companion clouds,"" NASA said.""We speculate that these dark spots on Neptune (which are most visible at blue wavelengths) are probably 'clear' areas, openings in the cloud decks that see to deeper layers,"" Heidi Hammel, a researcher at the Space Science Institute, told Astronomy magazine. ""The bright companions (which are most visible at redder wavelengths) are thought to be higher-altitude clouds.""Those companion clouds form by air being diverted over the vortex, which then causes gases to freeze, probably into methane ice crystals, NASA said.The bright companion clouds were first spotted last summer by several observers, including amateur astronomers, who suspected that they might be indications of a dark vortex. However, since the vortex was best viewed in blue wavelengths, more detailed observation required aiming the Hubble Space Telescope at the feature. Hubble's image taken last month confirmed the vortex. While a similar feature was spotted by Voyager 2 in 1989, this was the first one seen on the planet in the 21st century.""Neptune's dark vortices have exhibited surprising diversity over the years, in terms of size, shape and stability (they meander in latitude, and sometimes speed up or slow down),"" the space agency said. ""They also come and go on much shorter timescales compared to similar anticyclones seen on Jupiter; large storms on Jupiter evolve over decades.""Also on Thursday, NASA announced that it had extended Hubble's science operations for another five years -- until 2021.""After the final space shuttle servicing mission to the telescope in 2009, Hubble is better than ever,"" NASA said. ""Hubble is expected to continue to provide valuable data into the 2020’s, securing its place in history as an outstanding general purpose observatory in areas ranging from our solar system to the distant universe."""

The note suggests that even if the U.K. formally separates from the EU, many British citizens will continue to maintain strong ties with their counterparts on the continent.HuffPost Italy obtained the postcard that David, a British Londoner, slipped under the door of Mattia and Adele, two Italians living next door, on Friday morning. Mattia works for a marketing company in the U.K. and Adele works at an art gallery, and they have been living in the country for about two years. Here is what David wrote:Mattia and Adele,On a day clouded by uncertainty, Mattia and Adele found the note uplifting.“This unexpected letter made us very happy,” Adele told HuffPost Italy. “A small gesture that makes us feel less lost in front of the outcome of the referendum.”Italians, like other EU citizens, have been free to live and work in the U.K. Thursday’s Brexit vote will not change that overnight; Britain now has two years to renegotiate its relationship to the EU.It is likely that the U.K. will keep some free movement provisions in place for people from EU countries to retain critical access to the bloc's single market.But as WorldPost reported, that has not prevented many residents of the U.K. from other European countries from growing anxious about what a Brexit could mean for them.“Everything that happens today will affect me, without me having anything to do with it,” Marlou Hermsen, a Dutch citizen living in Liverpool, England, told The WorldPost on Thursday.A version of this piece was originally published on HuffPost Italy, and has been translated into English and adapted for a U.S. audience."

The S&P 500 has dropped over 3 percent.The finance ministers and central bank governors of the G-7 countries, which include the U.S. and the U.K., issued a joint statement aimed at reassuring the markets. The leaders said they “have taken steps to ensure adequate liquidity and to support the functioning of markets.” U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew issued another statement, in which he said the department will “continue to monitor developments in financial markets.""The worst financial shock to the global economy since the 2008 crisis has raised one major question for anyone with retirement savings: What do I do?The answer is simple: Nothing.

The best thing to do is exactly what you were doing before. If you were planning on increasing how much you save, do it. If you weren’t, don’t suddenly decide to save more because you think you can pick the low point of the market.Consider what happened in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Employees, on average, lost 14 percent of their savings in 2008 alone, according to Hewitt Associates.But the market bounced back several times over in subsequent years, leaving people who decided to sell their stocks far worse off than those who decided to -- or merely could afford to -- hold on.

That’s the amount of money those groups got in funding from the EU in 2014, the most recent year for which such data is available.Oxfam Great Britain received the most money from the EU that year. It got 39 million British pounds ($53 million). The International Rescue Committee got nearly 23 million British Pounds ($31.5 million).While a number of charities and aid groups stand to lose a significant amount of funds, many have resolved to remain focused on their causes, and particularly committed to the refugee crisis as those in favor of separating want Britain to wield more control over immigration issues. UNICEF U.K., for example, reaffirmed its support of vulnerable refugees in the wake of Brexit.“Whether it be tackling poverty, or our role in helping vulnerable refugees in Europe and the world; we must not falter in our commitment to helping vulnerable children wherever they may be,” Mike Penrose, executive director, told Reuters. Amid the uncertainty of the fallout, World Vision said it will do whatever it takes to stay on task.“There are many unanswered questions about Brexit,” Tim Pilkington, chief executive of World Vision, told Reuters, “but, in the meantime, we’ll continue working alongside the U.K. Government to champion the rights of children and to shape policies that achieve this.”While Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders criticized the decision, it had already separated itself from the EU recently.The aid group, which brings medical care to conflict zones and underserved areas, declared last Friday that it would no longer accept funds from the EU. The announcement came in response to the EU-Turkey deal, which granted Turkey financial and political rewards for halting illegal immigration through its territory.Last year, the organization received 19 million euros (about $21 million) from EU institutions, and 37 million euros ($41 million) from member states.“Deterrence policies sold to the public as humanitarian solutions have only exacerbated the suffering of people in need. There is nothing remotely humanitarian about these policies. It cannot become the norm and must be challenged,” Jerome Oberreit, international secretary general, said in a statement. “MSF will not receive funding from institutions and governments whose policies do so much harm.”"

The British government has a proud history of supporting international development and we will continue to work closely with them to uphold the interests of every last child, wherever they are.""ARCHIBISHOPS, CHURCH OF ENGLAND""As citizens of the United Kingdom, whatever our views during the referendum campaign, we must remain hospitable and compassionate, builders of bridges and not barriers. Many of those living among us and alongside us as neighbours, friends and work colleagues come from overseas and some will feel a deep sense of insecurity. We must respond by offering reassurance, by cherishing our wonderfully diverse society, and by affirming the unique contribution of each and every one.""VICKIE HAWKINS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, MÉDECINS SANS FRONTIÈRES/ DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS UK""Regardless of whether the UK is in the EU or not, the Government must not forget that it still has a moral and legal responsibility to ensure people fleeing war and violence can find safety. The UK, as well as all European Governments, must urgently increase the proper management of refugee claims in Europe. This is the only solution that will not leave to an unacceptable level of suffering and Brexit has not changed this. If anything, today's decision puts a greater responsibility on the British Government's shoulders and they must now use their own agency to take action.""MIKE PENROSE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF UNICEF UK""Unicef UK will continue to work with the Government and UK civil society to make sure that the UK retains its position as a world leader in supporting children internationally, in emergencies, and in the UK. Whether it be tackling poverty, or our role in helping vulnerable refugees in Europe and the world; we must not falter in our commitment to helping vulnerable children wherever they may be.""TIM PILKINGTON, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF WORLD VISION UK""Following a divisive campaign, we need to return to a unified and confident government that stays influential on the world stage and continues to push for reforms which benefit children in the world's toughest countries. There are many unanswered questions about Brexit but, in the meantime, we'll continue working alongside the UK Government to champion the rights of children and to shape policies that achieve this. The Prime Minister spoke in his resignation speech about keeping promises to the world's poorest people. We believe this is a proud UK tradition and part of the very fabric of British society - not a sentiment that will change because of a referendum.""(Reporting by Lin Taylor @linnytayls, Editing by Ros Russell; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters that covers humanitarian issues, conflicts, global land rights, modern slavery and human trafficking, women's rights, and climate change.

EMINI S&P 500 futures were down 4 percent and Japan's Nikkei ended down 7.9 percent.The British pound collapsed no less than 18 U.S. cents, easily the biggest fall in living memory, to hit its lowest since 1985. The euro in turn slid 3.2 percent to $1.1012 as investors feared for its very future.Having campaigned to keep the country in the EU, British Prime Minister David Cameron confirmed he would step down.Results showed a 51.9/48.1 percent split for leaving, setting the UK on an uncertain path and dealing the largest setback to European efforts to forge greater unity since World War Two.Sterling sank a staggering 10 percent at one point and was last at $1.3582, having carved out a range of $1.3228 to $1.5022. The fall was even larger than during the global financial crisis and the currency was moving two or three cents in the blink of an eye.""It's an extraordinary move for financial markets and also for democracy,"" said co-head of portfolio investments of London-based currency specialist Millennium Global Richard Benson.""The market is pricing interest rate cuts from the big central banks and we assume there will be a global liquidity add from them in the next few hours,"" he added.The shockwaves affected all asset classes and regions.The safe-haven yen sprang higher to stand at 102.15 per dollar, having been as low as 106.81 at one stage. The dollar peak decline of 4 percent was the largest since 1998.That prompted warnings from Japanese officials that excessive forex moves were undesirable. Indeed, traders were wary in case global central banks chose to step in to calm the volatility.The Bank of England said it would take all necessary steps to shield Britain's economy. A source told Reuters it was in touch with other major central banks. The Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda added his bank was also ready to provide liquidity if needed to ensure market stability.Other currencies across Asia and in eastern Europe as it woke up suffered badly on worries that alarmed investors could pull funds out of emerging markets. Poland, where many of the eastern Europeans in Britain come from, saw its zloty slump 5 percent.RECESSION FEARSEurope's natural safety play, the 10-year German government bond, surged to send its yields tumbling back into negative territory and a new record low.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slid almost 5 percent, while Shanghai stocks lost 1.1 percent.Financial markets have been gripped for months by worries about what Brexit, or a British exit from the European Union, would mean for Europe's stability.""Obviously, there will be a large spill-over effects across all global economies if the ""Leave"" vote wins. Not only will the UK go into recession, Europe will follow suit,"" was the gloomy prediction of Matt Sherwood, head of investment strategy at fund manager Perpetual in Sydney.Investors duly stampeded to sovereign bonds, with U.S. 10-year Treasury futures jumping over 2 points in an extremely rare move for Asian hours.Yields on the cash note fell 24 basis points to 1.49 percent, the steepest one-day drop since 2009 and the lowest yield since 2012.As investors sought safer assets, the rally even extended to UK bonds, despite ratings agency Standard and Poor's warning it would likely downgrade the country's triple A rating if it left the EU.Yields on benchmark 10-year gilts fell 27 basis points to 1.108 pct.Across the Atlantic, investors were pricing in even less chance of another hike in U.S. interest rates given the Federal Reserve had cited a British exit from the EU as one reason to be cautious on tightening.""It adds weight to the camp that the Fed would be on hold. A July (hike) is definitely off the table,"" Mike Baele, managing director with the private client reserve group at U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon.Fed funds futures <0#FF:> were even toying with the chance that the next move could be a cut in U.S. rates.Commodities likewise swung lower as a Brexit would be seen as a major threat to global growth. U.S. crude shed $3.00 to $47.11 a barrel in erratic trade while Brent fell as much as 6 percent to $47.83 before clawing back to $48.18.Industrial metal copper sank 3 percent but gold galloped more than 6 percent higher thanks to its perceived safe haven status.(Editing by Toby Chopra)"
39,BUSINESS,Brexit Chaos Could Shock Trump Voters Back To Common Sense,Emily Peck and Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brexit-donald-trump-voters_us_576d42c0e4b0dbb1bbba44c9,Or it should anyway.,2016-06-24,"Trump on Brexit: ""People want to take their country back.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576d442a2200002e00f82cc9.jpeg?cache=fdUgpuEW5U&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Markets around the world plunged Friday morning as the shock of Britain’s vote to leave the European Union ripped through the global economy.Donald Trump, for his part, aligned himself firmly on the side of the economic chaos. In the long term, if the Brexit vote triggers a slowdown or sustained job losses in the United Kingdom -- as many predict -- Trump may find that he's made a fatal error.The presumptive GOP presidential nominee bragged on Friday that his ideas are well-reflected in the sentiment driving the Brexit: a feeling among the English that they needed to “reclaim” their country from immigrants (particularly Muslims) and globalization.“I felt it was going to happen,” Trump said Friday at a press conference held on his golf course in Scotland. “There are great similarities between what happened here and my campaign. People want to take their country back.” If the Brexit continues to roil markets, those words could come back to haunt Trump. The vote across the pond could serve us a perfect case study for the reality-TV star’s ideas, which include deporting millions of people and banning an entire religious group from coming to the United States. These nakedly racist and nativist policies, plus the call to “make America great again,” are the American equivalent of the anti-immigration mood that drove English voters to turn against Europe. There was even a Trump-like character, Nigel Farage, leading the movement to leave the EU, as The Huffington Post's Marina Fang noted. A businessman-turned-politician, Farage heads the right-wing U.K. Independence party and has called Muslims a “fifth column living within our country, who hate us and want to kill us.”On Friday, Trump doubled down on the similarities, speaking at a press conference in Scotland.“I really do see a parallel between what’s happening in the United States and what’s happening here. People want to see borders. They don’t necessarily want people [coming] into their country they don’t know where they’re coming from,” he reportedly said.Trump also boasted that he’d profit as the British pound declined in value. So far that sentiment has sent stock markets plunging, wiping out $2 trillion in value from capital markets on Friday, and potentially set us up for a summer of economic turmoil. The specter of job loss hangs ominously over the U.K., particularly for 2.2 million financial workers in the country. Before the historic vote on Thursday, employers signaled that they’d flee the country if it voted itself out of the Union. In April, John Cryan, the British-born chief executive of the German giant Deutsche Bank said he planned to move operations to Frankfurt, Germany’s financial capital. Goldman Sachs, which has warned for years that leaving the EU could devastate the British financial sector, seems likely to move to Germany, too. JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon, who threatened to quit the U.K. if it left the EU, said in a memo to staff Friday that “we may need to make changes to our European legal entity structure and the location of some roles.”Brexit could spell trouble for the British tech industry, too. Startups benefit from European laws designed to create a “digital single market” worth an estimated €415 billion, or about $460.8 billion.“This could be a new Lehman moment,” one investment manager overseas told The Wall Street Journal, referring to the collapse of the investment bank in 2008 that set off the financial crisis. “Today’s UK referendum results on European Union (EU) membership will mean more uncertainty for businesses around the world as they navigate the complex implications,"" Mark Weinberger, global chairman and CEO of consulting firm EY, said in a statement. To be sure, already on Friday, political leaders were working to quell the chaos. Martin Schulz, president of the EU parliament, told The Guardian that EU lawyers would work to hasten the Brexit -- which could take up to two years of negotiation -- in hopes of minimizing volatility in the market. In the U.S., President Barack Obama reassured the world that America and England are still friends. ""The people of the United Kingdom have spoken, and we respect their decision,"" Obama said in a statement. ""The special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom is enduring.""Still the road ahead looks pretty rough. And definitely in the short term, Trump’s ideas just got a big test overseas and they failed -- here’s hoping Americans are paying attention. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Courtesy Andrew Edlin Gallery",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576d67c51500002f001bb45a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"On June 12, 2016, a gunman opened fire at a queer nightclub in Orlando, Florida, killing 49 people and injuring 53 others. The massacre was the deadliest shooting in United States history. In the days since, countless individuals have grieved the young, innocent and beautiful lives cruelly cut short through this act of hate and questioned a world in which such a sickening gesture of inhumanity could occur, again and again. ""I was talking to someone about how, as artists, we are responsible, we have to do something,"" artist Terence Koh explained in an interview with The Huffington Post. He speaks softly and silvery, his voice one that immediately makes you want to temper your own in response. ""He said back to me, 'We are all responsible.'""On the evening of June 23, Koh performed a tribute to the victims of the Orlando massacre in the form of a chanting ceremony. Inspired by a ritual he witnessed at a Buddhist monastery, the Chinese-Canadian artist chanted the names of the 49 victims inside a bee chapel, a space in his ongoing exhibition at Andrew Edlin Gallery in New York. The chapel was connected to a microphone that linked to an antenna, which transmitted the sounds that moved through it into outer space, spreading Koh's message of love into the universe. The bee chapel features a steep mound of dark earth, on top of which rests a metal mesh structure housing the swarming insects. Their sounds, smells and vibrations fill the room. ""I thought it would be nice for the bees to also listen to the names as well,"" Koh said, ""so the bees would know the stories of the names.""Koh began the performance by blowing a shell horn, one of the sculptures featured in the ""Bee Chapel"" exhibition, six times into the Manhattan streets surrounding the gallery, alerting the public of the ceremony about to take place. He then proceeded to play a Tibetan gong while chanting the names of the 49 victims one by one. ""I went to a monastery where they were chanting the name of Buddhists that had passed away,"" Koh recalled. ""By chanting the names, they became living presences again. It's another way of storytelling. So I tried to almost sing the names, instead of just saying them, to celebrate them in a loving and beautiful way."" Koh read most names in alphabetical order, except for Juan Ramon Guerrero and his partner Christopher “Drew” Leinonen, who were in love and planned to be married. Koh read their names alongside one another. The heart of the tribute, Koh explained, was sparked by Namu Dai Bosa, a Buddhist chant that refers to the idea, as the artist put it, ""that all beings are enlightened in the past, present and future. Every atom in existence is alive and present."" To fully amplify the scope of this concept, Koh broadcast the names he spoke into outer space.""It spread all the good energy in the room out into the universe,"" he said. ""It was like singing them like a vibration of light.""After the chant, six films played simultaneously and silently on the gallery walls, representing iconic moments in cinema for the LGBTQ community. ""Beautiful People"" by David Wojnarowicz, ""Pink Flamingos"" by John Waters, ""Jihad for Love"" by Parvez Sharma, ""Raspberry Reich"" by Bruce La Bruce, ""Flaming Creatures"" by Jack Smith, and ""Bijou"" by Wakefield Poole streamed as soundless, moving pictures, overlapping and shapeshifting into one another.""It was almost like a nightclub,"" Koh said. As the films played on, the gallery space morphed from a performance into a gathering, with participants eating pizza and popcorn, sharing stories, being together. As Koh explained: ""It made me feel like everybody in there was participating. It’s a way of human storytelling, a festive atmosphere to celebrate life.""This profound tribute to Orlando's victims is a stark departure from the work that made Koh's name known throughout the art scene in the early 2000s. Back then, Koh held the reputation of being a ""bad boy"" -- or at least the art world equivalent. He dressed only in white and often in monkey fur, took vows of silence before scheduled interviews, and notoriously dipped his feces in gold leaf and sold it for for half a million dollars at Art Basel Miami Beach. He first became known for his queer punk website and zine asianpunkboy.com, before evolving into a full-fledge art darling who seamlessly blended darkness and party antics. And then, in 2014, Koh cut off ties with his gallery representatives and moved upstate to New York's Catskills. He got rid of his cell phone, stopped reading the news, and many assumed he had quit the art world all together. ""Bee Chapel"" marked Koh's return to the art world, and a very different Koh it was. Meditative, somber, concerned with the essential questions of love, death and nature that make up human existence. ""I want to be responsible, to bring love and light into the world,"" Koh expressed. As an artist, one takes responsibility by making work, translating the darkness that plagues the world around us into brief spurts of beauty that can reach for understanding and bring about comfort and hope. But, as Koh stated, those of us who aren't artists have a responsibility in the face of iniquity as well.""We carry the spirit ourselves wherever we are,"" Koh said. ""Anybody that is anywhere can take a moment to remind ourselves about the very present moment we have. There are so many amazing, positive possibilities for us as human beings, we have to remember.""He paused before speaking again. ""I’m walking in the bee chapel right now and there are mementos of flowers and pictures that people left behind. I think it’s important we all come together to do things like this. There is so much fear and hate in the world, it’s our responsibility to give love and light. Whether it’s just people having a dinner and a conversation, it all spreads out. We can all make a change.""Terence Koh's ""Bee Chapel"" runs until July 29, 2016, at Andrew Edlin Gallery in New York. "

Obama, who had argued passionately against the UK leaving the EU in a trip to the Britain this year, vowed that Washington would still maintain both its ""special relationship"" with London and close ties to Brussels.In an emotional speech on Friday, UK Prime Minister Cameron, who led the campaign to remain in Europe to defeat, after promising the referendum in 2013, said he would leave office by October.""The British people have made the very clear decision to take a different path and as such I think the country requires fresh leadership to take it in this direction,"" he said in a televised address outside his residence.""I do not think it would be right for me to be the captain that steers our country to its next destination,"" he added, choking back tears before walking back through 10 Downing Street's black door with his arm around his wife Samantha.The British pound fell as much as 10 percent against the U.S. dollar on Friday to levels last seen in 1985 on fears the decision could hit investment in the world's fifth-largest economy, threaten London's role as a global financial capital, and usher in months of political uncertainty. The euro slid 2.0 percent against the U.S. dollar. World stocks saw more than $2 trillion wiped off their value. European stocks ended down 7.0 percent the biggest one day fall since 2008. U.S. stocks fell suffered the largest selloff in ten months sharply, with the Dow Jones industrial average losing 3.4 percent.Investors rushed to put their cash in the safety of gold which clocked up its biggest daily gain the global financial crisis of 2008, ending Friday up 5.0 percent at $1,315 an ounce.INVENTING ANOTHER EUROPEQuitting the world's biggest trading bloc could cost Britain access to the trade barrier-free single market and means it must seek new trade accords with countries around the world. A poll of economists by Reuters predicted Britain was likelier than not to fall into recession within a year.The EU arose out of the ashes of two world wars to unite a continent and now faces the challenge of maintaining economic and political unity without Britain, which has the EU's biggest financial center, a U.N. Security Council veto, a powerful army and nuclear weapons.""It's an explosive shock. At stake is the break-up pure and simple of the union,"" French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said. ""Now is the time to invent another Europe.""German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the ""Brexit"" vote a watershed for European unification.The result emboldened eurosceptics in other EU member states, with French National Front leader Marine Le Pen and Dutch far-right leader Geert Wilders demanding their countries also hold referendums. Le Pen changed her Twitter profile picture to a Union Jack and declared ""Victory for freedom!""The British vote will trigger at least two years of divorce proceedings with the EU, the first exit by any member state. Cameron, in office since 2010, said it would be up to his successor to formally start the exit process.His Conservative Party rival Boris Johnson, the former London mayor who became the most recognizable face of the Leave camp, is now widely tipped to seek his job.""We can find our voice in the world again, a voice that is commensurate with the fifth-biggest economy on earth,"" he told reporters at Leave campaign headquarters.Lawmakers from the opposition Labour Party launched a no-confidence motion to topple their leader, leftist Jeremy Corbyn, accused by opponents in the party of campaigning tepidly for its Remain stance.""INDEPENDENCE DAY""There was euphoria among Britain's eurosceptic forces, claiming a victory over the political establishment, big business and foreign leaders including U.S. President Barack Obama who had urged Britain to stay in Europe.""Let June 23 go down in our history as our independence day,"" said Nigel Farage, leader of the eurosceptic UK Independence Party, describing the EU as ""doomed"" and ""dying"".The political and economic shock hits a European bloc already reeling from a euro zone debt crisis, unprecedented mass migration, and confrontation with Russia over Ukraine. Support for anti-immigrant and anti-EU parties has surged across the continent recently.U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump, whose own rise has been fueled by similar anger at the political establishment, called the vote a ""great thing"".

Obama, who had argued passionately against the UK leaving the EU in a trip to the Britain this year, vowed that Washington would still maintain both its ""special relationship"" with London and close ties to Brussels.In an emotional speech on Friday, UK Prime Minister Cameron, who led the campaign to remain in Europe to defeat, after promising the referendum in 2013, said he would leave office by October.""The British people have made the very clear decision to take a different path and as such I think the country requires fresh leadership to take it in this direction,"" he said in a televised address outside his residence.""I do not think it would be right for me to be the captain that steers our country to its next destination,"" he added, choking back tears before walking back through 10 Downing Street's black door with his arm around his wife Samantha.The British pound fell as much as 10 percent against the U.S. dollar on Friday to levels last seen in 1985 on fears the decision could hit investment in the world's fifth-largest economy, threaten London's role as a global financial capital, and usher in months of political uncertainty. The euro slid 2.0 percent against the U.S. dollar. World stocks saw more than $2 trillion wiped off their value. European stocks ended down 7.0 percent the biggest one day fall since 2008. U.S. stocks fell suffered the largest selloff in ten months sharply, with the Dow Jones industrial average losing 3.4 percent.Investors rushed to put their cash in the safety of gold which clocked up its biggest daily gain the global financial crisis of 2008, ending Friday up 5.0 percent at $1,315 an ounce.INVENTING ANOTHER EUROPEQuitting the world's biggest trading bloc could cost Britain access to the trade barrier-free single market and means it must seek new trade accords with countries around the world. A poll of economists by Reuters predicted Britain was likelier than not to fall into recession within a year.The EU arose out of the ashes of two world wars to unite a continent and now faces the challenge of maintaining economic and political unity without Britain, which has the EU's biggest financial center, a U.N. Security Council veto, a powerful army and nuclear weapons.""It's an explosive shock. At stake is the break-up pure and simple of the union,"" French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said. ""Now is the time to invent another Europe.""German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the ""Brexit"" vote a watershed for European unification.The result emboldened eurosceptics in other EU member states, with French National Front leader Marine Le Pen and Dutch far-right leader Geert Wilders demanding their countries also hold referendums. Le Pen changed her Twitter profile picture to a Union Jack and declared ""Victory for freedom!""The British vote will trigger at least two years of divorce proceedings with the EU, the first exit by any member state. Cameron, in office since 2010, said it would be up to his successor to formally start the exit process.His Conservative Party rival Boris Johnson, the former London mayor who became the most recognizable face of the Leave camp, is now widely tipped to seek his job.""We can find our voice in the world again, a voice that is commensurate with the fifth-biggest economy on earth,"" he told reporters at Leave campaign headquarters.Lawmakers from the opposition Labour Party launched a no-confidence motion to topple their leader, leftist Jeremy Corbyn, accused by opponents in the party of campaigning tepidly for its Remain stance.""INDEPENDENCE DAY""There was euphoria among Britain's eurosceptic forces, claiming a victory over the political establishment, big business and foreign leaders including U.S. President Barack Obama who had urged Britain to stay in Europe.""Let June 23 go down in our history as our independence day,"" said Nigel Farage, leader of the eurosceptic UK Independence Party, describing the EU as ""doomed"" and ""dying"".The political and economic shock hits a European bloc already reeling from a euro zone debt crisis, unprecedented mass migration, and confrontation with Russia over Ukraine. Support for anti-immigrant and anti-EU parties has surged across the continent recently.U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump, whose own rise has been fueled by similar anger at the political establishment, called the vote a ""great thing"". Britons ""took back control of their country"", he said in Scotland where he was opening a golf resort.
