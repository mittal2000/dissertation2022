Exit polls on the night of the election showed Netanyahu had closed the gap.... Avi Degani, a pollster, professor at Tel Aviv University and president of the Geocartography Knowledge Group, saw very different results from his own polls. He never anticipated a Zionist Union victory. Instead, he says, he always saw Likud holding a lead. The mistake that others made, according to Degani, was in the methodology. 'The Internet does not represent the state of Israel and the people of Israel,' he said, referring to modern statistical methods. 'It represents panels, and the panels are biased strongly to the center -- Tel Aviv, better-educated, more participants in this kind of conversation. And people who are in the periphery and so on and have the stronger tendency to vote Likud, I think, are poorly represented.'"" [CNN]Internal polls showed a late shift - Carl Bialik: ""'Likud gained votes by convincing right-wing voters they need to make a strategic vote for Likud at the expense of voting against their ideology,' Jeremy Saltan, chairman of Bayit Yehudi’s English-speaking wing and an election forecaster, said in an email interview Wednesday. 'The strategic vote argument actually worked better than anything the prime minister actually said or did.' He cited on his blog unspecified, unpublished internal campaign polling that was conducted after the blackout on public polls and that showed Likud gaining at the expense of Bayit Yehudi. In the email interview, he said there were multiple internal polls, most of them conducted Sunday, two days before the election. He declined to say which campaign or campaigns they came from. [538]And the exit polls? Renee Ghert-Zand: ""Professor Camil Fuchs, a Tel Aviv University statistics expert who conducted the Channel 10 exit poll, told Army Radio that the discrepancy could be attributed to the fact that a larger number of voters refused to participate in his exit poll than in past elections. Mina Tzemach, who conducted Channel 2’s exit poll together with her partner Mano Geva, insisted her statistical model was good. She also pointed to lower than usual participation in her exit poll as the possible problem. 'Usually we have 7 or 8 percent of voters who don’t agree to participate, but this time is was more like 15 percent,' she told Army Radio. Tzemach said this lack of participation was greatest at polling places that were known to have many pro-Likud voters, and in particular immigrants from the former Soviet Union countries who are reluctant to take part in exit polls. This under-representation of Likud voters must have skewed the results, she said. [Times of Israel]Exit poll methods explained - More from Ghert-Zand: ""Channel 1 pollster Stella Karayov dismissed a suggestion that exit poll participants could have been untruthful about whom they had actually voted for. According to her, this kind of behavior would have affected results for not only the large parties, but also the smaller ones — whose exit poll numbers turned out to be very close to actual vote counts. Channels 1 and 2 used similar methods in their exit polls. Both asked voters who had just finished dropping their actual ballots into official ballot boxes to vote again in similar fashion for the exit poll. Channel 2 set up 60 ballot boxes at polling stations around the country to gather information from 25,000 voters this way. Channel 1 used the same number of ballot boxes, but at polling places that served a total of 30,000 voters...Instead of using ballot boxes, Channel 10 asked people to stop and fill out a survey after voting. Fuchs told Haaretz that he suspected that the lower participation rate that this approach generates (usually around 80 percent) is due to the lack of anonymity. At the same time, however, he said the methodology was preferably in terms of speed and logistical simplicity."" [Times of Israel]Missed late voting? - Adam Taylor and Peyton Craighill: ""Joe Lenski, an expert on exit polls at Edison Research, is quick to caution that even at best, polls can only make predictions. 'Exit polls have margin of errors like any other survey,' he says in a phone interview. 'It just becomes magnified when races are this close.'...Lenski noted were reports that the polling companies had stopped interviewing voters about two hours before the polls closed in a bid to have numbers for news reports at the 10 p.m. close of polls. In closing their polls early, pollsters may have missed a last-minute rush from right-wing voters. Counting the votes of members of the Israeli army also was known to be a problem, Lenski added. The soldiers vote earlier than the rest of the population and follow different procedures. Errors in exit polls occur all over the world — in the 2004 U.S. presidential election, for instance, a number of polling companies, including Edison, were found to have made errors that led to inflated estimates of support for John Kerry in exit polls....'They have a really tough time in Israel,' Lenski says. 'They're not only estimating the top two candidates, they're trying make seat estimates for 10 parties.'"" [WashPost]More from U.S exit pollster Lenski - In a telephone interview with HuffPollster, Lenski explains that he found it “curious” that “you had three supposedly independent exit polls all coming up with results for every party within one seat of each other,” especially given the complex threshold and rounding rules involved in translating vote percentages into Knesset seats. He recalls working on exit polling for CBS in 1988 when three U.S. television networks still conducted exit polls separately. ""We had differences [with] ABC and NBC in those years, and I think that’s healthy. If there were in [the U.S.] multiple exit poll results, each would be treated with the proper amount of skepticism instead of the belief that ‘that’s what the exit polls says, so that’s what it must be.’” Lenski also speculates that, after a thorough investigation, Israeli pollsters will reach the same conclusion as in probes of past polling snafus: ""It’s going to come out that it’s a combination of small effects and in this case they all went in the same direction. So maybe they’re off by one seat because of the spike in turnout late in the day. Maybe they’re off an additional seat because of the non-response difference; the non-response went from 7 percent to 15 percent and was all Likud supporters, that could be a point there."" Another factor or two could tack on few more seats and explain the full error. Quote of the day - Democratic pollster Mark Mellman, who advised Yesh Atid, when asked about Israeli polling via Twitter: ""It sucks."" [@MarkMellman]AMERICANS' GREATEST WORRIES SHIFT - Justin McCarthy: ""Out of 15 domestic issues, Americans' concerns about terrorism and race relations have risen most sharply over the past year. The percentage of Americans who worry 'a great deal' about the possibility of a terrorist attack (51%) climbed 12 percentage points from 2014 to 2015, while concerns about race relations (28%) surged 11 points. Americans' worries about illegal immigration also climbed over the past year, increasing six points to 39%....On the other hand, Americans' concerns about unemployment have fallen substantially over the last year. While nearly half of Americans (49%) said in 2014 that they had a great deal of worry about the job market, this figure has since dropped to 37%, a level not seen since before the most recent economic recession. Similarly, the percentage saying they worry a great deal about the economy has fallen six points, which is consistent with higher economic confidence over the past year and a slightly higher rate of growth in the national GDP in 2014 than in recent years."" [Gallup]AMERICANS WOULD RATHER VOTE A PRO GAY MARRIAGE PRESIDENT - HuffPollster: ""Support for gay marriage has become the majority opinion, and voters now also say they're more likely to reject a presidential candidate opposed to gay marriage than one who backs it -- something gay marriage advocates hope marks a political tipping point for 2016. In a new HuffPost/YouGov poll, more than a third of voters say they don't care what position a candidate takes on the issue, but those who do care say they favor gay rights by an 8-point margin. Thirty-four percent of voters say they'd prefer a presidential candidate to support gay marriage, and just 26 percent say they'd prefer a candidate to oppose it. Most Democrats want a gay-marriage advocate, while Republicans voters are more likely to say they don't care or are unsure than that they'd actively favor an anti-gay marriage candidate.

It's because I now live in a sauna. Right about the time that menopause hit, momma moved in with the hubby and I. Wanting her to be comfortable I taught her how to use the thermostat. It's electric and digital and that just blew her mind. Technology is not her strong point.This is the biggest mistake I have made to date... and there have been many! Momma also takes blood pressure medicine and is ALWAYS cold. So every time I turn around the thermostat goes to 80! I keep it at a warm 72 degrees which with my menopausal hot flashes already feels like 110. Photo courtesy of morguefile.comLast night she was in her room quilting when I went to my room for the night so I said good night and went to write for awhile before going to bed. I feel asleep early after having both babies Saturday night but before I did I made a last check of the house. Doors locked, lights out, thermostat check.Two a.m., my husband sits up on the side of the bed and it wakes me up immediately since I am a very light sleeper and the sweat running down my body wasn't helping. I asked him what was wrong and he answered back, ""I'm melting!"" Realizing it wasn't just me in this hot house hell I got up to check the thermostat again -- this time it is set at 90 degrees! So I turn it back down but by this time we are both soaked with sweat. We huddle in our small bathroom with the window open him sitting on the toilet and me sitting on the tub the fan blowing the cold air in to relieve us.We look at each other in the dark and just start cracking up. Here we are two grown up, married, older adults huddling in the bathroom trying to get a real ""breath of fresh air."" So when most normal people are sleeping we decide to head out to the garage where we can cool off and hold a conversation without whispering. My neighbors probably think that we are crack heads but hey you do what you got to do. Photo courtesy of morguefile.comMy husband complains about the electric bill and then I gently remind him that we'll make it up this summer when she turns the air to 90 when it's 120 outside. Strangely this calms him down. It's amazing the things you learn to live with when someone you love has Alzheimer's Disease.Last week I made breakfast for supper and after I cook she always does the dishes (even though there is a perfectly good dishwasher right next to the sink) but she likes to do them so I don't argue. There were only a few left and I excused myself to go to the restroom and when I came back everything was cleaned up... or so I thought. Turns out momma got confused about which side of the sink holds the garbage disposal. My husband spent the evening taking the pipes apart to pull out all of the junk she had shoved down the drain pipe.The very next day we kept smelling this weird smell and searched the house trying to find the source. We narrowed it down to the kitchen but knew the pipes were clean because he had it all apart the night before. At this point, I open the freezer to get some ice for my drink and what do I find? An egg carton, inside this egg carton were all the eggshells from the eggs I had used the night before along with the HOT bacon grease which melted the egg carton so my freezer was full of frozen bacon grease all over EVERYTHING! Photo courtesy of morguefile.comI don't go back and say ""Momma what were you thinking"" what good would that do? I just try to minimize the damage and clean up the messes. It could be worse... I'm sure one day it will be worse but for now we're all right. This is what I mean by ""laugh at the crazy""! Can I just say, ""I'VE GOT THE BEST HUSBAND EVER!""Remember to appreciate the good, laugh at the crazy and deal with the rest. I love you momma... can I please have my shoes back now?"

Rob Woodall of the House Budget Committee. ""A budget is a moral document,"" said the Georgia Republican. ""It talks about where your values are.""That's certainly true. So what are we to make of this year's House and Senate Republican budgets? They harm seniors, use the disabled as pawns, punish the needy, pamper the wealthy, and employ deceit -- all to promote a selfish agenda for the wealthy and powerful.There's a lot to say about these two proposals, but for now we'll restrict ourselves to two important subjects: Social Security and Medicare.False AlarmsOn Social Security, both the House and Senate documents mislead readers about the state of the program's finances. ""[I]t is irresponsible to ignore the looming insolvency in Social Security,"" says the House GOP plan. ""The Social Security program is on a track to bankruptcy,"" says the Senate proposal, adding, ""The deficits will increase the publicly held debt while depleting the Social Security trust fund.""These statements are false and alarmist. The Social Security Trust Fund currently holds $2.8 trillion in assets, in the form of legally binding debt from the U.S. Treasury. (And a word to conservatives: Don't tell us that this debt is comprised of ""just IOUs"" -- not unless you're prepared to say that your own Treasury bonds are ""just IOUs"" too.)Under current projections, and with no changes to the program, Social Security will be able to pay full benefits until the mid-2030s. Even then it will be able to pay three-quarters of benefits, since it will continue to collect revenue every year. That is neither ""insolvency"" nor ""bankruptcy"" as those words are commonly understood.To add an extra frisson of panic, the Republicans continue to oppose rebalancing the retirement and disability trust funds to ensure that disabled Americans continue to receive full benefits. That adjustment, which Congresses led by both parties have made 11 times in the past, is quite minor. But the Republicans are eager to provoke a needless crisis to promote their agenda, even if it means using the disabled as pawns.A ""moral document"" indeed.Here's another fact that these GOP budgets conveniently fail to mention: that future shortfall is easily remedied through such measures as lifting the ""payroll tax cap"" for high and extremely high earners, imposing a financial transaction tax on Wall Street, and increasing the average American's payroll tax by literally a few dollars a month.Polls show that these solutions are popular with voters. In fact, large majorities of Republicans, as well as Democrats and independents, support using a tax-the-rich approach to fund an expansion of Social Security benefits. That makes sense, since growing wealth inequality and the collapse of other retirement vehicles has left most Americans facing financial insecurity in their retirement.The Bipartisan ShuffleHaving raised their false alarms, the Republicans are surprisingly diffident about following them to their logical conclusion: benefit cuts. No wonder -- the idea is enormously unpopular with voters. Instead of pitching that, Republicans take a page from the ""Grand Bargain"" and ""bipartisan"" talk of years past.""Truly what's needed is a long-term solution to the problems facing Social Security,"" says the House document. ""One such proposal would be a bipartisan commission that would be required to study the structural deficiencies within the current Social Security system and report back with specific legislative proposals for Congress and the President to consider.""The Senate document echoes that sentiment. Senate Republicans say their plan ""allows the President and congressional leaders to begin a bipartisan, bicameral discussion to protect Social Security, prevent a massive increase in publicly held debt"" -- (note: Social Security law is forbidden by law from contributing to Federal deficits) -- ""and avoid ... across-the-board Social Security benefit cuts....""The House budget says, ""Our budget calls for a bipartisan path forward in addressing the long-term structural problems within Social Security"" (emphasis mine).Well, of course it does. No politician in their right mind, not even a Republican one, would want their party associated with such widely unpopular policies. That's why Republicans, as well as Democrats who are economically conservative on this issue, are so fond of the word ""bipartisan.""""Bipartisanship"" is the Washington equivalent of those Agatha Christie novels where all the suspects commit the murder in the hope than none of them will be found guilty.They're Ba-a-a-ck...Bipartisanship was the watchword of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, commonly known as the Simpson-Bowles commission. While the commission deadlocked and failed to issue a proposal, the Simpson-Bowles proposal released by its co-chairs became the outline of several failed attempts at a ""Grand Bargain.""There appears to be some nostalgia for those talks among Republicans on the Hill. In discussing sequestration (mandatory government spending caps), Sen. Lindsay Graham said this last week, ""I would generate some revenue by capping deductions in the tax code if Democrats help me make some small entitlement changes that buy it back ... a mini Simpson-Bowles.""Beware, Democrats. Congressional Dems like Rep. Chris Van Hollen, now seeking Sen. Barbara Mikulski's Senate seat, are already paying a political price for their past support of Simpson-Bowles. Van Hollen has, in fact, just come out in support of Social Security expansion.For his part, President Obama appears to be in less of a mood to play along with ""Grand Bargain"" talk than in years past. But Social Security remains at great risk when Republicans control both houses of Congress and the Democratic president has already displayed a willingness to propose Social Security cuts of his own.Undoing MedicareWhen it comes to Medicare, Senate Republicans were more inclined to punt than their House counterparts. The Senate proposal promises to match the president's projected Medicare savings of more than $400 billion -- but it doesn't say how they plan to do that. Senate Republicans would dismantle a key element of the president's cost-containment mechanism. But when it comes tor replacing it, they're vague, proposing ""congressional committees [that will] work with beneficiaries and other stakeholders on the best ways to save the system and stave off insolvency.""The House proposal repeats the Republicans' extremist plan to dismantle Medicare as we know it, replacing it with a voucher system that would fail to cover the cost of private insurance. Even the GOP admits that, at least tacitly, when they describe it as a ""premium support system.""There's also this: ""[T]his system would set up a carefully monitored exchange for Medicare plans. Health plans that choose to participate in the Medicare exchange would agree to offer insurance to all Medicare beneficiaries, to avoid cherry-picking, and to ensure that Medicare's sickest and highest-cost beneficiaries receive coverage.""Sounds a lot like Obamacare, doesn't it? That's somewhat ironic, since Republican proposals would dismantle the Affordable Care Act without offering a viable replacement.A Question of ValuesWe haven't even discussed the jury-rigged numbers yet, or the false fiscal assertions -- and Mike Enzi, the chair of the Senate Budget Committee, is an accountant. Contrary to GOP assertions, these documents wouldn't balance the budget. What they would do is plunge the United States into an austerity-triggered recession reminiscent of the situation in Greece.But for all the deception and evasion that permeates these documents, one thing comes through clearly: The Republicans have no interest in the well-being of seniors or the disabled. Theirs is an anti-tax agenda for the wealthy and an anti-social-contract agenda for everyone else.Rep. Woodall is right. A budget is a moral document that ""talks about where your values are."" These documents don't paint a pretty picture."
7,MEDIA,Secret Service Director To Dispute Early News Reports Of White House Car 'Crash',Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/secret-service-crash-reports_n_6901290.html,,2015-03-19,"WASHINGTON, DC - MARCH 17: U.S. Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy testifies during a hearing before the Homeland Security Subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee March 17, 2015 on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. Director Clancy faced tough questions from lawmakers regarding the recent misconduct scandal as the subcommittee held a hearing to examine the budget for the Security Service. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5c60b1f00003901248037.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK –- Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy is expected on Thursday to dispute news reports that two senior-level agents “crashed” a car outside the White House earlier this month, according to prepared testimony obtained by The Huffington Post. Clancy, who has viewed surveillance video of the March 4 incident, is prepared to tell the Senate Appropriations Committee that the footage indicates that “previous reports of a crash are inaccurate -- there was no crash.” “The video shows the vehicle entering the White House Complex at a speed of approximately 1-2 mph, and pushing aside a plastic barrel,” Clancy will say, according to the remarks. “There was no damage to the vehicle.”Clancy’s prepared remarks, first reported by The New York Times, echo a source’s description of the incident to HuffPost on Tuesday. The source, who had viewed the surveillance video but wasn’t authorized to speak publicly, told HuffPost the agents were driving only 1-2 mph and appeared to intentionally nudge a traffic barrel in an attempt to drive through. This account is odds with the seemingly chaotic version of events initially reported in the press. The Washington Post first reported the incident on March 11, with a headline indicating that there had been a “car accident” involving two high-ranking agents during an investigation of a suspicious package outside the White House. The Post soon tweaked the headline, instead describing the agents as driving into a ""White House barrier.” The report described the agents running through security tape and hitting multiple “barricades” after attending a “late-night party.” The following day, The Post reported that the agents may have run over the suspicious package that sparked the investigation, a shocking allegation later removed from the top of the article. Several news outlets, including The New York Times, similarly reported a ""crash"" taking place outside the White House. The media's early framing of the incident -- possibly drunken agents arriving at the scene of an ongoing investigation and crashing their car -– seemed consistent with perceptions of the embattled agency, which has been dogged in recent years by a prostitution scandal and, more recently, by multiple security lapses involving the White House and the president.A less dramatic picture, however, began to emerge in the following days through reports by CNN and Fox News. But as Jon Stewart pointed out Monday night on “The Daily Show,” the ""car crash"" story had already gotten big play on TV news before the more tempered version came to light. Still, there are questions to answer about the agents’ actions on the night in question, including why they entered the scene of an ongoing investigation, whether agents were instructed not to give the pair a sobriety test and why the director didn’t learn of the incident until five days later. According to the prepared remarks, Clancy will tell senators that it's “unacceptable” he didn’t learn about the allegations for so long. The Secret Service director is also expected to say that he’s “extremely concerned by the allegations of misconduct and the potential for alcohol involvement.”On Tuesday, Clancy was grilled about the incident by members of the House Appropriations Committee.He has turned the investigation of the incident over to the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of the Inspector General.   “I trust the OIG’s investigation will be thorough and free from accusations that the Secret Service impeded their independence,” Clancy will say, according to the remarks. “I have committed the Secret Service’s full cooperation to the OIG investigation and eagerly await the findings.”"

That figure will continue to grow as the prevalence of natural disasters increases because of climate change. Spending in response to these occurrences has gotten so out of control that the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office now includes climate change in its annual High Risk Report, noting that a failure to take action presents a significant financial risk to our economy.New York City got a taste of climate change in 2013 when Hurricane Sandy swept through the region and caused $60 billion in damage in its wake. More than 8.5 million New Yorkers went without power, and 650,000 homes were damaged or destroyed. The storm closed the New York Stock Exchange for two days and shuttered our nation's largest public transit system.The city is now undertaking a massive effort to enhance resiliency in the face of future superstorms and rising sea levels. Tens of billions of dollars are to be spent protecting the shoreline and enhancing infrastructure, and for good reason. According to research supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, over the coming decades New York City will experience increasing temperatures, heavier precipitation events, and a steady rise in the sea level.NASA projection models show sea levels in New York City rising from 11 inches to 21 inches by the year 2050. And if we continue to do nothing about the serious issue of climate change, the Northeast region may face the worst-case scenario of up to six feet by 2100.Given the risks and the abundance of scientific evidence, you might expect lawmakers in Washington to join together in common cause to fight climate change, but that expectation fails to recognize the anti-science mentality held by many on the far right.In fact, congressional Republicans have worked time and again to restrict even the study of climate change. Last year the House passed a bill that would ban the Department of Defense from researching climate change and its national security implications. Another bill would have required the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to stop climate research. And just last week a Republican senator questioned NASA Administrator Charles Bolden on the core mission of his agency, to which the administrator replied that we can't explore space ""if the Kennedy Space Center goes underwater.""What is oddest about opposition to action to address climate change is the implications for another priority of the Republican party: deficit reduction. The bury-your-head-in-the-sand approach won't make extreme weather events driven by a changing climate go away, but it will ensure that our response is uncoordinated, less proactive, and far more expensive.Our effect on the climate is significant and shows no signs of scaling back without serious action. In 2014 there were eight natural disasters in the United States that exceeded $1 billion dollars in damages. Storms like Sandy hurt individuals and families who can't get to work or face the personal cost of rebuilding and repairs, they hurt small businesses that see a smaller client base or are forced to close, and they hurt state and local governments that must redirect public services like police, EMS, and fire departments to disaster areas.The changes that are needed are clear as day. We must invest in resiliency and sustainability projects to protect us from rising sea levels, strengthen our infrastructure, and reduce vulnerability for our citizens. We need to invest in cleaner energy production and reduce our overall energy consumption. I stand with my colleagues in the Safe Climate Caucus, ready to act on each of these tenets. I am hopeful that more of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will consider doing so as well."

Though Alex certainly wanted to see a cure within her lifetime for the childhood cancer she was fighting (neuroblastoma), she was equally concerned, if not more so, with making sure others would have the chance of cures. Alex set up her front yard lemonade stand and never looked back, she had a determination, persistence and never gave up, traits that I have come to see in many other childhood cancer fighters. I have always felt that childhood cancer fighters share a maturity beyond their years, as well as a hope and positivity that we should all have more of. Recently, one of our childhood cancer heroes, 10-year-old Maya Rigler, proved that she is a force to be reckoned with. Maya first battled childhood cancer, Wilm's tumor, when she was just two years old. As a cancer survivor, Maya and her family decided to raise funds and awareness for Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation as a way to remember how lucky they are. Their family held annual lemonade stands near their suburban home raising a few thousand dollars and were frequent guests at Alex's ""Original"" Lemonade Stand. Maya and her family had been happily moving through life as a survivor when in mid-January, her parents noticed something had changed. So, they headed to the doctor where it was discovered that Maya had another cancer, this time Ewing's sarcoma.Unfortunately it is not unusual that children develop secondary cancers later in life, a side-effect of the harsh treatments they endure. However, Maya's doctors believe that this cancer is completely unrelated, and to their knowledge not something that was part of the ""possible."" Maya took the news in stride, and when friends started asking how they could help, she said she wanted to raise funds for Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation. And that's exactly what she did. Maya set up a fundraising page on our website on January 27, 2015, with a goal of $10,000. How wonderful would it be for her to reach that she thought, but what she didn't anticipate was just how quickly that moment would come. In fact, it came so quickly that she raised her goal, something she would do many times over until finally settling at $100,000. On Monday, less than two months after her first donations began pouring in, Maya's Virtual Lemonade Stand passed the $100K threshold, and she showed no signs of slowing down. Her goal is now $250,000. Maya's family visited the Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation office to commemorate her milestone.Words cannot express how special children like Maya are to us. While no one would blame her for being negative or terribly scared, Maya has instead been nothing but positive. When it was time to make the announcement of raising $100,000 on her Instagram, Maya drew similarities between the bald heads of cancer patients, and those same bald heads of emojis - we use them so often in our everyday lives and that never even crossed my mind. We may not know what lies ahead for Maya, but we know that whatever it is, she will meet it with strength, bravery, determination and optimism, just like Alex. There are so many more things that I could say about Maya and her family to conclude this blog, but instead of trying put it all into words, I'll let her mom, Stacy Rigler do that for me.""Ever since our daughter was first cured, we had planned our first Alex's Lemonade Stand. We read the book Alex and the Amazing Lemonade Stand and watched the documentary each spring during Alex's Lemonade Days. We held our first stand and brought the money to Alex's ""Original"" Lemonade Stand, a tradition that my family has upheld for the past seven years. Each year our efforts grew, involving her class, our places of work, anyone who might want to be involved. Looking back I don't know if it was the inspiration of a courageous little girl who lived so close by, who was treated at the very same hospital, or our continued commitment in a world where it's hard to keep commitments, but I know that she and her siblings have gotten the message -- ""when life gives you lemons, do something about it."""
10,POLITICS,Obama Calls On Federal Agencies To Reduce Emissions 40 Percent By 2025,Kate Sheppard,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-federal-emissions_n_6901970.html,,2015-03-19,"US President Barack Obama answers audience questions at the City Club of Cleveland March 18, 2015 in Cleveland, Ohio.

The executive order builds on a previous administration directive to cut emissions from federal agencies 28 percent by 2020, compared with 2008 levels. ""We are well on our way to meet that goal,"" Brian Deese, senior adviser to the president, said in a call with reporters Thursday. ""That's what's motivating us today to chart out a new and even more aggressive goal going forward.""The administration is also setting a goal of cutting the per-mile emissions from the agencies' vehicle fleet 30 percent, it said. It estimates the total commitment across the federal agencies will save taxpayers $18 billion -- funds that won't be spent on energy.Christy Goldfuss, managing director of the Council on Environmental Quality, said that by the end of 2014, the federal government had cut emissions 17 percent since 2008, putting it well on the way to meeting Obama's earlier goal. Much of that has come through energy efficiency improvements in federal buildings and with the installation of renewables. As of the end of 2014, renewable energy accounted for 9 percent of the federal government's energy use, and Thursday's directive wants to increase that to 30 percent by 2025. The Department of Defense has set its own goal of deploying 3 gigawatts of solar energy on its installations around the world by 2025. The federal government is the single largest energy user in the United States, Goldfuss said, with 360,000 buildings and 650,000 vehicles. ""Not only is our footprint expansive, our impact is as well,"" she said.The administration also argued that the push to reduce emissions in the federal government has effects across the private sector as well. To that end, the administration also released a scorecard to track emissions from major federal contractors such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing and General Dynamics, which the administration is also calling on to make reductions. The White House estimates that with reductions from the agency and those of private suppliers, the administration can cut greenhouse gas emissions by 26 million metric tons in the next 10 years. ""These goals will make sure the federal government is leading by example and pushing the envelope on cutting emissions,"" said Deese, adding that it will ""demonstrate that we are going to stay on offense in pushing our clean energy and climate change objectives."""

Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ee6c260000360083c21c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The following post first appeared on FactCheck.org.Sen. Ted Cruz has repeatedly gotten basic facts about the Internal Revenue Service wrong when delivering one of his favorite applause lines, calling for its abolition.He did it — again — over the weekend in New Hampshire, when he said:Cruz, March 15: There are 110,000 agents at the IRS. We need to put a padlock on that building and take every one of those 110,000 agents and put them on our southern border.That line gets applause from conservatives who don’t like either the IRS or don’t like those living in the U.S. illegally. But the fact is that the IRS has nowhere close to 110,000 total employees — even counting lowly clerks. And it hasn’t for nearly 20 years.According to the IRS’s most recent budget request, which the administration submitted in February, Congress has enacted budget authority for only 82,203 total employees in the current fiscal year, which runs through Sept. 30. That’s down from 84,761 total workers last fiscal year (as measured by the usual “full-time equivalent,” or FTE, standard).And of those 82,000, only about one in four can properly be called “agents,” or even “revenue officers.”Cruz has made this factually challenged line part of his standard stump speech as he explores running for president. We found he has been using it since at least last July. During a star turn at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference gathering on Feb. 26 he got so amped up that he inflated the number to 125,000 agents. The line brought down the house.But at the International Association of Fire Fighters on March 10 the line was greeted by silence. (Cruz was by then back to his 110,000 figure — see video starting at 7:50)The fact is, however, the last time the IRS had 110,000 workers was nearly 20 years ago, in the Clinton administration. On Sept. 30, 1995 — at the end of fiscal year 1995 — the IRS had just over 114,000 total employees. It dropped to 102,000 a year later, and has been below 100,000 ever since, according to employment figures from the IRS’s annual Data Books and its most recent budget submission.Furthermore, not all IRS employees can properly be called “agents.” We went over this in 2010 when other Republicans were also peddling false information about the IRS. At the time, they were claiming that 16,500 new “agents” would be needed to enforce the Affordable Care Act. In one extreme instance then-Rep. Ron Paul of Texas claimed all 16,500 “agents” would be “armed.”As we said back then, there’s a huge difference between an IRS revenue agent — who calls on taxpayers and conducts face-to-face audits — and the workers who make up the bulk of IRS employees.What we said then — and it still holds true — is that IRS workers include clerks, accountants, computer programmers, telephone call center workers and other support staff.As of the most recent detailed breakdown from the IRS Data Book– covering fiscal year 2013 — only 15 percent of all IRS employees carried the title of revenue agent. Another 3 percent were “special agents” (who conduct criminal investigations, and who really are sometimes packing firearms), and another 6 percent were “revenue officers” (who seek to collect delinquent tax payments and track down those who haven’t filed a return.)Cruz ResponseWhen we asked where Cruz got his 110,000 figure, his deputy press secretary, Phil Novack, told us that it came from a report by the Treasury Department’s Inspector General. That report stated that the IRS “workforce” was 107,622 at the end of fiscal 2010. However, the IG report also stated that the “workforce” had already declined to 97,717 by the following year, and of course it has gone down more since then. So even using his own source, Cruz was wrong.The IG’s figures also includes many workers who are carried on the IRS payroll but actually work for other agencies, such as in criminal fraud investigations. The figures we have given from the IRS represent — in the words of the IRS Data Book — “positions actually used to conduct IRS operations.” They exclude positions funded by reimbursements from other federal agencies and private entities for services performed for these external parties, according to the IRS.Novack said, “Sen. Cruz was clearly making a joke to convey the point [that all IRS workers] are engaged in one mission: collecting taxes under a tax code that is too complex, too costly, and unfair to the American taxpayer. ”We think the joke would work just as well if Cruz was more careful about getting his facts straight."

Kathy Castor (D-Fla.) to add roughly $51 billion over 10 years in new mandatory funding for the National Institutes of Health. The amendment would have spread out the money so that it increased over time, providing a stable and growing stream of funds from which the institutes could draw. The amendment died along party lines, with 22 Republicans in opposition and 12 Democrats in favor (two Democrats missed the votes). At issue were the provisions in the amendment to help pay for the increase in NIH funding. Democrats called for reducing tax expenditures for the top 1 percent of income earners, cutting down on corporate tax breaks, closing loopholes for businesses that send jobs abroad, and other usual elements of the revenue hike potpourri.Republicans are philosophically opposed to tax hikes, so their opposition shouldn’t necessarily have caught anyone off guard. But the timing is noteworthy. On Tuesday morning, numerous congressional Republicans appeared at a joint event by the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network and Stand Up To Cancer, during which they pledged their commitment to funding biomedical research. Rep. Matt Salmon (R-Ariz.) called for NIH funds to be raised from roughly $30.1 billion to around $40 billion in the year 2021. Rep. Kevin Yoder (R-Kan.) subsequently raised the stakes even higher, saying the federal government should be spending $60 billion on NIH research and that the amount didn’t even need to be offset. Neither of those members is on the budget committee, though Yoder is on appropriations, which means he may end up having a say in the final outcome on NIH funds. But the House GOP budget makes that hard, as it calls for dramatic reductions in non-discretionary spending. And as Wednesday night’s amendment vote demonstrates, it’s easy to commit to a plush, well-funded NIH; it’s harder to agree on ways to get there. "

The figures, from the International Energy Agency, no less, will come as a cold shower to those who still believe that burning fossil fuels is inextricably bound to economic growth.For the first time in 40 years, global carbon dioxide emissions from the energy sector did not increase. During 2014, the global economy grew by 3 percent but emissions remained at 2013 levels. ""This is a real surprise. We have never seen this before"", IEA chief economist Fatih Birol was reported as saying.  Whether a blip or a tipping point, it is an indication that renewable energy and energy efficiency are becoming serious game-changers.If, despite the overwhelming evidence and the internationally agreed scientific consensus, you are someone who still believes climate change is contentious, take a moment, inhale deeply, and think about what a tip could mean for millions of people who are forced to breathe polluted air.Consider the air quality in some Chinese cities where extreme air pollution means young children have never seen the stars. China's carbon dioxide emissions have dropped for the first time since 2001, largely due to a drop in coal use by factories that have become the workshop of the world. Yet this hasn't resulted in a slowdown of the country's economy -- something that my colleagues in Greenpeace East Asia have been saying for a while.Or consider the air quality in Delhi which continues to rival that of Beijing's. Let me here give a shout-out to the High Court of India that recently ruled that standing up against the polluting coal industry doesn't constitute ""anti-nationalism."" My colleague, Priya Pillai embodies the boldness of thousands of people across the globe who are proving their courage in the face of relentless polluters.  Does development really have to be founded on choking levels of smog and ever-rising carbon pollution or can it be achieved under the clear skies of a future based on renewable energy?Aside from the progress being achieved in China, the IEA's figures, due to be released in full in a report in June, show that OECD countries' carbon dioxide emissions have fallen 4 percent over the past five years while their economies grew by nearly 7 percent.  In the European Union, renewable energy sources, led by wind and solar, last year proved central to meeting the additional power needs of its Member States. Renewables also met over half of those needs in the US, where 180 coal plants have become obsolete in the past four years. It is a testament to the thousands of forward-thinking engineers and business people who have harnessed the wind and the sun as serious options for generating power.I wonder how the IEA's figures are going down in the boardrooms of fossil fuel companies, whose defenders continue to pump millions of dollars into anti-climate change PR campaigns and then scurry away when confronted with scrutiny.  Deep in their hearts they must know that pillaging the planet to power businesses and warm our homes is wrong and a zero-sum game. Why are they so sadly lacking in morality?Surely they see that the writing is on the wall. It is manifested in the countless numbers of solar panels blossoming on rooftops and in communities across the world. It is being sung by the whirring of wind farms that are capturing increasing amounts of pollution-free energy. And it can be heard in the growing number of voices that are calling for a halt to climate change and for holding polluters accountable.  Renewable energy and energy efficiency are already making important inroads in stemming air pollution. The vast untapped potential for clean energy must not be lost on governments as they prepare to conclude a new climate agreement in Paris, this December. The question is whether governments will stand up for their citizens and set in stone ambitious targets that allow us all to live within the 'safe' limits of the biosphere.  I hold out the hope that the world will shortly turn a corner in combating global warming. At the very least, we have a firm example that curbing global emissions while economies expand is not a fanciful notion. Meanwhile, the onward march of clean energy is becoming unstoppable.  I believe that the goal of a world running entirely on renewably energy by the middle of this century is far from science fiction, and it is a goal that all of us -- governments, corporations and citizens -- should aim for.  Now, again, take a deep breath and consider who your government should be standing up for: you or the fossil fuel industries?"

""Heart, on inside,"" she says while lifting up her shirt and trying to convey to me that her heart beats inside her chest. She points out her stuffed animals' hearts me to as well. ""Ba-boom, ba-boom,"" she tells me, mimicking the sound of a heartbeat, while holding a toy stethoscope up to them. She puts her little hand on my chest while proudly saying ""Mommy's heart."" I wonder if she can feel how strongly it beats for her.One of the best descriptions of motherhood that I have heard is that it is like watching your heart beat outside of your body. For me, no description could be truer. Being a mother has been full of feelings: joy, worry, exasperation, pride and many others. I feel these emotions deeply, every day.My daughter is my flesh and blood, so it is no surprise that her feelings run through my body. When she cries, my stomach drops and I rush to her to find out what is wrong. When she is happy, I hear myself laughing along with her. When she hides behind my leg while entering a new classroom, I am nervous for her. When she runs away in the playground and climbs up the tallest slide, I feel a flutter of worry in my chest, but it is quickly replaced by pride at her bravery. I feel my love for her deep in my belly where she grew from a tiny egg into a baby.There is a fragile vulnerability that comes with being a mother. After nine months warm in my womb, my daughter was born into this big, scary world and suddenly I wasn't able to protect her in the same way anymore. She falls when she runs, skinning her knee. Another kid pushes her at the playground. She gets a cold and I spend days wiping snot off her face. I know that these events are part of childhood, but I can't help from wanting to simply hold my daughter in my arms and protect her from anything that could ever cause her harm.I know that it will only get more difficult. Part of me dreads what's ahead: sending her to school for a half-day, then a full day, and then off to college. I know I won't be able to protect her from mean girls or job rejections or heartbreak. I know that I will continue to feel hurt when she is hurt. But along with these difficult emotions, come the happy ones. When we laugh together, I can feel her joy in every part of my body, down to my toes. She fills me to the brim daily.In the two years since becoming a mother, one of my greatest lessons has been that I must keep my heart open to fully reap the rewards of parenthood. This means letting myself feel sad when she is sad. I allow myself to feel worry instead of blocking it out. I accept the vulnerability that is an inevitable part of motherhood. Keeping my heart open to every emotion that comes with being a mom allows joy to enter easily.I know that I want this for my daughter, for her to feel everything. So whenever she points out her heart I remind her: keep it open. Allow yourself to be vulnerable because this means that you are loving someone fully. And it's a magnificent way to love.She plays along with me, putting her hand on her chest and tapping it to the sound of her heartbeat.I watch her: my heart beating outside of my body.Ba-boom.

Perhaps a trip to a certain elephant conservation center in Florida is in our future.",2015-03-18,2015-03-13-1426258392-2873240-sCIRCUSELEPHANTsmall.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-13-1426258392-2873240-sCIRCUSELEPHANTsmall-thumb.jpg,"The Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus, owned by Feld Entertainment, recently announced they are removing the Asian elephant show from their traveling performances. Like many parents, I do have fond memories of going to the circus to see the elephants and my children love when the circus comes to town. My first question after I heard about Ringling decision was, What will happen to the elephants? My 10-year-old wondered the same.I was pleasantly surprised to learn the 13 elephants in the traveling circus are heading to a 200-acre conservation facility in Florida, the Center for Elephant Conservation (CEC). Who knew the circus was in the business of animal conservation? But what a wonderful thing. I cannot pretend to be a conservation expert, but a glance at Feld's CEC is impressive. They founded the Center in 1995 and it is home to the largest and self-sustaining herd of Asian elephants. Their program boasts the most successful breeding program in the Western Hemisphere. I thought the Giant Panda reproduction cycle was complicated, but I have since discovered that elephants have a longer gestation period than any other mammal with a gestation of almost 22 months. And since the Center's inception, 26 elephants have been born there!Over the years, I followed the media claims detailing abusive treatment towards circus animals. Animal activist groups detailed stories about elephants being beaten, traumatized, and starved into submission -- this would alarm even a non-animal lover.With every visit to the Ringling Brothers Circus, I questioned the validity of these animal rights activists claims. How could Feld successfully run a business for decades that has included animals and has been regulated and monitored by government agencies and veterinary care groups?It just doesn't add up.Ringling Brothers Circus has always given me the impression of being a world class entertainment experience that families can enjoy together. In the age of questionable and obscene content on television, the radio and the internet, the circus is one of the last forms of live entertainment that offers a wholesome experience.Feld Entertainment said that their decision to discontinue the Asian elephant show is in response to changing consumer sentiment and anti-circus legislation that has popped up in cities and counties across the U.S. As a result, it is difficult to bring the traveling circus to those areas. I can imagine that animal rights activists played at least a small part as well. Within hours of Ringling's announcement, PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) and other animal rights groups were claiming victory.My guess is the animal rights activists are probably not impressed with the Center for Elephant Conservation, and my question for them would be: where do they think the elephants should go? Is it better to return them to Asia? As far as I can tell, it does not seem like there is any other public or private organization that has the capacity or desire to preserve the Asian elephants, including the activist groups.If circuses are guilty of mistreating animals, then the animal rights groups might need to re-evaluate their approach. Ironically, last year, the Humane Society and other animal rights groups paid a hefty sum in a $15.75 million settlement to Feld Entertainment, as a result of a lawsuit that was found to be frivolous and without merit. Additionally, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA paid Feld Entertainment a $9.3 million payment for making false claims in a U.S. District Court. Ultimately, Feld's decision appears to be the result of changing consumer perceptions and ongoing anti-circus and anti-elephant litigation and legislation. Given the amount that animal rights groups have paid to Feld Entertainment for making false claims, I am unsure how these activists can claim victory. My kids favorite has always been the elephants, which have been part of the circus since an Asian elephant named Jumbo, was brought to the States in 1882. We are sad to see them leaving the big top, but we understand the times are changing. The positive result is that the elephants will retire to, what appears to be, a state-of-the art facility with experts who can properly care for them.By 2018, the remaining 13 elephants currently traveling with the Ringling Brothers Circus will join the other Asian elephants in Florida. We know the animal rights groups will not miss the elephants in the circus, but our family will miss them. Perhaps a trip to a certain elephant conservation center in Florida is in our future."

While music festivals are welcome to all, they are not necessarily accessible for all. Within the past few years, most festivals have been throwing pre-parties that encompass the general vibe, art and music of these weekend extravaganzas in one night. Those who cannot make their way to the music festivals themselves can find a home at these pre-parties.The second annual Serenity Festival hosted a pre-party, along with Grateful Generation, in Hollywood that boasted a Technicolor array of live artists, performers, and DJs. Complete with vendors and even mermaids, the crowd was a mixture of club-goers, performers and festival patrons. Gladkill, Pumpkin, Amp Live, Mikey Lion, Porkchop, Whitehorse and Isaiah Martin offered their beats to open ears. With two stages, the bass room and the house room, there was an endless rotation of various BPMs. Removing isolation and adding accessibility creates a fusion of two worlds that normally might not collide.Serenity Gathering 2015 will be held on March 19th-23rd at the La Jolla Indian Campground about two hours south of Los Angeles and one hour north of San Diego. The La Jolla Indian reservation consists of nearly 1,000 acres of pristine wilderness and wildlife. Temperatures can range between 70°F in the daytime to 40°F at night so it is important to prepare for all types of weather. It is a music festival that is organized around the Pisces new moon. Largely based on radical self expression through art, performance, music and culture, Serenity Gathering is part of a new generation of transformational music festivals that concentrates on growth, mind expansion and improving the world (even if it's just a small part of the world). The Serenity family consists of Kevin Summers, Steven ""Morpheus"" Shaw, Joe Hurtubise, Chris Ponder, Olivia Gooden and was co-founded by Mimi and Brandon Beebe in honor of the late Lee Beebe. As Mimi's husband and Brandon's father, Lee was a beacon of light and love in their lives and Serenity Gathering is a reflection of that memory.The lineup consists of big headliners in the underground such as Eoto, Kalya Scintilla, Vokab Kompany, Thriftworks, Vibesquad, Pumpkin, J*Labs, ill-esha, JPOD, Neon Steve and many more. Featuring an assortment of festival accouterments such as yoga, live art, workshops, vendors, and a colorful array of performance artists, Serenity Gathering is yet another amazing place to let your tangled tendrils swing to some sweet, sweet bass music.To be in a state of serenity one must feel composure, tranquility, stillness, patience and peace of mind. There are few places and few people who can encompass all of these attributes. Serenity is not something that comes naturally, but rather something that is achieved. It can be achieved in a cramped and putrid subway; it can be achieved while stuck in traffic; it can be achieved with loved ones and it can be achieved in solitude. Serenity is for everyone but belongs to no one as it cannot be possessed, only felt. What better word to name a place that shares, evokes and teaches serenity, than a music festival. As the festival community grows, so do our minds. As our minds grow, so does the world. As the world grows, so does the universe. We are thousands of twinkling stars all being connected into beautiful constellations. Expand our galaxy and gather with us. For the mind that seeks serenity, serenity it will find.

The clearest example of this confusion comes from the exhibition's fiercest critic, The Guardian's Jonathan Jones.Jones is right at pointing out that the curators' decision to turn the whole exhibition into a Rubensian assortment of works by artists allegedly influenced by him, is a bad idea. The examples that he chose, however, to illustrate his point are so wrong that they evidence a worrying lack of awareness. From the beginning, Jones broadcasts his frustration with the curators' decision to place a painting by John Constable at the beginning of the show, nearby one of Rubens' landscapes.In his own words: 'It is hard to think of a painter who has less in common with Rubens. But the curators have spotted one connection I never guessed: they both painted rainbows. That is the RA's less than precise approach to art history. So Rubens invented the rainbow, apparently. Rubens and His Legacy tries to distort the rich and complex story of art to fit a simplistic big idea. Constable, Turner and Gainsborough - all of whose landscapes are juxtaposed with those of Rubens here - were fascinated by the great European masters: their biggest ""influence"" was the 17th-century French landscape artist Claude. So why try to claim that Rubens was somehow their one true source?'Even though it is true that Constable, Turner and Gainsborough's landscapes were influenced by Claude, they were more so by Rubens. While Claude's landscapes are idealised arcadian perfections with mythological figures, in Rubens' Het Steen we see a conflation of this and the Late-Renaissance Flemish tradition of Patimir, Brueghel and Bosch. It is that human inflicted ruggedness that Constable observes in Rubens and that is enough of a reason to suggest a curatorial link. When referring to the curators' decision to include a Warhol portrait of Jackie Kennedy besides one by Rubens, Jones says: 'Please, tell me, that I am dreaming it! I really don't see any possible similarity between Rubens and Warhol'. Well, what about the fact that both were artistic superstars that used the pictorial surface as a space where theirs and their sitters' identities were negotiated. It is a fact that when we look at one of Warhol's Marilyns, we see her facial features but we can also see him through his style'. Another similarity between these two artists has to do with the fact that they both used to leave the execution of their paintings to their employees. This confusion takes us to the real problem of a show that does not appear to do itself many favours by placing pieces by Rebecca Warren and Sarah Lucas along masterpieces by Rubens' and Andy Warhol. I think that the problem with this show is that it does not do what it promises to do. Even though the show's title includes the word 'legacy', there is no distinction made between 'allusion' and 'influence' for the former has to do with borrowing while the latter is often unconscious.Jonathan Jones, however, becomes insulting when saying that Rubens was not only just a courtier but also 'a supreme decorator who never touches profundity. Thus, he will never be a Rembrandt, Caravaggio or Velazquez. These three geniuses all lived in the same age that Rubens dominated. But where he created seductive confections, they tell a more serious truth'. Here, Jones misunderstands the use of 'chiaroscuro' with 'the ability to convey serious truth through painting'. Rubens' art should, however, be understood as an alchemic manipulation of something dead (pigments) into something alive (Inmortal Art). His works has that centrifugal drive that demands an over-crowded pictorial space compositionally organised as a wheel which transforms the painting itself into an allegory of the cycle of life. Besides, while Velazquez used to be a painter of peace (for even his war paintings depict people at rest), Rubens is a painter of violence.

From the beginning, Jones broadcasts his frustration with the curators' decision to place a painting by John Constable at the beginning of the show, nearby one of Rubens' landscapes.In his own words: 'It is hard to think of a painter who has less in common with Rubens.

Rubens and His Legacy tries to distort the rich and complex story of art to fit a simplistic big idea. Constable, Turner and Gainsborough - all of whose landscapes are juxtaposed with those of Rubens here - were fascinated by the great European masters: their biggest ""influence"" was the 17th-century French landscape artist Claude. So why try to claim that Rubens was somehow their one true source?'Even though it is true that Constable, Turner and Gainsborough's landscapes were influenced by Claude, they were more so by Rubens. While Claude's landscapes are idealised arcadian perfections with mythological figures, in Rubens' Het Steen we see a conflation of this and the Late-Renaissance Flemish tradition of Patimir, Brueghel and Bosch. It is that human inflicted ruggedness that Constable observes in Rubens and that is enough of a reason to suggest a curatorial link. When referring to the curators' decision to include a Warhol portrait of Jackie Kennedy besides one by Rubens, Jones says: 'Please, tell me, that I am dreaming it! I really don't see any possible similarity between Rubens and Warhol'. Well, what about the fact that both were artistic superstars that used the pictorial surface as a space where theirs and their sitters' identities were negotiated. It is a fact that when we look at one of Warhol's Marilyns, we see her facial features but we can also see him through his style'. Another similarity between these two artists has to do with the fact that they both used to leave the execution of their paintings to their employees. This confusion takes us to the real problem of a show that does not appear to do itself many favours by placing pieces by Rebecca Warren and Sarah Lucas along masterpieces by Rubens' and Andy Warhol. I think that the problem with this show is that it does not do what it promises to do. Even though the show's title includes the word 'legacy', there is no distinction made between 'allusion' and 'influence' for the former has to do with borrowing while the latter is often unconscious.Jonathan Jones, however, becomes insulting when saying that Rubens was not only just a courtier but also 'a supreme decorator who never touches profundity. Thus, he will never be a Rembrandt, Caravaggio or Velazquez. These three geniuses all lived in the same age that Rubens dominated. But where he created seductive confections, they tell a more serious truth'. Here, Jones misunderstands the use of 'chiaroscuro' with 'the ability to convey serious truth through painting'. Rubens' art should, however, be understood as an alchemic manipulation of something dead (pigments) into something alive (Inmortal Art). His works has that centrifugal drive that demands an over-crowded pictorial space compositionally organised as a wheel which transforms the painting itself into an allegory of the cycle of life. Besides, while Velazquez used to be a painter of peace (for even his war paintings depict people at rest), Rubens is a painter of violence.

The artist's ""Red Sea parting"" moment came while majoring in economics, through the advice of his ceramics professor, David Furman, who persuaded Casselman that he had the natural ability and insight to become a painter and that he should take a painting class. It's a story that has many interesting parallels to those of hugely successful artists like Dale Chihuly, who started out as a textile major, which eventually led him to weaving glass together,and later, creatively expanding molten glass into translucent sculpture; or the billboard painter James Rosenquist, who carried his sometimes dangerous professional experiences from a one-man balancing act on scaffolding high in the air into his downtown Manhattan studio to become a stalwart of Pop Art by appropriating advertising pictures into his compositions. Likewise, Andy Warhol, whose exclusive source material also was borrowed imagery, parlayed his childhood fascination with movie stars into controversial silkscreen paintings that were created by pulling a squeegee across a blank canvas. It also needs to be noted that Roy Lichtenstein first worked as a commercial artist and window dresser, where he cultivated a fascination with cartoons and everyday objects that he captured in his artwork by an idiosyncratic abstraction painted through stencils, and for a time closely resembled Warhol's early paintings. Resemblances in styles and influences then and now are an acceptable and frequently celebrated reality in picture-making, where artists deliberately overlap with each other, often inseparably like the early experimental Cubist works of Picasso and Braque, which for years were identical as they continued to break down compositional conventions, and preceded the ultimate reuse of the printed page with the invention of collage.

While in college, he used those ribs, essentially mini-squeegees, to define, mold or uncover hidden layers -- techniques that he continues to use on a much bigger scale today, as he methodically spreads paint across a tightly-stretched canvas. Through years of trial and error and always with his myriad of custom-built squeegees, Stanley Casselman has carefully crafted his personal iconic surfaces that began to get results and draw critical attention.

The thought of having one of Manhattan's most important critics visit Casselman's studio seemed too good for him to pass up, yet he was quite conflicted about the idea of copying Richter, or anyone, for that matter. However, caution to the wind, he set out to decode Richter's language. Encouraged by the ongoing explosive experiments and the promising results in his studio, Casselman knew he had something and indeed he succeeded. Saltz visited and got his painting; $155 changed hands; but Jerry was so taken by what Casselman had created that he decided to write a feature story about it in New York magazine.   Stanley Casselman working in his studio.The best part of this historic tale is that in Casselman's paintings -- what led him here aside -- he's created a novel syntax that doesn't exist in Richter's repertoire. His recent small and large-scale works have been well received and seem to go well beyond Richter's standard fare. In addition, Casselman has perfected a delightful surface consisting of the unique practice of meticulously applying thick and thin paint, then pulling a squeegee across the canvas surface both vertically and horizontally, resulting in brilliant colors flowing and merging together to form a cohesive visual statement. Casselman, like an architect, plans well ahead to construct a strong, painterly foundation, which allows him to explore an adventuresome journey that ultimately provides structure, density, layering, fluidity, harmonic movement, spatial illusion and rich texture with a propensity for producing truly powerful works of art. Brintz Galleries Installation I'm reminded of the remarkable similarities between Casselman's background and serendipitous ""luck of the draw"" and that of acclaimed artist Harold Shapinsky, whose ""discovery"" was the subject of a lengthy feature article in The New Yorker in 1985. Shapinsky was a young man when he began painting abstract expressionist-based works in total obscurity, which he continued refining every day for over thirty years before he was noticed by accident. He had studied briefly with de Kooning and Motherwell, and then he diligently built a hybrid style that was associated closely with de Kooning's; in fact, Shapinsky's work often was misinterpreted as that of de Kooning. But curators and critics, including Kenworth Moffett, former director of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, argued that Shapinsky perhaps was more original, and questioned ""who came first?"" His first exhibition in America was at my Palm Beach gallery, which nearly sold out, and included a painting that was purchased by Henry Ford.

It's a horrid mess, rather than a hot one, and everyone involved has made remarkably poor choices along the way. It's hard to connect what Fashion Police has become to what it long had been: One of the most entertaining programs on television, before the tragic loss of its host and essential reason for being, the late, great Joan Rivers.Rivers might have denied this, but from where I sat Fashion Police was first and foremost a showcase for the talents of one of the great comedians of our time. She had definitive taste in clothing and accessories, a fine working knowledge of contemporary popular culture (an attribute that sadly escapes many comics of a certain age) and a cutting and clever wit that had been honed over six decades of performing in virtually every medium, from radio to digital. The show was built around her, it grew around her and it thrived around her. I do not for a minute believe that anyone who watched on Friday nights tuned in only to enjoy the relatively tepid commentary of her co-stars Giuliana Rancic, Kelly Osbourne or George Kotsiopoulos. They were all fine in partnership with Rivers, trading jokes, challenging each other and defending their points of view -- but at the end of the day the show was all about its leading lady. Remember, Fashion Police fans weren't referred to as Giuliana Rangers or Kelly Rangers or George Rangers... or even Fashion Rangers. (The pic below features the original Fashion Police cast with actor Adam Pally in happier times.)Joan's Rangers are still in mourning. Friday nights simply haven't been the same since she passed. Certainly, Fashion Police hasn't been the same, either. How could it be? And how could anyone involved expect it to be?When I first heard that Rivers' daughter Melissa Rivers (the executive producer of the show) and various executives at E! and its parent company NBCU Cable thought it best to keep the show going without its dazzling comic center, my response was that this would be the biggest TV mistake since Murphy Brown's baby (and, before that, Rhoda Morgenstern's divorce). Better to let it rest with its great memories intact. But that wasn't to be the case. Onward and downward, as they say.First came the news that Kotsiopoulos was leaving the show. I have no knowledge of the details concerning his departure, but assuming it was his decision, that would make him the smartest person on the Fashion Police team.Then came the decision to install another funny woman with a caustic wit as the ostensible star of the show. There is nobody out there who can replace Joan Rivers in that capacity, not even Kathy Griffin, who gamely agreed to give it a go. Anyone would have suffered in comparison. Griffin surely did, whether she cares to admit it or not. She left the show last Friday, claiming that she had certain issues with it, which invites questions as to whether or not she had ever watched it before agreeing to become its star.With Twitter fueling the fun, Fashion Police really messed the bed two weeks ago, right after the Academy Awards, when Rancic, reportedly reading jokes off a cue card that had been written by someone else, mocked the dreadlock extensions worn on the Oscar red carpet by young singer and actress Zendaya, suggesting that her hairstyle might have made her smell like ""patchouli oil"" or ""weed.""Zendaya -- who has previously appeared as a guest judge on the show -- took to social media with cries of racism. Rancic -- who isn't a comedian and should probably stop trying to tell jokes anyway -- offered an urgent apology. Osbourne, for whatever reason, up and left the show.It was all such nonsense. Not for one second could anyone believe that Rancic's joke (which wasn't even her own and wasn't especially funny) was racially motivated. It may have been tasteless, but haven't most of the jokes on this show since its start been rude (sometimes shockingly so) to some extent? I know little about Zendaya, but her response suggested that she needs to toughen up a bit if she is to continue to survive and thrive in so high profile a career. Rancic, the older and more experienced person in this situation, should have been less anxious in her response to the agitation of Zendaya, making clear to miffed Millennials everywhere that sometimes people in this world are going to say things that they consider unkind -- and, of more importance, that context is everything.One can only imagine what Rivers would have said about all of this. I think her kindest words might have been, ""Oh, grow up!"" As a staunch defender of comedians' rights to say just about anything in a humorous way -- especially on a comedy program known for its sometimes harsh humor -- I don't think she would have kept quiet about the dust-up. Of course, it likely wouldn't have happened in the first place, because I also think Rivers would have rejected the offending ""joke"" as not funny enough, or not up to her standards, and she would have been right. (Plus there's the thing about Rancic not being an actual comedian, but whatever.)If nothing else, Rivers would not have tolerated an attack on the Fashion Police by the PC Police.Anyway, it has been reported that E! still refuses to end Fashion Police and will revive it yet again (in September), this time with Rancic and Brad Goreski -- the fashion stylist who took over for Kotsiopoulos -- as co-hosts of the show. (If nothing else, that's a giant win for Goreski, pictured above.) Could it be that Fashion Police will tone down the humor, stop trying to be The Spirit of Joan Rivers Comedy Hour and instead transform itself into a newsy, lighthearted, less-cutting look at celebrity fashion? I can actually imagine that working, at least in the E! of Things. Like I said above, context is everything.This column was first published in the Planet Ed blog at MediaBizBloggers."
