The North African affiliate of al Qaeda, al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, claimed responsibility.Alaoui's death adds to a toll that includes 69 journalists who were killed in the line of duty in 2015, according to The Committee To Protect Journalists. At least three other journalists have been killed so far in 2016, the group said.Alaoui, who was French-Moroccan, was on assignment for human rights group Amnesty International to document women's rights in the region. She and her driver were parked outside the Cappucino cafe, across from the hotel targeted in the attack, according to Amnesty International. Alaoui died awaiting medical evacuation. ""She was representing Arab women in the art world, a visionary when it came to topics like immigration and women’s rights,” her cousin, Yalda Alaoui, told The Independent following Leila Alaoui's burial in Marrakesh, Morocco.Alaoui's work has been exhibited around the world. She studied at the City University of New York, and her work recently was featured in The European House of Photography in Paris.""She was young, she was beautiful and she was talented,"" said Jean-Luc Monterosso, director of the European House of Photography, and Jack Lang, president of the Institut du Monde Arabe, in a joint statement on Facebook.

4,LATINO VOICES,"Latino Millennials Have The Power, So Why Don't They Use It?",Michael McLaughlin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/latino-millennials-have-the-power-so-why-dont-they-use-it_us_56a13571e4b0404eb8f0af8b,"""Everyone wants to know when this really large voting group is going to punch its weight.""",2016-01-22,"Soraya Marquez, the state coordinator for Mi Familia Vota and her crew hit a Puerto Rican neighborhood trying to get Latinos to register to vote in the 2016 presidential election on July 24.<br><br>Millennials make up 44% of eligible Latino voters, a bigger share than any other age group.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56a136051a00001001ab1172.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Millennials make up a huge share of eligible Latino voters, much more than their peers do among their black and white counterparts, according to the Pew Research Center.Latino voters born since 1981 make up 44 percent of the 27.3 million Hispanics eligible to choose the next president. Then there are the 3.2 million Latinos who reached voting age since Obama's reelection in 2012, according to Pew. That sounds like an exciting opportunity to get new voters to the polls. But what's more likely is that Latino millennials won't exert anything close to their full power on Election Day, analysts said, and that will dilute the overall Latino vote.""Everyone wants to know when this really large voting group is going to punch its weight,"" said Jens Manuel Krogstad, a co-author of Pew's recent report on Latino voting trends. ""A big part of the story is that the Latino electorate is young.""The growing numbers of young Latinos eligible to vote don't surprise academics or pollsters who track voting demographics, What's tougher to grasp is why they're underrepresented among people who actually vote. Millennials don't vote much in general, but the problem is more acute among Hispanics because they make up a larger share of the overall Latino vote than do black and white millennials in their respective racial groups. Hispanic millennials also vote at lower levels than their African American and white counterparts. In 2012, only 37.5 percent of Latino millennials voted, compared to 47.5 percent of whites and 55 percent of African Americans in the same age group. That lack of participation drags down the overall Latino turnout rate There are several reasons why Hispanic millennials are discouraged from maximizing their clout at the voting booths.Latinos concentrated in uncompetitive states.Why bother voting if it's unlikely to matter in your state's outcome? More than half of all eligible Latinos live in California, Texas and New York, according to Pew. California and New York reliably vote for the Democratic presidential nominee and Texas is a deeply red state. Candidates don't spend much time in those states because they favor possible swing areas. Florida, Nevada and Colorado are the only battleground states with sizable Latino populations, according to Pew. With the outcome in Texas, California and New York virtually declared already, Krogstad said it's not surprising that young Latinos might not see any reason to get involved. Cultural divide.""Latinos have rather large cultural and language barriers that keep the voter turnout rate down,"" Krogstad said. Bilingual voting materials are generally available, but that doesn't mean it will be easy to exercise the right to vote.Spanish speakers will probably see and hear less advertising targeting them and thus not get as excited about voting either.The lack of voting interest could be a holdover too, if the voter was born abroad or has a family connection to a Spanish speaking country that didn't inspire democratic participation either, so they or their parents didn't vote before naturalizing in the U.S. Politicians don't interact well with LatinosCandidates' half-hearted attempts at peppering speeches with a few basic words of Spanish don't work on Latinos, who report receiving less interaction from candidates and their campaigns than black and white voters do, according Matt Barreto, a UCLA professor who does polling on Hispanics for Hillary Clinton's campaign.""You have to feel like the candidate depends on your vote,"" he said. ""People ask 'Why aren't these Latinos voting?' The question should be 'Why isn't the political establishment investing the same amount?'""Latinos overall vote less on average.The behavior of Latino millennials is hardly unprecedented. In some ways, they're following a general pattern of the previous generations. Older, eligible Latinos don't vote as much as their white and black counterparts either. In 2012, during Obama's reelection, only 48 percent of eligible Latinos voted compared to 64 percent of whites and 65 percent of blacks, Pew's data shows. Wild card: the Trump factor.If Donald Trump becomes the GOP presidential nominee, will Latinos turn out in higher than expected numbers to try and defeat someone who has vilified immigrants, especially people from Mexico? Not necessarily, which is why Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders' campaigns have tried cultivating Latinos. ""You can't count on the bogeyman on the other side [to motivate Latino voters],"" Barreto said. ""You've got to have engagement. Outreach is happening, but nothing is going to automatically materialize if Trump wins.""Wild card #2: the Cruz and Rubio factor.There's yet another question that could upset the equation. What happens if a Cuban-American like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) or Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Florida) becomes the nominee? It's hard to say, according to Krogstad, because Latinos have reliably supported the Democratic party. In 2012, Obama won 71 percent of the Hispanic vote. Presumably that number would be much lower if a Hispanic candidate has the chance to move into the White House, but so far Latinos haven't embraced Cruz or Rubio. Part of the reason, is that many identify with their country of origin, such as Mexico, Colombia or Cuba, rather than under the umbrella category of Latino.Their connection to the Democratic party might hold up, according to Cornell professor Sergio Garcia-Rios. ""I don't think they're up for grabs,"" he said. ""Latinos favor a lot of policies that Republicans are against,"" such as looser immigration controls and expanded healthcare programs. Bright spots: Children of Latino immigrants.Though polling results indicate low turnout for Latino millennials, it doesn't mean they're politically off the grid. Other research shows that children of immigrants get involved in other ways that could lay the foundation for strong voting power, according to Garcia-Rios. Children from a young age who speak English often help their non-native speaking parents fill out forms or translate when dealing with authorities, such as school officials. These interactions with officials and institutions might make voting feel natural for the sons and daughters of immigrants. ""They're used to being involved in these activities from a young age,"" Garcia-Rios said. Bright spots: More educated, more motivated.Another reason for optimism is eligible Latino voters are much more educated now. In the 2000 election, only 24 percent had a two-year degree orsome college schooling and just 11 percent had earned a bachelor's degree. This year, Pew projects that 30 percent will have a two-year degree or some college schooling, while 18 percent will have graduated from a university. The proportion who dropped out before finishing high school fell from 32 percent in the George W. Bush v Al Gore election to a projected 20 percent this fall.Then there are the so-called Dreamers. Researchers believe that these children, brought to the U.S. without documentation by their parents and whom Obama granted amnesty, might become highly active in the political arena. ""My sense…is that naturalized dreamers are more prone to participate in politics [and vote] than older, naturalized Latinos,"" said University of Connecticut professor Charles Venator-Santiago. So when will Latino millennials make their voices heard? Not till they're older. Experts said that passage of time will probably have a bigger effect than any outreach effort from the traditional parties. Older age groups simply vote more. As the huge number of millennials mature, they'll show up at the polls. Barreto, who does polling for Clinton's campaign, looks at the data with a lot of optimism. ""It’s the best of both worlds,"" he said. ""You have all of the existing Latino voters and now you have a very, very large percent who are younger so it means you even have more potential.""

It defined sexual harassment as ""unwelcome verbal, visual, or physical behavior of a sexual nature,"" but did not state that it must be offensive to an ""objectively reasonable person.""The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a civil liberties nonprofit often critical of federal efforts to address sexual assault, has said that omission is a problem. FIRE raised the alarm about the Education Department's letter back in 2013, arguing that such a broad definition of harassment would lead to a crackdown on professors.FIRE's director of litigation, Catherine Sevcenko, said on Thursday that her organization essentially knew this was coming. ""FIRE predicted that universities would silence and punish faculty by using the Department of Education's unconstitutional definition of sexual harassment -- and that's exactly what happened at LSU,"" she said.Buchanan was a tenured education professor who had worked at LSU for two decades. She lost her job after students complained that she used curse words and vulgar terms like ""pussy"" and joked about the decline in sex over the course of a relationship. ""Students complain about professors, and we have a procedure to follow, and that wasn't followed,"" Buchanan told HuffPost in July. ""Instead I was removed immediately from teaching and [referred] to human resources to investigate me for sexual harassment."" The national American Association of University Professors defended Buchanan at the time of her firing, saying she was using ""run-of-the-mill"" language that should not have been grounds for termination. LSU's faculty senate also objected to Buchanan's removal and voted in October to censure LSU President F. King Alexander, Provost Stuart Bell and Damon Andrew, the dean of the College of Human Sciences and Education.Buchanan's lawsuit names several administrators at the university as defendants, but not the Department of Education, despite the fact that it is mentioned in the complaint.LSU said in July that Buchanan created a ""consistently hostile and abusive environment in the classroom,"" and noted that ""more than one"" elementary school where she supervised student teachers had asked her not to return.""We have not been served with a lawsuit,"" said Ernie Ballard III, a spokesman for LSU. ""However, we are confident that our action regarding Ms. Buchanan was appropriate. We take our responsibility to protect students from abusive behavior very seriously, and we will vigorously defend our students’ rights to a harassment-free educational environment.""Watch an interview with Teresa Buchanan from July 2015."
6,POLITICS,Noam Chomsky's First Campaign Contribution Was To Bernie Sanders*,Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/noam-chomsky-bernie-sanders_us_56a25a6de4b0d8cc1099d089,Online FEC records dating back to 1997 show he's given to just two candidates.,2016-01-22,"Noam Chomsky has supported just Ralph Nader and Bernie Sanders since 1997, according to online FEC records.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56a267851f00007f00216801.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Radical intellectual Noam Chomsky has supported just two federal political candidates with campaign contributions over the past 18 years.Chomsky gave a total of $750 to Ralph Nader's 2000 presidential bid. But a month before he started cutting checks for that corporate reformer, Chomsky had already given $200 to a candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives from Vermont named Bernie Sanders.At the time, Sanders was running for his fifth term as Vermont's sole representative in the lower chamber. When Sanders ran for Senate in 2006, Chomsky added $1,000 in support, and he kicked in another $200 when Sanders sought reelection in 2012.Thus far in the presidential cycle, Chomsky hasn't given to any candidate, according to online FEC records, which date back to 1997. It's possible Chomsky could have given to campaigns that predate the federal records. Chomsky did not respond to a request for comment.Chomsky has long been a sharp critic of the capital class and its power to subvert democratic ideals. He called the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision ""The Corporate Takeover Of Democracy,"" in an article for In These Times. But Chomsky also has a pragmatic streak. He assailed President Barack Obama's international drone assassination program as a moral outrage, but encouraged swing-state voters to support his reelection in 2012, on the grounds that a Mitt Romney presidency would be worse.Chomsky is still an admirer of Sanders today, but has dinged his campaign operation for not harnessing its energy into a longer-term populist movement. ""Take, say, the Bernie Sanders campaign, which I think is important, impressive,"" Chomsky told teleSUR's Abby Martin in October. ""He's doing good and courageous things. He’s organizing a lot of people. That campaign ought to be directed to sustaining a popular movement that will use the election as a kind of an incentive and then go on, and unfortunately it's not. When the election's over, the movement is going to die. And that's a serious error.""""The only thing that’s going to ever bring about any meaningful change is ongoing, dedicated, popular movements that don't pay attention to the election cycle,"" he said. ""It's an extravaganza every four years. You have to be involved in it, so fine. We’ll be involved in it, but then we go on. If that were done, you could get major changes.""Jason Linkins and Zach Carter are co-hosts of the HuffPost Politics podcast ""So That Happened.""

The city's transportation department will also incur an extra $2.3 million in costs, though it could recoup some of those costs through additional public transit fares.Only the city's emergency management and fire departments have budgeted for the additional expenses, according to the report, though other departments have been asked to identify surpluses that could cover the remainder of the costs -- roughly $4.3 million.The Super Bowl Host Committee, the private group that brought the game to the Bay Area, has agreed to cover just $104,000. Santa Clara was able to negotiate agreements with the Host Committee that require reimbursements for additional city services, but San Francisco has no written agreement in place with the committee, the analysis says.The NFL makes a laundry list of demands of each Super Bowl host, but it will not cover any of San Francisco's costs, even though its annual revenue figure -- $9.2 billion in 2013 -- is larger than the city's $8.9 billion budget. As part of the original Super Bowl bid, the report states, San Francisco's fire, police and emergency departments ""signed letters of assurance to not seek reimbursement from the NFL for providing additional public safety services in support of public events related to the Super Bowl.""The report recommends that the city seek an agreement similar to Santa Clara's. The analysis notes that Mayor Ed Lee's office ""expects local tax revenues generated by Super Bowl 50 to offset the City’s General Fund expenditures for these events."" A spokesperson for Lee told the Examiner that the report was a one-sided look that ignored the benefits the events will bring the city. While host committees and Super Bowl backers often tout those benefits, research has shown that mega-sporting events like the Super Bowl have little discernible impact on local economies, especially once additional costs for public services are counted.The big game has been a loser for cities in the past. The mayor of Glendale, Arizona, which hosted Super Bowl XLIX a year ago, predicted before the game that the city would lose $1 million to $2 million on the game. In the end, a city-commissioned report found that the city may have received a small financial gain but more likely lost between $579,000 and $1.2 million hosting the Super Bowl."
8,POLITICS,WaPo Bombshell: Marco Rubio Was A Teenager Once,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marco-rubio-once-drank-a-beer-omg_us_56a257afe4b0404eb8f155b0,An early contender for 2016's most superfluous campaign story.,2016-01-22,The shocking new revelation that presidential candidate Marco Rubio once stood in a park that was closed.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56a261221f00007f002167ed.jpeg?cache=7e08BDRPQk&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Now that it's pretty clear that either Donald Trump or Ted Cruz is going to be the Republican nominee for president, reporters who've collected dribs and drabs of information on the candidates once thought to be contenders are taking that material and stitching it up into story form. After all, if ""labor"" doesn't result in ""content"" then can these reporters truly say they ever existed at all?That's the best explanation for a story by Manuel Roig-Franzia and Scott Higham in today's Washington Post titled ""Rubio’s summer of ’90: An arrest, then newfound purpose."" In it, you'll find the incredibly true tale of that time Rubio was nicked by the cops for standing in a park that was closed, and how this could have potentially been -- you never know! -- the singularly profound experience that would forever change his life.The backstory on this: Rubio is a man who is alive and 18 years old. He has some bad grades and he hurts his neck, and he needs money. Poor dissolute Marco, what's he gonna do?Ehhh, he's going to hang out in a park at the wrong time, drinking a beer, that's all. Per the Post:He resolved to go back to Florida and get his life on a path to success. Instead the 18-year-old added to his troubles after returning to Miami for summer break: He was arrested one night in May 1990 for being in a crime-plagued public park after closing time, according to police records and an interview with a friend who was cited with Rubio that night.That's it? I'm just not feeling the weight, guys. What else do you got?The previously unreported misdemeanor, which eventually was dismissed, tugged Rubio into the criminal-justice system just one year after the conviction of his brother-in-law in a major drug-trafficking case had exacted a devastating toll on his family.I can picture the scene. Mom is wailing in the bedroom. Dad, a bent and downcast portrait of wrecked middle-class masculinity in the kitchen, stares at his feet, as his son Marco quietly, almost imperceptibly, vibrates with worry by the stove. Marco's dad slowly unwraps himself, and takes a deep breath before speaking:DAD: Marco! How could you? First your brother-in-law devastates the family by being convicted in a major drug-trafficking case, and now you? Standing in a park after it closed? How are we going to come back from this?And he obviously never did. But as the Post relates, he did forget to include this event in his book, An American Son. Now, my explanation would be that getting poached by a beat cop for drinking in public while underage is a pretty common thing to happen to anyone around Marco's age, and when you write a memoir, you tend to want to focus on details that set you apart from everyone else on the planet. At the very least, you don't include quotidian things like that time you were 18 and had a beer like almost every other 18-year-old.(Sometimes I think political reporters don't understand that memoirs have editors and they typically inveigh against including every piddling detail of your stupid life, because no one wants to read a 4,000-page autobiography about Florida's junior senator.)The Post reporters seem to have gotten it into their heads that this event was some sort of formative, game-changing experience that put Rubio on the path to coming in fourth, or maybe third, in a presidential primary. Go read, if you want, and judge for yourself, but the only real conclusion the paper arrives at is that some stuff happened, and then Rubio got nicked in a park, and then some other stuff happened, and here we are. To listen to the other guy who got cited by police, Rubio's friend Angel Barrios, it doesn't sound like a big deal at all: “We were there just hanging out.” He goes on to say that he and Rubio received, from the police, a promise-to-appear form, ostensibly obligating them to appear in court. “I don’t think we even ended up going to court,"" he told the Post.So there you have it. For a brief moment as a teen, Marco Rubio's life was almost but not quite as riveting as a Hold Steady lyric. Stay tuned to find out if Rubio will strenuously deny ever having gotten with your little hoodrat friend.Also on HuffPost:"

10,POLITICS,"Paid Family Leave Laws Aren't Crushing Business, Despite What Ted Cruz Says",Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paid-family-leave_us_56a26e47e4b0404eb8f17190,Another conservative talking point is falling apart.,2016-01-22,Research shows paid leave is good for new dads and moms -- and not bad for their employers.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56a2711d1f0000500021680b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Paid family leave is finally getting serious attention in Washington and on the campaign trail, as politicians are waking up to the financial struggles of people who need time away from work to care for newborns, newly adopted children or sick relatives. But efforts to create laws guaranteeing paid leave are running into opposition from conservatives and business groups who say, among other things, that such programs will burden business and drag down the economy.Now a new report has come to the exact same conclusion that past research has: The fears of conservatives and business owners are misplaced.The report focuses on Rhode Island, which in 2013 became the third state to approve a paid leave law. Its program allows all private sector and some public sector workers up to four weeks of leave and pays out about 60 percent of salary during that time, with a cap of $790 in replacement wages a week. To qualify for the program, employees must have worked previously in Rhode Island and earned at least $11,520 there. To finance the benefits, the state imposed a small payroll tax, which officials calculated would cost just 64 cents a week for the typical employee making $40,000 a year.Rhode Island’s program took effect one year ago, and the timing of the report, one of the first to assess aspects of the law’s impact, is perfect. Paid family leave has come up repeatedly in the presidential campaign, with both former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) calling for legislation that would guarantee leave to all workers in all states -- and several Republicans coming out against such proposals. “I think maternity leave and paternity leave are wonderful things. I support them personally,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said in the fall. “But I don’t think the federal government should be in the business of mandating them.”Proponents argue that paid leave laws have multiple beneficial effects, and they have a lot of evidence on their side. Studies have shown that paid leave laws increase the likelihood that new parents who want to work, particularly women, can stay in the workforce over the long run. Other studies have found that access to paid leave leads to better child health, possibly because it increases the likelihood that new mothers will breastfeed -- or because paid leave allows new parents, fathers as well as mothers, to be more attentive to their newborns’ health and medical needs. In every other developed country, paid leave is a universal right. In most of the U.S., paid leave is at the discretion of the employer, which is why just 13 percent of employees have access to it right now, according to the National Partnership for Women and Families. Low- and middle-income workers are the least likely to have paid leave, since their employers are the least likely to offer the benefit. Of course, those workers are also the ones who need it the most. They’re the ones living paycheck to paycheck, using every dollar just to cover rent, food and other basic necessities. Without some kind of income, they can’t take extended time away from work.The conservatives and business leaders who oppose paid leave laws don’t generally dispute the benefits for workers and their families. They warn, instead, about the new taxes and -- especially -- the burden paid leave laws put on employers, who must fill lengthy vacancies whenever workers take time off. Such arguments came up repeatedly in 2013 in Rhode Island, when legislators there were debating about their paid leave bill. ""I think it will raise holy hell for small businesses,"" David Bates, a Republican state senator, told the Associated Press at the time. ""There is just no way this is good for the employer.""The new report, which the U.S. Department of Labor helped to finance, represents an attempt to see whether such dire predictions came true. From the looks of things, they haven’t, at least not so far.The study actually has two parts. One compared small- and medium-size businesses in Rhode Island to counterparts in two neighboring states, Connecticut and Massachusetts. It focused on the food and manufacturing industries and found no signs that the law had affected Rhode Island’s firms adversely -- although, as the authors concede, the small data size meant that they couldn’t say so definitively.HuffPost Infographic by Alissa Scheller.The other, more significant finding came from a survey of Rhode Island employers that the researchers conducted. The poll asked respondents what they thought of the new law. Sixty-one percent said they strongly supported or were somewhat in favor of the law, while another 15 percent said they had no strong feelings either way. Twenty-four percent said they opposed the program, somewhat or strongly -- a significant portion, to be sure, but still a clear minority. And the survey doesn't even include large employers who, because they have such vast workforces, can most easily accommodate extended absences from individual employees.It's just one survey. But the findings echo media reports from Rhode Island over the last few months. Based on those accounts, the program has been a hit with employees and hasn’t bothered most employers. Even some state legislators who voted against the law say they are rethinking their opposition. “I’ve had a chance to see it in effect,” Christopher Ottiano, a Republican state senator, told The New Republic’s Rebecca Leber. Ottiano, a physician who specializes in spinal problems, said he has noticed relatives of his elderly patients using the program to take time off. Had he been considering the policy today, Ottiano said, “I’d probably vote for it.”The new study is also consistent with other research and media accounts, including studies of California’s program, which offers up to six weeks of paid leave and has been in place for more than a decade. The debate leading up to the enactment of that program also featured predictions of economic problems that never materialized. Jane Waldfogel, a Columbia University professor of social work and co-author of the report on Rhode Island, told The Huffington Post, “I think our findings -- consistent with those from California -- suggest that these state laws are not having a negative impact on employers. So that’s good news. And we find that a majority of employers -- even small ones -- support the law. That’s good news too.”One key difference between the existing state laws and the national proposals from Democrats is the maximum duration of leave. The leading proposal in Congress would allow workers to stay away from work for as many as 12 weeks. The Democratic presidential candidates say 12 weeks of leave is their goal as well.But the data shows that most workers in the U.S. take only a portion of allowed time, and in other countries, governments guarantee paid leave that can last for months -- or even more than a year. Research on those programs showed that the result was higher productivity and workforce participation for women, and their economies don’t appear to be suffering as a result.Betsey Stevenson, a University of Michigan economist who focused on work-family policy while serving in the Obama White House, says the evidence on paid family leave points in one clear direction. ""The Rhode Island study confirms what many other research studies have found -- paid family leave offers families needed support without harming employers,"" she said. ""Just like every other developed country has been able to provide this kind of security to their citizens without harming their businesses, California and Rhode Island have learned that American businesses can thrive while still supporting families."""
11,POLITICS,Bernie Sanders Wants To Kill Citizens United. It's Actually Not That Simple.,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-citizens-united_us_56a24542e4b0404eb8f13f1b,Overturning the decision is more complicated than the senator lets on.,2016-01-22,Bernie Sanders has some thoughts about how to fix Citizens United.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"To commemorate the six-year anniversary of the Supreme Court's reviled Citizens United decision, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) lamented the occasion on Twitter.The Democratic presidential candidate called it ""one of the most disastrous"" rulings in his lifetime.""This decision hinges on the absurd notion that money is speech and that corporations are people,"" Sanders tweeted, saying it's given the richest of the rich ""unlimited influence in our elections.""These critiques have merit, as The Huffington Post's Paul Blumenthal explained Thursday. But then came this curious tweet:There's nothing special about wanting to overturn Citizens United. Both Sanders and his chief opponent for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton, have made opposition to the ruling a litmus test for their eventual Supreme Court nominees. (Clinton also mourned the ruling on Thursday with an editorial.) But short of passing a constitutional amendment, fixing Citizens United is much more complicated than simply hoping one of your nominees will help get the decision reversed by a post-Sanders court. For one, an America where a democratic socialist like Sanders is president may very well affect the politics of confirmation hearings -- and maybe the Supreme Court itself.As things stand now, the Senate, which confirms Supreme Court nominees, is still GOP-controlled, and it is still far too early to know for sure whether Democrats can take it back. But even if Democrats regain a majority, President Sanders could face staunch opposition from Republicans to get his anti-Citizens United nominee confirmed, which would require a 60-vote supermajority in the Senate.Then there's the court itself. A new Sanders appointment will necessarily depend on a conservative justice retiring. With two of them approaching 80 -- Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy -- it may very well be one of them. Or both. But what if the prospect of a President Sanders is simply too much for them? Will they hold on to their seats for dear life? That's a long shot, but it's still possible. But imagine Kennedy, the author of Citizens United, does retire, and President Sanders does get his dream replacement confirmed. What then? You would still need a case engineered to overturn Citizens United. Maybe the Federal Election Commission decides to crack down on a corporation giving millions to a super PAC, or a state passes a law banning such donations. Maybe then you'd have a new court case under the First Amendment. But even that case would take time to be litigated and move up the appellate chain. The process could take years. And once the lucky case finally reaches the Supreme Court, there's no guarantee the justices will actually agree to hear it. Their discretion in the matter is essentially unfettered. To be sure, cases raising important constitutional issues tend to catch the court's attention more often than not. And as ThinkProgress' Ian Milhiser notes, it is not beyond the realm of possibility to think that the right case challenging Citizens United could eventually land before the justices. But Supreme Court dynamics -- legal, institutional and otherwise -- are a tricky thing. Sanders' tweet obscures that reality.Civics aside, whether it's Sanders or someone else who takes the White House, the future president's nominees put the future of the Supreme Court -- and maybe even the country -- very much on the line.Related on HuffPost:"

14,MEDIA,Did Binge-Watching Fox News Inspire This Man To Threaten Muslims?,Christopher Mathias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fox-news-anti-muslim-rhetoric_us_56a12d57e4b0d8cc10991d50,Rhetoric has consequences.,2016-01-22,"In a letter to the Council on American-Islamic Relations, dated Dec. 10, 2015, John David Weissinger expresses regret over the threats he previously made against the organization.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56a1116d2a00002c00031045.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Jan. 14, 2015, John David Weissinger called the San Diego office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations -- a civil rights group that advocates on behalf of U.S. Muslims -- and left a terrifying voice mail.“You're gonna be in the news. It's gonna be like Charlie Hebdo,” said Weissinger, 54, referring to the deadly attack on the French satirical magazine that had taken place a week earlier. ""Guess what? It's coming your way, motherfuckers.""The following audio contains profanity.Weissinger followed up with an email to CAIR spokesman Ibrahim Hooper.""I'll show up any day, any time with plenty of firepower to kill any and every one of you fuckers,"" Weissinger wrote. ""It's coming your way and Hell is coming with it.""CAIR reported the voice mail to San Diego police, who tracked Weissinger down and arrested him two weeks later in his home. There, they also recovered an unlicensed AR-15, an assault weapon that is illegal in California, and an illegal large-capacity ammunition magazine.Weissinger pled guilty in August to felony charges of possessing an illegal firearm and making a criminal threat determined to be a hate crime, along with a misdemeanor charge of interfering with civil rights. This Tuesday, during a sentencing hearing, Weissinger's attorney advanced a peculiar argument: His client, who was drunk when he made the threats, had committed the crimes “after a week of watching Fox News over and over.”“Fox News is a hate machine, spewing out horrible things” about Muslims, attorney Michael Malowney said.Malowney said he wasn't trying to make up a ""lame excuse"" for Weissinger -- who he said struggles with depression and anxiety -- or say that ""Fox News made him do it."" But Malowney did argue that Islamophobia, of the sort propagated by media outlets like Fox News, helped push a susceptible man over the edge.Fox News did not respond to a request for comment Friday.It's true that Fox News has served as a platform for some of the country's most vile Islamophobia. According to the liberal media watchdog group Media Matters for America, in the week after the Charlie Hebdo attacks -- when Weissinger was watching Fox News constantly -- the cable channel ramped up its rhetoric against Muslims. Host Sean Hannity, for example, asked whether the U.S. should ""insist"" on assimilation from Muslim immigrants. Bob Beckel, the channel’s supposedly liberal counterweight, flat-out declared, ""I'm an Islamophobe.""Fox News invited one polemicist after another to rail against Muslims in broad, blanket terms. Steve Emerson, a self-styled ""terrorism expert"" of limited credibility, appeared on the channel at least four times in the week after the Charlie Hebdo killings. Emerson claimed that Birmingham, England, was a ""totally Muslim"" city ""where non-Muslims just simply don't go in."" Birmingham is in fact 22 percent Muslim. In another appearance, Emerson said that Europe was ""finished"" because it had too many Muslims who hadn't assimilated to Western culture. In response, U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron called Emerson ""clearly an idiot.""Robert Spencer, director of the anti-Muslim website Jihad Watch, claimed on Fox News' “Hannity” that a ""core principle"" of Islam is ""the idea of emigrating to a new place to conquer and Islamize it."" Spencer is a known personality on the anti-Muslim circuit who “engages in fear-mongering through steady reference to theories like 'stealth jihad,' eminent 'Islamization of America,' and the infiltration of Congress by 'Muslim spy interns,’” according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.Brigitte Gabriel, once described by an editor of The Oxford History of Islam as a ""professional Muslim basher,"" is the founder of ACT! for America, a group the SPLC says has ""eagerly tapped into a groundswell of anti-Muslim rage and done what it could to fan the flames."" Gabriel appeared on Fox News multiple times after the Charlie Hebdo attacks, arguing that Europe was ""paying the price"" for allowing Muslims in after World War II. Europe, she said, had ""ignored the cancer growing within its body when it was at stage 2.""Fox News also had Frank Gaffney on the air, a man described by the SPLC as ""the anti-Muslim movement's most paranoid propagandist."" Gaffney once accused the prominent conservative Grover Norquist of being a mole for the Muslim Brotherhood.People commit crimes for all kinds of reasons. But it's impossible to deny that rhetoric has consequences.There's no available data yet on hate crimes in the U.S. following the Charlie Hebdo attacks. But Professor Brian Levin, a criminologist at California State University, San Bernardino, has analyzed hate-crime data for the months following other recent attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California. The militant group that calls itself the Islamic State claimed credit for the Paris killings, while authorities say the San Bernardino shooters were adherents of radical Islamic theology and admirers of ISIS.After the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris and the Dec. 2 shootings in San Bernardino, speakers on Fox News and other cable channels relentlessly demonized Islam and argued that all Muslims should be considered dangerous. According to Levin's data, the number of U.S. hate crimes targeting Muslims and mosques during that period was three times as high as in previous months. The Huffington Post alone has documented nearly 80 anti-Muslim incidents in the U.S. and Canada in the two months since the Paris attacks.""Agenda-driven media outlets like Fox create an atmosphere in which hate crimes are more likely to occur,"" Hooper said. ""It's not a shock to anyone that someone taking on a steady diet of Fox evening talk programs would come away with Islamophobic view points.”The judge didn't buy Weissinger’s Fox News defense on Tuesday, sentencing him to a year in prison and five years’ probation.Malowney told HuffPost he wasn't surprised by the decision. Weissinger was ultimately responsible for his own actions, he said, and the judge ""wanted to send [the] message that you can't do this.""Still, Malowney maintained that exposure to anti-Muslim propaganda was a ""mitigating factor” in his client’s case.""He lashed out for sure at who he thought was hurting the country,"" Malowney said. ""There are going to be more people like this when Fox News broadcasts such hatred.”It would be a huge oversimplification, of course, to claim that Fox News and Fox News alone has been responsible for the rising tide of anti-Muslim acts and sentiments. Still, the role of media in these circumstances can't be ignored. A 2010 academic study from the University of Exeter's European Muslim research center, for example, found that anti-Muslim media coverage had led directly to a rise in hate crimes against London's Muslim population. ""The report provides prima facie and empirical evidence to demonstrate that assailants of Muslims are invariably motivated by a negative view of Muslims they have acquired from either mainstream or extremist nationalist reports or commentaries in the media,"" the report says.And Fox News can certainly boast a large reach. It's the country's top cable news channel, according to Nielsen data, and often beats out ESPN in the ratings. An average of 1.8 million people tune in to Fox News' primetime programming each night.Weissinger wants Hooper and other employees at CAIR to understand how sorry he is. He wept in court Tuesday when a CAIR employee described the ""terror"" she felt upon hearing his threatening voice mail. In a Dec. 10 letter to the organization, Weissinger wrote that ""nobody should be subjected to the type of harassment and language I displayed.""After a year of ""support and therapy,"" the letter continues, ""I understand peaceful Muslims are not in any way responsible for the horrible events taking place around the world. I have no hatred toward any religion.""Malowney told HuffPost that Weissinger ""blames himself for being under the influence of booze and Fox News."" Both are vices, Malowney added, that Weissinger has recently decided to give up."

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Donald Trump, and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) have not been asked about reproductive rights in recent GOP presidential debates.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56a26ad41f00005000216805.jpeg?ops=crop_0_20_3000_1005%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Forty-three years after the Supreme Court established the right to a safe and legal abortion in Roe v. Wade, the stakes have never been higher for those on both sides of the abortion debate. States have enacted 288 new abortion restrictions in the past five years that have shut down a slew of clinics across the country, and the next president could nominate Supreme Court justices who will determine the fate of legal abortion for decades to come. But even as abortion access for millions of women hangs in the balance, the issue has somehow been neglected by presidential debate moderators, causing the issue of reproductive rights to fade from the 2016 race. The Democratic candidates haven't been asked about reproductive rights at all in any of their four debates, and the Republicans have only been asked about abortion and funding for Planned Parenthood in the first two of the six debates they've participated in so far. Advocates working for and against abortion rights are baffled by the silence.“There are real and important differences between candidates here, and it's a loss for American women that they haven't been explored,” said Jess McIntosh, a spokeswoman for EMILY’s List, a group that helps elect pro-choice women to office.NBC moderators did not ask how Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) new health plan, released just two hours before the Democratic debate the network hosted Sunday, would handle public funding for abortion, and did not press Hillary Clinton on her view that federal restrictions on Medicaid funding for abortion should be repealed. Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) haven't been asked in the past four GOP debates about their opposition to allowing victims of rape or incest to get abortions, a position that is significantly more conservative than those held by prior Republican presidential nominees.The only abortion-related question GOP frontrunner Donald Trump has fielded during a debate was back in August, when Fox's Megyn Kelly asked him about his 1999 comment that he was ""very pro-choice."" His stance on abortion is much murkier these days, but no other moderators have chosen to ask him about it.Americans United for Life, an anti-abortion group, wants candidates on both sides to explain whether they support public funding for abortion or the kinds of clinic regulations that conservative states have passed to make it difficult for abortion providers to stay open.“Pro-life Americans would love to know whether candidates support health and safety standards for women who are exposed to great risks in abortion clinics,” said Kristi Hamrick, a spokeswoman for AUL. On the Democratic side, Clinton took it upon herself to mention Republican attacks on reproductive rights and Planned Parenthood in the first Democratic debate in October, even though the question she had been asked was about the political feasibility of passing paid family leave legislation. Neither Sanders nor former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley have brought up abortion or Planned Parenthood in any debates.None of the networks The Huffington Post reached out to would say why they hadn’t asked about reproductive justice in the Democratic debates they have sponsored. One network spokeswoman even asked whether such a debate question would be ""exciting,"" since, she presumed, Clinton and Sanders hold similar positions on the issue.Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, suggested the moderators simply don’t care about the nuances of a “pro-choice” position.“Unfortunately, we're battling decades of conventional wisdom of 'check-the-box pro-choice-ism,' which is just say you're pro-choice and move on and talk about things people really care about,” Hogue said. “The idea of how and when and if we grow our families is integrally tied up with our economic progress and our education and our debt and everything else. So I think it’s an old model of thinking about things that we've been very pleased to see Hillary breaking through.”After Sunday’s debate, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta argued that reproductive rights have “just not been a big issue” for Sanders. Sanders’ camp obviously disagrees. Tad Devine, a senior campaign strategist, told HuffPost that “Bernie is one of the strongest supporters of a woman’s right to choose” and that reproductive rights would be “one of his core principles” as president. Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ campaign manager, said that Sanders' health care plan would cover abortions. “You just do it when you pass the plan,” Weaver said. “It’s part of the list of comprehensive benefits that are covered by the plan.""Sanders has criticized GOP candidates for their stances on abortion, spoken out against abstinence-based education and said he would “expand” funding for Planned Parenthood. He’s said he supports the EACH Woman Act, which would mandate insurance coverage for abortion services, and said in a statement Friday that he would ""rescind the Hyde amendment and resist attempts by states to erect roadblocks to abortion."" But the senator didn’t endear himself to reproductive rights groups earlier this week when he called Planned Parenthood and NARAL part of “the establishment."" He partially walked back those comments on Thursday, after intense criticism, saying that such groups are “fighting the important fights that have to be fought.” But he had already alienated himself from some advocates by characterizing abortion as a “social issue” in an interview with Rolling Stone last year. Those who back Clinton argue that reproductive justice and economic justice are intrinsically linked and that Sanders doesn’t seem to understand the connection.Hogue said NARAL endorsed Clinton over Sanders because Clinton is more outspoken and proactive on abortion and is the most vocal in calling for the repeal of the Hyde Amendment, a measure inserted regularly into appropriations bills that prevents federal dollars from paying for most abortions. Clinton has spoken this election season about Hyde’s disproportionate impact on low-income women of color.“We need champions. And a champion means not just voting right when it comes up on the floor, but actually sponsoring legislation, which Hillary did a lot more in her time in the Senate,” Hogue said. “It means actually speaking about things on the stump.”The Democratic candidates don't disagree about the need to fight back against conservative attempts to restrict health care access. But Clinton frequently talks about those attacks in her stump speech, while Sanders does not. That's a revealing difference that moderators should explore in the primary's two remaining debates. "

The Huffington Post has an exclusive clip from the movie, which was written and directed by ""The Departed"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven"" scribe William Monahan. ""Mojave"" revolves around Thomas (Garrett Hedlund), a suicidal artist who encounters his unfriendly doppelgänger (Isaac) in the desert, after which said doppelgänger attempts to dismantle Thomas' life.

The 47-year-old actor is one of the many to address the Oscars' lack of diversity. Not a single actor of color was nominated for an Academy Award for the second year in a row, prompting the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite. Smith, a two-time Oscar nominee in previous years, was snubbed by the Academy this year for his role in ""Concussion,"" though he insists it's not the entire reason that he and his wife are taking a stand. ""There's probably a part of that in there but, for Jada, had I been nominated and no other people of color were, she would have made the video anyway,"" Smith told Roberts. ""We'd still be here having this conversation. This is so deeply not about me.""As the actor explained earlier in the interview, diversity is what makes America so great. And when the Academy doesn't reflect that diversity, there's a problem. ""When I look at it, the nominations reflect the Academy. The Academy reflects the industry, reflects Hollywood. And then the industry reflects America, it reflects a series of challenges that we are having in our country at the moment,"" Smith said. ""There's a regressive slide towards separatism, towards racial and religious disharmony. And that's not the Hollywood that I want to leave behind. That's not the industry, that's not the America I want to leave behind.""  On Monday, Jada Pinkett Smith posted a video on Facebook confirming that she would not attend or watch the Academy Awards in February. The video, entitled ""We must stand in our power,"" currently has over 11 million views. ""Is it time that people of color recognize how much power, influence, that we have amassed, that we no longer need to ask to be invited anywhere?"" she said in the video. ""Maybe it's time that we recognize that if we love and respect and acknowledge ourselves in the way in which we are asking others to do, that that is the place of true power."" Spike Lee, George Clooney, Lupita Nyong'o and David Oyelowo have all spoken out about the Oscars frustrating lack of diversity. ""The Academy has a problem. It’s a problem that needs to be solved,"" Oyelowo said at a gala honoring Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs on Monday night. ""For 20 opportunities to celebrate actors of color, actresses of color, to be missed last year is one thing; for that to happen again this year is unforgivable."" Isaacs also addressed the Oscars controversy in a official statement on Monday. ""I'd like to acknowledge the wonderful work of this year's nominees. While we celebrate their extraordinary achievements, I am both heartbroken and frustrated about the lack of inclusion,"" Isaacs said in the statement. ""This is a difficult but important conversation, and it's time for big changes. The Academy is taking dramatic steps to alter the makeup of our membership.""Those dramatic steps can't come soon enough. Also on HuffPost: "

A 1996 appropriations bill included a provision declaring taxpayer dollars could not be used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “to advocate or promote gun control,” effectively putting a freeze on research. In 2013, President Barack Obama issued a memorandum reversing the ban, and directed the CDC to begin researching the causes and effects of gun violence -- but lawmakers have yet to approve funding for it. On Thursday, a handful of Senate Democrats, joined by three gun violence researchers from universities across the country, raised the issue again. Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) called on Congress to pass legislation that would authorize $10 million annually, for six years, in the CDC’s budget for such research. “For gun violence, which kills more than 33,000 Americans a year, the CDC’s budget is zero,” Markey said. “That is wrong, that is unacceptable, that is immoral.”Earlier this month, Markey, joined by 17 other Democrats, urged Senate Appropriations Chairman Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) to hold a hearing on the effectiveness of gun violence research. Markey told reporters on Thursday that he has not received a response from Cochran, or Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), who chairs the relevant subcommittee under appropriations.In December, House Democrats led by Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), tried to get a provision directing money toward gun-related research into the massive omnibus spending package, but Republicans wouldn’t bite. A string of high-profile gun violence incidents last year -- including a shooting at a historic black church in South Carolina that left nine dead, and one on a college campus in Oregon that left ten dead (including the shooter) -- catalyzed members in Congress to revisit the ban. “We are a nation that values science and innovation,” Garen Wintemute, director of University of California Davis’ Violence Prevention Research Program, said. “We’ve proven that with motor vehicles, we’ve proven that with cancer, with heart disease, and we are in the process of proving that with the current epidemic death from opioid abuse -- firearm violence has been the exception.”Wintemute lamented that while a response to gun violence began in the early '90s it was subsequently “choked off.” Markey admitted Thursday he has yet to receive a response from Cochran or Blunt about a possible hearing on the issue, but noted Democrats are going to try every avenue available. “Ultimately we have the option of bringing an amendment to the Senate floor, at the right time, but we intend on having a debate on this public health crisis in America this year,” Markey said. “Hopefully it happens at the committee level but on the senate floor we are definitely going to have the debate before the end of the year.”Pressed on the realities of passing such a provision in the middle of a heated national debate over gun control and the second amendment, during a presidential election year unlike many seen in recent history, Markey insisted it would reach the chamber floor.“We will have the debate this year. It’s January, we have until October,” he said. “We will have plenty of opportunities before the end of this year to ensure that this discussion is held on the floor of the senate.”Democrats will likely try to attach such language to one of the 12 appropriations bills Republicans are eager to pass this year. Still, the limited legislative calendar will make it harder to have substantive debates in either chamber and leaves little time for both parties to compromise.Also on HuffPost:"
