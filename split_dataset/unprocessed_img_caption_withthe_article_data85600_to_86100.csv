The problem is not so much that it violates rule of law and sovereignty, but that it shrinks the actual and potential role of the public.",2015-06-24,"US President Barack Obama speaks about the shooting deaths of nine people at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, from the Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House in Washington, DC, June 18, 2015. AFP PHOTO / SAUL LOEB (Photo credit should read SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb901d12400003100577f27.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The road to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a ""megaregional"" economic agreement at the center of the White House's current trade strategy, is paved with good intentions. Yet the TPP will likely not provide lasting solutions to this country's economic predicament, and it may only complicate existing domestic and international challenges.Domestically, the TPP won't resolve the problems of economic inequality and stagnating wages. The TPP will provide some opportunities, and will undermine others: there are always winners and losers from trade deals. The Congressional Research Service has found that, twenty years after the adoption of the North American Free Trade Agreement, its net aggregate impact on the U.S. economy has neither been disastrous nor miraculous, though some industries such as the auto sector bore concentrated losses. The real causes of this country's economic ills lie elsewhere, in entrenched problems such as the decline of national infrastructure and the disintegration of the tax base. Even if the TPP grows the national economic pie, those problems cannot be resolved without a concerted change in course.Internationally, the TPP plows over serious concerns about what global economic institutions should look like. The World Trade Organization, which was established with American leadership, continues to face entrenched obstacles in its beleaguered negotiations, related to stubborn differences of opinion on issues like how much trade protection should be granted to farmers, and whether poor countries should benefit from more lenient rules than rich countries. Ignoring these problems doesn't make them go away, and diverts vital time and attention from crafting the necessary compromises to address them.At its beginnings in the mid-1940s, the modern trading system faced fundamental disagreements that helped to sunder the global community into the First, Second and Third Worlds. Decades later, those distinctions have faded, but the rise of megaregionals risks carving the globe back up again. In particular, the TPP seeks trade alliances to isolate China, identifying China as a rival economic superpower. Perhaps a trade race is preferable to the Cold War-era arms race, but it may yield similar results in terms of escalating economic and political rivalries in ways that may prove difficult to control. Moreover, very poor developing countries are shut out of these new trade deals.The TPP also alters the framework for global trade by adding rules that potentially antagonize, rather than supplement, agreements negotiated in the World Trade Organization. For example, the TPP's rules on data exclusivity (at least reportedly, since the text is confidential) could undercut past efforts within the World Trade Organization to increase access to patented medicines. The pharmaceutical industry disapproved of those efforts, even though they were more representative of global views. Creating new international bodies to circumvent them amounts to bad faith.The most salient ""add-on"" feature of the TPP is its investor-state dispute settlement mechanism, which, unlike the World Trade Organization, gives investors private rights of action against governments outside the court system. The problem with investor-state dispute settlement is not so much that it violates rule of law and sovereignty, but that it shrinks the actual and potential role of the public. When an increasing proportion of the economy is subject to privatized dispute settlement, and courts and judges are cut out of the process, there is no institutional actor with the responsibility for protecting the public interests that may be affected. The potential for correction through democratic debate and political participation may be limited once this system is established.Misgivings about investor-state dispute settlement have increased as its usage has skyrocketed through other trade and investment deals that are similar to, but smaller than, the TPP. To pitch headlong into another expansion of investor-state dispute settlement, without subjecting these institutional questions to a real and searching analysis, is to ensure debilitating controversy the first time a sensitive issue comes into the system. And yes, the TPP will include labor and environment standards, but enforcement of those standards may be much less effective than the system accorded to investor complaints. The support for labor and the environment that the TPP offers is offset by this kind of double-standardization. In short, the TPP may provide some economic benefits to some constituencies (though others will lose out), but they're probably not worth all the other baggage. True, paving the way for the TPP allows President Obama to notch a legislative victory in a congressional environment that has often otherwise been toxic. One can certainly sympathize on that front. But this, too, amounts to reaching for a shortsighted solution. In the short term, we should focus on existing domestic and international challenges rather than potentially adding new ones. In the longer term, we should help chart a course towards an international environment that is not only pro-globalization, but also pro-democracy and pro-justice."

2,POLITICS,"House Advances Chemical Safety Reform Bill, Teeing Up Senate Vote",Kate Sheppard,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-chemical-safety_n_7657560.html,,2015-06-24,"A view of the U.S. Capitol Building's Dome, taken from the east side.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb901d42100005002c971e9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The House of Representatives passed legislation Tuesday evening that would reform the country's principal chemical safety law, moving Congress one step closer to the first major revision of the law in nearly four decades.The bipartisan bill aims to update the 1976 Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). It passed the House nearly unanimously. There is fairly strong agreement among congressional representatives that the TSCA needs to be reformed. The law has been criticized for allowing thousands of new chemicals to go on the market in the United States without safety testing, and for failing to keep chemicals that have been found to be harmful off the market. The House reform bill would allow both chemical manufacturers and the Environmental Protection Agency to flag chemicals for risk evaluation, and would require such evaluations to be completed within three years. The bill would also increase the amount of information about chemicals made available to regulators and health care professionals.Sens. David Vitter (R-La.) and Tom Udall (D-N.M.) have introduced their own reform legislation in the Senate. That bill passed out of committee in April but has not yet come up for a vote before the entire body.""Now it’s the Senate’s turn to act on our extremely bipartisan legislation,” said Vitter in a statement following the House vote, describing the Senate process as ""a long, difficult road bringing people to the table and negotiating compromise."" The bill currently has 21 Republican and 20 Democratic co-sponsors. There are some key differences between the House and Senate bills that will likely need to be reconciled if and when the Senate version passes. Democratic co-sponsors of the Senate legislation, including Sens. Udall, Tom Carper (Del.), Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.), Jeff Merkley (Ore.) and Cory Booker (N.J.), issued a joint statement Tuesday saying that ""while we don’t agree with the details of the House bill, tonight’s vote is yet another bipartisan demonstration that Congress must act.""""We are committed to ensuring EPA has the necessary tools, resources and mandates to create a comprehensive chemical safety system,"" the senators noted in their statement. ""That includes a clear focus on chemicals that pose a risk to the environment and public health, a mandate to review the safety of all new and existing chemicals, authority directing the EPA to test chemicals, assurance that companies can no longer hide information from the public, and clear regulatory authorities.""Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), the most vocal critic of the Senate bill, said she prefers the House approach, though she said it ""could still be improved."" Among her main concerns has been how the law will deal with states that have passed tougher regulations on specific chemicals. Environmental and public health groups have had concerns about certain provisions of both the House and Senate bills. Overall, though, they've been generally enthusiastic about the bipartisan reform efforts.Andy Igrejas, director of the coalition Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families, said the House bill is ""an important step toward the reform we need,"" and that the bill addresses some of the most pressing concerns that environmental and public health groups have about the current TSCA law. He also said the bill ""avoids some of the pitfalls of the Senate approach."" Richard Denison, the lead senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, said that the group welcomes the House action, but believes a final bill ""will need to make considerably stronger and more comprehensive reforms in order to live up to the promise of fixing the key flaws in current law."" Ken Cook, president and co-founder of the Environmental Working Group, was more pointed in his criticism, saying that ""Congress has neglected the problem of dangerous chemicals in consumer products for decades, to the great benefit of chemical industry profits.""Cook criticized the House bill for not setting higher safety standards for chemicals or stricter deadlines for agency actions, and for not providing the EPA with additional resources to review the backlog of chemicals.""American families have waited far too long for a strong regulatory program that aggressively protects their children’s health and safety from toxic chemicals,"" he said.Vitter says he expects the Senate to vote on its TSCA reform bill ""in the coming weeks.""

We're just a couple weeks into this season of unstructured adventure and it seems one more stray sock may just be the thing to send moms everywhere over the edge.Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's easy to be surrounded by a tribe of needy, hungry, messy creatures. (The only rainbows and unicorns in our house are the ones permanently stained on my daughter's pillowcase after last weekend's face-painting extravaganza.) Even so, I've found that if you really take the time to look -- right there in the middle of all the chaos -- there's a whole lot of wonderful.Those wet, grassy footprints you just found all over your clean hardwood floors? Next year, they'll be notably bigger. Perhaps even too big to create the 12 projects you pinned that you have no intention of actually completing because, really, who does that more than once­ -- or even once for that matter? But you can't resist the idea of wanting to dip those chubby toes in paint, because you know those feet represent a fleeting moment in time. Sure, it's a moment that comes with piles of laundry, but it's also a moment where your efforts are rewarded with spontaneous hugs and ""I love you""s. And come next summer? Those footprints may even be someone else's problem. Because, if you're like me, at least one of your kids is approaching the age where he'd rather be off at a friend's house than spending time with the lady who's starting to make his eyes roll.So maybe the container you needed to store today's lunch leftovers was made into a snail sanctuary early this morning -- complete with holes in the now unusable lid. That's totally ok. You know why? Hours -- ok, minutes that felt like hours -- of sibling teamwork and giggles. Your little ones enjoyed a bit of hands-on science that didn't require Google or a trip to the library or, for that matter, you.The aftermath of today's LEGO-building session was enough to make any parent scream for mercy. (I know -- and so do my neighbors.) But somehow just watching that little mind at work and those little fingers at play while sitting on a blanket in the front-yard shade, well, it was pretty spectacular. There were moments of defeat, problem solving, and -- in the end -- triumph. And, after really sitting back and watching, chances are you even learned a thing or two from your kid as she worked her way through the seemingly endless, tedious steps and ended up with a pretty impressive finished product.Yes, this summer moms everywhere have cleaned more crumbs than we care to count. We've counted to three more times that we care to admit. And we've admitted defeat more times than a grown woman should. A summer with school-aged kids at home certainly comes with its challenges.But, I'm choosing to take them head on. I say bring on the messes. This summer we'll work on learning to clean them -- together. And the bickering? This summer we'll practice resolving conflict -- together. If those tiny bellies claim to be empty yet again? This summer we'll fill them -- together. And, yes, I'll even go so far as to say give us boredom. This summer we'll find new ways to squash it -- together. (Or embrace it, for that matter...after a school year filled with the demands of modern childhood, I think we've all earned the opportunity to relax a bit.)As the mom of three happy, healthy children, I see these summer challenges we're all facing as badges of privilege. So I'm going to do my best -- even when our family is at our worst -- to wear them with honor. Because long after the footprints and crumbs have been wiped away, my heart will linger on the moments that took my breath away, filled me with pride, and made the chaos look beautiful, if only for an instant.A version of this post originally appeared on Using Our Words.Amy Heinz is a San Francisco Bay Area mom of three and the writer behind Using Our Words -- a parenting blog filled with lessons she's learned (usually the hard way), laughs she's enjoyed (mostly at her own expense), and tears she's shed (this mama's got heart).

While all marijuana is illegal under federal law, Vancouver has seen an explosion in dispensaries in recent years and is now home to about 100 of them.“These new rules will give the City the tools we need to properly manage dispensaries, while enabling those who provide a vital medical service,” Vancouver mayor Gregor Robertson said in a statement emailed to The Huffington Post. “This is a common sense approach to a complicated issue, which has been made worse by the lack of action from the Federal government.”Under the new rules, dispensaries must remain 300 meters (0.2 miles) away from schools, community centers and other pot shops. They must also deny entry to anyone under 18; and subject employees to annual criminal record checks. To discourage underage customers, the sale of any edible marijuana is permitted only in the form of capsules, tinctures and oils.The law will also require dispensaries to pay 30,000 Canadian dollars as an annual licensing fee. A loophole allows dispensaries that qualify as non-profit compassion clubs by offering acupuncture, massage and other therapies to pay only a 1,000 Canadian dollars each year. The city's current dispensaries have 60 days to apply for licenses. Federal Health Minister Rona Ambrose opposed Vancouver's bylaw, CBC News reported, and sent letters to Robertson and the city councillors warning that supporting these businesses will increase marijuana use and addiction. Vancouver officials blasted Ambrose's position. ""Wake up!"" City Councilor Geoff Meggs said Wednesday, directing his comments toward the health minister, the Vancouver Sun reported. ""You are completely out of touch with the realities on the ground."""

It’s also not out of the realm of possibility that, in a moment of darkness, Ainge drafted Love’s contract back in 2014 and then locked it away in his office, forgot about it, remembered it today, went to shred it up, discovered it was lost, realized it was theoretically possible Love had somehow obtained it and then leaked the aforementioned threat to Yahoo’s Adrian Wojnarowski, who first reported on news of the threat Wednesday. Pierce, 37, has played in the league since the Clinton administration and was contemplating retirement before he decided he had one last season in him. Robin Lopez is an NBA basketball player and the brother of pretty good NBA basketball player Brook Lopez, and that’s about all we can say about that.Love could also decide to sign with the Los Angeles Lakers, who suck, or rejoin Kyrie Irving, LeBron James and the team that was in the NBA Finals literally, like, a week ago. He opted out of his contract Wednesday. "

And what a well written and well thought-out letter it was.However, between you and me, we need to clear up a few things:First, may I say that, while I applaud your effort to help bolster the voice of all the newbies ""just starting out"" in the music biz, let's face it, we both know independent artists have about as much of a chance of ""getting out of debt"" (as you put it) due specifically to Apple's reversal on the 3 month royalty thing as Caitlyn Jenner does of winning another decathlon.Second, I'm not sure if you're aware, but Apple was already prepared to compensate artists for the Free 3 Month trial in the form of increased payouts going forward. And, while some say it's still not good enough, 6% or 7% of nothing is still nothing.Third, some naysayers say they feel that your motivation in writing the letter was not because of your desire to help the little guy, but rather, the simple fact that if Apple holds back 3 months of your royalties, you'd stand to lose millions. To me, that's hogwash. You have enough money to last you ten lifetimes and, even though you're barely old enough to rent a car by yourself, you seem savvy enough not to fall under the influence of your team of greedy music biz veterans who stand to lose their trio of matching Ferraris should the royalties not come through. So, I say, ""Screw the h8rs!"" Although, this guy does have a point.Having said that, being where you are, at the tippy top of the musical mountain, I'm not sure you realize that your letter, as heartfelt as it was, will wind up nothing more than a great piece of pop culture fodder for a trillion buzz-hungry media outlets in search of the latest hourly scoop, for a couple of reasons.One being, because, as it stands now, 99% of independent artists earn next to nothing from their performance royalties - you need to be played thousands of times, first , before the conversation of ""royalties"" - of any kind - means anything to you. So, 3 months or no 3 months, it really won't have much effect on the bank accounts of the new artists you speak of.Case in point, I'm as far from a new artist as it gets, but I just received a royalty check from one payout service for the first quarter of 2015 totaling a whopping $0.09. (I pasted a photo of the little beauty below, as it will hopefully give you as big a laugh as it got on Facebook.) Sadly, this is the norm for most independent artists; getting checks in the mail wherein the stamp on the envelope is worth more than the check itself. The fact that I've actually composed T.V. theme songs and have a vast catalog of tunes orbiting somewhere in the void should demonstrate how difficult it really is to earn adequate royalties from your music.And, sadly, checks like the one below further prove that, while there are a heck of a lot more opportunities now for the indie artist than ever before, when it comes to breaking new talent and sustaining a career, there's still no substitute for terrestrial radio. Sure, these days, it seems every other month some lucky troubadour stumbles their way to a bazillion Youtube hits, then earns a few hundred grand thanks to ad placements, but, for the most part, there's still nothing like being played in heavy rotation with 50,000 watts of N.Y.C.'s over-caffinated, empty-headed disc-jockeys behind you. Ask anyone's who's had the benefit of The Machine behind them - i.e. having your single played 10-20 times/day in a major market like New York, L.A., or Chicago, and they will tell you, the world is yours. But, I'm sure you, of all people, know exactly what I'm talking about, as you're probably reading this from your Gulfstream lll. The other reason your letter to Apple doesn't really hold water, in my opinion, is, when speaking about performance royalties, one would be remiss if one does not address the elephant in the room, which is, surprise, FM Radio.Did you know, Taylor, darling, that FM radio pays ZERO dollars and ZERO cents in performance royalties to ALL artists when playing their music, bar none? Considering you just tweeted your undying love for ""pop radio,"" I assume you don't. Your label probably does, however, as they negotiated a deal with Clear Channel in which they make an exception in your case, and a few other mega-stars and agreed to pay you performance royalties.See, you really can't have a conversation about performance royalties these days without including terrestrial radio. AM/FM stations, nationwide, have been exempt from having to compensate artists since the beginning of time. They claim it's ""good exposure."" Thus, they feel those lucky enough to be chosen should simply say, ""thank you!,"" and move along. Given my praise for its career-making abilities in the previous paragraph, as well as your obvious Twitter glee, perhaps they're right. Who knows? But, if you're going to take the time to go after Apple with such drive and intensity, you should probably do the same, and then some, with pop radio, toots. It seems a bit hypocritical to lambast one company for a temporary hold on performance royalties, while pledging your eternal allegiance to the biggest offender in the industry, the next. Just sayin'.This is obviously a conversation for another day, but it makes for a good time to suggest to you that, if you really want to use your musical super-powers to help artists, everywhere, I would implore you to take a trip to D.C. and help Rep's Nadler and Blackburn urge Congress to push the bills removing all terrestrial radio exemptions through its mucked-up channels. Beyond that, if an artist as well-established as yourself wanted to do something, personally, to really help today's up and coming artists earn more money, I would recommend allowing a different independent act to open each of your shows on your next tour. They'd sell more CD's and downloads in one night than they'd make in 12 months of royalties from Apple. If that's too crazy, simply tweeting out one new artist a day that you like to your sixty-million-plus Twitter followers would instantly boost that performers profile and download revenue, tenfold.Don't get me wrong, love. I think it's great what you did. Most artists are chicken shit and are terrified of biting the hand that feeds them, so kudos to you for the effort, as every bit helps to level the playing field. But, in the end, royalties for new artists only mean something if said artists are played consistently.It occurs to me, as I write this, I may come off just a tad bit oppositional, but we actually have a lot in common with regards to this 'soapbox' stuff, and, while some might say I lack the credibility/experience to wax poetic about politics or the economy, this is the one area where my credentials, albeit long-expired, hopefully still qualify me to teach a class at night school on Music Biz 101.For instance, back when folks were just starting to use words like Upload and Download, my band, The Rosenbergs, managed to get Universal to change their unfair performance contract with an email, and you got Apple to change their policies with a blog. See? Quite similar. I would go a step further and say we were the quintessential ""indie"" band, turning down a potential major label deal to try an entirely new business model w/ King Crimson's Robert Fripp, in which we retained ownership of our masters.If you think I may be tooting my own horn a bit here, you're right. But keep in mind, I was just paid nine cents for my life's work, so it evens out. Looking back, I think our little band from Jersey accomplished quite a bit when it came to helping independent artists everywhere think of him/herself as a ""business"" and not just a ""drug-addicted rock star."" And, with regards to royalties, my testimony on Capitol Hill in front of the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel (C.A.R.P.) - a pre-cursor to the 3 judge panel that now determines royalty percentages for all music licensing - was used to help online broadcasters avoid having to pay billions in back royalties, which, had the labels gotten their way, would've immediately bankrupted the entire online streaming universe. So, although I'm probably the only living participant of those hearings, I'm pretty proud of that.Believe it or not, to this day, those pesky judges still can't figure out a stable system of paying artists their fair share across the board. In fact, between you and me, the rules change so much and so often with regard to performance royalties, no other industry in the world could survive with such chaotic uncertainty and rates that flip-flop every 3-4 years.Actually, it's a miracle there's any online music at all. Especially, considering the favorable treatment received by FM and the likes of satellite broadcasters over the likes of streaming services. But that, too, is a story for another day.Don't get me wrong, T.S. In spite of all of the above, when all is said and done, I think it's great what you did and are trying to do. It's about time independent artists had the support of music ""royalty."" As far as the naysayers, just shake it off.Your Pal,DF(Disclaimer: Many of the aforementioned facts and statements may be completely unsubstantiated and bordering on delusional, due to the fact the last time I was relevant in the music biz, Michael Jackson was still black.)"

14,COLLEGE,"Columbia Adds Toni Morrison, But Not Trigger Warnings, To Required Reading",Alexandra Svokos,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/columbia-trigger-warnings-required-reading_n_7588580.html,,2015-06-23,"Author Toni Morrison signs copies of her latest book ""Home,"" during Google's online program series, Authors At Google, on Wednesday, Feb. 27, 2013 in New York. (AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae59a2240000510054e4ea.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"An op-ed in an Ivy League school's student newspaper was enough to incite a national debate on trigger warnings for classic texts, but not enough to sway school policy.Members of Columbia University's Multicultural Affairs Advisory Board, a student group that works with the school administration, described in April how a survivor of sexual assault was triggered by reading a scene depicting sexual violence in Ovid's ""Metamorphoses."" The narrative poem is part of the syllabus for Literature Humanities, a yearlong course that is supposed to introduce students to the foundational texts of modern civilization. The concern with ""triggering"" material is that students who have been through traumatic experiences might read something in the required texts that brings up these past events, causing undue harm and anxiety.The Spectator piece led to a storm of national debate from both the right and the left, calling out coddled students and, naturally, Fascism. Peggy Noonan, former speechwriter to Ronald Reagan, called the op-ed ""a significant and growing form of idiocy"" in the Wall Street Journal.Despite the debate over the student opinion piece, there is no plan to eliminate triggering texts or mandate trigger warnings, Roosevelt Montás, the director of Columbia's Center for the Core Curriculum, told HuffPost. The syllabus for the Literature Humanities course was updated earlier this month, following a routine review, and Toni Morrison's ""Song of Solomon,"" selections by female poet Sappho and John Milton's ""Paradise Lost"" were all added. The April op-ed said Morrison's work ""should be valued as founding texts of the Western canon.""The decision to add Morrison was driven by a desire to add a more contemporary author to the end of the syllabus, and ""Song of Solomon"" was chosen by a faculty vote, Montás said. Sappho and Milton have previously been included in the curriculum.Columbia's choice to go without trigger warnings is representative of a larger trend, according to an online, non-scientific survey of members of the College Art Association and the Modern Language Association. Out of the 808 higher education faculty members who responded, just .5 percent said their school had a policy on trigger warnings. On an individual level, 42 percent said they had never used a trigger warning in class, while 12 percent said they did so regularly. Nearly 90 percent of respondents said that they had never had a complaint about not using a trigger warning.There are several reasons for Columbia's decision, Montás said, including the unpredictability of classroom discussions, a dedication to protecting academic freedom and the need to confront difficult issues.Literature Humanities classes are discussion-based, meaning that what gets discussed ""depends on the themes that a class picks up on and the personalities, interests and investments of each class,"" said Julie Crawford, current chair of Literature Humanities. Thus, professors can't always warn students that a class will talk about sexual violence or other forms of oppression.It is also important to offer autonomy to the professors teaching the courses, who come from across departments, Montás said. Aside from the texts and general themes, these teachers are free to focus on whatever aspects of the readings they choose.""We are very zealous of guarding academic freedom and intellectual freedom of expression of professors,"" Montás said. ""So we are very careful not to appear to be acting in a role of thought police.""Professors do receive guidance and support. Some instructors are graduate students, and they have a required class themselves on teaching Literature Humanities. For all instructors, there is a weekly lecture by an expert on the upcoming text. There are also frequent opportunities for collaboration, including workshops, recommended conferences and online resources.""If you deal with that material in a way that alienates a student or alienates any portion of the people you are teaching, then to that extent you have failed as a teacher,"" Montás said. ""So we want to have the kinds of conversations that equip instructors to do the best job with those texts.""Both Montás and Crawford said that discussing the difficult content in these texts is vital. Crawford spoke to the therapeutic qualities of literature as well as the power to build empathy and understanding. After 9/11, she told her Literature Humanities students that they could skip the upcoming class, or come but use it to discuss what had happened in the city. But, ""uniformly my students wanted to come and talk about the book.""""One of the goals of the class that I think is really crucial is empowering students to say no text is too close to them and no text is about them,"" Crawford said. ""They are empowered by this experience to pick up any book from any time and make their way through it in meaningful and rigorous ways.""Moreover, Montás explained, to avoid sexual violence and marginalization is to miss out on key parts of the growth of civilization.""I don't see any way that you can deal with the history of thought and politics and literature that we deal with without those issues being salient,"" Montás said.If a student is worried about being potentially triggered, Montás said, he or she should speak with the instructor directly, especially since each class is individualized. If a student feels he or she cannot speak with the instructor, Montás encouraged the student to speak with someone else, like an academic adviser, counselor or himself.""But we have to find ways to talk about the difficult issues,"" he said. ""We cannot simply shut down when we encounter them.""Last year, freshmen students wrote a similar article about confronting the sexual violence included in many of the texts. This is also far from the first time students have criticized the heavily Western, heavily male curriculum. It has been an ongoing debate, with ebbs and flows, for decades. "
15,FIFTY,THIS Is How To Afford Living Abroad,"Suzan Haskins and Dan Prescher, ContributorInternationalLiving.com Editors",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/controlling-cost-of-living-abroad_b_7586696.html,"When you're researching your options for retirement or work abroad, it's not unusual to run into indexes and rankings of the relative cost of living in different countries. These can be excellent guides when comparing various locations.",2015-06-23,2015-06-16-1434471769-2096841-livinginParisSteenieHarvey2.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-16-1434471769-2096841-livinginParisSteenieHarvey2-thumb.jpg,"When you're researching your options for retirement or work abroad, it's not unusual to run into indexes and rankings of the relative cost of living in different countries. These indexes can be excellent guides when comparing various locations, as they will often include rankings for a particular country's transportation, health care systems, real estate prices, internet, etc. All of these indicators can be used to determine which country best fits your individual requirements and preferences.Things get a little murkier, however, when it comes to a country's ""cost of living."" That's because how much you spend has less to do with how much things cost, and more to do with the things you want ... and how much you're willing to spend to get them. In other words, once you account for the fixed costs that everyone living in a particular location incurs, you can spend as much or as little as you want to.In Paris, everyone is subject to the generally high costs of real estate, rent, and utilities. But if you're a teetotaler, eat rice and beans, and take walks and people watch for entertainment, you can live pretty cheaply there.In the Ecuadorian village of Cotacachi, real estate, rent, and utilities are generally low ... But if you need single-malt scotch or a decent bottle of carménère wine, eat at the local five-star restaurant three times a week, and drive your sedan to Quito on the weekends, you can spend a lot of money there.It all depends on how you want and need to live. The costs of many items that go on the budget lines are fixed, but just as many are completely up to you ... especially the lines for food, entertainment, travel, and home furnishings.That's why we always urge anyone considering a move abroad to carefully consider what they really need to be happy ... as opposed to what they simply want or are used to having. Especially if saving money is important, it's crucial to know what your requirements are and how you'll deal with them in your adopted country.If having your favorite brand of peanut butter is crucial to your quality of life, find out if you can get it where you want to live ... and how much you'll pay for it. U.S. brands of peanut butter can go for $7 to $9 a jar in some locations.Need super-soft, high-thread count sheets? Aged Angus beef? A space foam mattress? Colloidal silver water treatments? Special hearing aid batteries? Roasted red peppers? The latest phone/tablet/smart watch?Your cost of living will reflect that.There is no shame if you can't or won't compromise on the things you need to be happy. Everyone's list of requirements for the Good Life is different. But in our experience, the happiest expats are those who measure their quality of life by the place they live, the adventures they have, and the people they know -- rather than by the things they consume. They don't compromise -- they adapt.Adapting is one of the most effective ways to take control of your cost of living.Related Articles: Five Top Retirement Havens With The Lowest Cost Of Living Cotacachi, Ecuador Is What Small-Town USA Once Was We Can Afford Adventures Because We Retired To PanamaEarlier on Huff/Post50:"

18,BLACK VOICES,People All Over The U.S. Have Had Enough Of Confederate Tributes,Lilly Workneh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nationwide-petitions-conf_n_7646820.html,,2015-06-23,"COLUMBIA, SC - JUNE 22: The Confederate flag flies on the Capitol grounds after South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley announced that she will call for the Confederate flag to be removed on June 22, 2015 in Columbia, South Carolina. Debate over the flag flying at the Capitol was again ignited off after nine people were shot and killed during a prayer meeting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae0e5b250000320037b495.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (R) on Monday called for the Confederate flag to be removed from the Captiol grounds, Americans all over the country rejoiced -- nowhere more so than in Charleston, where Dylann Roof allegedly shot and killed nine people in a historic black church last week. Now, people nationwide are calling on their own community and state leaders to do away with local tributes to the Confederacy and Southern separatism. The flag at the South Carolina Statehouse won't actually come down unless two-thirds of the state legislature votes to remove it, but Haley's call to action is certainly a step in the right direction -- and it seems to be at the forefront of a trend. At least half a dozen petitions have launched on Change.org since last week’s deadly shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. Each petition is a plea to a politician or school official to remove or rename an area fixture that in some way memorializes the Confederacy.“The Charleston tragedy reminded everyone that racism is very much still a thing we have to deal with, and it's ingrained in our cultural landscape through these monuments and symbols,” Xavier Rotnofsky, a student body representative at the University of Texas at Austin, told The Huffington Post. Rotnofsky is one of more than 2,300 students at UT Austin who have called on the school's president, Greg Fenves, to remove the statue of Confederate president Jefferson Davis from the campus. The students' Change.org petition argues that the statue “memorializes a man who stood for racial inequality and bigotry,"" and suggests that the statue be taken down and moved to a museum “so it could be learned from instead of revered.” Meanwhile, in Tennessee, state Democrats are calling for officials to remove a bust of Nathan Bedford Forrest from the Statehouse grounds. Forrest was a Confederate general and an early leader of the Ku Klux Klan. The Baltimore City Paper, an alt-weekly, has launched a Change.org petition calling for Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake (D) to rename Robert E. Lee Park. Evan Serpick, editor of the City Paper and creator of the petition, called the park's name “a symbol of white supremacy and an embarrassment.”“My kids’ school, which is 75% African-American, has activities in the park, and I hated thinking about African-American kids going to that park and then learning that the person it was named after led an army that fought for the right to keep their ancestors as slaves,” Serpick told The Huffington Post in an email. “What message does that send?” Residents in Arlington, Virginia, have launched a petition demanding that a stretch of highway named for Davis be rechristened. In a similar vein, one Minneapolis resident is hoping to rename Lake Calhoun -- a local body of water named for former South Carolina Sen. John C. Calhoun, “who dedicated himself to preserving white supremacy and slavery, and helped lead the push for southern secession and civil war,” according to the petition. The Minneapolis petition notes that ""while changing the name of a lake will not, in itself, bring an end to injustice, it can and should be an important step in an ongoing effort to confront our nation's past and to end systemic racism and oppression today.""Similar calls have gone up in Georgia, where a statue of a Confederate soldier stands on the lawn of the Bulloch County Courthouse in Statesboro.Obviously, even if these and a hundred other petitions were to succeed, that still wouldn't solve our country's deeply rooted racial inequalities, nor would it magically banish prejudice and intolerance from American soil. Still, at the very least, changing these names and taking down these memorials would represent highly visible gestures of respect toward people and communities who have historically received very little in this country. Certainly making these changes would be better than not making these changes.But what are we supposed to do with all these highways and parks that suddenly need new names? Well, maybe... just maybe, if the people in power being urged to take action can find it in themselves to come to terms with history... then maybe the University of Virginia has already shown us a way forward. Maybe instead of memorializing the slave owners, we could spend a little more time paying tribute to the slaves.Are there flags or other tributes to the Confederacy in your town? Take a photo and send it to us at openreporting@huffingtonpost.com, or put it up on Twitter or Instagram with the hashtag #HeritageOfHate. Be sure to note where the photo was taken and who or what the site is paying tribute to. We'll post some of the submissions here."

(Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images for Doha Film Institute)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4c31c3c000066000cb47b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In what I can only call a remarkable, unfortunate coincidence, as I was driving into class yesterday afternoon, I was listening to an old episode of the MovieFilm Podcast wherein Brian and I discussed the then-recent passing of Robin Williams. During the course of that conversation, I mentioned my affinity for the 1999 Williams vehicle Bicentennial Man. This in turn got me in the mood to listen to some of that movie's terrific, evocative score by James Horner. Letting the music wash over me, I starting thinking about the number of memorable films he's composed memorable scores for, and how his trademark tones have served as the soundtrack to so much of not only my life, but countless others. When I got to work, I found out that James Horner was gone, a victim of a single-engine plane crash that morning. The two-time Academy Award winner (for 1997's Titanic) leaves behind a body of work that's staggering in not only its sheer volume, but its overall consistency.When I was a kid and first starting to get into movies, there were the three ""J""s of film scores: John Williams, Jerry Goldsmith, and James Horner. I'd only just learned to read, yet I knew even then that if I saw any of those three names in the credits, I could expect a great score. The first time I heard Horner was his soaring, nautical theme for 1982's Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, which was about as different as could be from Goldsmith's work on the previous Trek, but no less powerful.He was only twenty-seven when he worked on that, and with its apparent quality, it's no surprise he was drafted back into duty for 1984's Trek III. While that marked his final foray into the Federation, he didn't leave deep space far behind, as he again sequelizing a Goldsmith score to give James Cameron's Aliens its percussive heartbeat in 1986 (marking the first of three pairings with the director). From there he never looked back, lending his skills to Field of Dreams, The Rocketeer, Sneakers, Braveheart, Apollo 13, Jumanji, The Mask of Zorro, and far too many others to mention.More than just laying down sonic wallpaper, Horner found a way to make even larger-than-life scenarios seem human, and relatable, and real. As a result, his music became instantly recognizable even to those folks who didn't normally pay attention to that stuff. One of my favorites of his more recent output was 2012's The Amazing Spider-Man reboot, in which he was tasked with reinterpreting the iconic hero's musical identity after it had been pretty well defined by Danny Elfman in the previous trilogy.While I was initially a bit leery of his new Spidey theme after a decade of Elfman, it quickly became my favorite. (Here's a video of Horner discussing his Spider-Man process.) At the time of his passing, the composer was hard at work on his next batch of projects, which included another round of collaborations with Cameron for the Avatar sequels. At sixty-one years of age, Horner still had several years of creativity ahead of him, and in addition to the tragedy of the situation, I'm also sad for all the wonderful music we'll never get to hear."
21,WORLDPOST,Why Anti-Establishment Parties Are So Appealing to Dispossessed European Voters,"Mark Leonard, ContributorDirector of the European Council on Foreign Relations.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anti-establishment-parties-europe_b_7646946.html,"LONDON -- Across Europe, voters are increasingly discontent with political movements that were once part of civic life but have now become appendages of the state -- a governing class that seeks office rather than a chance to represent ideas or groups in society.",2015-06-23,"French lawyer Franck Samson, dressed as Napoleon Bonaparte (R) pulls the ear of UK Independence Party (UKIP) leader Nigel Farage at Napoleon Bonaparte headquarters during the celebrations of the 200th anniversary of The Battle of Waterloo in Waterloo, on June 18, 2015. European royals and diplomats gathered in Belgium on Thursday to mark the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo, a turning point for the continent which still touches a nerve and stirs national passions. 'Waterloo, the folly and the grandeur. The horror and the genius. The tragedy and then the hope,' Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel said in an opening address under leaden skies. AFP PHOTO/Emmanuel Dunand (Photo credit should read EMMANUEL DUNAND/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc150e12400005500e48516.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"LONDON -- Now is not the time to be a politician in one of Europe's established political parties. Across the continent, interlopers are breaking into the halls of the power. In southern Europe, new parties are emerging to campaign against austerity; in the north, they are rallying against immigration and the European Union. In many ways, Syriza in Greece and Podemos in Spain are neatly mirrored by UKIP in Britain or the AfD in Germany. Denmark is the latest country to see the surge of discontent overcome established parties. Helle Thorning-Schmidt's center-left alliance was defeated -- narrowly -- by the center-right coalition in the recent election. But the bigger story was the rise of the Danish People's Party, a right-wing populist party in the mold of UKIP. Its support rose dramatically to 21 percent, overtaking the mainstream center-right Liberal Party to become the second party of Danish politics. In the face of such a populist surge, the traditional parties that have long divided up Danish politics between them only barely gathered up half the votes cast. At the other end of the continent, all European eyes are on Alexis Tsipras, Yanis Varoufakis and the Syriza coalition that dramatically swept aside the old guard in Greek politics earlier this year. At first glance, Syriza and the DPP could not be more dissimilar, but their origins are remarkably alike. Both have successfully redefined politics as not an argument between left and right, but between elites and the people.The rise of these insurgent parties has both an economic and a cultural component. Their success emerges from the economic trends detailed most eloquently and extensively by Thomas Piketty in ""Capital in the Twenty-First Century."" Across Europe, urban voters from former industrial heartlands, concerned about immigration and marginalized by a globalizing economy, are turning out to vote for these new parties.""These voters have been abandoned by the mainstream parties, which are becoming 'cosmopolitan' and 'metrosexual.'"" The other group that many insurgent parties appeal to is rural voters put off by the liberal social values being adopted by mainstream parties. As London School of Economics Professor Simon Hix argues, these voters have been abandoned by the mainstream parties, which are becoming ""cosmopolitan"" and ""metrosexual."" Parties of the left are now increasingly dependent on public sector workers and those in cultural industries, while those of the right struggle to extend their appeal beyond business and finance.It is interesting to see how successfully Denmark's populist surge married these two constituencies. By making immigration a mainstay of its political discourse over the last decade, the DPP managed to make itself a significant, but ultimately limited part of the Danish political landscape. But in this election, it put its faith in a more centrist leader, who sought to reinvent the people's party as a voice of the ""left behind."" It was able to hoover up votes from Jutland -- Denmark's large, rural peninsula -- which suffers from lower growth than Denmark's cosmopolitan, metropolitan areas. By arguing that the government should stop spending money on refugees, migrants and foreign aid, and instead halt plans to cut Danish benefits, they campaigned under the slogan, ""Du ved, hvad vi står for,"" which loosely translates as: ""You know what we stand for.""""You know what we stand for.""The surge of these kinds of insurgent parties has been made possible by the way that the mainstream parties have changed in recent decades. The late political scientist Peter Mair wrote an extended essay, ""Ruling the Void,"" about how conventional politics has become alienated from the societies being governed. According to Mair, the mainstream political parties have abandoned their familiar functions of expressing their supporters' views or representing them. Political movements that were once part of civic life have now become appendages of the state -- a governing class that seeks office rather than a chance to represent ideas or groups in society. This is the void that insurgent parties are trying to fill: acting as channels for popular anger rather than governments-in-waiting. In fact, Reuters reported that the DPP's leader, Kristian Thulesen Dahl, said: What we have said before the election is also what we will follow after the election -- that we will be where the political influence is greatest. If that is in government, then that is where we will be. If it is outside of the government, then that is where we will be. That is the driver for us, not ministerial titles.He has spoken openly about wanting to avoid the fate of political movements such as the British Liberal Democrats or the Norwegian Progress Party that were squeezed by the compromises of government.Europe's mainstream parties are now, somewhat belatedly, promising to listen to their discontented voters. But it is, by definition, hard for politicians to appeal to an anti-political mood. The challenge facing these established political parties will be to find a way of engaging the disengaged without ignoring their concerns or imitating the insurgent political forces. That is exactly the balancing act that the Danish Social Democrat leader Helle Thorning-Schmidt tried to take on -- a challenge that was ultimately her nemesis."

Church in Charleston. South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and the state's U.S. senators, all Republican, have called for the Confederate flag's removal from the statehouse grounds, and the Post and Courier newspaper in Charleston is tracking how many lawmakers are on record in favor of removing the flag. As of Tuesday evening, 92 legislators who had responded were in favor of removing the flag, while about half had yet to respond, were undecided, refused to answer or were not in favor of removing the flag. In January 2000, 46,000 people demonstrated in favor of bringing down the flag from the state capitol, where it was being flown above the building. In response, the legislature passed the Heritage Act, which requires a two-thirds vote from the state legislature to change the name of streets, parks and other public areas named for historical figures, or to move the flag, which was placed on a staff outside the statehouse. This law has prevented colleges in South Carolina from changing the names for buildings honoring white supremacists.On Monday, University of South Carolina President Harris Pastides went on record calling for the flag's removal, stating that it's ""the right thing to do and the right time to do it.""Clemson University President Jim Clements and Bob Jones University President Steve Pettit both added their support Monday on Twitter.Dr. David Swinton, president of Benedict College, said he joined the calls to end the display of the flag above the state Capitol in 2000, and continues to hold that position.""Whatever noble ideals and heritage were once symbolized by the Confederate flag has long been lost to hatred and racism,"" Swinton said in a statement to HuffPost on Tuesday.The Huffington Post asked several other college presidents in South Carolina to weigh in on whether the Confederate flag should be removed from the state capitol. Their responses are below:Furman University President Elizabeth Davis“I applaud and support the state’s leadership in the call to remove the Confederate battle flag from the Statehouse grounds,"" Davis said in a statement. ""South Carolina should be a place where all are able to fully participate in the social, economic, and civic life of our state -- free from the fear and the symbols of racial segregation that diminish the life of all of our citizens. It is my fervent hope that the General Assembly will act morally and swiftly to pass legislation to take down the flag. This is an historic time in the life of our state. May those in charge have the courage to take action.""Wofford College President Nayef SamhatSamhat issued a statement to HuffPost Tuesday afternoon adding his support to bringing down the flag:I support South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and others in our state’s leadership who have called for the removal of the Confederate battle flag from the State House grounds. It is incumbent upon us -- especially those of us who are educators -- to affect change that embraces the wonderful diversity that is South Carolina.   I urge the General Assembly to move quickly to pass the necessary legislation to remove the flag from this public area, which belongs to all of the people of South Carolina. Our state should be a symbol of diversity, creativity, transformation, and a unique blend of tradition and forward thinking -- where everyone has the opportunity to participate freely and without prejudice.Clemson University President Jim ClementsClements added in an email to the student body, ""I write to let you know that I issued a brief statement earlier today, announcing that I join Governor Haley and other South Carolina leaders in calling for the removal of the Confederate battle flag from the State House grounds.

Gov. Boyd Rutherford (L) and state delegete Keiffer Mitchell (R) during a news conference on May 6, 2015 in Baltimore, Maryland. Hogan announced he had ended a state of emergency in Baltimore imposed after the riots and looting that followed the funeral of Freddie Gray. Gray, 25, was arrested for possessing a switch blade knife on April 12. According to his attorney, he died a week later in the hospital from a severe spinal cord injury he received while in police custody.

Larry Hogan (R) announced on Monday that he has been diagnosed with late stage 3 non-Hodgkin lymphoma, an aggressive form of lymph node cancer.Hogan, 59, sought medical attention after noticing a lump in his neck while shaving, and his doctors discovered more than 30 tumors in total. However, he plans on continuing to serve at his political post, recruiting Lt. Gov. Boyd K. Rutherford (R) to fill in for him when necessary during his chemotherapy treatments.“I’m going to face this challenge with the same energy and determination that I’ve relied on to climb every hill and to overcome every obstacle that I’ve faced in my life,” Hogan said at a news conference on Monday.According to the American Cancer Society, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (also known as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, NHL, or just lymphoma) is one of the most common cancers in the United States, accounting for about 4 percent of all cancer cases.Approximately 70 percent of people diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma are still alive after five years -- a commonly used metric of survivability, reports the National Cancer Institute. They also estimate there are 71,850 new cases of the cancer each year and 19,790 annual deaths.The two types of lymphomas, non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin, start in lymphocytes, or small white blood cells residing in lymph tissues, such as the lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow. Lymphocytes are a component of the body’s immune system; lymphoma occurs when these cells begin growing in an abnormal manner and uncontrollable rate. In the majority of cases, it's the B lymphocytes -- the ones responsible for producing antibodies -- that are compromised by lymphoma, as opposed to T lymphocytes, which are responsible for directly attacking pathogens. Hogan's case parallels these statistics: his doctors diagnosed him with  B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. With tumors in his neck, chest, abdomen and groin, he plans to undergo 18 weeks of chemotherapy treatment. Though the governor described his illness as ""very aggressive"" and ""very advanced,"" his doctors told The New York Times that they believe he has a ""strong chance of survival” and recovery.The majority of non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients aren't diagnosed until stage 3, when the tumors are easier to spot, Kevin Cullen, the director of the University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center, who did not treat the governor, told The Washington Post. Since Hogan was also diagnosed during this time frame, Cullen expects that chemotherapy will be enough to terminate the cancer and thinks it's a good idea that the governor continues to work in the meantime to maintain a positive psychological outlook.While researchers are still unsure of how non-Hodgkin lymphoma arises, the Mayo Clinic indicates that infections like Epstein-Barr virus and HIV, old age and even exposure to some insect and weed killers can play a role. Potential signs include enlarged lymph nodes, a swollen abdomen, feeling full after only a small amount of food, chest pain or pressure, shortness of breath or cough, fever, weight loss, night sweats, fatigue and anemia."

His cousin, painter Lajos Tihanyi, was among a group of Hungarian-Jewish artists who moved to Paris in 1924 that included Brassai and Kertesz (Kertesz went on to New York but often returned to visit Paris). In 1937, as Hungarian fascists began to promulgate anti-Semitic laws, Marton also moved to Paris, where he would live for the rest of his life.Through his cousin, he became friendly with a group of older artists in Paris, whose circle included Picasso. When the Nazis overran France, Marton joined the French resistance and worked with other Hungarians and foreigners, making false identity cards for people wanted by the Nazis, as well as producing and distributing numerous underground fliers. For these efforts, Marton was later awarded France's Medaille de la Liberation.After the war, Marton received commissions from the French government, including from Culture Minister Andre Malraux, to take portraits of France's greatest artists, including Renoir, Chagall, Brassai and even Pierre Cardin (several of these images are at the Cohen Gallery exhibition).The exhibition also includes several of Marton's photographs of Paris street life, including strolling lovers, playing children and a fire-breathing performer.

Clare has a serious heart condition but her coronary artery disease was mostly under control with medication when we retired in our mid-50s and began an active retirement. However, in 2009, less than a year after Clare's Alzheimer's diagnosis at age 63, we went from being active retirees to a couple trying to cope with life one day at a time. There soon would be no more daily conversations about matters big and small. No more afternoons playing games for hours at our kitchen table. No more engaging in all sorts of enjoyable activities together at home and in our neighborhood. No more travel. No more physical relations in bed. And by the fall of 2013, Clare was living in the dementia unit of an assisted living residential facility and we were no longer even together in our home. I am angry about all we have lost. I now wake up each morning and go to sleep each night without Clare by my side. There is no more present to fully enjoy with Clare, and there is no more future to look forward to as we had envisioned our future to be. But Alzheimer's has not just taken away our present and future; it has also taken away our past. Clare no longer remembers any of our past ... she cannot recall any of the wonderful activities and experiences we once shared. She no longer remembers our children and grandchildren, let alone other relatives or friends. Birthdays, anniversaries and special occasions do not register with her anymore. Alzheimer's is such a horrible disease, erasing one's past while ending one's present and future at the same time.I am angry. Not at Clare ... never at Clare. She did not choose to have this horrible disease. But I am angry that Clare has this horrible disease. I have recited the ""Serenity Prayer"" so many times trying to accept the things I cannot change, trying to have the courage to change the things I can, and trying to have the wisdom to know the difference. Clare's continued decline is something I cannot change. I know that. I also recognize how lucky we were to have had those nine years to enjoy a wonderful retirement together. But that doesn't change the fact that I am angry. Alzheimer's disease has absolutely no redeeming value. It is a disease that causes great pain for those who have it, and great pain for their caregivers. It is a disease that can rip apart families. I hate what is happening and will continue to happen to Clare. I am angry that I cannot have my best friend, my wife, my lover to be with me to share what I had hoped would be our long retirement years.I cannot even begin to imagine how painful everyday life is for Clare. How painful it must be for Clare, a former language teacher, to be unable to find the words she wants to say. It is so painful for me to see her struggling so hard trying to remember what she wants to say. But no matter how hard she tries, she cannot find her words. The most basic facts of our lives together prior to her AD, and now the most basic facts of her everyday life by herself, are gone from her memory. And that, too, makes me angry.It was our 48th anniversary on June 8th, but Clare no longer has any concept of the word ""anniversary"" nor does she have any concept of time. I took her out for lunch to one of the few places we can still go out to eat. (Wherever we go now must have a separate handicapped bathroom available because I must accompany Clare.) I reminded her of our anniversary many times that afternoon but, of course, each time was a revelation to her.The next day, aides told me that Clare had already forgotten that I had taken her out for our ""anniversary lunch"" only seconds after I brought her back to her unit. It is what it is.Anger is an emotion that many caregivers carry with them. I am angry about Clare having Alzheimer's. Watching Clare die slowly but surely of this horrible disease just continues to make me angry.This is the fourth in a series of ten weekly postings that will share emotions I find myself dealing with regularly. It is my hope that these articles will bring some comfort to other Alzheimer's caregivers.

Verizon Communications Inc. is buying AOL Inc. for about $4.4 billion, advancing the telecomâs push in both mobile and advertising fields, the company announced, Tuesday, May 12, 2015. (AP Photo/Mel Evans, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb32476250000320038a4df.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- Verizon now owns AOL.The telecom giant said Tuesday that it completed its $4.4 billion acquisition of the New York-based media and tech firm.“The Internet path is well worn, but the mobile brands, mobile video, and mobile advertising path -- all tied to the coming Internet of Things -- has few footprints,” AOL CEO Tim Armstrong, who will remain at the helm of the division, wrote in a memo to employees on Tuesday morning. “AOL and Verizon’s combined assets create an ability for us to blaze a new trail in a newly mobile and connected world.”Verizon agreed to buy all AOL stock at $50 per share.The deal, announced last month, comes 15 years after AOL’s catastrophic merger with Time Warner. The dot-com bubble burst of 2001 resulted in a $98.7 billion loss for the combined company in 2002 and forced it to write down the value of AOL, creating the biggest annual corporate loss in history.In 2009, Time Warner finally spun off AOL, which then began investing heavily in media properties. AOL acquired TechCrunch in 2010. A year later, it purchased The Huffington Post for $315 million.By 2013 -- the year online video ad sales topped $2.8 billion for the industry overall -- AOL began investing heavily in video products. That year, the company bought the programmatic video ad platform Adap.tv for $405 million. A month later, HuffPost Live -- HuffPost’s streaming network -- launched. In April, AOL promoted to advertisers a slate of new reality programs starring celebrities including James Franco and Oscar-winner Jared Leto. That same month, AOL unveiled One, an automated platform for buying ads across different media. The service, which provides open data to ad buyers, pits AOL against tech giants Facebook and Google, which limit the data clients can access.Rumors emerged soon after the AOL-Verizon deal was announced that the telecom would spin off AOL’s publications, including HuffPost and TechCrunch. Verizon had a brief stint in the content business last year with the short-lived Sugarstring. But the controversial tech news site was shuttered in December after The Daily Dot reported that Verizon refused to allow editorial staffers to write about net neutrality, a principle which Verizon opposed.Armstrong and Verizon Chairman and CEO Lowell McAdam have repeatedly said they have no plans to exit the content business and vowed to maintain the editorial independence of all the company’s journalistic enterprises. Last week, Arianna Huffington, the chair, president and editor-in-chief of HuffPost, signed a new four-year contract to remain at the company.""Today, I can say that we are in a stronger position than we’ve ever been in, with the wind at our backs,"" Huffington wrote at the time in an email to staffers. ""With input from our newsroom and our tech and business leaders, we have a detailed plan to execute our vision and build on our core mission of informing, inspiring, entertaining and empowering audiences around the world."""
