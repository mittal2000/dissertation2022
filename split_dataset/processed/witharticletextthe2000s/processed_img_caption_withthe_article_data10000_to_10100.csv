0,POLITICS,A Key Southern Democrat Says Let's Stick With Obamacare,Howard Fineman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/steve-beshear-kentucky-obamacare_us_59b9b248e4b0edff97191d67,"Former Gov. Steve Beshear made it work, spectacularly, in Kentucky.",2017-09-13,"""We aren’t starting from scratch,"" Steve Beshear warned his fellow Democrats.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b9bc251900002500563a25.jpeg?cache=KFoB4QPQOe&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― If you aren’t from Kentucky or you don’t know Steve Beshear, you might at first glance tend to underestimate him. Wiry, slight and carefully barbered, he speaks with a twang and carries himself with the polite, easy manners of an unassuming country lawyer.But Beshear is one of the most successful Democratic politicians ― indeed, one of the few major Democratic politicians ― to have thrived below the Mason-Dixon Line in this millennium. He served as governor of Sen. Mitch McConnell’s increasingly deep-red Commonwealth of Kentucky from 2007 to 2015.Beshear implemented Obamacare in his state more sweepingly and effectively than almost anywhere else in the country ― so effectively, in fact, that the big-talking tea party Republican who succeeded him, Matt Bevin, hasn’t followed through on his gaudy campaign promise to dismantle it.In a poor state with only 4.4 million people, the program under Beshear added an astonishing 500,000 to the insured rolls and dropped the uninsured rate from about 20 percent into the single digits.Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and a bundle of Democratic senators on Wednesday announced their commitment to replace Obamacare with a “single-payer” government plan for all Americans modeled on Medicare.But in an interview in Washington, Beshear suggested that single-payer was politically unrealistic and that Obamacare can still be made to work the way it has in Kentucky.“The problem with Obamacare is not the program itself but the uncertainty about the program,” he said. “We were able to minimize that uncertainty in Kentucky, which is why we had nine different insurance companies come in and participate, where before we had had basically only two.”It’s not that Beshear opposes single-payer in theory.“If we were starting from scratch, I would be for single-payer, too,” he said. “But we aren’t starting from scratch. There are too many stakeholders to be able to sweep them away and begin all over again. It won’t work.”Democrats can be forgiven such idealism, Beshear said, but Republicans and Trump administration officials who are deliberately undermining the existing program cannot.“It’ll work if we support it the way we did in Kentucky,” the former governor said.More generally, Beshear urged Democrats to remember their own working class roots ― white, black and brown ― and to offer a meat-and-potatoes menu of job programs, public education and health care.In his new book, People Over Politics, Beshear writes that national Democrats need to get “back to the basics” if they hope to win back the white working class voters between the two coasts who have shifted over to the GOP.Democrats also need to understand how skeptical those voters have become about the political system and how angry they are at being ignored.“Trump called out their name,” Beshear said, “and that meant something. Ninety percent of connecting to people in politics is showing up and talking to them where they are. They may not agree with you, but there is a better chance they’ll trust you.”"

Gillibrand, who’s been an outspoken advocate for survivors of sexual assault for years, wrote that DeVos’ decision “betrays our students, plain and simple.”She added that the Education Secretary’s announcement was made during the most dangerous time of the year for students, known as the “red zone.”According to Gillibrand, the “red zone” is the first few weeks of the school year when students are still getting used to their new surroundings and new communities, which leaves students more vulnerable to sexual assault. “With so many sexual assaults still happening on college campuses all over the country, we should be doing everything we can to make our sexual assault prevention and enforcement policies stronger ― not weakening them, not jeopardizing them, and certainly not taking them away.” Gillibrand broke down the multiple ways the Dear Colleague Letter guidelines make the reporting process easier, namely that they helped universities adhere to the Title IX law.

3,LATINO VOICES,"Silicon Valley Startup Takes Aim At Mom-And-Pop Stores, First By Stealing Their Name",Ryan Grenoble,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bodega-startup-vending-machine-silicon-valley_us_59b94819e4b0edff97186328,"“This is sacrilegious, what they’re doing,” says a representative for bodegas.",2017-09-13,A Bodega (at left) provides goods for residents of an apartment building.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b98eb419000025005639bd.png?ops=crop_11_26_870_573%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"A Silicon Valley startup wants to disrupt the bodega, a beloved fixture in urban centers around the country, but the internet isn’t buying it.The startup, called “Bodega,” seeks to replace its human-run counterparts with what are essentially vending machines, strategically stocked and placed in building lobbies, dorms, gyms, and wherever else someone might conceivably need to buy something like deodorant at two in the morning.Instead of carrying a wide range of goods, the vending machines would learn over time and only stock items that appeal to customers in each particular location, say the startup executives.“Each community tends to have relatively homogenous tastes, given that they live or work in the same place,” Bodega co-founder Paul McDonald told Fast Company. “By studying their buying behavior, we’re hoping to eventually figure out how the needs of people in one apartment building differ from those in another. We could customize the items in one dorm versus the next.” McDonald and Bodega’s other co-founder, Ashwath Rajan, are both former Google employees.Fast Company’s profile of the company, which officially launched Wednesday, provoked a storm of outrage on social media. On Twitter, people rushed to defend the mom-and-pop stores that are so often run by immigrants and people of color, and celebrated for having a cat or two. In addition to appropriating the name, even Bodega’s logo ― a silhouette of a cat head ― was lifted wholesale, internet denizens argued.(Reached for comment by HuffPost, the on-demand delivery service Postmates carefully distanced itself from the startup. While Postmates’ drivers can supply everything a bodega ― or Bodega, for that matter ― might carry, a spokeswoman emphasized the company buys all its merchandise from local stores.)“We’re very disturbed that a name to us so important as ‘bodega’ would be used to hurt our own members,” Garcia told HuffPost. “This is sacrilegious, what they’re doing.”Garcia’s grandfather headed up the Latin Grocery Association in the 1960s, where the term “bodega” took root to indicate to immigrants that they were welcome in a particular establishment.“My grandfather would be rolling over in his grave,” he said.The local stores provide much more in their neighborhoods than foodstuffs and other sundries, he added. When residents don’t have enough money for diapers and milk, for instance, bodegas will often offer credit to community members they know.″[This company] said they went to the community to ask if it was all right to use the name?” Garcia asked incredulously, “They never did that.”Instead of approaching them, he said, Bodega tried (and failed) to trademark the name outright.Garcia said his group has every intention of fighting to thwart the company.“The community has earned the right for people to respect the name, and respect how important these businesses are to the community,” he added. “These are business owners that work 24/7, and now you’ve got a well-funded company that’s going to come in like Uber did, and they’re going to hurt the community.”In response to questions from HuffPost, McDonald pointed readers to the company blog, where he sought to clarify their branding decisions:The name Bodega sparked a wave of criticism on social media far beyond what we ever imagined. When we first came up with the idea to call the company Bodega we recognized that there was a risk of it being interpreted as misappropriation. We did some homework — speaking to New Yorkers, branding people, and even running some survey work asking about the name and any potential offense it might cause. But it’s clear that we may not have been asking the right questions of the right people.Whatever the intent, Twitter wasn’t into it:"
4,ENTERTAINMENT,Kid Rock Bans Newspaper From His Detroit Concert After Critical Column,Carla Herreria,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kid-rock-bans-detroit-free-press_us_59b8b6b3e4b086432b027dcc,"The performer's publicist called the opinion piece a ""f**ked up story.""",2017-09-13,Kid Rock performs the very first show at the new Little Caesars Arena on Tuesday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b8bace19000025005637a4.jpeg?cache=8WUbWwMP2I&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Kid Rock denied a Detroit newspaper concert press credentials for his Tuesday performance because the outlet had published a column that was critical of the singer.Kirt Webster, Kid Rock’s publicist, told the Detroit Free Press over the phone Monday that it wouldn’t be receiving press passes because “you guys wrote a fucked up story and allowed it to be published.”Webster added: “You want a quote, there it is.”The offending “story” was actually a column written by the Detroit Free Press’ editorial page editor, Stephen Henderson. In the opinion piece published earlier this month, Henderson likened Kid Rock’s series of concerts scheduled for the opening of the new Detroit arena to “Jim Crow-era signs warning that blacks weren’t welcome.”Henderson went on to criticize the “Bawitdaba” singer for his “crass cultural appropriation of black music,” his use of the Confederate flag and the insult Kid Rock hurled at Colin Kaepernick, the former NFL player who began protesting racial inequality and police brutality last year by kneeling during the national anthem.Kid Rock performed at the grand opening of the Little Caesars Arena in downtown Detroit on Tuesday night. During the inaugural concert, the country rapper played into politics, displaying a giant sign that read “Kid Rock For U.S. Senate” and delivering a lyrical speech in front of a podium decorated with an emblem resembling the official seal of the president of the United States.Kid Rock even launched into a tirade against LGBTQ rights, according to a review of the concert by The Detroit News’ Adam Graham.“And why these days is everything soooo gay?” Kid Rock said, according to Graham. “Gay rights, transgender this and that. I say let gay folks get married if they want, and I’m not even close to a death trap. But things shouldn’t be this complicated, and no you don’t get to choose, because whatever you have between your legs should determine the bathroom that you use.”Demonstrators showed up at the arena to protest the concert, but it went on otherwise undisturbed. Kid Rock is an outspoken supporter of President Donald Trump who has recently ramped up his political rants, often slamming political correctness, the “extreme left” and “fake news.” The so-called Detroit cowboy even debuted a website at KidRockforSenate.com, which sold campaign merchandise bearing his name, and teased a possible 2018 run for a seat in the U.S. Senate.He later clarified that he was only exploring the option of running for Senate and announced that he was creating a nonprofit to promote voter registration. It is not uncommon for performers to deny press credentials to members of the media because of poor concert or album reviews. However, Kid Rock’s decision to bar the Free Press stands out since he is teasing fans with a potential political campaign and, if he does indeed run, the paper’s presence at his concert could have served as political news coverage.Webster, the country rapper’s publicist, accused the Detroit Free Press of publishing Henderson’s opinion piece without fact-checking and cited that as a reason the paper was banned from the show.“To be published without doing any fact checking on what Kid Rock has done for the city of Detroit? We don’t condone bad behavior. We won’t reward bad behavior,” Webster said, according to the Free Press.Jeff Taylor, a midwest regional editor for the USA Today Network who oversees the Free Press, told the newspaper that he was disappointed in the decision and pointed out that Henderson’s column was an opinion piece ― not a news story.The rapper is scheduled to perform at Little Caesars Arena through this week and into next week."
5,POLITICS,JPMorgan Chief Admits CEOs Quitting Trump’s Business Councils Was A Sideshow,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-council-jamie-dimon_us_59b956ade4b086432b038c44,Jamie Dimon says the resignations after Charlottesville shouldn't alter the business community's core relationship with Trump.,2017-09-13,"Merck & Co. CEO Kenneth Frazier was the first corporate chieftain to resign from a White House advisory council in protest of President Donald Trump's initial response to deadly violence sparked by a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last month.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b958141a00007100f06813.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Corporate executives took the unusual step of disavowing the sitting U.S. commander-in-chief last month after President Donald Trump failed to unambiguously condemn the white supremacist rally that sparked deadly violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, last month. The White House disbanded two advisory councils after chief executives, facing intense public pressure, began quitting in protest. But that hasn’t resulted in the business executives cutting ties to the president, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon acknowledged on Tuesday. In an on-stage interview at CNBC’s Delivering Alpha conference, the chief of America’s biggest bank by assets said the dissolution of the council he served on was “not a big deal,” and that executives have a responsibility to help when called upon by the administration.“You can’t say, ‘‘I’m not going to go help a new president of the United States,’” he said at the event in New York. But in the immediate aftermath of the controversy spurred by Trump’s reactions to the Charlottesville violence, the councils “became more of a distraction than was necessary, that’s all,” he said, and were “more of a negative than positive.”He added that the ending of the councils doesn’t mean CEOs “aren’t going to be involved in a way they can be productively involved” with the administration. Merck & Co. CEO Kenneth Frazier stepped down from the White House’s manufacturing council two days after Trump, in his initial comments on what occurred in Charlottesville, refused to single out the white supremacist marchers, one of whom allegedly drove a car into a crowd and killed an anti-racism counter protester. Trump instead condemned violence on “many sides.”Trump publicly attacked Frazier, the lone African American on the council, with an angry tweet criticizing his company for high drug prices.But other executives followed suit, including the top bosses of Under Armour, Intel and Campbell Soup Company. And in a rare rebuke, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon ― who served alongside Dimon on the White House’s business advisory council, a sister group the manufacturing panel ― published a memo to employees excoriating Trump’s response to the Charlottesville tragedy on the retailer’s website. Under mounting calls for more companies to make a similar stand, the White House disintegrated both groups in a move Trump said allowed the firms to save face.Corporations are by nature averse to weighing in on social politics, yet Trump allowed them to righteously seize the high ground on an issue as morally one-sided as the merits of neo-Nazism. Trump may have forced corporate captains into uncharted waters, but he ultimately blew wind into their sails by giving them the chance to publicly state that they think Nazis are bad and win plaudits by doing so. The whole situation became a most dramatic ― and yet least controversial ― expression of corporate social responsibility in recent memory. And it came at little cost. Even if a showy and vindictive president disbanded the advisory councils, that hasn’t stopped corporate lobbyists and industry trade associations from working with top White House officials such as Vice President Mike Pence or National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn.“Businesses will continue to engage on the issues important to the American economy, just through different venues,” Michael Steel, managing director at Hamilton Place Strategies, a public affairs firm that represents a number of financial services clients, told Politico last month. “Many people in the business community are frustrated by the president’s words and tweets on Charlottesville, but that does not change the importance of policies that make life better for the economy and the American people.”Trump made aggressive deregulation a key part of his policy platform. Since taking office, his administration has been stripping away environmental and banking regulations put in place to combat climate change and prevent an financial crisis like the one that sparked the Great Recession. Now, he’s pushing for a major tax overhaul that would sharply reduce the burden on big companies and the richest Americans. On Wednesday morning, he tweeted that destruction left by two major hurricanes this month meant “Tax Cuts and Tax Reform is needed more than ever before.”Dimon, in his Tuesday comments, said business executives “should try to help the president be successful.”“Can you imagine me standing in front of an audience like this and saying I’m not in favor of the president of the United States being successful?” he added. “I would find that ― I’d be a traitor.”"

The most memorable one came earlier this year, though, when she and her husband adopted a baby girl.The “Younger” star appeared on Harry Connick Jr.’s show, “Harry,” for an episode airing Wednesday. During her interview, Foster spoke about her 6-month-old daughter, Emily, whom she and her husband, screenwriter Ted Griffin, recently adopted. “She’s amazing,” she said. “It’s changed our life forever.”During the show, Foster showed off a funny photo of Emily squashing her face and described it as the “the glamorous life of mom life.” She also mentioned that she and Griffin had little experience with babies before welcoming Emily, whom she said is “like the golden child” since she’s the first grandchild on both sides of the family.“We are learning as we’re going,” she said, adding later, “It’s a massive learning curve. She teaches you a lot.”In June, the “Younger” actress appeared on Today’s segment with co-hosts Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb. She joked that she and her husband had “no idea” what they were doing when they first welcomed Emily and explained how her adoption “felt 100 percent right.”“It’s been unbelievable, the whole process and being in my 40s and realizing that there are many ways to have a family,” she said, adding later, “I was like, ‘What took me so long?’ But yet I felt like I was waiting for this little soul to find me.”H/T People"

A substantial number of Democrats joined Republicans in defeating the measure, which is significant given Congress’ years-long reluctance to go on record on the matter of war.Three Republicans voted in support of the proposal: Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.), the author of the amendment; Dean Heller (Nev.); and Mike Lee (Utah).Thirteen Democrats voted to “table,” or kill, the amendment: Tom Carper (Del.), Bob Casey (Pa.), Catherine Cortez Masto (Nev.), Joe Donnelly (Ind.), Maggie Hassan (N.H.), Joe Manchin (W.Va.), Claire McCaskill (Mo.), Jack Reed (R.I.), Brian Schatz (Hawaii), Jeanne Shaheen (N.H.), Debbie Stabenow (Mich.), Mark Warner (Va.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.).Paul threatened to hold up passage of the National Defense Authorization Act, which sets forth the Pentagon’s budget, unless the Senate voted on repealing the 2001 and 2002 authorizations for the use of military force (AUMF) for the wars against al Qaeda, the so-called Islamic State and the Taliban. The repeal would not have taken effect until six months after the amendment’s passage, however, to give Congress time to pass a new authorization for the use of military force.“I don’t think one generation should bind another generation to war,” Paul said during an interview Wednesday on MSNBC. “I don’t think that the resolution in 2001 has anything to do with the seven different wars we’re involved with now.”White House legislative director Marc Short said Monday the administration does not support the push for a new authorization for the use of military force because it already has adequate legal authority to wage war against terror groups based on the 2001 authorization.The Afghanistan War is the nation’s longest-running war. American troops have been stationed in the Middle Eastern country for more than 16 years, with no end to the mission in sight. President Donald Trump signed off on sending an additional 4,000 troops there last month.The opposition to Paul’s amendment was bipartisan.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) argued the 2001 war authorization is still needed because al Qaeda is not yet defeated.“Why would we vote to repeal our authority to defeat al Qaeda? All that we do to defeat al Qaeda and ISIL rests on this AUMF,” McConnell said Wednesday on the Senate floor, referring to another name for the Islamic State militant group.Reed, the ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he worried Paul’s amendment would “be read in many places as a signal the Senate has essentially declared in six months we are going to de-authorize military actions.”Wednesday’s vote also drove a wedge between Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who joined forces to draft a new war authorization earlier this year. Flake said he wanted to move the effort through the normal committee process. Kaine, however, supported Paul’s amendment “as a way to accelerate” debate and markup of a new authorization for the use of military force in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b93ea61c00003a0079e3f2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel’s Supreme Court on Tuesday canceled legislation exempting Jewish religious seminary students from military service, angering ultra-Orthodox lawmakers who could destabilize Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition.A panel of nine justices ruled that parts of the conscription law that exempt seminary students from service were “unreasonable and unconstitutional”. It gave the government a year to resolve the matter.For decades, the exemption from military service on religious grounds for seminary students has caused friction in Israeli society, where most Jewish men and women are called up for military service when they turn 18.The ultra-Orthodox say that their study of the Torah is vital for the continued survival of the Jewish people and also fear that young men serving in the army would come into contact with women and with less pious elements in society.Several hundred ultra-Orthodox men have, however, enlisted in special units that cater to their religious needs.Legislation was enacted in 2014 to replace arrangements that had previously expired. It was prompted by then-coalition member Yair Lapid’s secular, centrist Yesh Atid party which ran on a platform of “sharing the national burden”.That legislation angered ultra-Orthodox parties who rejoined Netanyahu’s subsequent government in 2015 when Lapid’s party went into opposition and they managed to effect a watering down of the law.Eight of the nine justices ruled the law should be scrapped and Supreme Court President Miriam Naor, wrote that the most recent arrangement that was made to appease the ultra-Orthodox parties “deeply harms equality in a way that damages the constitutional right to human dignity.”Since Israel’s founding in 1948, ultra-Orthodox politicians have campaigned vigorously against the conscription of members of their community, who make up about 10 percent of Israel’s population of 9 million.Netanyahu’s government, which controls 67 of the Knesset’s 120 seats, includes both ultra-Orthodox parties, but two other influential factions oppose a further relaxation of the legislation against conscription.Interior Minister Aryeh Deri, the leader of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, said in response to the ruling that the justices were “completely detached from our heritage and tradition and from the people.”He encouraged seminary students to continue their Bible studies and said: “Do not despair, continue to study the Torah, we will stand firm and will do everything to fix this situation.”Lapid, whom opinion polls have shown to be a possible challenger to Netanyahu in future elections, convened a news conference to praise the court’s decision, saying it had delivered a verdict that would force equality among communities.“This is why we have come to politics. Conscription for everybody, work for everybody. Benjamin Netanyahu can no longer continue to wriggle out all the time. Military conscription is for everybody, not only for the suckers who don’t have a party in his coalition,” Lapid added."

It gave the government a year to resolve the matter.For decades, the exemption from military service on religious grounds for seminary students has caused friction in Israeli society, where most Jewish men and women are called up for military service when they turn 18.The ultra-Orthodox say that their study of the Torah is vital for the continued survival of the Jewish people and also fear that young men serving in the army would come into contact with women and with less pious elements in society.Several hundred ultra-Orthodox men have, however, enlisted in special units that cater to their religious needs.Legislation was enacted in 2014 to replace arrangements that had previously expired. It was prompted by then-coalition member Yair Lapid’s secular, centrist Yesh Atid party which ran on a platform of “sharing the national burden”.That legislation angered ultra-Orthodox parties who rejoined Netanyahu’s subsequent government in 2015 when Lapid’s party went into opposition and they managed to effect a watering down of the law.Eight of the nine justices ruled the law should be scrapped and Supreme Court President Miriam Naor, wrote that the most recent arrangement that was made to appease the ultra-Orthodox parties “deeply harms equality in a way that damages the constitutional right to human dignity.”Since Israel’s founding in 1948, ultra-Orthodox politicians have campaigned vigorously against the conscription of members of their community, who make up about 10 percent of Israel’s population of 9 million.Netanyahu’s government, which controls 67 of the Knesset’s 120 seats, includes both ultra-Orthodox parties, but two other influential factions oppose a further relaxation of the legislation against conscription.Interior Minister Aryeh Deri, the leader of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, said in response to the ruling that the justices were “completely detached from our heritage and tradition and from the people.”He encouraged seminary students to continue their Bible studies and said: “Do not despair, continue to study the Torah, we will stand firm and will do everything to fix this situation.”Lapid, whom opinion polls have shown to be a possible challenger to Netanyahu in future elections, convened a news conference to praise the court’s decision, saying it had delivered a verdict that would force equality among communities.“This is why we have come to politics. Conscription for everybody, work for everybody. Benjamin Netanyahu can no longer continue to wriggle out all the time. Military conscription is for everybody, not only for the suckers who don’t have a party in his coalition,” Lapid added."

The campaign features compelling stories from people across the United States who have been affected by mental illness, including Paul’s story below.By Paul C.After graduating from a small liberal arts school in Connecticut, I found myself swept up in the hypnotic swirl of New York society. I jumped at the opportunity for an internship at Vogue magazine, and soon found myself in the spotlight. Before long, I became caught up in the social scene, gaining the attention of journalists, bloggers, and gossip columnists. I even starred in a CW television series based on the lives of well-known New York “it­ kids.”The attention… I loved it. But at the same time, I had not dealt with the issues that I’d bottled up for many years, and inevitably they all came to a head.Those issues started when I was a kid. Growing up in a quiet, picture-perfect New England town, my expressive style made it difficult to fit in. I spent the bulk of my childhood dedicated to ballet—an escape that allowed me to get out of my head, which always seemed to be racing. I would perform in “The Nutcracker” at the end of each year. But, after the bustle of the holiday season, the long, bleak winters would lull me into deep depression, because ballet is all about the illusion of perfection, and outside of that world, perfection is unattainable. In my teens, I sometimes had suicidal thoughts stemming from these unrealistic expectations. Drugs and alcohol took the edge off the depression and anxiety.Unfortunately, substance abuse (much like fame) has a shelf life. Sooner or later, they both stop helping you cope, and start helping you unravel. New York and all of that socialite/”it boy” nonsense and the invasiveness of all that fanaticism from strangers, and phonies, and the press—it was like quicksand.The addiction continued to spiral out of control for years. One summer night, while driving through the Hamptons, police arrested me for a DUI, and I spent the night in jail. On another night, depressed and in despair, I tried to take my own life. Instead of ending it all then, I awoke to an apartment littered with wine bottles and drug residue. Knowing in that moment that I could no longer survive alone and on this path, I took an Amtrak to Boston, where I admitted myself to McLean Hospital.It helped to be surrounded by others who were working on similar issues. One girl told us in group about how she left an abusive home situation at 15 and turned to prostitution to score her heroin. I’ve never forgotten that story. That put it all into perspective. I’ve had a pretty privileged life. I had a wonderful childhood and loving parents. I could never imagine going through what she went through. And yet, here we all are, crippled by the same afflictions.I’m now living in San Francisco, where I work as a writer and fashion stylist. My medium has evolved from print to digital, working most recently with the e­commerce style team at Ralph Lauren. I also write for Deuxmoi.com, an advertising-free website that is edgy and honest but still focused on fashion. To maintain balance in my life, I check in with a therapist when needed. My work provides a creative outlet that keeps me inspired and grounded.It is strange, because having a nervous breakdown or even acknowledging mental health problems doesn’t fit into an image­-based industry. But I believe now that these are not insurmountable problems. Although you may feel broken on the inside, you can be fixed by reaching out and seeking help. And, if you have the courage to be vocal about it, not only can you get the help you need, but also help others who are suffering.Paul is a 29-year-old writer and fashion stylist from San Francisco.

The group wanted to create a design worthy of the definition of patriotism ― “love for or devotion to one’s country.” They collaborated with local artist Jason Maxfield and graphic designer Sean Donnell to create the “In Our America” design, a modified version of the United States of America flag which upholds the rights of all people and touts the preservation of our planet.“My definition of what it means to be American is to live up to our potential to treat every person as equals, just as our founding fathers promised,” said King. “Sadly, our history, up through present day, has not delivered on that promise.

Now, scientists have found a way to use a tobacco-like plant to create particles for a new polio vaccine.In a study published in the journal Nature Communications in August, researchers from the John Innes Centre in the United Kingdom report that they successfully produced a polio vaccine using a tobacco-related plant called Nicotiana benthamiana. The plant manufactures virus-like protein particles that can be used to create vaccines.The team chose the plant, which is native to Australia, because it grows quickly, has an effective plant immune system and is good at synthesizing proteins.“It just happens to be a workhorse plant that’s been used for decades in plant research,” said Andrew Macadam, co-author of the study and principal scientist at the U.K.’s National Institute for Biological Standards and Control. “The plants are easy to work with.”Currently, there are two types of polio vaccines in use: the inactivated poliovirus vaccine, or IPV, and the oral poliovirus vaccine, or OPV. The IPV was first developed by Dr. Jonas Salk and introduced for general use in the 1950s. It involves growing the poliovirus and chemically inactivating it before injecting it into a patient. The vaccine then produces antibodies in the patient’s blood.In the late 1950s, Dr. Albert Sabin developed the OPV, which was approved for use in 1961. The OPV uses a live virus, but prevents it from spreading to the central nervous system and helps people develop an immune response to the poliovirus.However, the issue with these vaccines is that they both rely on the poliovirus in order to function. Although the viruses are contained in facilities, there’s a risk that they could escape and circulate in the environment.“What they both have in common is you have to grow the virus,” Macadam said of the two vaccines. “There’s the risk of reintroducing it into the human population. If we could develop a vaccine that doesn’t introduce the live virus, that would be a huge breakthrough.”The World Health Organization helped fund this research in hopes of fully eradicating polio. Since current vaccines still require the live poliovirus, WHO hopes to seek alternatives.“These [existing vaccines] have been absolutely effective at controlling polio,” said George Lomonossoff, project leader at the John Innes Centre and co-author of the study. “The problem is they require the production of large amounts of poliovirus and allow the virus to continually circulate. You’ll never eliminate polio entirely without continually vaccinating.”Polio is an infectious disease that can be fatal or disabling and lead to paralysis. One of the most well-known Americans who suffered from polio was former President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who lost movement in his legs and right hand. Today, polio still circulates in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria. WHO has been working to provide polio vaccines to developing countries, but one problem with current vaccination programs is their expense. Lomonossoff says that manufacturing vaccine material in plants would reduce costs.This new plant-based method also has some costs of its own. To create the vaccine, manufacturers would have to grow the plants and extract the material. Right now, the plants are grown in controlled conditions, so these types of facilities would have to be scaled up.To create a vaccine using the plant, the researchers put genetic code from the poliovirus’ outer surface into a natural soil bacterium. This bacterium can transfer its own DNA into plant cells, so once the bacterial cells infiltrate the plant, the plant will be infected with genetic instructions from the poliovirus.Within less than a week, the plant will start making protein particles that look almost identical to and have the same structure as the poliovirus. These particles are empty on the inside, but still mimic the virus in appearance, allowing researchers to create a polio vaccine without using the actual poliovirus.Polio is just one virus that can be treated using this method. Researchers have also been working on creating vaccines for other diseases, such as a virus that affects sheep in South Africa, the hepatitis B virus and enterovirus 71, a cousin of polio. The method could also potentially be used for the Zika virus, flu, tuberculosis, cancer and more.The researchers tested the vaccine on mice with successful results, but the next steps for research are to scale up and find ways to produce more of the virus-like particles to create vaccines. The team plans to do more extensive animal trials and eventually clinical trials on humans.There are currently three types of polio, and this study just treats one. Researchers plan to work on vaccines for the other two types of polio as well.“I was pleasantly surprised at how relatively straightforward [it was] to make these stabilized captives,” Lomonossoff said. “I thought it was potentially feasible but it actually worked extremely well as a collaboration. It did seem to work exactly as predicted. It’s almost a rarity [when] things work out the way you think things are going to.”"

The OPV uses a live virus, but prevents it from spreading to the central nervous system and helps people develop an immune response to the poliovirus.However, the issue with these vaccines is that they both rely on the poliovirus in order to function. Although the viruses are contained in facilities, there’s a risk that they could escape and circulate in the environment.“What they both have in common is you have to grow the virus,” Macadam said of the two vaccines. “There’s the risk of reintroducing it into the human population. If we could develop a vaccine that doesn’t introduce the live virus, that would be a huge breakthrough.”The World Health Organization helped fund this research in hopes of fully eradicating polio. Since current vaccines still require the live poliovirus, WHO hopes to seek alternatives.“These [existing vaccines] have been absolutely effective at controlling polio,” said George Lomonossoff, project leader at the John Innes Centre and co-author of the study. “The problem is they require the production of large amounts of poliovirus and allow the virus to continually circulate. You’ll never eliminate polio entirely without continually vaccinating.”Polio is an infectious disease that can be fatal or disabling and lead to paralysis. One of the most well-known Americans who suffered from polio was former President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who lost movement in his legs and right hand. Today, polio still circulates in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria. WHO has been working to provide polio vaccines to developing countries, but one problem with current vaccination programs is their expense. Lomonossoff says that manufacturing vaccine material in plants would reduce costs.This new plant-based method also has some costs of its own. To create the vaccine, manufacturers would have to grow the plants and extract the material. Right now, the plants are grown in controlled conditions, so these types of facilities would have to be scaled up.To create a vaccine using the plant, the researchers put genetic code from the poliovirus’ outer surface into a natural soil bacterium. This bacterium can transfer its own DNA into plant cells, so once the bacterial cells infiltrate the plant, the plant will be infected with genetic instructions from the poliovirus.Within less than a week, the plant will start making protein particles that look almost identical to and have the same structure as the poliovirus. These particles are empty on the inside, but still mimic the virus in appearance, allowing researchers to create a polio vaccine without using the actual poliovirus.Polio is just one virus that can be treated using this method. Researchers have also been working on creating vaccines for other diseases, such as a virus that affects sheep in South Africa, the hepatitis B virus and enterovirus 71, a cousin of polio. The method could also potentially be used for the Zika virus, flu, tuberculosis, cancer and more.The researchers tested the vaccine on mice with successful results, but the next steps for research are to scale up and find ways to produce more of the virus-like particles to create vaccines. The team plans to do more extensive animal trials and eventually clinical trials on humans.There are currently three types of polio, and this study just treats one. Researchers plan to work on vaccines for the other two types of polio as well.“I was pleasantly surprised at how relatively straightforward [it was] to make these stabilized captives,” Lomonossoff said. “I thought it was potentially feasible but it actually worked extremely well as a collaboration. It did seem to work exactly as predicted. It’s almost a rarity [when] things work out the way you think things are going to.”"

Now, scientists have found a way to use a tobacco-like plant to create particles for a new polio vaccine.In a study published in the journal Nature Communications in August, researchers from the John Innes Centre in the United Kingdom report that they successfully produced a polio vaccine using a tobacco-related plant called Nicotiana benthamiana. The plant manufactures virus-like protein particles that can be used to create vaccines.The team chose the plant, which is native to Australia, because it grows quickly, has an effective plant immune system and is good at synthesizing proteins.“It just happens to be a workhorse plant that’s been used for decades in plant research,” said Andrew Macadam, co-author of the study and principal scientist at the U.K.’s National Institute for Biological Standards and Control. “The plants are easy to work with.”Currently, there are two types of polio vaccines in use: the inactivated poliovirus vaccine, or IPV, and the oral poliovirus vaccine, or OPV. The IPV was first developed by Dr. Jonas Salk and introduced for general use in the 1950s. It involves growing the poliovirus and chemically inactivating it before injecting it into a patient.

For the past five years, Diaz has lived “out of the shadows” via the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals executive order of 2012.“The difference is that now I’ve already felt what contributing to America feels like,” said Diaz, aged 24, who came to the U.S. from Mexico with his family when he was 8 years old. “I know how it is different to be part of America and to contribute to it in so many ways. I’m not ready to give that up just yet.”Diaz is one of about 800,000 young people whose status is at risk because of the Trump administration’s announcement that it is ending the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. The immigration policy offers a way for some immigrant children who lack proper visas or immigration status to remain in the U.S. without fear of deportation.With good grades, a clean criminal record, and other requirements met, young people whose families brought them to the U.S. as children can apply for a two-year deferral on immigration enforcement. During the deferral, they may get authorized to work legally. Though not eligible for federal financial aid, DACA participants may qualify for in-state tuition or state financial aid, depending on state law. For others, getting a Social Security number allows them to fill out federal forms that colleges use to determine private financial aid.While a majority of DACA participants are from urban areas, more than a quarter million rural young people were potentially eligible for the program in 2012, according to a report (PDF) from Grantmakers Concerned with Immigrants and Refugees. While the report says rural children may be less likely to participate in DACA than urban children, there could still be more than 100,000 participants from small cities and rural areas, according to a Daily Yonder estimate.Diaz is from San Juan, Texas, a city of about 34,000 residents in south Texas in the Rio Grande Valley. While formally part of the McAllen metropolitan area, San Juan is small and has a different feel than larger cities nearby, Diaz said. San Juan is predominately Hispanic and has economic ties to the rural and agricultural areas farther out in the valley.Diaz graduated with honors from high school in 2012. He was in the top 10 percent of his class academically, was a member of the National Honor Society, and participated in extracurricular activities. Normally, those kinds of qualifications set a young person up for college admittance and even scholarships. But Diaz spent his years in high school with an increasing sense of dread that higher education wasn’t in his future.His high school counselor was uninformed about ways that undocumented students might find financial aid, and that deepened his sense of hopelessness, he said. He did not apply to college.“I thought I had the brains to do something different,” he said. “All those four years of high school, I had worked hard. I had studied. I thought I was going to get a chance.”Though Congress considered immigration reform that could have affected him during that period, nothing passed. When graduation came and went, Diaz took a job at an onion packing plant. “It wasn’t the best experience,” he said.The following month, President Obama issued an executive order creating DACA. Diaz met the requirements and applied.“I didn’t waste time,” he said. He enrolled that fall at the University of Texas Pan American (which later became UT Rio Grande Valley) and graduated last spring with a bachelor’s degree in Mexican American studies.Now he has a job as education specialist with LUPE (La Union del Pueblo Entero), a community organizing and service organization with about 7,000 members in the Rio Grande Valley.DACA participants have to re-register for the program every two years. The changes by the Trump administration mean the federal immigration service will no longer accept new DACA applicants. For DACA participants whose benefits expire between now and March 5, 2018, renewal requests have to be submitted to the U. S. Citizens and Immigration Services by October 5th, 2017. Diaz’ current permit expires in December. But since his change in legal status, more has changed for Diaz than just his level of formal education. “Since the [DACA] announcement in 2012, I think a lot of people have come out of the shadows,” he said. “They said, ‘you know I’m undocumented but I’m not afraid and I’m going to work on this.’”While in college, Diaz got involved with groups that advocated on behalf of the Dream Act, a bill that would put into law provisions like those in DACA. He joined and eventually became president of the Minority Affairs Student Council, which formed in 2012 following the suicide of a high school graduate who had learned he was not going to be able to attend college. “I thought, ‘That could have been me,’” Diaz said.Diaz worries about his future and the future of fellow “dreamers,” the name undocumented young people have acquired through the proposed Dream Act. But he’s optimistic that Congress will be able to reinstate the program through legislation before the six-month deadline on the program expires.“I have a lot of hope [about Congress],” he said. “The Dream Act has been brought up over and over since 2001 and now it’s even more of a reality to have this than it was back in 2010 or 2005 of 2001. We have a window and we have more support in both chambers and both sides of aisle.”He said he is encouraged by a statement from Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. Ryan said Trump was right to phase out DACA because the executive order is a presidential overreach. But Ryan also said he supports immigration reform that would make a place for “dreamers” to “to contribute as a valued part of this great country.”Diaz said the sense of risk he feels now that his status is less certain is nothing new. That unease has been constantly with him and other young people who participate in DACA. “It was really scary back in 2012 when I first applied to the program because I didn’t know what was going to happen,” he said. “I put my family at risk” by giving the government personal information about his immigration status. “Now I know a lot of people who have that same fear again that we had back then. We don’t know what is going to happen.”That doesn’t mean he regrets participating more directly in the economy and education system in America thanks to DACA. “I’m glad I did come here [to the United States],” he said. “It’s great. It’s the only place I know.” When people ask him how living in Texas compares to Mexico, he said he has no basis for comparison. “I can only compare it to other places in the U.S.”CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that the renewal application deadline was in March 2018. The deadline for renewal applications is October 5, 2017. The Daily Yonder regrets the error."

At the Vaquera show on Tuesday, a white bath robe with an absurdly long train made its debut at New York Fashion Week. With its oversized sleeves and miles of fabric, the piece looked comfy enough to sleep in, but not quite fancy enough to ever wear anywhere: Totally outrageous. Over the past few years, celebs like Rihanna, Selena Gomez, Gigi Hadid and Kim Kardashian have all readily embraced the pajama trend.Though the sleep fashion statement makes people look like they simply rolled out of bed and added a pair of stilettos, it’s great for all of us who like being a little lazy sometimes. As we’ve said before, the trend is worth trying and you can definitely work it into your wardrobe (though we’d advise skipping the massive bath robe). Just try wearing a pajama-inspired piece ― like a blouse or dress ― with a pair of jeans or a leather jacket and voilà! You’re ready to take on the world in sleepwear. "

After the 70-year-old actor expressed disgust at a gay relationship between a 17-year-old and 24-year-old depicted in an upcoming Armie Hammer film, Hammer fired back, tweeting, “Didn’t you date a 19 year old when you were 60.......?”Then 34-year-old Tamblyn chimed in with a disturbing anecdote of her own:After Woods asserted that Tamblyn was lying, Tamblyn wrote an open letter on Teen Vogue addressed to the actor. She asked him to consider the backlash he was receiving a “teachable moment,” suggesting that he “go inward now and ask [himself] the hard stuff.”Tamblyn wrote that when she was 16 ― before she was a recognizable face ― she and her friend Billy went to Mel’s diner in Los Angeles. They were stopped by Woods and his friend, who, as Tamblyn writes, then asked her to go to Las Vegas with them.“You tried to make it sound innocent,” she wrote. “This is something predatory men like to do, I’ve noticed. Make it sound innocent. Just a dollop of insinuation. Just a hair of persuasion. Just a pinch of suggestion.”When Tamblyn told Woods she was 16, she says he laughed and said, “Even better. We’ll have so much fun, I promise.” Tamblyn explained in her letter that she brought up the anecdote to make a larger point about the way women and girls are treated by predatory men who are rarely asked to examine or answer for their actions:Here’s the thing, Mr. Woods. At that time I was not a public persona. I had done a couple years on a soap opera as an actress, but you wouldn’t know me from Adam. I’m sure you’ve racked your brain trying to remember how you could’ve possibly hit on the actress Amber Tamblyn at a diner almost two decades ago. You think, it’s not possible, there’s no way I would’ve been so stupid as to hit on a 16-year-old known actress. But I wasn’t known then, James. I was just a girl. And I’m going to wager that there have been many girls who were just girls or women who were just women who you’ve done this to because you can get away with it.Toward the end of the letter, Tamblyn asks a direct question: “Are you and your history with women and girls a part of the problem, Mr. Woods?”Most people who read Tamblyn’s letter and her exchange with Woods will know the answer, but Woods’ behavior indicates that he may never have considered the question.Head over to Teen Vogue to read the full letter."

She rejected arguments by Shkreli’s lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, that the post was protected free speech.“This is a solicitation of assault in exchange for money,” the judge said. “That is not protected by the First Amendment.”Matsumoto rebuffed Brafman’s repeated pleas to reconsider her decision, or at least give Shkreliuntil Monday to prove he was not a danger.The judge also scheduled Shkreli’s sentencing for Jan. 16.“We are obviously disappointed,” Brafman told reporters outside the courthouse. “We believed that the court arrived at the wrong decision. But she’s the judge, and right now we will have to live with this decision.”Shkreli, who earned the nickname “Pharma Bro” for exploits that included increasing to the price of a life-saving drug by 5,000 percent, said in a letter to Matsumoto on Tuesday that the post was meant as satire.Brafman repeated that on Wednesday, but Matsumoto was not convinced.“What’s funny about that?” she demanded.Shkreli said in the post, since deleted, that he needed the hair to “confirm the sequences I have,” an apparent reference to genetic testing.Shkreli was convicted in August of defrauding investors of two hedge funds he ran, MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare. He was acquitted of stealing from a drug company he later founded, Retrophin Inc, to pay them back.Though the charges carry a maximum sentence of 20 years, Shkreli will likely serve much less, in part because none of the investors lost money.Patients and U.S. lawmakers were outraged in 2015 when Shkreli, then chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals, raised the price of anti-infection drug Daraprim by 5,000 percent.Since his December 2015 arrest, he has clashed frequently with critics on social media. Twitter banned him from its platform in January for harassing a female journalist, another incident prosecutors cited in their motion to revoke his bail.(Reporting By Brendan Pierson in New York; Editing by David Gregorio)"

Democrat Jacob Rosecrants, a schoolteacher, defeated Republican Darin Chambers, a businessman, by nearly 21 percentage points in a special election to represent District 46 in Oklahoma’s House of Representatives. The district encompasses part of the city of Norman, home of the University of Oklahoma.Rosecrants had lost by a nearly identical margin in a previous race for the seat in November. The seat opened up, however, when Republican Scott Martin resigned to head the Norman Chamber of Commerce, prompting Tuesday’s special election.The Democratic win was even more notable because President Donald Trump defeated Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in the legislative district by over 10 percentage points.Rosecrants campaigned on restoring school funding, reforming the state’s criminal justice system, resolving Oklahoma’s budget crisis and limiting corporate influence on state politics.“Representative-elect Rosecrants fought hard to win this open Republican seat that Trump carried by 10 points in 2016. Progress, public education and long-term budget solutions resonated with Oklahoma voters, turning this once reliably-red seat blue,” said Jessica Post, executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, in a statement reacting to the victory.Democrats also took control of the New Hampshire House of Representatives’ Belknap County District 9, which includes Belmont and parts of Laconia.Democrat Charlie St. Clair, a retired teacher, defeated Republican Steven Whalley 1,267 votes to 1,009 votes. St. Clair, who runs the Laconia Motorcycle Week Association, emphasized his deep roots in the community. He campaigned on improving public safety, maintaining Laconia’s nursing home and upgrading transportation infrastructure.Republican Robert Fisher had won the district handily in the previous election, but he resigned in May amid revelations that he had founded the misogynist Reddit forum “Red Pill.” Trump had also won the district in November by 16 percentage points.Oklahoma and New Hampshire have proven especially fertile ground for Democrats looking to make gains in state legislatures. Counting Rosecrants, the party has picked up three previously GOP-held legislative seats in special elections since November. And St. Clair’s win is the second pickup for Democrats in New Hampshire.Democrats remain in the minority in both the Oklahoma and New Hampshire Houses of Representatives. But the victories bolster the party’s attempt to regain nearly 1,000 legislative seats that Democrats have lost across the country since 2009, and suggest they could make more significant gains in normal state-level elections in Virginia and New Jersey this November.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated Rosecrants’ age."

Yacob was the only candidate to meet the stringent qualifications for presidency set up by Singapore’s Elections Department, the Straits Times reports. That means she’s likely to become president-elect after nominations close on Wednesday, and take her oath of office on Thursday. Since Yacob was the only candidate left standing, she’ll effectively win the presidency without an election ― a fact that has led to heated criticism from citizens of the city-state about its electoral process.“I can only say that I promise to do the best that I can to serve the people of Singapore and that doesn’t change whether there is an election or no election,” Yacob said about the news on Monday, according to Channel News Asia.

Yacob entered local politics in 2001 and rose to the rank of Speaker of Parliament in 2013. She resigned from that post in August. In Singapore, the prime minister is the most powerful political leader, while the president’s role is largely ceremonial. However, the president does have some important responsibilities, such as the ability to block key public-sector appointments, investigate allegations of corruption, and appoint a prime minister. In 2016, Singapore’s parliament decided that the post of president will be reserved for a candidate from a particular racial group if no one from that group has been president for five continuous terms, or 30 years. That meant that this year’s election was reserved for someone from Singapore’s minority Malay community. The last time Singapore had a Malay president was in 1970.Presidential hopefuls are required to submit applications to Singapore’s Presidential Elections Committee. Although other candidates submitted applications, the committee announced in a press release that it was only issuing a certificate of eligibility to one candidate. Yacob was reportedly the only one who met the committee’s requirements ― which include either experience in a top public post, or experience managing a private company with a specific minimum in shareholder equity.Eugene Tan, an associate law professor at Singapore Management University, told The New York Times that there has been a “groundswell” of criticism online about the lack of an election. “A contest would have added to her legitimacy,” Tan said.Although Yacob is set to make history for Singapore as a hijab-wearing woman, the city-state still has bans against hijabs in some government schools and public sector jobs. According to Reuters, Yacob hasn’t often spoken publicly about this ban. On Monday, Yacob said that she believes the President’s role is to act as a “unifying force.”“Obviously there is work that I have to do, but the most important thing for me is I would like Singaporeans to work together with me,” she said, according to Channel News Asia.

President Donald Trump does not like to be ignored either although what the North Koreans are doing is illegal while the U.S. president wants to sound tough (”fire and fury like the world has never seen”).With the high level UN General Assembly session beginning next week, Asian diplomats believe North Korea may do something. No doubt nearly every world leader will mention the threat from the DPRK (Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea), the North’s official name.Pyongyang has not been quiet. “In case the U.S. eventually does rig up the illegal and unlawful ‘resolution’ on harsher sanctions, the DPRK shall make absolutely sure that the U.S. pays due price,” said a threatening statement carried by the official KCNA news agency.Six detonationsMonday’s resolution, the ninth measure on sanctions since 2006, was another attempt to force North Korea to stop nuclear and ballistic missile tests. Just last week it detonated a sixth device and claimed it had tested a hydrogen bomb.Adoption of the document was swift – within one week whereas negotiations on previous measures have taken far longer. The compromises on the resolution came during intensive talks on Sunday in what British Ambassador Matthew Rycroft called “the most stringent UN sanctions regime enacted on any nation.”France’s ambassador, François Delattre, told reporters it was important to get a unified council position. “This is a compromise in order to get everyone on board,” he said.The Security Council vote was a unanimous 15-0. Five permanent members have veto pAmbassador Haley told the Council:“We are not looking for war. The North Korean regime has not yet passed the point of no return. If it agrees to stop its nuclear program, it can reclaim its future. If it proves it can live in peace, the world will live in peace with it. On the other hand, if North Korea continues its dangerous path, we will continue with further pressure. The choice is theirs.”What the resolution says and doesn’t sayThe measure bans North Korea’s export of textiles, estimated at nearly $800 million a year. It also limits the number of laborers North Korea sends abroad, many of them to Russia, generating millions in cash for Pyongyang.The original draft Haley circulated wanted to block all oil supplies, which could have caused hardship to civilians in winter. The resolution puts a cap on oil imports to North Korea but does not stop them. It reduces about 30 percent of oil provided to the DPRK by cutting off 55 percent of refined petroleum products.It also bans joint ventures and technology transfers to North Korea. Countries are asked to inspect ships with the consent of nations where the ships are registered. Originally the United States wanted countries to interdict vessels suspected of violation sanctions.Also dropped from the resolution was a plan to impose an asset freeze on the government and leader Kim Jong-un.Freeze-freezeChina’s ambassador, Liu Jieyi, said no one should think of regime change and again advocated a dialogue. China and Russia have proposed a so-called “freeze-freeze” wherein North Korea suspends its missile and nuclear tests while South Korea and the United States stop military drills. Washington has rejected this.Most of North Korea’s trade is with China, which is anxious that the country does not collapse and send thousands of refugees across the border. It would also place American troops across the Yalu River, a replay of the movie during the 1950s Korean War.The resolution also called for talks which have not taken place since the Clinton administration, despite Trump’s assertion that President Obama, his bête noir, had engaged in negotiations.But a dialogue seems unlikely in the near future. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson has said the idea is to force North Korea to the negotiating table, but only after it begins to show a willingness to stop testing and gradually disarm.“There is no good option, much less a solution,” said Richard Haas, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. “No amount of sanctioning will persuade North Korea to give up nuclear weapons, nor will China step up and solve the problem for us.““The best course for the United States would be to explore diplomacy for a limited amount of time, to consider carefully the two remaining alternatives if diplomacy comes up short [build up nuclear weapons in South Korea or take preventive military action] and then to choose the least bad option. The era of strategic patience has given way to the era of bad choices,” he said."

The government plans to adopt the new measures, being implemented by decree, on Sept. 22.During a trip to Athens on Friday, Macron told the local French community: “I am fully determined and I won’t cede any ground, not to slackers, nor cynics, nor hardliners.”He said the “slackers” comment was aimed at those who had failed to push through reforms in the past, although political opponents and some unions took it as an attack on the unemployed or on workers making the most of job protection.“Mr Macron knows very well it’s a power struggle, that’s what he wants,” far-left firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon, who has become Macron’s most vocal opponent in parliament, said on the sidelines of a demonstration in Marseille.“We will make him back down,” he said.Turnout estimates for the march varied widely between sources, as is often the case in France, with the CGT union putting it at 60,000 in France’s second city, while police said it was nearer 7,500.Protesters were also gathering in Paris.CHERISHED RIGHTSFrench workers have long cherished the rights enshrined in the labor code, but companies complain it has deterred investment and job creation and stymied economic growth. Unemployment has been above 9 percent for nearly a decade. Macron’s reforms are being followed in Germany as a test of his resolve to reshape the euro zone’s second-biggest economy, a must if he is to win Berlin’s backing for broader reforms to the currency union.The CGT is France’s second-biggest union, though its influence has been waning. Martinez said Tuesday’s nationwide protests were the “first phase” and more would follow. He called Macron’s reference to “slackers” an insult to workers.“The president should listen to the people, understand them, rather than cause divisions,” Martinez told France 2 television.CGT workers from the rail, oil and power sectors have said they will heed his call for strikes on Tuesday, but by mid-afternoon there was no apparent impact on power and refining production, spokespeople for utility EDF and oil major Total said.Just over 11 percent of the workforce at EDF, which operates France’s fleet of 48 nuclear reactors, took part in the strike, a spokeswoman for the state-owned utility said.UNIONS DIVIDEDMacron landed in the French Caribbean on Tuesday to survey the devastation wrought by Hurricane Irma on the French territory of Saint Martin.Governments on the political left and right have been trying for decades to overhaul the 3,000-page labor code, but ended up watering down their plans in the face of street demonstrations.Macron was economy minister in the Socialist government of president Francois Hollande, whose attempt at labor reform led to weeks of protests that at their peak brought 400,000 onto the streets, and stoked a rebellion within his own party.Hollande was forced to dilute his proposals, but so far there are no signs of Macron feeling compelled to back down.An opinion poll published on Sept. 1 indicated that voters have mixed views on the reform. Nearly six in 10 said they opposed Macron’s labor decrees overall. But when respondents looked at individual measures, most received majority support.With economic growth accelerating, unemployment on a downward trend and the leading unions divided in their response to the reforms, it is not clear whether the protests will eventually gain significant momentum.Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told the newspaper Les Echos that voters had chosen Macron “to carry out the reforms that France has shrunk away from for 30 years.”The moderate CFDT union described Macron’s labor decrees as a “deep disappointment” but said it would not join the CGT demonstrations. The smaller Force Ouvriere (FO), usually an ally of the CGT, also decided to stay away, a move that has led to discord within its ranks.

Nearly 400,000 Rohingyas have fled Myanmar in the past two weeks and sought refuge in Bangladesh.Myanmar is home to over a million Rohingyas, a largely Muslim minority group from Rakhine state, though the country doesn’t recognize their rights. In Myanmar, Rohingyas are not recognized as citizens and are classified as illegal immigrants. They have long been victims of state-sponsored discrimination ― including what the U.N. has deemed possible crimes against humanity.Rohingya militants attacked government security posts on Aug. 25, inciting retaliation by government forces that has prompted the recent exodus of hundreds of thousands of refugees. Tens of thousands of Rohingya are still internally displaced. At least 1,000 people, and potentially many more, have been killed in the violence over the past two weeks, Yanghee Lee, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights for Myanmar, told CNN.Roughly 90 percent of Myanmar’s population is Buddhist, and the country’s state counselor, former Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, has come under pressure to address the Rohingyas’ plight.Twenty-year-old activist Malala Yousafzai posted a statement on Twitter urging Suu Kyi to take action.“Over the last several years, I have repeatedly condemned this tragic and shameful treatment. I am still waiting for my fellow Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi to do the same,” Yousafzai wrote. “The world is waiting and the Rohingya Muslims are waiting.”Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu also spoke out in an open letter to Suu Kyi, posted on his Twitter account last week. “I am ... breaking my vow of silence on public affairs out of profound sadness about the plight of the Muslim minority in your country, the Rohingya,” he wrote.Suu Kyi has dismissed the mounting reports of abuse as “misinformation.”Tejshree Thapa, the senior South Asia researcher for Human Rights Watch, said she believes Suu Kyi “has chosen to take the side of the majoritarian population” in favor of Myanmar’s Buddhist population. State media outlets in the country have reportedly referring to Rohingyas as “morally bad” and “human fleas.”“It’s very disappointing,” Thapa recently told HuffPost. “I wish [Suu Kyi] would recognize that she is leader of everyone in the country, not just the majority.”"

We continue to take seriously the climate change, not the cause of it, but the things we observe.”The White House will have to perform a “trend analysis” sometime in the future, he added.Bossert’s comments followed ones made last week by EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, who said on Friday that it was “insensitive” to bring up climate change as the storm was unfolding. “To have any kind of focus on the cause and effect of the storm; versus helping people, or actually facing the effect of the storm, is misplaced,” he told CNN.Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) criticized Pruitt’s response, saying that, “now is precisely the time for a national commitment, when the winds are blowing and fires are burning.”“The floods and fires are not a time just for sorrow, they must be a time for action,” he said. “We must seize this moment to help the victims of these storms, and we must seize this moment to take action on climate change.”Miami mayor Tomás Regalado, who is a Republican, urged the administration to use the hurricane as a jumping off point for a larger push against climate change.“If this isn’t climate change, I don’t know what is,” he said last week. “This is the time to talk about climate change. This is the time that the president and the EPA and whoever makes decisions needs to talk about climate change.”While― as HuffPost France noted last week― scientists haven’t reached a consensus on whether rising temperatures causes more storms, the scientific community has long warned that climate change will lead to more extreme weather events and has generally agreed that the impact of storm will be worse.As French meteorologist Robert Vautard told HuffPost France, “the atmosphere is going to warm up and will therefore contain more water, which means more rain... it’s safe to say that hurricanes affecting low-elevation islands will therefore cause greater damage, even if they have the same features as today’s do.”The White House response is by no means surprising. Both President Donald Trump, who has referred to climate change as a “hoax,” and Pruitt, have a history of climate change denial. Since taking office, Trump pulled out of the historic Paris Climate Agreement and disbanded a presidential climate change panel. The Trump administration’s attitude on climate change is stark contrast from its predecessor’s.“Climate change didn’t cause Hurricane Sandy, but it might have made it stronger,” former president Barack Obama said in 2015. The year before, he warned that storms like Sandy would likely grow more common and stronger over time as climate change continues to intensify."

Police officers still continue to get a free pass to killing black people,” said one activist.",2017-09-12,Clouds of smoke and crowd control agents rise around a protester shortly after the deadline for a city-wide curfew passed in Baltimore in April 2015.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b849bf1900003a00563679.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The Justice Department will not press federal charges against the six police officers involved in the 2015 arrest and death of Freddie Gray due to insufficient evidence, the department announced on Tuesday evening.“Prosecutors considered multiple theories of liability, based on multiple constitutional provisions, including theories of false arrest, excessive force, and deliberate indifference to the risk of serious harm to Gray,” the department said in a statement. But ultimately they concluded the evidence could not support criminal charges under federal civil rights law.The Baltimore Sun had broken the news earlier on Tuesday, and Billy Murphy, the attorney representing Gray’s family, confirmed it to The Associated Press.Gray was arrested by Baltimore police on April 12, 2015, following a short foot chase. He suffered a fatal spinal cord injury while in custody and eventually died on April 19.His death triggered citywide protests against police brutality. After Gray’s funeral on April 27, the unrest escalated and residents looted stores, set fires and threw rocks at police lines. Then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that the Justice Department would be launching a federal civil rights investigation into his death.In May of that year, Baltimore State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby filed a range of criminal charges against the six officers involved in Gray’s death. Three of them ― Caesar Goodson, Edward Nero and Brian Rice ― opted for bench trials and were cleared of all charges by a judge. Mosby then dropped the charges against the remaining three: Garrett Miller, Alicia White and William Porter, whose initial trial had ended with a hung jury. The failure to secure Gray with a seat belt before transporting him in a police van came to the forefront during Nero’s state trial, with state prosecutors arguing that the officer’s failure to buckle Gray in made him liable for Gray’s death. Not being secured in the van was the cause of Gray’s spinal cord injuries. But federal investigators concluded that the police department’s seat belt policy “afforded officers the discretion to refrain from seat-belting detainees if the officers believed there were security risks involved.”“Given the angry crowds at Stops 1 and 2, and in light of Gray’s combative behavior once inside the wagon, the Department cannot prove that the officers believed that their failure to seatbelt Gray was an inappropriate balancing of the safety risks involved,” the Justice Department statement says. “Accordingly, to the extent that the officers violated department policy in failing to seatbelt Gray, those failures suggest civil negligence rather than the high standard of deliberate indifference.”The federal investigators also considered whether the officers failed to take Gray’s need for medical attention seriously and concluded it would be “impossible to prove” that they deliberately ignored Gray’s medical state.Five of the officers still face internal disciplinary trials, which are scheduled to begin on Oct. 30.Goodson, Rice and White could be fired, according to The Baltimore Sun. Nero and Miller could be suspended for five days without pay. Porter does not face internal discipline. In January of this year, the city of Baltimore and the Justice Department struck a deal requiring the Baltimore Police Department to implement a more transparent disciplinary system and to prohibit officers from stopping city residents without reasonable suspicion.The 242-page consent decree, which was approved by a federal judge in April despite objections from the Trump Justice Department, came after a 15-month-long investigation. The probe found that Baltimore police officers routinely used excessive force against black citizens, retaliated against residents for exercising their First Amendment rights, did not hold fellow officers accountable for misconduct and committed other civil rights abuses.Attorney General Jeff Sessions is highly skeptical of such pattern-or-practice investigations and consent decrees like the one reached with Baltimore, leaving uncertain the chances of any future federal involvement in police reform.“It’s not surprising. Police officers still continue to get a free pass to killing black people, and it’s especially not surprising under this [presidential] administration,” Kwame Rose, an activist in the city, said of the Justice Department’s decision not to prosecute the six officers. “Now it’s just becoming more and more apparent that … the issue of policing has to change from outside the system, as opposed to believing that the system is gonna change it.”Read the Justice Department’s full release: The Justice Department announced today that the independent federal investigation into the death of Freddie Gray, Jr., on April 19, 2015, in Baltimore, Maryland, found insufficient evidence to support federal criminal civil rights charges against six Baltimore Police Department (BPD) officers. The story has been updated with the Justice Department’s statement."

ShepardPresident Trump has threatened that if he doesn’t receive funding for the “big and beautiful wall” listed in his fiscal year 2018 budget, he’ll shut down the government. The $1.6 billion requested from Congress (not Mexico) for construction in 2018 means the “big” wall has been cut down to around 75 miles of the 2,000 mile U.S.-Mexico border. However, the White House has declined to comment on exact mileage. Even for just 75 miles, construction costs are likely 50 percent more than the requested amount. Coupled with the construction budget request, the president asked for another $1 billion for more border patrol agents and technology for the next year. Assuming the wall would be maintained for 20 years, its lifecycle cost would reach $21.6 billion. For that price, what exactly are taxpayers buying? Do the benefits justify the costs that were requested (so far), and likely additional costs necessary to fulfill President Trump’s January 2017 executive order?To answer these questions, we can use a method that businessmen like Trump often use to assess value: a cost-benefit analysis. The main purpose of a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border is to prevent unauthorized border crossing. To make our business decision, we must first determine how many unauthorized crossings such a wall would prevent. Then, we must calculate the monetary benefit of stopping them. Finally, we compare the lifecycle benefits and costs.Only half of all undocumented immigrants currently in the U.S. actually crossed the border illegally. There are already about 650 miles of fortifications along the southern border. The Congressional Research Service (CRS) judged that fortifications are effective in reducing the number of arrests by the U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) in areas where they exist, but not in reducing overall arrests at the border. In 1992, the USBP arrested about 1.2 million people crossing the border illegally, which was about the same number as in 2004, despite the many miles of wall constructed in high-traffic areas between those years. Newer data shows that arrests for illegal border crossing dropped from 1.1 million in 2004 to 400,000 in 2016. The Department of Homeland Security attributes this decline to multiple factors, including wall construction, other border enforcement activities, and declining U.S. economic conditions.Let’s consider a plausible scenario for the number of un-apprehended, unauthorized crossings that building 75 more miles of wall would prevent. From 2007 to the end of 2008, southern border fencing increased from 154 miles to 580 miles (an addition of 426 miles), while the number of border arrests decreased by about 300,000. Given the CRS findings and the 2008 financial crisis, let’s assume that 25 percent of this drop was due to fence construction. That would mean every mile of fencing averts about 176 arrests. Given the USBP’s arrest rate of about 50 percent, that mile of fencing would also avert an equal number of un-apprehended unauthorized border crossings. Altogether, 75 miles of new wall would prevent about 13,200 unauthorized crossings per year.Let’s also consider the best case scenario for the monetary benefits of stopping these crossings. The Heritage Foundation (a conservative think tank that helped shape Trump’s policies) estimates that the average unauthorized immigrant household costs the U.S. government $14,000 (or $3,500 per individual) per year. Even though this study’s methodology has been criticized by fellow conservatives, and real cost is likely lower, let’s use the Heritage Foundation’s high estimate. Let’s also assume the average person who crosses the border illegally stays in the U.S. for 10 years, so the total cost per individual would be $35,000. That amount, multiplied by the 13,200 people stopped by the wall, equals $460 million per year or a lifecycle benefit of $9.2 billion.These best-case scenario benefits account for less than half of the $21.6 billion lifecycle cost implied by Trump’s budget request. Given this, even if up to 50 percent of the aforementioned drop in border crossings were attributable to wall construction, this investment would still not break even. In order to prevent all of the approximately 400,000 un-apprehended, unauthorized border crossings per year using a wall, the costs of land acquisition, eminent domain court costs, environmental degradation, etc. would make it even harder for such an investment to ever break even. Construction alone, given the $1.6 billion for 75 miles, would add $28 billion to cover the approximate 1,300 miles of southern border that are currently not fortified. The 20 year lifecycle cost to taxpayers would be $375 billion. The wall is not a rational business decision, as the benefits would not outweigh the costs. But all evidence aside, perhaps the political significance of the border wall for the Trump campaign makes it priceless.Suzannah Scanlon is a senior department coordinator in the dean’s office of the Heller School for Social Policy and Management.

The two 19-year-olds joined a diverse crowd of women and men, starting at the entrance of Barnes & Noble in Union Square and filing down the block and around the next block. All of these people were spending their mornings waiting for one thing: A chance to meet Hillary Clinton and get a signed copy of her new book, What Happened.“We’re very hyped to see her,” said Gregory. She and Ireland, who insisted that we need to hear Clinton’s story, had been talking about what might be in this book for a long time. “We need to look deeper into why [Donald Trump] won and why he represents our country,” said Ireland. “And [Clinton] has experience.” Much of the early criticism of Clinton’s new memoir ― a reflection on, as the title suggests, what happened during the tumultuous 2016 presidential election, and her own experience as the first female nominee for a major party ― has centered on the question of whether she should stop speaking about the election and just quietly fade into the background. As a Politico piece about the reaction to Clinton’s book tour put it: “Political reporters gripe privately (and on Twitter) about yet another return to the campaign that will never end. Campaign operatives don’t want the distraction, just as they head into another election season.”But the men and women who waited for hours to get a copy of What Happened don’t want the woman they hoped would be our current president to shut up. They want to hear her story ― and learn from it. Some of the people in line had long been ardent Clinton fans from a distance, like 16-year-old J.C. DeMaria, who came into Manhattan from New Jersey and had been in line with his father since 6:30 a.m. He’s “idolized” Clinton since she ran for president in 2008, when DeMaria was just 7 years old. The thing he loves most about her? “She’s unafraid to hold opinions.”Others in the line came at their admiration for the former secretary of state from a more personal place, like Jean Moore, 70, who was in Clinton’s class at Wellesley College. She was in town from Tennessee to see her grandson and rushed over to Barnes & Noble at 7 a.m. She told HuffPost that she “had a feeling” Clinton would be a star someday from her first week on Wellesley’s campus. “Every time I saw her she was with a big group laughing,” Moore recounted, reflecting on how inspiring Hillary Rodham’s 1969 commencement speech was. “It let ’em know it was time for women to be recognized and be involved in public life. We weren’t going to sit around taking it anymore.”Everyone HuffPost spoke to scoffed at the idea that Clinton should bow out of public life in 2017. Many felt that the suggestion that she stop talking and go away reeked of sexism ― especially given that Sen. Bernie Sanders has published two books since his primary run wrapped up. “Hillary just wanted to vent,” said Carol Walther, 64, who waited in line with her 25-year-old daughter, Kristine. “That’s wonderful. That’s what Bernie did. Why isn’t Bernie criticized?”Karla Chrzanowski, who only identified herself as a “woman of a certain age,” told HuffPost that it’s imperative that Clinton doesn’t stop talking about the election, because silencing her would send a message to other women who might step into the public eye.“There’s so much to learn from what happened [during the 2016 election],” she said. “I think there is an effort underfoot to silence women, and I think it extends from rape victims on campuses to the highest levels of the government ... It is increasingly important for women to continue to speak their truth and find their voice and to share it with others.”Clinton’s supporters say they admire her refusal to be silenced by people (often male people) who would like to see her shut up. They love that even after a devastating loss, she’s out in the public eye, speaking up.“Even when she fails, she still perseveres,” said Ireland. “She lost the election, but she’s still writing this book and she’s still here. I really admire that about her.”"

As demonstrated by the “WannaCry” cyberattack launched on May 12, 2017, no system is invulnerable to cyberattacks. While the United States government has responded to these attacks via executive order in an attempt to improve federal cybersecurity, there is more the government can do to bolster protect governmental system framework from cyberattacks, particularly with regard to safeguarding critical systems such as those of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Cybersecurity attacks are an increasing threat to federal government systems. While the May WannaCry attacks are just one instance of the rising danger of cybersecurity threats, this attack serves as a prime example of the necessity to update federal computer networks and systems.Launched on May 12, 2017, the “WannaCry” cyberattack was a ransomware attack that affected hundreds of thousands of systems worldwide (See Figure 1). At a House hearing before the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology in July of 2017, cybersecurity experts from Kryptos Logic announced that the WannaCry attack, as it is now referred to, affected the systems of over 120 countries, each with one thousand or more hacking attempts, and over 190 countries with five to ten ransom attempts.With regard to the specific components of the WannaCry attack, the worm was designed to encrypt files on a computer or system and only allow the individual to decrypt their files after paying the hacker 300 bitcoins, a form of currency increasingly used and increasing in value. However, on the date of the attack, employees from Kryptos Logic discovered a “kill switch” that allowed them to disable the ransom portion of the cyberattack. It is estimated that if the kill switch had not been discovered, nearly 65 million more systems would have fallen victim to this cyberattack, the most vulnerable states being China, Russia, India, and the United States according to cybersecurity experts testifying before the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology.Though the federal government’s system were not affected nor compromised by this cyberattack, they do establish the rising threat future cyberattacks could pose both to national security and computer systems throughout America.In reaction to this cyberattack, among other denial of service (DOS) attacks, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order (EO) 13800, an executive order designed to mandate all federal agencies under the executive branch implement a NIST framework (see Figure 2), a highly acclaimed framework which would greatly improve the cybersecurity of federal systems. Furthermore, under this executive order, each agency or department would be required to annually report to the DHS and the Office of Management and Budget with regard to system safety.While steps to bolster federal cybersecurity have been taken via EO 13800, more action is needed to ensure that federal systems are better safeguarded against attack. One step is through the passage of H.R. 2774, titled the “Hack DHS Act”. Introduced by Representative Ted Lieu [D-CA-33] on June 6, 2017, this bill proposes the establishment of a “bug bounty program”, defined as a “program under which an approved computer security specialist or security research is temporarily authorized to identify and report vulnerabilities within the information system of the” DHS in exchange for monetary payment.Following the completion of relevant background checks on third party computer security specialists, the DHS bug bounty program will assign relevant systems and operations to be analyzed by security specialists in search for vulnerabilities. This will then be followed by the proposal of remedies for those vulnerabilities.Furthermore, given that this bill’s proposed program greatly mirrors a previous initiative by the Department of Defense (DOD) titled “Hack the Pentagon” which held the same express purpose and structure, DHS will receive recommendations from the DOD. This bill also requires a written report be submitted to the committee on Homeland Security of the Senate and House of Representatives by the Secretary of the DHS no later than 90 days following the program’s establishment. The report will document the security researchers involved in the program, their findings, and their solutions. The bill additionally authorizes that $250,000 are appropriated for fiscal year 2018 to pursue this endeavor.It is important to note, however, that several arguments can be made both in support and opposition of this bill. The benefits of H.R. 2774 include the fact that this program mirrors a similar and highly successful program launched by the DOD entitled “Hack the Pentagon” which, like this bill’s program, was designed to expose vulnerabilities in DOD’s cyber infrastructure systems. Furthermore, the mission of this program, investigating vulnerabilities in the DHS’s computer systems, is extremely important.However, some may argue that while this bill does allow for standard DHS protocol to conduct background checks on third-party computer security specialists, the mandate for the establishment of this program prior to 180 days may lead to insufficiencies in the background checks completed, given estimated processing typically exceeds that time frame. Nevertheless, DHS can prioritize the clearance of participants, thereby ensuring proper screening in a timely fashion. Additionally, some may question the necessity of hiring third-party specialists to conduct an infrastructure security investigation given the expertise of current DHS employees. However, a third-party opinion and analysis may discover weaknesses previously overlooked by DHS employees, thus strengthening DHS cybersecurity through further evaluation.National security is a bipartisan issue of the utmost importance. Given the mounting frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks, the updating of federal systems is critical to strengthening our national cybersecurity efforts. While President Trump’s Executive Order 13800 takes steps towards improving safeguards, passing H.R. 2774 would work to find vulnerabilities in the DHS, a step necessary in order to ensure that DHS systems are better safeguarded against cyberattacks."

Though he seemed to ultimately make a decision, ending things with Schulman to focus on his connection with Lombard, a tense exchange at the reunion show revealed that he continued to pursue both women after taping ended.As Unglert sat in the hot seat opposite host Chris Harrison, the audience viewed a montage of his relationship arcs on the show ― including an emotional crisis on the final day of “Paradise,” which aired just minutes before the reunion. “Waking up this morning, knowing Kristina wasn’t here, and knowing that there’s no way I can be in touch with her, it just kills me,” Unglert said through tears. “I actually am in love with this girl, and yet I lost that to pursue something else.” He chose to leave the show separately from his remaining love interest, Lombard, telling her that he needed to respect his previous relationship with Schulman.On the reunion show, Unglert confessed that he still had “strong emotions” for Schulman while she admitted she would always have “a love” for him because of their “intense, but ... real” connection.But Lombard quickly interjected, breaking up the warm moment. “If you were saying that you were in love with Kristina all this time, and you love her,” she pointed out, “when we left the show, immediately, within an hour, you called me ... we had a relationship that unfolded after ‘Paradise.’”Apparently this was news to Schulman, who had also seen Unglert since taping wrapped. “Careful, Dean, what you say,” she said, “because I thought we kind of tried talking again, but ... are you still flipping-flopping us both?” Though he looked flustered, Unglert didn’t deny the accusation. “Yes, my indecisiveness carried on after the season,” he admitted, “and I understand that.”“I mean,” Schulman sighed, “enough is enough.” We’d have to agree.For more on “Bachelor in Paradise,” check out HuffPost’s Here To Make Friends podcast below:Subscribe to Here To Make Friends: Apple Podcasts / Acast / RadioPublic / Google Play / Stitcher / RSSDo people love “The Bachelor,” “The Bachelorette” and “Bachelor in Paradise,” or do they love to hate these shows?

Hicks is the third person to hold the post since President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January.Hicks, 28, is regarded as one of the president’s most trusted advisers. According to a Politico profile published in July, Hicks is known internally at the White House as a “Trump whisperer” and is “sometimes treated like an extended family member of the close-knit clan.” Hicks has remained somewhat of an enigma in Washington politics due to her low public profile. Prior to joining Trump’s 2016 campaign, she worked in public relations and fashion. She joined the Trump Organization in 2014 to work on Ivanka Trump’s clothing line, where she became close to Ivanka and later Trump himself. She was tapped early in 2015 to join Trump’s campaign, serving as his press secretary. After Trump’s inauguration, she was named the president’s director of strategic communications. Hicks’ new appointment follows repeated shake-ups to the communications office and White House staff. In July, former Wall Street financier and frequent cable news guest Scaramucci was appointed to replace Mike Dubke, who resigned in May. Dubke, who was on the job for just three months, said his reasons for leaving were “personal.” Scaramucci’s appointment immediately led to the departure of another high-profile staffer, press secretary Sean Spicer. Spicer reportedly vehemently opposed Scaramucci’s hiring, voicing concern that he would cause further uncertainty in a White House already rife with chaos. Scaramucci immediately set out to crack down on administration officials leaking to the press, vowing to fire “everybody” in the communications shop if unauthorized disclosures didn’t stop. Shortly after that pronouncement, he told Politico he planned to fire assistant press secretary Michael Short, who quit before Scaramucci could make good on the threat. Scaramucci was booted just 10 days after his appointment, reportedly at the request of White House Chief of Staff John Kelly. Scaramucci’s brief tenure was marked by controversy, most notably a profanity-laden New Yorker interview in which he took aim at fellow Trump advisers Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon. (Priebus resigned as Trump’s chief of staff shortly after the interview’s publication and Bannon left the administration last month.) “Mr. Scaramucci felt it was best to give Chief of Staff John Kelly a clean slate and the ability to build his own team,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement after Scaramucci’s departure. “We wish him all the best.”This article has been updated with more details about Hicks."

LOUIS ― While President Donald Trump’s voter fraud commission met publicly for the second time on Tuesday, a coalition of voting rights groups gathered outside the Missouri History Museum here to denounce the panel and warn that Trump’s commission will likely lead to more voting restrictions.Organizers selected that location for the news conference so that visitors departing the museum after viewing its exhibit on the civil rights movement could be reminded that civil rights battles are ongoing.“We stand here today at the entrance to the Missouri History Museum because we know that the fight for the right to vote is grounded in our nation’s history,” said Denise Lieberman, a senior attorney in the Voter Protection Program at the Advancement Project. “We stand here on the shoulders of people who fought, bled and died for our right to have a voice. Fighting the very kinds of barriers to voting that we are starting to see again today here in Missouri and in this country.” Kenny Murdock, a spokesman for the St. Louis County NAACP, referred to a story about a boy in New Hampshire who was reportedly nearly lynched. He said the commission is trying to do the same thing to voting rights.“I noticed the commission is gonna meet to mock lynch our civil rights,” Murdock said. “They want to stop you from doing the one enfranchisement that makes you equal with them on one day.”“Just as a lynching would rob you of your life, taking away your right to vote robs you of your citizenship slowly and methodically,” Murdock said in an interview afterward.The event in St. Louis was one of several held across the country as Trump’s commission, formally called the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, met. Activists are alarmed that the panel includes Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R) and other officials who have a history of pushing voting restrictions. The commission, they say, will weaken confidence in election laws and help justify more restrictive voting policies.Missouri state Rep. Stacey Newman (D) warned the crowd on Tuesday that the commission is considering a proposal to impose criminal background checks on voting similar to the ones required for firearm purchases. She told HuffPost she expects Republican lawmakers in Missouri would seriously consider such a proposal.“Let me remind you criminal background checks is not mandatory on every firearm sale, but yet they want to mandate those on every vote cast. I think you can see exactly where this is headed. This is about blocking access,” she said at the news conference. Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens (R) signed a new voter photo ID requirement into law earlier this year. Civil rights groups are challenging it in court, arguing the state isn’t spending enough money nor making a good faith effort to provide the IDs required by the law. Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft (R) agreed to comply with a request from the commission for voter information, even as many states outrightly refused to comply with the request and others said they were barred by state law from turning over the information. Lieberman said Ashcroft had no reason to submit the information.“Our secretary of state has been bending over backward to assist Kris Kobach,” she told HuffPost. “He says he’s not divulging information that is prohibited under Missouri’s privacy laws. But he should say no to the whole thing. There’s absolutely no reason for people to have people’s private information.”"

Frieden said he had the opportunity to think big after ending his term as one of the longest-serving CDC directors in recent history. Tackling cardiovascular disease, which the World Health Organization says is the No. 1 cause of death globally, seemed like a good place to start. The disease kills nearly 18 million people each year. The initiative will receive $225 million over five years from the Bloomberg Philanthropies, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, marking the first time those three major philanthropic players have collaborated in funding such a project. Frieden said the majority of the funding will go toward scaling up “simple, inexpensive and underutilized” methods for countries to fight preventable cardiovascular disease, which can be linked to fatal heart diseases and strokes. Frieden laid out three overarching goals: get rid of artificial trans fats, reduce sodium intake and implement better treatments for high blood pressure.He said Resolve will also aim to help governments in low- and middle-income countries identify and close gaps in proper responses to outbreaks of deadly diseases. The group aims to create better disease-tracking systems, build laboratory networks, hire disease detectives and make sure there are highly trained rapid response teams working out of functional emergency units.“It’s not a matter of if there will be another infectious disease threat ― we know there will be another one,” said Frieden, who oversaw the CDC’s work on the Ebola and Zika outbreaks. “We need to be better prepared than we are today.”The initiative hopes to tap into potential sources of funds within countries, the World Bank and the private sector, all of which he said have economic and humanitarian incentives to close these gaps.Ron Klain, who served as President Barack Obama’s Ebola response coordinator, said the creation of an initiative like Resolve could not come soon enough. “No threat has a higher chance of leading to a massive, sudden loss of lives in the next few years than a pandemic ― and the world is woefully unprepared,” Klain told HuffPost. “Tom Frieden is the most respected leader in the world on this topic, both in the U.S. and overseas, and this effort, with the generosity of its donors, is vitally needed.”Frieden said Resolve will work with the World Health Organization, the CDC Foundation, the World Bank, the Bloomberg School of Public Health at the Johns Hopkins University and the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids to implement these public health strategies and initiatives globally. The initiative will be housed under Vital Strategies, a global health nonprofit that operates across 60 countries an specializes in public health initiatives and partnerships.The organization is outside the government’s chain of command, but Frieden said he plans to working extensively with public health officials. He also said Resolve could complement, but not replace, the role of government in public health.“Resolve can work fast, flexibly and at scale,” Frieden said. “We’re not trying to reinvent the wheel, but make the car go faster.”Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease who has worked with Frieden to address outbreaks, said Resolve could have a major positive impact. He highlighted the initiative’s ample resources and Frieden having control over an organization without the constraints of governmental bureaucracy.“I’m really looking forward to working with him in the coming years,” Fauci said. “It’ll be interesting to see what we can do when he’s on the outside and I’m on the inside.”This article has been updated with comment from Anthony Fauci.

45,POLITICS,Trump Is Changing The Immigration Debate — And The Press Isn't Keeping Up,Nick Baumann,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bannon-built-on-its-citizens_us_59b6fcbee4b09be4165761b0,"Reporters think most Americans believe in the ""nation of immigrants"" ideal. But that's exactly what Trump & Co. want to change.",2017-09-12,The poem by Emma Lazarus that's on the base of the Statue of Liberty.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b84fff1a00002400f065a5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Journalists can’t stop arguing with President Donald Trump and his allies about immigration.CBS’ “60 Minutes” interview with former top Trump adviser Steve Bannon, which aired Sunday, offers a telling example of this phenomenon. After Bannon said Trump should have gone “full bore” and focused “on the American citizens” by immediately ending Obama-era deportation protections for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children ― instead of delaying the change by six months ― interviewer Charlie Rose launched into a speech. “America was, in the eyes of so many people, and it’s what people respect America for, it is people have been able to come here, find a place, contribute to the economy,” Rose said. “That’s what immigration has been in America. And you seem to want to turn it around and stop it.”“You couldn’t be more dead wrong,” Bannon replied. “America was built on her citizens.”The awkward moment recalled an early August exchange between CNN’s Jim Acosta and Stephen Miller, a top White House aide, at a press briefing. Acosta asked Miller a question much like the one Rose asked Bannon: Why did the White House support a bill that would drastically cut even legal immigration? “What you’re proposing here, what the president’s proposing here, does not sound like it’s in keeping with American tradition when it comes to immigration,” Acosta said. “The Statue of Liberty says, ‘Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.’ It doesn’t say anything about speaking English or being able to be a computer programmer.”Miller was incensed. The Emma Lazarus poem on the Statue of Liberty, he argued, doesn’t have anything to do with the monument’s meaning because it was added later. Acosta, he suggested, was unfairly associating the statue with a pro-immigration agenda.These exchanges illustrate how Trump and his allies are changing the debate over immigration, and how reporters are racing to catch up.The remarks by Acosta and Rose have something in common: They imply that most Americans believe immigration is a good thing that helped build the U.S., and that there’s a broad consensus in favor of legal immigration. There’s some truth to this: 77 percent of Americans agree that the U.S. is a “nation of immigrants,” according to a 2015 Economist/YouGov poll. Acosta is among that 77 percent: “We are a nation of immigrants,” he told HuffPost in an email. “This is not debatable. To say otherwise is to engage in revisionist history.”More than half of Americans believe the Lazarus poem “should still apply” to U.S. immigration policy, according to a HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted in August. And for most of the past three decades, presidents and members of Congress from both parties have done little to restrict legal immigration ― and repeatedly tried to create guest worker programs and paths to citizenship for undocumented people. But the consensus surrounding legal immigration that Rose and Acosta suggest exists is exactly what Bannon, Miller, and Trump set out to challenge in the 2016 presidential campaign. Bannon’s vision of an America built “on her citizens” — not slaves, native people or women, who weren’t full citizens — and Miller’s dismissal of the Lazarus poem are part of a broader attack on the consensus view of the role of immigration and diversity in U.S. history. And, especially among Trump’s base, that consensus has eroded. Until recently, dramatic decreases in legal immigration were never seriously on the table, and Republican presidential hopefuls were willing to consider a path to citizenship for undocumented people. Attacks on the “nation of immigrants” ideal were the stuff of white nationalists like Richard Spencer and the website Stormfront.Trump and the Breitbart News Network — the right-wing, anti-immigration website Bannon ran before and after working in the White House — have changed all that. Immigration is extremely important to Trump’s base ― 40% of his voters cite it as one of the two most important issues facing the country, according to a HuffPost/YouGov poll taken last week. (Just 10 percent of Hillary Clinton voters put it in that category.) And Trump voters’ views on the subject are different from the majority of Americans: In the August HuffPost/YouGov poll, Trump supporters were split on whether the Lazarus poem’s message should still apply to immigration policy ― 39 percent said yes, 38 percent no, with 23 percent unsure. Among all respondents, the breakdown was 56 percent yes, 22 percent no, 23 percent unsure.In the same poll, 62 percent of Trump supporters said they favor a decrease in legal immigration, compared to just 35 percent of all Americans. Immigration issues were central to Trump’s campaign and have been one of the major battle lines of his presidency. He ran for office on a promise to build a wall on the southern border, suggested Mexican immigrants are rapists, and called at one point for banning all the world’s Muslims from even visiting the U.S. And he surrounded himself with advisers who see immigration as no less than an existential threat to the U.S. Before Jeff Sessions became Trump’s attorney general, he was known as one of the Senate’s fiercest immigration foes. (Sessions went on Bannon’s radio show in 2015 to offer praise for a 1924 immigration law that was designed to keep Jews, Africans, eastern and southern Europeans, Middle Easterners, and Asians from immigrating to the U.S.) Before becoming a top White House aide, Miller served as Sessions’ speechwriter. Michael Anton, who slammed diversity as “a source of weakness, tension and disunion” and called the U.S. “originally a nation of settlers,” “not a ‘nation of immigrants’” in essays published during the campaign, is now the spokesman for Trump’s National Security Council. And Bannon, of course, was until recently one of the president’s closest advisers. (Anton and Bannon didn’t respond to requests for comment.)These men were drawn together by common goals, and one issue was always at the fore. “The sacredness of mass immigration is the mystic chord that unites America’s ruling and intellectual classes,” Anton wrote in a pseudonymous essay last September that the New Yorker later declared “the most cogent argument for electing Donald Trump.” Trump and his clique set out to bust that consensus. “This is insane,” Anton wrote, referring to continued Republican (and non-Republican) support for “mass” immigration. “This is the mark of a party, a society, a country, a people, a civilization that wants to die. Trump, alone among candidates for high office in this or in the last seven (at least) cycles, has stood up to say: I want to live. I want my party to live. I want my country to live. I want my people to live. I want to end the insanity.”In office, Trump’s first major action was to ban travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. He has supported legislation to dramatically restrict legal immigration, moved to end protections for undocumented people brought to America as children (unless Congress intervenes), and threatened to shut down his own government if Congress does not fund his wall.Despite all this, Trump is disappointing parts of his base on immigration issues, argued William Gheen, the head of Americans for Legal Immigration, which favors reducing immigration to this country. By 44 percent to 30 percent, Trump voters said they do not want their representative in Congress to pass a new law to help undocumented young people covered by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, according to the September HuffPost/YouGov poll. Trump’s call on Congress to figure out a legislative solution to help the so-called Dreamers enraged supporters like Gheen, who believed his promises to immediately end DACA and strictly enforce existing immigration laws.“He’s losing base supporters,” Gheen said. “That’s not something the media could do to him, not something Democrats could do to him. Donald Trump himself is betraying the base on immigration issues.”Bannon was right to call Trump’s six-month reprieve for ending DACA a mistake, Gheen said. Trump “promised he was going to restore rules of the game and begin enforcing existing immigration laws,” Gheen said. “Now he’s calling for a form of amnesty for illegal immigrants. While this may fly with gazillionaire elites, it’s not flying with populist nationalist grassroots Trump harnessed to get what he wanted. I’m loyal to the Constitution, not Donald Trump. I do believe at this point Bannon and Miller and Jeff Sessions — from what I can tell, since I don’t know them personally — they appear to be true constitutionalists.”Trump isn’t giving the immigration restrictionists in his base everything they want. But he has made immigration restrictionism more central to his political appeal, his staffing decisions and his policy agenda than any of his recent predecessors. It’s part of what makes him, and his base, different. The press should take heed."
46,POLITICS,Remembering Our KKK Past,"Jane Dailey, ContributorAssociate Professor of History, University of Chicago",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/remembering-our-kkk-past_us_59b80179e4b027c149e2ccb3,A dark moment in American history offers lessons for the present.,2017-09-12,"Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Hugo Black, shown in his office on Feb. 23, 1966.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b80ce41c00003a0079e0cc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On August 11, 1921, Edwin Stephenson, a Methodist minister, shot and killed Father James Coyle on the rectory porch of St. Paul’s Catholic Church in Birmingham, Alabama. Earlier that day, Father Coyle had presided over the marriage of Stephenson’s eighteen-year-old daughter, Ruth, to native Puerto Rican Pedro Gussman, a 42-year-old wallpaper hanger. Independent-minded Ruth had been interested in Catholicism since adolescence; Coyle had baptized her into the Church some months before her marriage. When word of the wedding reached her father, he grabbed his gun and headed for St. Paul’s.Because Father Coyle was unarmed, Stephenson’s defense team could not plausibly assert self-defense, and needed to come up with some other justification for his action. It did. Lead lawyer and future Supreme Court justice Hugo L. Black argued that Stephenson had acted in a state of temporary insanity brought on by the marriage of his daughter to a “negro.”Pedro Gussman’s identity as a Negro came as news to him. Prior to the trial, he had always been regarded as white. He dated white women. He was registered to vote. Had Gussman been considered black, he and Ruth could not have acquired a marriage license, because marriage across the color line was strictly forbidden in Alabama. “No one has ever questioned my color until I became mixed up in this case,” he complained.By transforming Pedro Gussman from a tanned Puerto Rican into a “negro,” Hugo Black offered the jury, composed exclusively of white men, a credible basis to find Edwin Stephenson temporarily insane. Father Coyle had seduced Ruth Stephenson away from the true faith and her father’s rightful rule, and had then married her to a man whose religion and color marked him as inferior. Any self-respecting white man would blow a fuse under such circumstances. The jury voted to acquit. Hugo Black’s reputation grew. He joined the local chapter of the Ku Klux Klan, which paid Stephenson’s legal fees. Formally reconstituted at Stone Mountain, Georgia, in 1915 by white men inspired by the heroic portrayal of the Reconstruction-era Klan in the film Birth of a Nation, the Second Klan was not of the hooded-hicks-on-horseback variety. The resurgent KKK was strongest in the West and Midwest, and as common in urban as in rural areas. The 1920s Klan was rooted in WWI vigilance committees and is more accurately grouped with other postwar organizations like the American Legion than its Reconstruction antecedent. Two factors distinguished the resurgent Klan from other fraternal organizations of the era, however: its use of violence and its political influence.This new version of the Klan participated actively in politics as voters, organizers, and candidates. Militantly Protestant, the Klan was a vehicle for “Old Stock” Americans (those whose ancestors had arrived before the great waves of immigration after 1890) striving to reassert cultural dominance over an increasingly heterogeneous and secular society. Klansmen lived in a fractured and disorienting world. Their country, especially its cities, was swamped with clannish Jews and Catholics, who educated their children apart and voted together. Their wives were politically enfranchised and assertive, their sons were disrespectful, and their daughters ungovernable, especially in matters of sex and marriage. Skeptics derided their religion. The economy, and thus their livelihood, was unpredictable.At its peak in 1925, the Second Klan boasted a membership of more than 5 million, nearly all native white Protestants, many of whom were considered respectable members of their communities. The Klan’s causes — racial segregation, nativism, anti-communism, free enterprise, patriarchy, anti-Catholicism, anti-Semitism, Prohibition, and law and order — reflected its sense that everything was coming unglued.The Second Klan was a national phenomenon. The Klan dominated politics in Texas, Indiana, Oklahoma, and Colorado, and was a significant political force in many cities, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver, Atlanta, and Dallas. Oregon elected a Klansman governor in 1922. Its state legislature, in a swipe at parochial schools, passed a bill mandating all children to attend public schools, where Protestantism and patriotism were taught together. Klansmen resisted African American “incursion” into white neighborhoods, and clamored for racial segregation in the North. A Klan write-in candidate for mayor of Detroit, a city with a large African American population and a hub of organized labor, attracted more than one-third of the vote in 1924. Klan-backed candidates were elected to the U. S. Senate in six states. Edwin Stephenson’s lawyer Hugo Black was one of them.Although many Americans rolled their eyes at the spectacle of the Klan’s hooded marchers (40,000 strong outside the White House in 1926), the organization’s demand that control of the nation be returned to “old stock” Americans reflected widespread sentiment in the 1920s. Groups like the Anglo-Saxon League urged immigration restriction to limit the dilution of the Anglo-Saxon race by inferior Asian, African, and Eastern European bloodlines, arguing that “the idea of the great American melting pot, into which one can put the refuse of three continents and draw out good, sound American citizens... is simply and perilously false.”Congress responded to calls to limit immigration and passed the National Origins Act of 1924, which set national immigration quotas for each country at two percent of its existing total U.S. population based on the 1890 census: the last count before the mass influx of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe. This change in immigration policy was designed to ensure that descendants of early immigrants would forever outnumber the children of the new. The new law barred the entry of anyone from Asia, which was defined expansively to include India. “America must be kept American,” new President Calvin Coolidge declared when signing the law. It was this law that Congress replaced when it passed the Immigration Act of 1965, and to which the Trump administration would happily revert.After its national leader was convicted for murdering a white schoolteacher in 1925, the Second Klan declined. Membership in the Klan became a liability, particularly for politicians with national aspirations. In 1937, Franklin Roosevelt’s appointment of Hugo Black to the Supreme Court, where he became a stalwart liberal, was imperiled by his Klan background. In an 11-minute live radio address, Black apologized to Catholics but failed to mention African Americans or, indeed, Puerto Ricans.The post-WWI Klan was defined by its opposition to immigration and cultural diversity, by its insistence on Protestant, Anglo-Saxon supremacy, and by its racism and reactionary gender politics. The khaki-clad young white men in Charlottesville chanting “blood and soil” and “Jew will not replace us” trace their ideological roots back to the Klan of the 1920s and call to mind a dark moment in our nation’s past. So does the particular disaffection of many of Donald Trump’s strongest supporters, who long to “make America great again” by constraining immigration and subordinating Muslims, African Americans, gays, women, and transgender persons. The fact that this movement is not unprecedented makes it no less troubling. "

Federal agency questions about patients are raising concerns.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b85d721900003a005636cc.jpeg?cache=s3N5aPfsLy&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A federal anti-drug program has been requesting information about registered medical marijuana patients in several states where the drug is legal for medical purposes. Officials say they are collecting general demographic data for research, but the move has alarmed some state officials as well as those in favor of more progressive laws who cite the Trump administration’s mixed messages on marijuana use.Health officials in at least eight states have been contacted over the last few weeks by either a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area task force, established to help reduce trafficking in the U.S., or by Dale Quigley, deputy coordinator of the National Marijuana Initiative (NMI), an arm of HIDTA, HuffPost has found. There are 32 HIDTA task forces across the nation, all funded by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, known as the drug czar’s office.The federal program is seeking data on the age, gender and medical condition of registered patients, as well as the number of medical marijuana cards issued each year and the reasons for their authorization, according to numerous state health officials who spoke to HuffPost as well as emails sent to those state agencies and obtained by HuffPost.California and Nevada were contacted by NMI, while Oregon was contacted by a regional HIDTA task force. Both were seeking demographic data about the state’s registered medical marijuana cardholders. Additionally, the program contacted health officials in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maine and Vermont, The Boston Globe first reported last month, which HuffPost confirmed. HuffPost reached state health officials in 27 of the 29 states that have legalized marijuana for medical purposes, with no responses from New Hampshire, North Dakota or the District of Columbia.In emails sent to state health regulators, Quigley, a former drug cop in Colorado and a vocal opponent of marijuana legalization, says NMI is “doing comparative demographic research into states with medical provisions for marijuana and the use of a state-issued identification card.” Quigley is seeking information on patients issued medical marijuana cards “for the last 5 calendar years (2012 – 2016),” he wrote.Some states, including California, did not directly provide the data Quigley requested. Instead, officials pointed him to their public website, which gives aggregate general demographic data on ages and genders of medical marijuana patients. Other states, such as Nevada, provided Quigley with similar general public demographic data directly (data that is also available on its public website), still not handing over the more specific information being requested. Some states, including Connecticut, had not yet responded to Quigley, but officials there said that they intend to, but only with public information. Oregon health officials said they had not been contacted by Quigley but instead were contacted by an unidentified analyst at the Oregon-Idaho HIDTA. State officials directed him to their website with all publicly available data on their medical marijuana program. They also instructed him to submit a public records request for any other data that he could not find. Oregon officials said they had not received any public record requests from HIDTA. In an interview with HuffPost, NMI coordinator Ed Shemelya, said that the group had “reached out” to all 29 states that have legalized medical marijuana. He added that the group has been able to obtain most of the information it needed from the state’s websites and insisted that NMI had not sought specific patient information.Shemelya explained that the group is seeking the information as part of an effort to examine usage rates in states that have made medical marijuana legal as well as in states that continue to prohibit its medical use. It is engaging in the research, Shemelya says, as “part of our mission to examine the impacts of medical and recreational marijuana.” When asked if the research had any link to a Department of Justice task force formed in February by U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a staunch marijuana opponent, to review federal enforcement of marijuana laws, among several other issues, Shemelya said, “Absolutely not.”“The intent is to provide factual information about the consequences of medical marijuana, and we will provide this to general public via our website,” Shemelya said. “How it is used after that I cannot answer. However, it is not being done for the purpose of guiding or shaping federal policy on marijuana. We are merely fulfilling our mission of educating folks on the impacts of medical and recreational marijuana.”But some state officials and advocates for marijuana law reforms voiced concern about the request largely because it is being made by an agency with an anti-drug mission that is overseen by the drug czar’s office, which is legislatively prohibited from publicly supporting the legalization of marijuana. The federal program is also part of an administration that has voiced a willingness to roll back marijuana guidance set by the Obama administration that urged federal prosecutors to refrain from targeting state-legal marijuana operations. While marijuana remains illegal under federal law, the Obama-era guidance has allowed for state marijuana regulation to take shape, and there’s concern that it could be reversed or altered in ways that could harm patients and cripple thriving industries.“The federal agency and task forces requesting this data have a long and dubious history of misleading the public about marijuana and advocating against state-level medical marijuana laws,” Mason Tvert, vice president of public relations and communications at VS Strategies, told HuffPost. VS Strategies, a communications and government relations firm based in Denver, is focused on marijuana policy and was instrumental in the passage of Colorado’s recreational marijuana ballot measure. “It is not surprising that the state officials who have been entrusted with administering these programs and protecting patients’ rights have some qualms about handing over their data.” Tvert also noted the irony of a federal agency asking state officials to facilitate their research and provide insights into their state programs, as federal agencies spent decades blocking marijuana research that could have informed state officials as they developed their medical marijuana programs.“Apparently there is a lot the federal government could learn from the states, and hopefully it will opt to work with them rather than against them,” Tvert said. “The best path forward would be one in which patients’ privacy is protected, states’ rights are respected and federal priorities are reflected.” Tom Angell, chairman of drug policy reform group Marijuana Majority, said that in general he thinks it’s a good idea to track and report on public health outcomes, as long as no individually identifying patient information is compromised. But, Angell said, “with the anti-marijuana rhetoric coming from the Trump administration’s Department of Justice, and Quigley’s own past comments on the issue, you do have to wonder what the true motivation is here.”Angell said he’s concerned about the request and hopes that states that do hand over data are careful it “cannot be used to support any ‘Reefer Madness’-induced enforcement efforts that Jeff Sessions may wish to launch.”While Sessions’ task force has forwarded its recommendations on federal marijuana policy, he hasn’t disclosed what those are. However, The Associated Press reported last month that the task force largely reiterated the Justice Department’s current policy on marijuana and has not pushed for a crackdown.National support for marijuana legalization has risen dramatically in recent years to historic highs. More than 90 percent of Americans support allowing adults to use marijuana for medical purposes if their doctor prescribes it, according to a Quinnipiac poll this year."
48,POLITICS,House Conservatives Were Plotting Against Paul Ryan. Then Came Trump's Surprise.,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-coup-freedom-caucus_us_59b75e13e4b027c149e1c8b0,The biggest winner in the Democrats' debt-ceiling deal could end up being the GOP speaker.,2017-09-12,"House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) is facing pressure from the leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, who believes Ryan's leadership has left Republicans with little leverage for a December spending deal.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b75eb41c0000240079df4a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― House Speaker Paul Ryan’s position in the GOP conference appears a little more secure after President Donald Trump, not Republican leaders in Congress, struck a deal last week with Democrats to keep the government funded and raise the debt ceiling. But rather than actually solidifying Ryan’s position, the agreement may only have bought the speaker some time.“President Trump making a deal on a short-term spending item takes pressure off of the speaker from a performance standpoint,” House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told HuffPost on Monday, “but adds additional pressure on GOP leadership overall.”Meadows was the member who led the charge in 2015 against former House Speaker John Boehner, offering a proposal just before the August recess to force him out as speaker, hardening opposition that ultimately led the Ohio Republican to step down. Now Meadows seems to be posturing against Ryan, pointing out that the Wisconsin Republican’s leadership has left Republicans with little leverage for a December spending deal and hardly any accomplishments.The chatter that Meadows might be planning something intensified last week after Axios reported that he met with Breitbart News Executive Chairman Steve Bannon and its Washington political editor, Matthew Boyle, to discuss alternatives to the current GOP leadership team. The Washington Post also reported last week that Meadows and former Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) were gauging whether former Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) or former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) might be interested in leading House Republicans, though that talk might be more subterfuge than reality. One source familiar with discussions told HuffPost that Meadows and Jordan were more interested in making Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) the speaker, displacing Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and making either Jordan or Meadows the majority leader.Those desires might be just as fanciful as anointing someone outside of Congress as speaker, however, as there’s no indication Scalise ― who was wounded in June by a gunman who attacked Republicans during a congressional baseball game practice ― would try to leapfrog McCarthy or cooperate in a plot to take out Ryan. Ryan’s and McCarthy’s offices declined to comment, but Scalise’s communications director, Chris Bond, told HuffPost that these sorts of palace intrigue stories may make for good headlines but they’re rarely based in reality. “Right now Congressman Scalise is focused on completing his inpatient rehabilitation so he can return to the Capitol and continue serving as majority whip, a job he loves,” Bond said. Making this plot even more far-fetched, the source familiar with the discussions indicated that part of the conservative plan to take out McCarthy would be to require anyone who seeks the speakership to leave their current leadership position to seek a new spot ― something McCarthy might not do and GOP conference rules might not require.Either way, Meadows swears there is no formal plan to take out the speaker right now. He said any discussions that may have taken place were so premature that they seemed to have excluded a number of conservative agitators who almost certainly would be involved in an actual plot to force out Ryan.“I don’t know that there’s any substantial conversations about leadership races that are transpiring right now,” Meadows said Monday. And conversations with a number of conservative lawmakers over the last week generally seem to back that up.But even as Meadows dismissed the talk that there could be an effort to ditch Ryan, the very next thing he said was “there’s a real frustration that nothing’s getting done.”Meadows noted that Republicans had not yet delivered on health care, a border wall or tax reform. And he suggested the deal cut between Trump and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was only buying Ryan time before Republicans would have to come up with something for a longer-term spending deal.“If our leadership waits until December to address debt ceiling, funding the government and everything else, it will not bode well for them,” Meadows said.Although the Freedom Caucus largely voted against the deal to raise the debt ceiling and extend government funding until December, it has tried to avoid blaming Trump for the deal, arguing instead ― somewhat miraculously ― that Trump had to make the deal because Ryan left him no choice.That was the argument Jordan made repeatedly last week and on the Sunday talk shows, noting that Republicans went home without a debt ceiling plan for the longest non-election-year August recess in more than a decade. Jordan also said no one was talking about “changing the leadership.”Meadows has also refused to acknowledge any sort of potential coup, though his answers have had perhaps a little more wiggle room. (Last week, before news of Trump’s deal had broken, Meadows told HuffPost that he knew of no “meaningful” leadership discussions.)Meadows also denied Monday that he has any interest in being speaker or majority leader, and he said he wasn’t looking for any candidate to take on the speaker.“The only time I ever look for a candidate is a few months before Jan. 3 of every year,” Meadows said, referring to the biennial speaker election on the first day of Congress.“At this point, we’ve got our leadership people in place. It is my hope and prayer that they perform, that they actually get something across the finish line.”Meadows still thinks Republicans can get tax reform done this year, and he suggested accomplishing that goal would be a key toward keeping the president and other House Republicans satisfied with leadership. But Meadows also noted that Republicans ― in the House, Senate and White House ― haven’t agreed on even the broadest strokes.Still, when you talk to Republicans about Ryan’s position in the conference, it’s clear there’s a basic level of dissatisfaction. It’s just one that perhaps hasn’t spread very deep into the rest of the GOP conference.For instance, Freedom Caucus member Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) repeatedly refused to say last week whether he still supports Ryan as speaker, and Louie Gohmert (R-Texas), who noted that he’s been frustrated with Ryan “for some time,” refused to say last week whether he would vote for a “motion to vacate the chair,” a parliamentary proposal that would remove Ryan as speaker. But other members, some of them in the Freedom Caucus, didn’t even feel as if frustration with Ryan was that high now. (Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan said he didn’t think the frustration was “particularly high” compared with recent months.) Other members noted that dissatisfaction with the speaker hadn’t quite reached their constituents the same way it had at the end of Boehner’s tenure.And yet Ryan and his allies do seem to be preparing for war. Over the weekend, The Wall Street Journal ran an editorial daring Meadows to challenge Ryan, and lawmakers friendly with the speaker noted how Trump’s deal had already undercut Freedom Caucus leaders, with the president taking the blame for a bad deal for Republicans, not Ryan. One senior GOP aide told HuffPost that no deals or endorsements were going to earn the Freedom Caucus a spot in leadership. “If these guys want more influence, they should focus on winning over and aligning with someone currently in one of the many leadership spots. That will take compromise, and I don’t know that these guys know how to do that,” the aide said.The Freedom Caucus’ power all along, however, has been as a potential spoiler to Republican policies the group doesn’t deem sufficiently conservative. They may not have 218 votes to elect one of their own as speaker. They may not even have a majority of the GOP conference to win in a closed-door race for majority leader. But with roughly three dozen members in their ranks, and a few other sympathetic to their causes who aren’t in the group, they may have the roughly two dozen votes to remove a speaker ― or prevent anyone else from taking the job without their sign-off.One conservative lawmaker noted last week how Ryan had told the GOP conference on Wednesday that the next few months would define the future of the nation and the Republican Party. “He’s absolutely right about that,” the lawmaker said. “It also could define his future.”"
49,GREEN,"Ahead Of Hurricane Irma, Miami Detained Homeless People Against Their Will",Travis Waldron and Sebastian Murdock,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/miami-detains-homeless-irma_us_59b7f7e8e4b031cc65ccf70b,Authorities took the rare and controversial step to protect some people from the storm.,2017-09-12,The Miami skyline is seen above a boat that went ashore after the passing of Hurricane Irma.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b7fa4c1c0000240079e06f.jpeg?cache=UXYayEUf9F&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"MIAMI ― As Hurricane Irma rapidly approached Florida’s southern coast, Ron Book, the chairman of the Miami-Dade County Homeless Trust, and the Miami-Dade Police Department made an unprecedented decision: They chose to detain homeless people ― some against their will ― to protect them from the storm.The Baker Act ― the informal name given to Florida’s Mental Health Act of 1971 ― allows police and government officials to involuntarily detain individuals who may have a mental illness or could pose a significant threat to themselves or others. The law requires “clear and convincing evidence” that individuals detained under it are in danger.It is rarely used, in part because of the legal and constitutional concerns it raises, and Miami had never before invoked it ahead of a hurricane. But Irma was different. Forecasters warned that it was the most powerful hurricane to ever form in the Atlantic Ocean, and it carried the potential to devastate the Miami coast. Book, who has led the homeless trust for more than a decade, felt he had no choice.“I’m not going to be like Houston’s mayor, telling people to write their Social Security numbers on their arms with a Sharpie,” Book told HuffPost on Monday, after the worst of Irma had passed through Miami. “My responsibility is to do everything I can to save the lives of the people we’re charged with getting off the streets.”Miami-Dade police ultimately used the Baker Act to arrest six people in the days before Irma began to batter the south Florida coast Saturday night and into Sunday morning, Book told HuffPost. Twelve others, he said, were in handcuffs before ultimately agreeing to go willingly to one of the 42 shelters the county had opened to house Irma evacuees.That Miami invoked the Baker Act is a sign of how desperate the situation felt as Irma approached, and how far the city and its officials were willing to go in an effort to protect Miami’s homeless population from Irma’s wrath. But that it needed to be used may also point to a need to review how states and cities help their homeless residents ahead of natural disasters like Hurricane Irma.The Homeless Trust assisted police in seeking out homeless individuals through Friday night, Book said. Even after that, Miami-Dade police continued to sweep the streets until Sunday afternoon, when the county pulled patrols off the streets for safety reasons. Overall, police, nonprofit groups and mental health professionals succeeded in taking more than 500 homeless people to shelters, Book said. But Miami-Dade County had more than 1,100 people sleeping on the streets in August, the Homeless Trust found as part of annual count of the city’s homeless population, meaning many people likely remained on the streets throughout the storm. “Were there 600 left on the streets? I don’t know,” Book said. “But there were a lot we left behind, a lot we couldn’t get to or just ran out of time.”In all likelihood, the number wasn’t that high, as some were likely able to seek out shelters on their own in the days before the storm. North of Miami, for instance, a homeless man on Ft. Lauderdale Beach said Wednesday that he would make his way to the nearest shelter ahead of the storm, rather than riding it out in a vacant building as he had before. Homeless people with prior criminal records were also given shelter from the massive storm. Carl Farmer, a 53-year-old man who is homeless and lives in Hallandale, was released from prison in February after serving a two year sentence for manslaughter. During the 2015 incident, Farmer fatally punched a man he was drinking with after the man “kicked me in the nuts,” he told HuffPost. Farmer said he is part of a prison-monitoring program, and officers came to pick him up by the sea wall where he spends his time fishing for his food.“Two cops came by the sea wall and picked me up,” Farmer said. “They said, ‘I’m gonna save your life right now, you comin’ or what?’ They told me to put my bike in the back of their SUV and that they’d take me to a shelter.”He said four officers at the shelter in Miramar knew him. Others at the shelter who spoke to Farmer, and were made aware of his criminal history, seemed unconcerned with his presence. In Miami, the six individuals arrested under the Baker Act were taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital for evaluations, Book said. The law allows them to remain in custody for 72 hours, while any further detention would require a court order in most circumstances. Miami-Dade courts were closed on Monday, and it was unclear whether the six detained individuals had been released as of Monday afternoon, Book said.Public defenders and civil rights advocates have raised concerns about the Baker Act and its potential to lead to rights violations for individuals detained under it. Some legal advocates said invoking the Baker Act points to an overall lack of long-term planning in helping the homeless during times of crisis. The federal government recommends procedures for disaster preparation that are “inclusive” of homeless people and groups that work with them. Use of the Baker Act is “indicative of a broader problem in not including homeless people in our broader disaster relief and evacuation plans,” said Kirsten Anderson, the litigation director at Southern Legal Counsel, a Gainesville, Florida-based nonprofit that defends the rights of the homeless and other vulnerable populations. “We have a high homeless population in Florida. They have very unique disaster needs, and there are unique obstacles faced by those people in planning for disasters. Communities need to plan for those needs. Clearly we need other tools in the tool box.”Book, however, said he felt its unprecedented invocation in Miami was necessary as a last-ditch effort to protect people who could not protect themselves from a storm of historic strength. He stressed that his organization had longstanding contacts with most of the homeless people it sought out in the days before the storm. Mental health professionals, meanwhile, accompanied police in carrying out the sweeps, according to the Associated Press.“I believe use of the Baker Act was not only the right thing to do, but was the humanitarian thing to do,” he said. “People would have died had we not been as aggressive as we were out there. And we may yet find loss of life.”Book’s only regret, he said, was that his organization ran out of time to take even more homeless people to area-wide shelters. “There were others we could have gotten to,” Book said. “But we learned a lot. There’s a lot we’ll do better next time there is a storm of this magnitude approaching our area, and I would urge other communities to use this as a tool.”“It’s about saving lives,” he said. “I’d absolutely do it again.”"

But that it needed to be used may also point to a need to review how states and cities help their homeless residents ahead of natural disasters like Hurricane Irma.The Homeless Trust assisted police in seeking out homeless individuals through Friday night, Book said. Even after that, Miami-Dade police continued to sweep the streets until Sunday afternoon, when the county pulled patrols off the streets for safety reasons. Overall, police, nonprofit groups and mental health professionals succeeded in taking more than 500 homeless people to shelters, Book said. But Miami-Dade County had more than 1,100 people sleeping on the streets in August, the Homeless Trust found as part of annual count of the city’s homeless population, meaning many people likely remained on the streets throughout the storm. “Were there 600 left on the streets? I don’t know,” Book said. “But there were a lot we left behind, a lot we couldn’t get to or just ran out of time.”In all likelihood, the number wasn’t that high, as some were likely able to seek out shelters on their own in the days before the storm. North of Miami, for instance, a homeless man on Ft. Lauderdale Beach said Wednesday that he would make his way to the nearest shelter ahead of the storm, rather than riding it out in a vacant building as he had before. Homeless people with prior criminal records were also given shelter from the massive storm. Carl Farmer, a 53-year-old man who is homeless and lives in Hallandale, was released from prison in February after serving a two year sentence for manslaughter. During the 2015 incident, Farmer fatally punched a man he was drinking with after the man “kicked me in the nuts,” he told HuffPost. Farmer said he is part of a prison-monitoring program, and officers came to pick him up by the sea wall where he spends his time fishing for his food.“Two cops came by the sea wall and picked me up,” Farmer said. “They said, ‘I’m gonna save your life right now, you comin’ or what?’ They told me to put my bike in the back of their SUV and that they’d take me to a shelter.”He said four officers at the shelter in Miramar knew him. Others at the shelter who spoke to Farmer, and were made aware of his criminal history, seemed unconcerned with his presence. In Miami, the six individuals arrested under the Baker Act were taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital for evaluations, Book said. The law allows them to remain in custody for 72 hours, while any further detention would require a court order in most circumstances. Miami-Dade courts were closed on Monday, and it was unclear whether the six detained individuals had been released as of Monday afternoon, Book said.Public defenders and civil rights advocates have raised concerns about the Baker Act and its potential to lead to rights violations for individuals detained under it. Some legal advocates said invoking the Baker Act points to an overall lack of long-term planning in helping the homeless during times of crisis. The federal government recommends procedures for disaster preparation that are “inclusive” of homeless people and groups that work with them. Use of the Baker Act is “indicative of a broader problem in not including homeless people in our broader disaster relief and evacuation plans,” said Kirsten Anderson, the litigation director at Southern Legal Counsel, a Gainesville, Florida-based nonprofit that defends the rights of the homeless and other vulnerable populations. “We have a high homeless population in Florida. They have very unique disaster needs, and there are unique obstacles faced by those people in planning for disasters. Communities need to plan for those needs. Clearly we need other tools in the tool box.”Book, however, said he felt its unprecedented invocation in Miami was necessary as a last-ditch effort to protect people who could not protect themselves from a storm of historic strength. He stressed that his organization had longstanding contacts with most of the homeless people it sought out in the days before the storm. Mental health professionals, meanwhile, accompanied police in carrying out the sweeps, according to the Associated Press.“I believe use of the Baker Act was not only the right thing to do, but was the humanitarian thing to do,” he said. “People would have died had we not been as aggressive as we were out there. And we may yet find loss of life.”Book’s only regret, he said, was that his organization ran out of time to take even more homeless people to area-wide shelters. “There were others we could have gotten to,” Book said. “But we learned a lot. There’s a lot we’ll do better next time there is a storm of this magnitude approaching our area, and I would urge other communities to use this as a tool.”“It’s about saving lives,” he said. “I’d absolutely do it again.”"
51,IMPACT,Why This Artist Hangs His Paintings On Abandoned Buildings,Catharine Smith,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/st-louis-paintings-abandoned-houses_us_59a58a39e4b050afa90cdf38,"His home city of St. Louis has a huge number of rundown, uninhabited buildings.",2017-09-12,The St. Louis nonprofit Better Family Life commissioned local artist Chris Green to paint murals of prominent African-Americans and post them on blighted buildings.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59a5941d1e00002700c5fcf0.jpeg?cache=RZQMhOzY1K&ops=crop_2_29_1198_684%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"The population of St. Louis has fallen dramatically in the last few decades. At its peak in 1950, the so-called “Gateway to the West” was home to 850,000 ― now its residents number less than half that.As people moved away, thousands of empty houses remained. Until recently, the city was short on cash and plans for managing all the abandoned properties, so they’d sit and crumble, blighting otherwise vibrant communities. That’s where local artist Chris Green and nonprofit Better Family Life come in. The community development organization commissions Green to paint portraits of prominent African-Americans, many of them St. Louisans, for a mural series called “Beyond the Walls.” Then they nail the finished pictures onto the boarded-up doors and windows of dilapidated buildings, in an attempt to beautify vacant structures and instill a new sense of local pride.“Buildings that were once a source of negative esteem become a source of positive energy,” James Clark, vice president of community outreach at Better Family Life, told HuffPost. “I think this project will be a great educational piece of experience for youngsters,” Green said of his art in a segment for local channel HEC-TV.His portrait subjects range from renowned jazz trumpeter Miles Davis and singer Tina Turner, to St. Louis radio news anchor and former TV host Carol Daniel, to local activists and business leaders.Green completed his first series of portraits for the “Beyond the Walls” project in 2005. Better Family Life then commissioned him for two more rounds of portraits, the most recent of which was this year.Green’s work is on display in the neighborhoods of Academy and Wells/Goodfellow, Clark told HuffPost.Similar projects have popped up on abandoned buildings in cities around the country recently, including Los Angeles and Flint, Michigan, notes the Nonprofit Quarterly. In St. Louis, the project is a short-term fix for a problem that locals want solved.“The murals are better than the ugly boarded up houses, but to be honest, I would much prefer the city to tear them all down and build better housing or rehab them and sell them to members of the same community,” resident Kim Boyd told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch last year.St. Louis has plans to demolish about 1,000 abandoned buildings over the next few years. The city has partnered with the Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District on a $13.5 million program to knock down hundreds of derelict buildings. Prior to this partnership, the city could demolish only 200 buildings a year, reports local media outlet KSDK. Clark told HuffPost that the murals are just one part of a Better Family Life’s larger social service programs in St. Louis, which include centers to promote de-escalation of gun violence, and door-to-door visits from trained outreach specialists in high-crime neighborhoods. “We’ve got to get surgical,” Clark told The Trace, a news site devoted to tracking gun violence, earlier this year. “We’ve got to look at the neighborhoods where crime and violence are more prevalent, and we’ve got to have a boots-on-the-ground approach, door-to-door, direct neighborhood engagement.”"

Police announced they used the tool for the first time on Sunday at a Naval Association Parade in central London, and that it’s likely to become a fixture at heavily populated events in the city.The police said they also had installed vehicle mitigation barriers on nine bridges and at several other sites around the city. The Talon is the latest example of how cities are attempting to prevent vehicular terror attacks, which have killed over 100 people across Europe in recent years. The attacks have increased security concerns around large gatherings and tourist locations in many cities, but have proven hard to stop.Two ramming attacks in Spain last month, one of which targeted a popular boulevard in Barcelona, killed 13 people and injured dozens of others. Several attackers careened a van into people on London Bridge in June, before going on a stabbing spree in the tourist hub of Borough Market. The self-described Islamic State claimed responsibility for both incidents, along with other vehicular attacks in cities including Berlin, Stockholm, and Nice, France.ISIS is not the only group to use vehicles for terror attacks. Palestinian attackers have carried out car rammings in Israel for years, and more recently far-right extremists in Britain and the United States have used vehicles for violent purposes.At a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia last month, a man killed one person and injured 19 others by ramming his car into anti-racist demonstrators. A far-right extremist in London also killed one person and injured 11 others in June when he drove a van into a crowd of people outside of a mosque.On Sunday in Vancouver, Washington, one man was arrested after attempting to drive into a crowd of anti-fascist protesters.Authorities have struggled to find ways to prevent vehicular terror attacks, which have long been promoted by extremist groups as a means for supporters to commit mayhem without needing any direct support from a terror organization. Since at least 2014, ISIS propaganda has urged its followers to take it upon themselves to use vehicles to target “disbelievers.”Many cities have erected security bollards to guard against such attacks in high traffic areas, such as New York’s Times Square, but surrounding every street and event with barriers is not a viable solution. Following a truck attack on a Christmas market in Berlin, the city’s police chief, Klaus Kandt, told reporters that defending against vehicles was difficult because the number of soft targets is unlimited."

Not really.It’s not a hurricane on Florida’s east coast. I knew it would not be one for a single reason: You can hear a hurricane when it’s coming for you. There’s no sound like it. It’s a sorrowful rumbling very high in the air. It’s spooky, anguished, unyielding, keening, unending. When you hear it you might be out running in a stiff breeze, you might be completing a last chore, walking your wary dog, or tying down you outdoor furniture. It’s hard to notice when it starts; harder still to remember the sky without it once it begins. Hearing it, you understand that there’s a limit to the period of normalcy ahead. Your time is up.You know to stay calm for distant family, cheerful for friends, helpful and optimistic with neighbors but you have to keep moving, keeping working while you smile and chat―minutes are passing. You have to gather your wits and your resources because your hours in the real world are to be few. Soon you will enter the dream world of STORM and there will be little else while it rages, beats, and terrorizes. A hurricane is a torturous, wicked creature at best but it’s also unforgettable, large, and important as it destroys a world of petty things.But those memories will not be revisited tonight.Irma’s eye was on our latitude at eight this evening. Inside my shuttered house, the storm expresses itself as sound. Here, Irma is a tropical storm with some dangerous tornados driving winds that hoot like owls. Trees are thrashing, their branches banging together, beating bough on bough, breaking each other to twigs and green confetti with a violence that is loud.Two large limbs have crashed down from the hundred-year-old ficus in front of my house. Further down the street the road is blocked by a fallen tree. A garbage can blew noisily down the street and a broken shutter cartwheeled as I stepped out to look.To my unending gratitude, this is relatively nothing. It’s much less than the damage that is expected in Tampa and St. Petersburg but, even there, Irma will likely fall to a Category 2 hurricane from the Cat 4 that it was when it hit Key West this morning. Anyone on the mainland must feel the reprieve.The power is out and my internet is down. Probably a few million people are in the same boat―same dark.The storm is passing. It’s been thrilling here, invigorating. Even saying that makes me feel guilty when I think of Houston but there is no comparison. In Florida, the earth shed some skin. In Texas, the sky fell and kept falling as the water rose.Now the weather here, though still restless, is passing northwards. I showered at midnight―outdoors, as I always do. Living in Florida, you feel an obligation to observe the environment and its changes: flowers, fruit, creatures, insects. My shower―planted, decorated, and completely private―puts me in touch with the larger world. No politics; no squabbles. Steam rises on the coldest days, causing rainbows. Cool sluices down when the day is hot. The changing weather makes sure I never take this planet for granted.Just because Irma is not a hurricane here does not mean I don’t respect its power. Tonight It feels good to be alive―washing by lantern light; the warm wind and the hot water; the intermittent, fat drops of rain; my orchids bobbing their blossoms on the wall; the boldest frogs emerging to boast of our survival; the smooth pebbles under my feet; and the stars hidden by the clouds above. Tonight a hurricane shows mercy."

At least 10 members of a tribe in this region were reportedly killed by gold miners last month.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b61a721700001f00f523a7.jpeg?cache=Ycf0CNMWz6&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"At least 10 members of an uncontacted tribe in Brazil’s Amazon Basin were allegedly killed last month by illegal gold miners, according to Survival International. The organization, which advocates for indigenous rights, said the massacre included women and children and may have wiped out one-fifth of the tribe. Members of the tribe were gathering eggs along a river in the Javari Valley, in the country’s remote west, when they came across the miners, The New York Times reported. The miners later boasted about the slaughter at a bar in the nearest town and showed off a hand-carved paddle they claimed to have stolen as a trophy.“It was crude bar talk,” Leila Silvia Burger Sotto-Maior, Funai’s coordinator for uncontacted and recently contacted tribes, told the Times. “They even bragged about cutting up the bodies and throwing them in the river.”Funai is Brazil’s agency for indigenous affairs, and its budget was recently cut under Brazilian President Michel Temer. Survival International described Temer’s government as “fiercely anti-Indian, and has close ties to the country’s powerful and anti-indigenous agribusiness lobby.”Survival International called the attack “genocidal” and said Temer and his government bore “heavy responsibility” for it. According to Stephen Corry, Survival International’s director: “The slashing of Funai’s funds has left dozens of uncontacted tribes defenseless against thousands of invaders ― gold miners, ranchers and loggers ― who are desperate to steal and ransack their lands. All these tribes should have had their lands properly recognized and protected years ago ― the government’s open support for those who want to open up indigenous territories is utterly shameful, and is setting indigenous rights in Brazil back decades.”At least two other tribes in the region have seen their land invaded and are now surrounded by ranchers and others, Survival International reported.Adelson Kora Kanamari, leader of the Warikama Djapar tribe, told the Amazon Real portal that the situation for indigenous people in the region was “very critical” and that 18 to 21 people have been killed in attacks, AFP reported.“The invaders are landowners, hunters, miners,” Kanamari said. “Many [indigenous] are being killed in isolation, but we don’t know the exact dates or number of deaths.”"

Before coming to LaGrange College, I worked as a researcher for a consulting firm that was contracted out to the Pentagon. Even after I arrived at LaGrange College, I continued to work for them through that fateful day.It was very emotional standing outside the Pentagon weeks later, the building clearly hit, and survivors feeling that familiar guilt of “why them… and why me.” I have pictures, if there are any conspiracy theorists out there who claim it was a hoax. It must have been like Pearl Harbor.Angry folks look for someone to blame. And Islam is an easy target. Al-Qaeda terrorists came from Saudi Arabia Egypt, UAE, Lebanon… our allies in some kind of blowback. It all gets kind of complicated. Targeting a different religion is easy, though.But something in me stopped. I remembered a Christian comic book I got when I was a kid, possibly drawn by Marvel artists. It was about Pearl Harbor too, and my grandfather fought in World War II. It was called “Attack!”It told the story of Captain Mitsuo Fuchida, the leader of the air assault on Pearl Harbor. He was a national hero for this and other attacks but was wounded at the Battle of Midway and knocked out of flight duty. As a staff officer, he joined others to fly to Hiroshima to assess the immediate bomb damage at Ground Zero. He was the only one on that mission to survive.After the war, he met Staff Sergeant Jacob DeShazer, who enlisted right after Pearl Harbor “to get even with those Japs!” DeShazer flew with Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle’s bombing raid, until his plane ran out of gas. Three fellow crewmen were executed for their bomb attack, and another starved to death in prison. He was almost completely consumed with rage against his captors.Then a guard gave DeShazer a Bible. It changed his life. He read it, and prayed all the time, even while being beaten. He had been liberated from his POW camp, patched up by nurses, and returned with his wife to be a Methodist Missionary in Japan for more than 30 years. Fuchida also learned that his flying buddy was saved and treated by an American nurse (Peggy Covell), whose missionary parents were beheaded by Japanese forces during WWII. DeShazer’s story and Covell’s kindness converted Fuchida to Christianity, and the Japanese pilot also became a missionary. DeShazer built a church in the town he bombed.I thought to myself that if these three could get past hatreds from World War II, relying on Christianity, couldn’t I do the same after 9/11? I’ll always be a Christian, of course, but couldn’t I do something to build ties with Muslims, even as inciting hatred seemed much easier (and less Christian)? I sought to learn more about Islam and the importance key Christian figures play in it. I got to meet, and be the guest, of followers of a liberal Muslim cleric from Turkey, where I learned that not all Muslims have the same beliefs. He has taken out expensive ads to denounce 9/11 hijackers and Charlie Hebdo terrorists, pointing out how these attackers violate Islam with their deeds.I also returned to my old neighborhood on one of my trips back to Washington, D.C., where I learned how several neighbors (an NRA couple, a retired U.S. Marine, and an ex-football player) banded together to protect a fellow neighbor and friend, a Muslim originally from Yemen, who was convinced that he and his wife and child would be slaughtered on 9/11. Such kindness prompted the Yemeni to display a giant American flag outside his apartment, in gratitude to his protectors. It seems others displayed Christian kindness, whatever their thoughts were on 9/11.It’s easy to hate. It’s harder to do what’s called for in the Gospel of Matthew, Chapter 5, Verse 44. “But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you.” It’s what we are called to do on 9/11, and every 9/11 since.John A.

60,SPORTS,"Creating A Culture Of Concussion Safety Requires Teamwork All Season Long, Not Just One Day","Brooke de Lench, ContributorExecutive Director: MomsTeam Institute, Inc, Producer: The Sma...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/creating-a-culture-of-concussion-safety-requires-teamwork_us_59b6abefe4b0e4419674c362,"“If I can get up and walk away from it, yeah, I’ll probably keep playing,” one player said.",2017-09-11,<p>Football players-only meeting at the beginning of pre-season for Smart Teams documentary.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b6af4a1700003d00f524b9.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If your child plays a contact or collision sport, whether at the youth, middle school or high school level, chances are they will suffer a concussion at some point in their athletic career. How quickly they recover may depend on how soon after injury – if at all – their concussion is identified so they can be removed from practice or game action. The problem is that concussion signs – still the best way to identify a concussion – are difficult to spot, and athletes often hide their symptoms. The consequences of such unreported and undiagnosed concussions range from a longer recovery up to and including, in rare cases, catastrophic injury and death.One way to improve the chances that an athlete’s brain injury is identified is for teams to employ a “buddy” system in which team members are assigned to watch for signs of concussion in designated teammates and, if they spot signs, or if their teammates tell them they are experiencing symptoms, are encouraged or required to immediately report the possible injury to the athletic trainer or the coach.While I had been advocating the use of a buddy system for many years in every sport, it was not until five years ago, during the taping of our PBS documentary, “The Smartest Team: Making Football Safer,” in Newcastle, Oklahoma that I began to truly appreciate not just how culturally entrenched was an athlete’s reluctance to self-report concussion symptoms but also the part a buddy system could play in changing that culture.At a players-only meeting at the beginning of pre-season, and in interviewing athletes in small group and one-on-one, nearly every football player I spoke to freely admitted that they would not self-report concussion symptoms.“If I can get up and walk away from it, yeah, I’ll probably keep playing,” one said.“You see some dots and they go away ... so you just keep playing through it. It’s my senior year,” said another.“As long as I can still see and keep my balance, as long as I’m not feeling dizzy, head injuries are all right,” acknowledged a third.Typical was what one player told me: “There was a time that I’ve gotten a concussion. I didn’t think much of it, you know, just a headache, move on with it, keep playing. ... Got hit pretty hard, helmet to helmet, couldn’t see, saw stars everywhere, just went back on the field, started playing again. Didn’t need to tell anyone. I mean it’s not like I was laying down, couldn’t get up or anything. But I thought I was fine.”(He wasn’t, of course, and should have told someone and removed himself, or been removed, from the game)My anecdotal experience in Newcastle was that instituting a buddy system – not just players watching teammates but cheerleaders keeping an eye out for players showing signs of concussion – helped, although it’s hard to say how much. One of the players recounted how he had noticed a teammate who seemed really “out of it” at practice one day. When he told the coach, his teammate “got really mad.” But he said he was undeterred, because he “knew it was going to help [his teammate] in the long run.”Another player told me that, “As far as the buddy system goes, I know that we need to keep each other’s backs, like me and Justin have each other’s backs as far as like, if I get a concussion or he had gotten a concussion, then you know, make sure he’s OK. If he’s out of it, you know, can’t answer simple questions, go alert the coaches. He got mad at me, but I learned it was the right thing to do.”Given my experience in Newcastle, I was not surprised when, three years later, a 2015 study suggested that a buddy system, while it does not remove the need for honest self-reporting by athletes themselves or place final responsibility on teammates for each other’s health behaviors, may be an important step towards creating a culture of concussion safety on sports teams.What I learned from working with the Newcastle team, and with youth football programs across the country over the years is that traditional concussion education in which athletes, coaches, and parents are taught the signs and symptoms of concussion, and the health risks of concussion and repetitive head trauma, isn’t working to change the concussion reporting behavior of athletes. Between 40 and 60 percent of all concussions ― and a much higher percentage of so-called “bell-ringer” events ― still go unreported; indeed, a recent study found that four out of 10 athletes with concussion signs or symptoms return to play that same day. It has become increasingly clear that the problem isn’t a lack of knowledge. Rather, it is the attitudes and beliefs of athletes about concussion reporting, what they think might happen to them if they report, and what they think are negative attitudes of coaches, teammates, parents, and fans about concussion reporting which combine to create a climate which discourages reporting.In the age of social media, such negative attitudes by teammates about honest self-reporting can take the form of cyber-bullying and shaming. “As health care providers dealing with concussions, we need to be aware that many concussed patients may be bullied or shamed on social media by friends or teammates who may not believe that they are experiencing concussion symptoms, or that those symptoms are lingering,” notes Mark Halstead, M.D., a sports medicine physician and Director of the Washington University Sports Concussion Clinic & Young Athlete Center.The answer, then, is to work to change attitudes about concussion symptom reporting so that honest reporting is viewed as a valued team behavior and a hallmark of a good teammate. Like the Centers for Disease Control and an increasing number of concussion experts, I believe that the best way to increase the rate at which athletes report concussion symptoms, either their own or their teammates, is for coaches, parents, medical staff to work as a team to change reporting behavior ― to reshape the culture around concussion reporting ― by changing individual and team reporting attitudes and norms and by creating a climate in which athletes feel comfortable reporting their symptoms.The #TeamUp4ConcussionSafety™ freely available program, developed by MomsTEAM Institute as part of its SmartTeams Play Safe™ initiative with a Mind Matters Educational Challenge Grant from the National Collegiate Athletic Association and Department of Defense, is designed to do just that: to increase reporting by athletes of concussion symptoms by engaging coaches, athletes, parents, and health care providers in a season-long, indeed career-long program which emphasizes that immediate reporting of concussion symptoms – not just by athletes themselves but by their teammate “buddies” – not only reduces the risk the athlete will suffer a more serious brain injury – or, in rare cases, even death – but is actually helps the team’s chances of winning, not just in that game, but, by giving athletes the best chance to return as quickly as possible from concussion, the rest of the season, and by teaching that honest reporting is a valued team behavior and a hallmark of a good teammate.The rate at which student-athletes immediately and honestly report experiencing concussion symptoms, both their own and their teammates, will only begin to increase if all stakeholders first understand how much they know about concussions, and about their own attitudes towards and beliefs about symptom reporting. Our five-part program begins by asking coaches, athletes, athletic trainers, and parents to take a series of quizzes designed to test their concussion knowledge, and, more importantly, whether they view concussion symptom reporting in a positive or negative light.While knowledge and awareness of concussion has increased substantially over the seventeen years that MomsTEAM/SmartTeams™ has been engaged in concussion education, research shows that there are still important gaps that need to be filled. To fill them, coaches, parents, and athletes will be encouraged in Step Two in the #TeamUp4ConcussionSafety program to continue learning about concussions by taking our online concussion education course.Because studies show that one-off concussion education isn’t enough to change concussion symptom reporting behavior, Step Three in the SmartTeams Play Safe™ #TeamUp4 ConcussionSafety™ game plan calls for coaches, athletes, athletic trainers, team doctors (and, at the youth and high school level, parents) to attend a mandatory concussion safety meeting before every sports season to learn in detail about the importance of immediate concussion symptom reporting, not just in minimizing the risks concussions pose to an athlete’s short- and long-term health, but in increasing the chances for individual and team success. (As I have learned from long experience with youth and high school sports programs, making attendance at a concussion safety meeting voluntary virtually guarantees a lot of no-shows.)Anecdotal evidence from NCAA Division I football programs suggests that the signing by athletes of pledges acknowledging their responsibility to report concussion symptoms increases the rate of reporting by athletes, both of their own symptoms and those of teammates. Because improving concussion safety requires a team effort, we believe that all those with a stake in concussion safety should sign pledges, not just athletes. Step Four of our concussion safety game plan thus calls for athletes, coaches, parents, and medical staff to demonstrate in a tangible way their commitment to creating a culture in which immediate reporting of concussion symptoms by athletes is a valued team behavior and the sign of a good teammate by signing a concussion safety pledge at or shortly after the pre-season concussion safety meeting,And, finally, because prevailing attitudes towards concussion symptom reporting and reporting behavior are deeply entrenched in our sports culture, we encourage, as Step Five, that coaches, athletes, athletic trainers, team doctors, and parents continue working over the course of the sports season to create and maintain an environment in which athletes feel safe in immediately reporting concussion symptoms (both their own and their teammates) by sharing and reinforcing positive messages about the importance of immediate concussion symptom reporting via social media, by maintaining open lines of communication and an ongoing dialog about concussion safety among and between and among coaches, athletes, medical staff and parents.With consistent messaging and constant reinforcement of the value of immediate concussion reporting in achieving your team’s performance goals, and by making athletes feel comfortable in reporting, we believe that, not only will attitudes and beliefs about concussion reporting begin to change, but the concussion reporting behavior of your athletes will start to change as well, and that, over time, the culture of resistance to concussion symptom reporting will be replaced by a sports culture of concussion safety.Link for Smart Teams Play Safe Head Injury Prevention Program www.concussions.smart-teams.orgAbout the Author:Brooke de Lench is a pioneer in child athlete safeguards and rights, a risk reduction in sports and legal consultant.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59b692ec1700002000f5244c.jpeg?cache=ULR7oloJH8&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Pope Francis had some harsh words on Monday for President Donald Trump and others who support ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program: If you’re calling yourself pro-life, don’t separate families through restrictive immigration laws. “A good pro-lifer understands that family is the cradle of life, and that its unity must be defended,” Francis said during a wide-ranging interview aboard the papal plane, after a trip to Colombia.The advice from the Roman Catholic Church’s first Latin American pope came after journalists asked Francis to comment on Trump’s decision last week to phase out the DACA program. The Obama-era program temporarily granted deportation protection to some immigrants who were illegally brought to the U.S. as children. Trump gave Congress six months to hash out how to handle the immigration status of these estimated 800,000 young people. During the interview, Francis admitted that he’s unfamiliar with the particulars of DACA, or with Trump’s decision. But he is confident about one thing: Separating children from their families doesn’t align with a pro-life attitude, because it “isn’t something that bears fruit for either the youngsters or their families.”Francis said he hopes Trump rethinks the decision.“I believe that this law comes, I think, not from Congress but from the executive branch of the government,” he said, according to a translation by Crux. “If it is so, I have the hope that it’s re-thought, because I heard the president of the United States introduce himself as a ‘pro-life’ man.”Trump’s attitude on abortion rights has shifted over the years. In the 1990s, he called himself “pro-choice in every respect.” During and after his presidential campaign, he has presented himself as a staunch opponent of abortion. But Francis’ remarks on Monday suggested that the pope sees the pro-life movement as much bigger than disagreements over abortion. For Francis, being pro-life includes supporting the family as a whole, and keeping children with their parents.This position on DACA was underscored by America’s Catholic bishops, who spoke out last week against Trump’s decision to phase out the program.“It’s certainly not Christian, and I would contend it’s not American,” Cardinal Timothy Dolan, archbishop of New York, said in an interview. This isn’t the first time Francis and Trump have failed to see eye to eye on immigration. While Trump has sought to limit the number of refugees entering the U.S., the pope has spoken repeatedly about the need to protect the world’s refugees and migrants. Last year, Francis criticized the president’s campaign promise to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.“A person who only thinks about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,” he said."

This isn’t the first time Francis and Trump have failed to see eye to eye on immigration. While Trump has sought to limit the number of refugees entering the U.S., the pope has spoken repeatedly about the need to protect the world’s refugees and migrants. Last year, Francis criticized the president’s campaign promise to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.“A person who only thinks about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,” he said."

I smiled at my screen when I saw the return address. It was from a fellow advocate I met while I was participating in the International Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Alliance (IFAAA) meeting.We have become great friends over the past 2 years. We kept in touch via email even though she lives on a different continent. My smile faded as I read the note.She told me her non-food allergic child had been diagnosed with cancer. The best treatment options were out of the country, and the family would need to travel. Someone else had booked the flights and she was worried about the selected airline’s food allergy policy and track record. They had booked her on Delta Airlines, and she wanted to ask my advice as a food allergy airline advocate. Thankfully, I could tell her that Delta has one of the best food allergy policies and that she would be in good hands. I sat there at my screen and had a good cry that my friend had to worry about safely traveling on top of her child’s diagnosis.I often receive hate mail regarding my advocacy to make flying safer for people with food allergies. The lack of empathy and compassion makes me cringe. Many people suggest that those with food allergies should simply not fly, and flying is a luxury that we have no right to expect. Some even go on to make suggestions that food allergic passengers should drive or just take a bus. Please remember, travel is not always a luxury. Food allergy safety on planes should not be negotiable.The testimonials that I have collected indicate many airlines are consistently inconsistent. Food allergic passengers fly the same carrier on different occasions and experience disparate treatment. This makes it difficult to navigate the system and make informed choices. Many families report being kicked off flights for revealing a food allergy, being mocked by flight attendants, and being ridiculed by other passengers or airline staff.Each airline dictates its own policy toward food allergies with no oversight or ramifications for not adhering to it. Sometimes, the airline with the least accommodating policy is the only means of getting to your destination quickly (medical treatments, sports competitions, funerals etc.).Many people, including airline staff, are not educated as to what having a food allergy means when traveling. They often think: Just don’t eat food with your allergen. Yet the reality is far more complicated than that. A person with a food allergy, who ingests even a tiny amount of food ― say a leftover smear on an airline tray or dust that settled from a previous passenger’s bag of nuts ― could set off anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction).It is time for the airline industry to share responsibility for the safety of food allergic passengers and develop a clear and consistent approach. It is also necessary to educate all airline staff on the severity of food allergies and to be prepared in the event of an emergency by labeling emergency medications and having auto injectors onboard.I want to leave you with the thought that there are no vacations from food allergies, even when you get a devastating diagnosis of another disease. When we travel, we are far from medical care. There is no ER in the air and that is why, as allergic passengers, we ask for reasonable accommodations like pre-boarding the aircraft to clean from past contamination to make flying safer. It seems simple to implement because quite frankly, it is. Airlines who do it right show us it can be done. I simply do not understand or accept that policies that show respect and kindness towards food allergy flyers is not an achievable goal for all airlines."

The singer and her husband, Brandon Blackstock, have two kids, 3-year-old River Rose and 1-year-old Remington. She’s also stepmom to 10-year-old Seth and 16-year-old Savannah, Blackstock’s children from his first marriage. During a Facebook Live interview with the “Today” show’s Hoda Kotb, Clarkson opened up about motherhood.“When you work, you miss things,” she said. For example, Clarkson explained, she still hasn’t heard her son say “mama,” though apparently he’s already added the word to his vocabulary. “I’ll look at him and go ‘mama,’ and he’ll go ‘dada,’” she said. “And then my nanny and his grandma said, ‘Oh, he said mama this morning!’”Clarkson said she makes sure to make time to read to her kids individually and takes them on the road with her when she can. “It’s challenging when you’re a working parent,” she said. “I don’t want to be one of those pop star moms that doesn’t see their [kids] ... I want to hang out with them and be there.”“It’s hard to be a really good mom and a really good person at your job,” she added, noting that she’s very lucky to have “a village of people” supporting her family. Ultimately, Clarkson has a nice outlook on being a working parent. Said the singer, “I have to release control and just say, ‘I’m not going to be able to be there for everything, and it’s OK, because I’m showing my daughter and my son and our kids that you can do both and achieve great things.’”"

Just look at the consequences of 9/11 and American Imperialism.On this day, September 11th, while we remember one of the US’s greatest tragedies, it’s important to note the silver lining:Close to 3000 Americans died on 911 but on the bright side at least Trump’s Tower on 40 Wall Street became the tallest in Manhattan once again. Even though it was built after the WTC.Ladies and gentlemen, our 45th president. By the way, please spare me your “I can’t believe you’re politicizing this catastrophic event” bulls**t because Trump is not alone in his distasteful approach — more “acceptable” figures in both parties have been using 9/11 to accrue political brownie points for 16 years. But look, here’s Trump lying about it to garner support around hating Muslims:When the WTC came tumbling down, and I watched in Jersey City, NJ - where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down. ― President Donald TrumpBut enough about Trump’s rude behavior; let’s talk about the aftermath of 9/11 and how the U.S. exploited this tragedy to, among other things, increase discretionary military spending by 50 percent as our spending on social programs designed to benefit average Americans only increased by a comparatively measly 13 percent.It’s almost like Eisenhower saw the future when he considered the negative consequences of lobbying and the economic interests of the Military Industrial Complex as the largest threat facing our nation.Even prior to 9/11, the United States had been the dominant global military power, outstripping the rest of the world in defense spending many times over.But now the Pentagon has become the nation’s largest employer, while the US accounts for 51 percent of worldwide military spending.But skyrocketing military spending represents just one of the major shifts we’ve witnessed since 9/11. For many in my generation and younger, the US has been at war for our entire lives. And the single event that kicked the US’s already imperialism-driven foreign policy into overdrive was 9/11.9/11 was the justification used to invade Afghanistan and Iraq, continuing a longstanding policy of international destabilization as we invaded with boots on the ground, decapitated region leaders, and still consistently perform precision strikes in countries that had even less to do with 9/11 than Afghanistan.While constant war has been fairly profitable for the ballooning military industrial complex, the death toll numbers are in the millions. By 9/11/2015, these wars in the Middle East had taken the lives of 5,000 American soldiers and cost 1,160,521 their lives in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, and Libya.Aside from the human toll, the War in Afghanistan alone has cost US taxpayers trillions of dollars, with essentially zero benefit to the people of Afghanistan we’re ostensibly trying to help.And what about Iraq? At this point literally not a single sane American thinks Iraq is better off now that Saddam is gone - not to mention that his ouster led directly to the creation of ISIS, which the US partially funded.Libya is now a failed state, and a big part of the reason why “Hillary ‘Warhawk’ Clinton” lost the election to an orange white supremacist sympathizer.And Yemen, after being senselessly pulverized by US drones for a decade, now faces a humanitarian crisis nearly the size of the Syrian war since that’s what we desperately needed in the Middle East, another proxy war with Iran, Saudi Arabia, the US and Russia. We needed that as much as we need another Transformers movie, and both catastrophes will undoubtably happen.Meanwhile, here on American soil, the threat from terrorism has been on the rise ― and since Trump’s election, rapidly so, except that the threat has come primarily from radical white Christian terrorists, who since September 12, 2001 have been responsible for 73 percent of the extremist incidents that have taken place on US soil.And instead of looking at the consequences of these disastrous failed wars, we increase military presence in Afghanistan and give Eric Prince, a war criminal with very close ties to the Trump administration, a platform to decry that the privatization of the military is a viable economic solution to our continued colonization of the middle east. Eric Prince’s of any other nation would be in jail, in the US - he goes on CNN to promote Blackwater, and writes “New York Times” op-eds about the benefits of using his mercenaries.So on this day, remember all the lives that were lost. Also remember how our leaders exploited those deaths for political ends ― with disastrous results across the globe. And never forget the way those same politicians treated first responders who died prematurely or are still suffering from debilitating illnesses in the aftermath of their heroic work at Ground Zero ― it only took Congress 14 years to pass a reauthorization bill to take care of all the people who worked in the rubble. All while spending trillions of dollars destroying other countries overseas.Let this day be a reminder that we don’t like spending money on healing our nation, but for a tidy profit ― we like wasting money on destroying ours and others."

I vividly recalled the confusion, the horror, and the tragedy of that day.I distinctly remember coming upstairs around 7 a.m. California time and finding my father glued to the television, crying. I asked him what was wrong, and he couldn’t speak. He kept staring at the television while they replayed the planes flying into the Twin Towers and the pandemonium surrounding the attacks. I remember hearing the news updates regarding the four planes involved. I remember my anxiety and concern, wondering if I knew anyone in the planes that were bound for California, or anyone that was hurt in the devastation that followed.I remember hearing about the courage of American Airlines flight attendant Betty Ann Ong as she responded to a crisis on Flight 11 that was bound for the west coast, one of the first planes to become hijacked on September 11, 2001. The plane was just 15 minutes into its journey from Boston when it became clear something was wrong. Betty heroically notified the American Airlines ground crew of a hijacking situation on board. She stayed on the phone for nearly 25 minutes, relaying vital information until the plane crashed into the North Tower at 8:46 a.m.I will never forget.And yet...despite the darkness this day brought, I will also always remember the light that shone through people’s hearts.I remember watching the first responders frantically rescue and help anyone they could reach, without consideration for their own safety and well-being. I remember hearing about people lining up to donate food, clothing, and blood; anything possible to help. I remember watching crying people thanking strangers that saved their lives. My life was changed by how the communities around me pulled together.My husband’s life also changed after the attacks on 9/11. His sister lived close to the Pentagon, his brother was in the Armed Services, and his firefighter father was on high alert in the station. Because of the events of this day, Jason was inspired become a firefighter.It was a time etched into my mind because it conveyed the best qualities of my fellow Americans at the most trying and adverse time in recent American history– how we pulled together, remained strong, united, and most of all, helped each other when we needed it the most.Though tragic, on that day, we showed the world we have strength, we have heart, we have compassion, and we will never forget. When I drive past the Betty Ong Chinese Recreation Center and see how that area serves the growing number of families in San Francisco, I remember the courage of an everyday San Francisco native who grew up in Chinatown, attended San Francisco’s public schools, and became an American hero that gave her life for her country. I remember the heroism of the passengers on Flight 93 bound for San Francisco, in which the passengers managed to retake control before it crashed into a field outside of Pennsylvania. Then I smile to know that her name and heroism are remembered, as it is prominently featured on a building that is doing so much good for the local community and improving lives of families in the area. We are making life better for the next generation.On 9/11, take a moment of silence to reflect on what happened that day and remember those who are no longer with us. Thank you to the first responders, military, men, women, visitors, strangers, and Americans that lost their lives that day to help our nation survive that dark time. While fear and terror tried to divide us, we as a nation rose above hate and were unified by love and hope. Let’s remember the sacrifice made by all those affected that day, and respect their memories by living life with integrity and honor. Their sacrifice demands nothing less."

Planned Parenthood Great Plains Interim President and CEO Aaron Samulcek called the decision “a hard fought victory for Missourians.” “Today marks a hard fought victory for Missourians who, for far too long, faced insurmountable challenges to accessing safe, legal abortion,” he said.The branch’s license for providing abortion was removed in 2012 after the center could not meet the state’s harsh TRAP laws, which required the clinic to meet the same structural requirements as ambulatory surgical centers. (TRAP laws, or Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers, refer to legislation created with the specific intent to make abortion more difficult to access.) The TRAP laws also required abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a hospital within a 15-minute drive of the clinic.In the June 2016 ruling in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, Texas H.B. 2 ― essentially the Texan version of those TRAP laws ― was struck down by the Supreme Court after the court ruled that the legislation put an “undue burden” on women seeking access to abortion care. That same summer, Missouri’s state Supreme Court made a similar ruling. After that, PPGP reapplied for its license to offer abortions, and that license was finally granted on Monday. “PPGP believed and the courts affirmed, medically unnecessary laws like admitting privileges and ambulatory surgical center (ASC) requirements are unconstitutional,” Samulcek said. “We celebrate this win for our patients who deserve greater access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health care including safe, legal abortion.” The re-licensing of the Kansas City clinic is a win for Missouri women. According to the Guttmacher Institute, Missouri has some of the harshest anti-abortion regulations in the country, including a 72-hour waiting period and mandated, state-sponsored, in-person counseling. According to the press release, PPGP’s Columbia location will also likely be re-licensed in the coming days. H/T The Pitch"

Security Council on Friday to call a meeting on Monday to vote on a draft resolution establishing additional sanctions on North Korea for its missile and nuclear program.Japanese Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera said it was vital to put pressure on North Korea through additional sactions, including blocking or slowing its fuel supplies.“If we put firm pressure on North Korea such that it realizes it cannot develop missiles, it will accept dialog and we can progress with diplomatic efforts,” Onodera told public broadcaster NHK on Sunday. “Unless we firmly apply pressure, North Korea will not change its direction.”KCNA said Kim threw a banquet to laud the nuclear scientists and other top military and party officials who contributed to the nuclear bomb test last Sunday, topped with an art performance and a photo session with the leader himself.KCNA did not specify when the banquet had been held, but analysts said it had likely been on Saturday.Photos released on Sunday by KCNA showed the young leader breaking into a broad smile at the People’s Theatre with two prominent scientists: Ri Hong Sop, head of North Korea’s Nuclear Weapons Institute, and Hong Sung Mu, deputy director of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea’s munitions industry department.Ri and Hong have played vital roles in the North’s nuclear program, appearing at close distance to Kim during field inspections and weapons tests, including the latest nuclear test. Ri is a former director of Yongbyon Nuclear Research Centre, North Korea’s main nuclear facility north of Pyongyang, where Hong also worked as a chief engineer.North Korea had said the latest test was an advanced hydrogen bomb. There was no independent confirmation but some Western experts said there was enough strong evidence to suggest the reclusive state has either developed a hydrogen bomb or was getting very close.KCNA said on Sunday the scientists and technicians “brought the great auspicious event of the national history, an extra-large event through the perfect success in the test of H-bomb.”Kim praised the developers in his own remarks as “taking the lead” in attaining the “final goal of completing the state nuclear force” in line with his parallel pursuit of nuclear and economic development.“The recent test of the H-bomb is the great victory won by the Korean people at the cost of their blood while tightening their belts in the arduous period,” Kim was quoted as saying.Ri and Hong’s roles have also been noted overseas, prompting the United Nations, the United States or South Korea to blacklist them.Aside from the elite, rank-and-file North Koreans also commemorated the anniversary on Saturday by visiting the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, which houses the embalmed bodies of founding father Kim Il Sung and his son and successor Kim Jong Il.KCNA said service personnel and civilians, including children, laid floral baskets and bouquets at the statues of the deceased leaders across the country, while enjoying art performances and dancing parties.

Hurricane Irma devastated parts of the U.S. Virgin Islands as it barrelled through the Caribbean last week. On the island of St. Thomas, several people were killed, buildings were leveled and the hospital, airport and fire station were destroyed. On St. John, where damage was described as “very catastrophic,” a resident said houses were “flying away” when Irma struck.In a heartfelt article published Saturday in The Players’ Tribune, Duncan, who was born and raised in St. Croix, the largest of the U.S. Virgin Islands, described how his “old friends” and other islanders were suffering in the aftermath of the deadly storm. “I’ve been thinking a lot about my old neighborhood in St. Croix, where I recently took my kids,” Duncan wrote for the site that features articles by current and former professional athletes. “I showed them where I used to play with my friends when I was their age. I showed them my high school. Now I’m asking myself, What will still be there after the storms?”The former San Antonio Spurs center said he was “immediately” donating $250,000 to Hurricane Irma relief efforts in the U.S. Virgin Islands and pledged to match contributions that total up to $1 million. As of Sunday morning, that amount had almost been reached for his relief fund. “I’m not normally one to speak directly in the media, or write stuff publicly. So I’m a little out of my comfort zone here,” the famously media-shy athlete wrote in the article. “But here I am, talking right to you, asking you for a favor. I promise I wouldn’t be asking if it didn’t matter so much.”In his post, Duncan described how he had weathered a hurricane — Hugo — on St. Croix when he was a teenager. He spoke of the terror he felt, huddled in a small bathroom with his mother and sister as his dad acted as lookout in the hallway, watching a crack in the ceiling grow larger and larger as the storm intensified.Duncan recalled the terrible aftermath of Hugo and the long process of rebuilding, and how vital but challenging it was to get “immediate and sustained help” from the outside.“Islands like ours tend to get forgotten after storms. We’re remote, which makes it hard to deliver supplies quickly, cheaply and adequately,” he wrote.Duncan vowed to personally spearhead efforts to transport supplies to the Virgin Islands ― and to do so with haste.“Every dollar donated will go directly to relief efforts on the ground. Starting as soon as the weather permits, I’ll be chartering an airplane full of supplies from San Antonio to St. Croix,” he wrote.“Right now you — we — can really, really make a difference,” Duncan added.Learn more about his U.S. Virgin Islands Relief Fund here.

Over the next two days, 600 hot meals were prepared and distributed to Harvey evacuees.As the Labor Day weekend began, Ahmadi youth from all over Texas and the country began to trickle in from as far as Chicago and Los Angeles. The trickle grew into more than 175 volunteers over the weekend. The band of youth organized into groups and started roaming the hardest hit areas of Houston (Kashmere Gardens, especially), not with any bad intention, but to knock on doors and help residents struggling to clean up their apartments and homes.By the end of the Labor Day weekend, we had volunteered a total of 1,800 man hours, helped clean up over 64 homes, done 30 boat rescues and donated more than $10,000 in supplies. All this using Baitus Samee Mosque North of Houston as our command center."
