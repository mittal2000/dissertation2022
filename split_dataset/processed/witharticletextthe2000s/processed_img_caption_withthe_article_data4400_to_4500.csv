They urged Sessions to establish a task force “with the assignment of identifying and capturing the culprit or culprits who are now terrorizing American Jewry.”At least 11 JCCs in 10 states received threatening phone calls on Monday. It was the fourth series of such messages since the start of the new year, raising the total number of incidents to about 70 aimed at almost 60 JCCs in 27 states and one Canadian province. Anti-Semitic hate crimes comprise the largest portion of religiously motivated attacks in the United States. The rabbis, pointing to a “supercharged anti-Semitism” spreading on the internet and social media, wrote that they are “deeply worried” that the bomb threats could “inspire more dangerous targeting” of the Jewish community. The series of bomb threats against the JCCs is “unprecedented,” said Heidi Beirich, director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center.“I’ve been working at SPLC since 1999. I’ve never seen a string of attacks like this that are targeting the same kind of institution in the same kind of way. This is new,” Beirich said. "

She gave fans a sneak peek of her fresh new look in her most recent Instagram post, which she shot at an event in West Hollywood hosted by Vanity Fair and L’Oreal Paris.We’d say that’s a dramatic change to her usual long locks, wouldn’t you? As a refresher, here’s how long her hair usually is:Turns out, Cameron’s lob was the clever work of a wig, and she kept her long hair hidden and braided underneath. She sure had us fooled!Cameron slays the lob so well, we’re almost considering going short ourselves.

Meteorologists said the storms were spawned by an “atmospheric river” bringing moisture from the Pacific Ocean.Last week a string of storms triggered a crisis near the Lake Oroville Dam about 100 miles (160 km) northeast of San Francisco, where damage to two spillways prompted an evacuation of more than 100,000 people downstream.California is slowly recovering from five years of drought thanks to several months of unusually wet weather.At least 3 inches (8 cm) of rain fell in many areas, though some received far more, such as the sparsely populated Big Sur region and outside the city of Santa Rosa, which got more than 8 inches (20 cm), the weather officials said.The next heavy storm is expected to hit Northern California this weekend, they added."

Tom Wolf (D-Pa.) is undeterred by Trump's victory and recent Democratic losses.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ae06852900002200f282c0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Democrats have “done a good job of addressing the needs of Americans and will continue to do so,” despite election defeats, said Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D), whose state narrowly voted for President Donald Trump after going Democratic in the previous six presidential elections.“What we saw in November, to a certain extent — and remember, Hillary Clinton won by 3 million votes — what we saw were a lot of people who were concerned about whether either party is addressing their needs, rightly or wrongly,” Wolf told The Huffington Post on Wednesday. Trump campaigned as an anti-establishment candidate and his voters “wanted to shake things up,” Wolf said. A winning strategy for Democrats, he said, is to accomplish policy priorities to restore voters’ faith in government.Wolf cited his latest budget proposal, which he said increases funding for public education, jobs and the fight against the opioid crisis.“I’m actually increasing amount of money that I think Pennsylvania ought to invest in those areas. At the same time, I’m not asking for any tax increases,” he said. “I’m going to make government work better to do the things that people in Pennsylvania want it to do.”Wolf said it’s important for state and local officials to fight policies that hurt their constituents through the courts. But ultimately, he said, voters will decide.Last month, attorneys general from more than a dozen states, including Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro (D), vowed to challenge the constitutionality of Trump’s ban on immigration from seven majority-Muslim nations. A lawsuit filed by Democratic attorneys general in Washington state and Minnesota successfully halted enforcement of the ban.“The attorney general has the ability to pursue cases that — in our case, Josh Shapiro — are unconstitutional, but the best way is to make sure that we have representatives in various offices at the federal and the state level that don’t pass unconstitutional measures,” Wolf said.Since Trump’s election, Democrats around the country have become more actively engaged in grassroots activism.In Pennsylvania, progressive activists have targeted Sen. Pat Toomey (R), with a new group called “Tuesdays with Toomey,” which goes to the senator’s local office each week to voice concerns.Toomey narrowly won re-election in November, in part by distancing himself from Trump. He waited until Election Day to reveal that he voted for Trump.Toomey has avoided town hall meetings this week, apparently fearing protesters. Activists mocked his absence with an empty suit at an event on Tuesday. The national Democratic Party is preparing to choose a party chair this weekend. The Democratic National Committee race, featuring former Labor Secretary Tom Perez and Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) as front-runners, has exposed rifts within the party on how best to oppose Trump and the GOP.Both Wolf and Pennsylvania state Democratic chair Marcel Groen have endorsed Perez."

Though the fire took place just four years after the 1969 Stonewall riots ― which are considered the symbolic start of the modern LGBTQ rights movement ― the tragedy itself has become a bit of a historical footnote. Enter Max Vernon. The New York playwright and composer learned about the UpStairs Lounge fire in college, and has written a new musical that brings the victims to life for a new generation of Off-Broadway theatergoers. But Vernon insists “The View UpStairs,” which opens at Manhattan’s Lynn Redgrave Theater at Culture Project on Feb. 28, is anything but a somber history lesson. “I wanted to write something that would use the fire to have a conversation about how our world has changed since 1973,” he told The Huffington Post. As such, the couple at the heart of “The View UpStairs” represent, as Vernon puts it, the conflict between “two different generations of queer history.” The show follows contemporary fashion designer Wes (Jeremy Pope) as he is transported through time to the UpStairs Lounge in its free-swilling 1970s heyday. Along the way, he meets Patrick (Taylor Frey), who is coming to terms with his sexuality after his Christian family sent him to “conversion” therapy. “American Idol” veteran Frenchie Davis, stage and screen actor Nathan Lee Graham (“Zoolander 2”) and Broadway favorite Michael Longoria add texture to the plot as lounge patrons of different backgrounds, while the musical as a whole doesn’t skimp on the sex.Frey, who was raised in the Mormon faith, told HuffPost he connected to the role of Patrick, who is “playing sexual and mental catch-up,” in many ways. “I lived such a straight path, and I tried to do my best not to be gay or, as my church told me, not to act on it,” the actor-singer, who has appeared on Broadway in “How To Succeed in Business Without Really Trying” and “Finian’s Rainbow,” said. “I’m not familiar with a musical where a leading character is gay and sings about [conversion therapy]... These stories aren’t always told in our world of musical theater, especially when producers are trying to make a buck and trying to get something commercial on Broadway.” “The View UpStairs” struck an even deeper nerve for Pope, a Florida native who knew several Pulse victims personally. When the actor-singer first read the script last year, he said it felt “like therapy.” “It just felt necessary, right now, that we be able to share this piece of theater with the community,” he said. “It’s interesting to see where things nowadays are similar [to 1973] and where things are different. Yes, we have progressed and have made steps and strides, but there’s still a long, long way ahead, I believe.”True to its setting, the show’s score puts a fresh spin on a mélange of 1970s sounds. For Vernon, who cited Stevie Wonder and David Bowie as influences, the “badass rock score” was a no-brainer. The steamy vibe of the lounge itself, he added, was perfectly suited to a musical adaptation in the “downtown, grungy and sexy” vein of “Hair” and “Hedwig and the Angry Inch,” although show tune traditionalists might be better served elsewhere. “[The lounge] had drag, it had cruising and glory holes, it had piano bar sing-a-longs... it even had church services,” he said. “When you put that in context in the South in 1973, it makes it all the more inspiring.” The significance of presenting such a pro-queer piece at a time when the LGBTQ community is facing an uncertain future under President Donald Trump isn’t lost on the team. “When I first started writing the show, it was just my character that was traveling back to 1973, and now it feels like it’s our whole country,” Vernon said. Ultimately, he’d like the musical to help him “reclaim the power of being a subversive queer theater artist. I want to write work that shocks, provokes, makes people laugh at things they’re not supposed to laugh at... [My show] is saying that we have to be the ones to pick up the torch from the past, march forward and make it better ourselves.” Currently in previews, “The View UpStairs” opens at Lynn Redgrave Theater at Culture Project in New York on Feb. 28.

6,POLITICS,"Donald Trump Promised To Build Infrastructure, Delays Bay Area Railway Project Instead",Sebastian Murdock,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-infrastructure-delays-caltrain_us_58adc320e4b03d80af714733,"Meanwhile, he plans to waste $20 billion on a useless wall.",2017-02-22,"A commuter carries his bicycle aboard a Caltrain train in San Francisco on Nov. 24, 2009. Caltrain and the California High-Speed Rail Authority are facilitating improvements to Caltrain to bring high-speed rail to the region.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58adca2f2900002100bea390.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump promised Americans he would rebuild the country’s crumbling infrastructure, boasting on the campaign trail that he would put $1 trillion of public and private funds into rebuilding roads and bridges. He later drastically decreased that number to $550 billion.So where is that money going? Not to California, where plans to revitalize the Bay Area’s Caltrain transit system have just been delayed by his administration.Trump’s newly appointed transportation secretary, Elaine Chao ― who oversees the Federal Transit Administration ― has slammed the brakes on the project, which would change the diesel-powered trains to electric and cost about $2 billion, according to SF Gate. Last Friday, Chao halted the $647 million federal grant that helps cover the project until an audit can be completed. Caltrain has already selected contractors to get started on construction by March 1. If they aren’t able to get started by that date, the bidding process will begin all over again ― and likely at a much higher cost.There’s little chance Caltrain can meet its deadline now that an audit is required, and the cost penalties could be “so severe that we might not be able to do the project,” Seamus Murphy, the rail system’s chief communications officer, told the Los Angeles Times.Caltrain, which connects riders from San Francisco to the Silicon Valley hub of San Jose, currently carries approximately 60,000 riders a day. Making the trains electric would increase ridership, save money on operating costs and help the environment, advocates for the change argue.“For two years, Caltrain worked closely with Federal officials to complete a thorough evaluation of the project including intensive engineering assessments and financial vetting,” Murphy said in a statement. But on Jan. 24, 14 Republican members of the California GOP sent a letter to Chao, saying the cost of the project was too high and would not attract private financing. “I never imagined that the electrification of a train would be subjected to such brutal, partisan politics,” said Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) in a statement. “This is not a Democratic project nor is it a Republican project. It is about the modernization of an outdated commuter system that is the spine of the transportation system of the Peninsula and the Silicon Valley region.”Caltrain officials are asking Trump to intervene and direct the FTA to fund the electrification process of the existing Caltrain system. They say the project would create 9,600 jobs.The electrification of Caltrain would be just one element of an ambitious project to connect San Francisco to Los Angeles by high-speed train, reducing travel time between the two metropolises to three hours. California voters approved the entire project in 2008, but the original $40 billion cost is now closer to $64 billion (this sum includes the cost of the electrification of the current Caltrain system).Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who is married to Chao, previously panned Trump’s plan to spend a trillion dollars on infrastructure, saying such an infrastructure bill would not be a good use of the GOP’s time or resources.Trump has already promised to waste more than $20 billion on a useless U.S.-Mexico border wall. And it seems unlikely that he would give federal funds for infrastructure to California, a state that limits local law enforcement agencies’ cooperation with deportation efforts and contains many so-called “sanctuary cities.”The president has already threatened to withhold federal funds from sanctuary jurisdictions. “Certainly that would be a weapon,” Trump said of denying funding to states and cities that don’t fall into line with his federal immigration policies.In a 4 a.m. tweet earlier this month, Trump also floated the idea of cutting off federal funding for the University of California, Berkeley, after violent student protests erupted ahead of a scheduled appearance by right-wing agitator Milo Yiannopoulos.Part of Yiannopoulos’ “different point of view” was his apparent defense of pedophilia, as the world learned earlier this week. Maybe that will change Trump’s mind about blanket refusals of federal funds. Probably not."
7,POLITICS,Testy Town Halls Driving Many GOP Lawmakers To Simply Duck Them,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-lawmakers-town-halls_us_58acc338e4b0d0a6ef46158d,"It's 2009 all over again, just a different party in the hot seat.",2017-02-22,Unhappy constituents hold up signs during Rep. Scott Taylor's town hall meeting at Kempsville High School in Virginia Beach on Feb. 20.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58acc41b290000f616f27e73.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the summer of 2009, as Democratic town hall meetings grew unruly with protests over President Barack Obama’s health care proposal, lawmakers looked for ways to calm the waters. One idea was to simply scrap the in-person town hall.Instead of inviting constituents to community centers or school auditoriums, Democratic lawmakers would send out dial-in information for conference calls. People could still “attend” and questions could be “posed.” But the opportunities for direct confrontation ― the type that made for cable catnip ― were greatly limited.“I had hosted town hall meetings over the telephone so no one could act out,” former Rep. Earl Pomeroy (D-N.D.) told The Huffington Post. “I knew [the protesters’] entire purpose was to disrupt and create some video making a member look awkward and defensive. They didn’t want dialogue. They wanted to shout at me and get on the television.”For short-term purposes, the strategy worked. Pomeroy and others were spared the heat of town hall unrest. But in the long run, it only cemented the image of lawmakers afraid to defend the very agenda their party was pursuing.“Looking back all these years, I didn’t give them a platform to publicly humiliate me in a meeting for the purpose of trying to put me on TV,” Pomeroy said. “On the other hand, I’d always prided myself on being open and engaging North Dakotans. In retrospect, maybe I should have done that more.”Eight years later, Republican lawmakers are faced with the same dilemma: to stand and endure the anger of constituents scared about the direction of their party’s health care policy or to duck and cover in cozier confines. As in 2009, there appears to be some division over the best approach, with none proving particularly enjoyable.On Tuesday, a number of Republican lawmakers held open forums, only to be confronted by constituents’ pleas not to repeal Obamacare and demands to hold the Trump administration more accountable. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was pressed repeatedly on the two topics. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) was jeered when she left a town hall after 45 minutes, crowd members chanting, “Your last term.” Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) had a constituent tell him that if “wasn’t for Obamacare, we wouldn’t be able to afford insurance,” while Rep. Buddy Carter (R-Ga.) was driven to get biblical in his defense of the president. “I am not here to tell you Donald Trump is perfect. I am not here to tell you I agree with everything he has done,” Carter told a boisterous crowd. “Those of you who have studied the Bible know that God has used imperfect people to do great things before.”At least those lawmakers showed up.In recent weeks, other politicians have gone the Pomeroy route. Reps. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.), Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.), Martha McSally (R-Ariz.), Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.), Rodney Davis (R-Ill.), John Katko (R-N.Y.), Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.), Mike Bishop (R-Mich.), Barbara Comstock (R-Va.), Ryan Costello (R-Pa.), Patrick Meehan (R-Pa.), Dan Donovan (R-N.Y.), Peter Roskam (R-Ill.), John Culberson (R-Texas), Kay Granger (R-Texas), Randy Weber (R-Texas), Michael Burgess (R-Texas), Brian Babin (R-Texas), Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), Mike Kelly (R-Pa.), Chris Stewart (R-Utah) and Ken Buck (R-Colo.), among others, have turned to conference calls as an alternative to in-person meetings. Rep. Steve Pearce (R-N.M.) avoided constituents who gathered in his office before hosting a tele-town hall to hear their concerns. Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) said he’d cancel town halls if people there became disruptive. Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.), who had pledged on the campaign trail to hold town hall meetings, said he was avoiding them now out of fear they’d be hijacked.“It doesn’t make sense that you would allow the fringe to take over a town hall,” Bacon told The World-Herald. “It’s not fair to the people there, and it’s what they’re going to try to do. And I just don’t see putting myself in that situation or those who want to attend.”In ducking town hall gatherings, the GOP lawmakers fell back on several excuses ― one being that those who show up are there precisely to agitate; another being that the format can become a security risks when tempers flare, as they often do.On Monday evening, President Trump himself tweeted that the crowds showing up at these events are actually just liberal activists.The current crop of politicians also aren’t the first to make these calculations. For several election cycles now, members of Congress have been hosting fewer and fewer such events.As any congressional aide knows, it’s not just that in-person town halls are tricky; it’s that tele-town halls have definite advantages. Questions can be screened, if the host so desires. Legislative staffers can feed their boss data points, as the lawmaker fields queries and complaints. All the while, the communications director hovers nearby to enforce message discipline.A video from a town hall services provider lays out the ease with which it works:This all comes at a cost, though. A lawmaker only willing to talk on the phone is a lawmaker sacrificing not just face time with those who elect him, but also authenticity. Former Rep. Allen Boyd (D-Fla.) proudly recalled ― without a moment’s hesitation ― that he’d held 16 town hall meetings in the summer of 2009. “Even as my staff advised me against doing them,” he told HuffPost. Boyd said he was better off for it. “We didn’t have any YouTube moments, but they were pretty rowdy,” he said. “And we were able to understand, from a first-hand experience, what was going on in the country.” Even face time with the voters isn’t always enough. Boyd lost his seat in the Democrats’ 2010 electoral bloodbath, just like Pomeroy. “I said often that there was little that I did or could have done to change any of that,” Boyd said. “So, you know, you’ve got to ride through it. I couldn’t give [current lawmakers] any advice other than that. If they’ve done their due diligence and are comfortable with the decision they’ve made, then they’ve got to go out and defend it.” "

In retrospect, maybe I should have done that more.”Eight years later, Republican lawmakers are faced with the same dilemma: to stand and endure the anger of constituents scared about the direction of their party’s health care policy or to duck and cover in cozier confines. As in 2009, there appears to be some division over the best approach, with none proving particularly enjoyable.On Tuesday, a number of Republican lawmakers held open forums, only to be confronted by constituents’ pleas not to repeal Obamacare and demands to hold the Trump administration more accountable. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was pressed repeatedly on the two topics. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) was jeered when she left a town hall after 45 minutes, crowd members chanting, “Your last term.” Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) had a constituent tell him that if “wasn’t for Obamacare, we wouldn’t be able to afford insurance,” while Rep. Buddy Carter (R-Ga.) was driven to get biblical in his defense of the president. “I am not here to tell you Donald Trump is perfect. I am not here to tell you I agree with everything he has done,” Carter told a boisterous crowd. “Those of you who have studied the Bible know that God has used imperfect people to do great things before.”At least those lawmakers showed up.In recent weeks, other politicians have gone the Pomeroy route. Reps. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.), Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.), Martha McSally (R-Ariz.), Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.), Rodney Davis (R-Ill.), John Katko (R-N.Y.), Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.), Mike Bishop (R-Mich.), Barbara Comstock (R-Va.), Ryan Costello (R-Pa.), Patrick Meehan (R-Pa.), Dan Donovan (R-N.Y.), Peter Roskam (R-Ill.), John Culberson (R-Texas), Kay Granger (R-Texas), Randy Weber (R-Texas), Michael Burgess (R-Texas), Brian Babin (R-Texas), Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), Mike Kelly (R-Pa.), Chris Stewart (R-Utah) and Ken Buck (R-Colo.), among others, have turned to conference calls as an alternative to in-person meetings. Rep. Steve Pearce (R-N.M.) avoided constituents who gathered in his office before hosting a tele-town hall to hear their concerns. Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) said he’d cancel town halls if people there became disruptive. Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.), who had pledged on the campaign trail to hold town hall meetings, said he was avoiding them now out of fear they’d be hijacked.“It doesn’t make sense that you would allow the fringe to take over a town hall,” Bacon told The World-Herald. “It’s not fair to the people there, and it’s what they’re going to try to do. And I just don’t see putting myself in that situation or those who want to attend.”In ducking town hall gatherings, the GOP lawmakers fell back on several excuses ― one being that those who show up are there precisely to agitate; another being that the format can become a security risks when tempers flare, as they often do.On Monday evening, President Trump himself tweeted that the crowds showing up at these events are actually just liberal activists.The current crop of politicians also aren’t the first to make these calculations. For several election cycles now, members of Congress have been hosting fewer and fewer such events.As any congressional aide knows, it’s not just that in-person town halls are tricky; it’s that tele-town halls have definite advantages. Questions can be screened, if the host so desires. Legislative staffers can feed their boss data points, as the lawmaker fields queries and complaints. All the while, the communications director hovers nearby to enforce message discipline.A video from a town hall services provider lays out the ease with which it works:This all comes at a cost, though. A lawmaker only willing to talk on the phone is a lawmaker sacrificing not just face time with those who elect him, but also authenticity. Former Rep. Allen Boyd (D-Fla.) proudly recalled ― without a moment’s hesitation ― that he’d held 16 town hall meetings in the summer of 2009. “Even as my staff advised me against doing them,” he told HuffPost. Boyd said he was better off for it. “We didn’t have any YouTube moments, but they were pretty rowdy,” he said. “And we were able to understand, from a first-hand experience, what was going on in the country.” Even face time with the voters isn’t always enough. Boyd lost his seat in the Democrats’ 2010 electoral bloodbath, just like Pomeroy. “I said often that there was little that I did or could have done to change any of that,” Boyd said. “So, you know, you’ve got to ride through it. I couldn’t give [current lawmakers] any advice other than that. If they’ve done their due diligence and are comfortable with the decision they’ve made, then they’ve got to go out and defend it.” "

She played Andy García and Meg Ryan’s child in 1994’s “When a Man Loves a Woman”; she was the president’s daughter in the 1996 sci-fi action flick “Independence Day”; Whitman was George Clooney’s daughter in 1996’s “One Fine Day”; and she, of course, stunned as Bernice in the Sandra Bullock–fronted film “Hope Floats” in 1998. But Whitman admitted that she wouldn’t have made it very far if it weren’t for her “super-tight” relationship with her parents, Pat Musick and Jeffrey Whitman. “Growing up as a kid actor, I feel like it could really go either way. I can see how it could be such a horrible struggle. It’s tricky,” she told The Huffington Post during a Build Series interview on Tuesday. “I feel like, in anything, if you don’t feel like people have your back, it can lead you down a bad place, whether you’re a kid or an adult. I luckily had a super strong family base. My parents have always been so amazing and [are] my heroes. They really were so careful all along the way to choose projects that were with good people and honest people, and also they really gave me the gift of choosing if I wanted to do something or not. They were always like, ‘What’s inside your heart is the most important.’” Whitman, now 28, has found continued success in Hollywood with work in television series like NBC’s upcoming “Good Girls.” But she knows this career wouldn’t have been possible without her unique upbringing.“I just felt like I had a big, big family growing up,” she said when thinking back to the ‘90s. “I think equally of like hanging out with Harry Connick Jr. and Sandra Bullock, genuinely feeling like, ‘These are my friends, Mom, please go away,’ and then just hanging out in Austin and getting to be with my family and my parents. I had such a rich upbringing as far as the experiential system went ... having all these people that could be so supportive if you’re considerate. Like anything, you just have to surround yourself with the right people.”Although Whitman has steadily been working since 1994, taking on voice-over projects as well as on-screen roles, she never forgets how “lucky” she is to be in the film industry and hopes to inspire others to follow their dreams. In her new animated movie, “Rock Dog,” Whitman’s character Darma helps a dog named Bodi (Luke Wilson) fulfill his goal of becoming a musician, urging him to never quit. “I loved the concept of having a message for kids right now that is about individuality and celebrating your dreams,” Whitman told HuffPost. “It seems like it’s an easy concept but I find that in the world we live in, it’s sort of not maybe celebrated enough with kids. It’s an important movie to make kids realize that you got to work for it, no matter what people tell you you can and can’t do. You got to keep on your own path and trust what you know in your heart is what you really love to do. “Watch Mae Whitman’s full Build series interview below. “Rock Dog” hits theaters on Friday. "

Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.). But so far, she seems unwilling to meet that expectation.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58adc1ea280000db9899a85f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― As chairwoman of the House GOP’s millennial task force, Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) issued a report last week urging her Republican colleagues to hold town halls to engage and win over millennial voters.But Stefanik isn’t taking her own advice.The second-term Republican has no current plans to hold a town hall meeting in her district during this week’s so-called “district work period,” even after pushing out a 22-page report last week that strongly advises members to be accessible to millennials and other voters.“Millennials are a generation that expects their government to be open and honest, even if the message they deliver isn’t what they want to hear,” Stefanik writes in the first section of the report.She later names four “best practices” for engaging millennials: hold roundtables with them, establish a youth advisory group, use social media and hold town halls.Stefanik notes that House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) held a town hall event at Georgetown University last year, and she advises House Republicans to organize similar events at local universities or high schools in their districts.But Stefanik isn’t doing that. She was a no-show at events she was scheduled to attend once protesters showed up, according to local news coverage in her upstate New York district. Her critics charge that she’s going back on a campaign pledge of transparency by posting her schedule only after the days have come and gone.Responding to the criticism, Stefanik posted on Facebook that it’s “unfortunate and counterproductive that a small number of activists believe the best way to address the very serious issues facing our country is to hijack and ambush community events for the sole purpose of political theater.”Many House Republicans seem to believe the protests in their districts are not representative of their constituencies and are simply a small, vocal and organized minority.Stefanik, a 32-year-old millennial herself, has nevertheless preached accessibility even when it is uncomfortable. But the congresswoman ― who also refers Capitol Hill reporters to her office when they ask her questions in hallways ― has gone out of her way to duck protesters.The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which has its eyes on Stefanik’s moderate seat, blasted the report and called Stefanik’s behavior an example of “galling hypocrisy.”“Congresswoman Stefanik waxed poetic about the importance of holding town halls and then refused to hold her own ― proving that her words are as meaningless as Speaker Ryan’s shiny little pamphlet,” DCCC spokesman Evan Lukaske told The Huffington Post, referring to Ryan’s “Better Way” agenda.“It’s time for House Republicans to stop hiding and start explaining why they are going to take health care away from millions of hardworking Americans,” he added.A spokesman for Stefanik defended her failure to appear at town halls in her district. “Congresswoman Stefanik is on a Congressional Delegation trip this week as part of her work on the House Intelligence Committee for new Members that has been scheduled since early January,” said Tom Flanagin, her communications director.This story has been updated with comment from a spokesman for Stefanik."
15,ARTS & CULTURE,Met Director Fears Elimination Of NEA Marks 'New Assault' On Art,Katherine Brooks,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/met-director-fears-elimination-of-nea-marks-new-assault-on-art_us_58ab6476e4b0f077b3ed1677,We can all learn from Thomas P. Campbell's impassioned defense of public art.,2017-02-22,"Emanuel Leutze's ""Washington Crossing the Delaware,"" 1851.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ae0e522900002100bea584.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In an impassioned (but not quite scorched-earth) op-ed for The New York Times, Metropolitan Museum of Art director Thomas P. Campbell issued a swift and effective defense of public art in the United States. “Arts and cultural programming challenges, provokes and entertains; it enhances our lives,” he wrote. “Eliminating the NEA would in essence eliminate investment by the American government in the curiosity and intelligence of its citizens.”His defense ― a paean to the National Endowment of the Arts, in particular ― comes after rumors-turned-reports alleged that President Donald Trump’s administration plans to slash arts funding in an attempt to cut down on domestic spending. “Eliminating arts funding programs will save Donald Trump just 0.0625% of budget,” outlets have claimed. Nonetheless, it appears as though his office is ready to eliminate nine programs, including the NEA.Campbell anticipates that regions around the country, not just those within walking distance of the Met, will feel the loss of such an institution. NEA grants are awarded to schools, jazz festivals, dance troupes, literary organizations, museum exhibitions, “arts programs for war veterans,” and so much more across every U.S. congressional district, Campbell claims. In fact, you can get an idea of the NEA’s scope of influence here, courtesy of a website created by artist Tega Brain. Grants are small ― they average $26,000, Campbell says, and require groups to secure matching funds ― but they can be powerful.“Thousands are distributed in all 50 states, reaching every congressional district, urban and rural, rich and poor,” Campbell added, countering the Heritage Foundation’s characterization of the NEA as “welfare for cultural elitists.” “These grants sustain the arts in areas where people don’t have access to major institutions like the Met.”Contained within Campbell’s poetic defense is also an admission of concern: “I fear that this current call to abolish the NEA is the beginning of a new assault on artistic activity,” he proclaimed, harkening back to the last time publicly-funded art was under threat. In the 1990s, a congressional “decency test” turned lawmakers into wayward art critics capable of vetoing grants to expecting artists who didn’t meet Congress’ moral standards. Think artists like the NEA Four. Or, in the late 1980s, Robert Mapplethorpe, Dread Scott and Andres Serrano.Campbell continued:Eliminating the NEA would in essence eliminate investment by the American government in the curiosity and intelligence of its citizens. As the planet becomes at once smaller and more complex, the public needs a vital arts scene, one that will inspire us to understand who we are and how we got here — and one that will help us to see other countries, like China, not as enemies in a mercenary trade war but as partners in a complicated world.Campbell is hardly the only person to bridle at the prospect of decreased national arts funding. Authors, actors and artists, in particular, have been vocal about the need to protect the NEA and similar institutions. PEN America launched a petition to support the NEA; a White House petition with similar aims erupted.As writer Celeste Pewter noted in a comprehensive Twitter thread, any proposed cuts to the NEA or similar programs would depend on Congressional budgets and appropriation. Similarly, in a thorough examination for The Huffington Post, reporter Claire Fallon outlined six things NEA supporters can do to protect national arts funding before an official decision to defund is made.In the meantime, it will be important for figures like Campbell to continue to step forward and effectively communicate the impact and reach of the NEA. To tell the stories that accurately reflect how arts funding touches not only the coasts, but heartland organizations. To eloquently explain the ways in which art can transform opinions and illuminate the other. In the face of a president who seems willing to cut budgetary corners he might not fully understand, it’s worth remembering the words of a former president, Barack Obama, who said, “Equal to the impact [artists] have on each of us every day as individuals is the impact [they] have on us as a society. And we are told we’re divided as a people, and then suddenly the arts have this power to bring us together and speak to our common condition.”"

They had come to celebrate the culmination of a school project on freedom, just as many of the families were getting a taste of liberty themselves.The students, a number of whom are Muslim immigrants from Somalia, had created posters and written essays that proclaimed their vision of American ideals. Some of their families had fled the war-torn nation that became subject to the ban announced by President Donald Trump in late January for travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations.In a divisive political climate, public schools are taking on the challenge of helping refugees who feel unsafe in a country that seems increasingly intolerant of them. The students’ work took on an even deeper meaning after a January 27 racially charged assault near Casco Bay High School, which spurred pro-immigrant rallies throughout the city.“Islam is blamed for terrorism, but Christianity isn’t blamed for radical groups like the KKK,” said eighth-grader Zakaria Ali, 13, a student of Somali heritage who argued in his project that Muslims lose their freedom when Americans equate Islam with terror.Portland is a progressive coastal city of trendy restaurants and Victorian homes, as well as housing projects and homeless shelters, in one of the whitest states in the country. Its diversity is evident — from the assistant principal at Deering High School, who is a Somali immigrant, to the former student and current math teacher at King Middle School, a Ugandan immigrant, to the Somali restauranteur whose son is studying for his law school entrance exams. Republican governor Paul LePage has said he supports President Trump’s travel ban and has sought to deny government benefits to asylum seekers, but Portland city officials have proclaimed support for their immigrant community.“It’s a lightning-rod issue,” said Judy Katzel, a spokesperson for Catholic Charities Maine, the agency that resettles refugees in the state. “But welcoming refugees is not a political issue. It’s about people.”Students said King Middle School feels like a safe haven, but added that the world outside the school building has lately felt more dangerous. They hear their parents talking about being accosted in the street and worrying about relatives abroad who may be affected by the ban. (A federal appeals court has upheld a temporary order blocking the ban, but the Trump administration is considering an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.)The school’s freedom project, which is in its 19th year, is based on President Franklin Roosevelt’s World War II concept of the “four freedoms” that everyone in the world is entitled to enjoy. The students initially explored these concepts — freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want and freedom from fear — through the oil paintings of the quintessential American painter Norman Rockwell, and then deepened their understanding through individual research projects and field trips. This year in the project, which encompassed social studies, English, math and science, the topic of Islamophobia was popular.Umulker Ugas, 13, an eighth-grader whose family fled Somalia for Kenya before she was born, wears a hijab and goes to a mosque after school to study the Koran. In her project on freedom of worship, she focused on discrimination against women who wear the hijab in the workplace.“I feel like it’s not fair,” she said. “Not everyone from the countries they are banning is starting trouble.”Related: Muslim girls in Trump’s America: ‘I’m not going to cower into fear’The federal government has resettled about 3 million refugees since Congress passed the Refugee Act of 1980, according to the Pew Research Center. Roughly 44,000 immigrants, including refugees, have made their homes in Maine, according to Catholic Charities Maine. In the 1980s, most refugees were from Vietnam; now the majority come from Africa and the Middle East.Most Somalis arrived in the United States after 1991, when their government collapsed, civil war broke out and the country faced famine and anarchy. United Nations estimates showed that roughly 150,000 Somali immigrants were living in the United States in 2015, according to the Pew Research Center.Last year, at Ohio State University, a Somali refugee, apparently inspired by the Islamic State terrorist group, rammed a car into pedestrians and then stabbed people with a butcher knife. The attacker was shot dead within minutes, but his act added to the tension surrounding U.S. refugee communities. Katzel said such violence hasn’t affected her work in Maine. “Most people understand that there can be isolated events and tend to not really translate that onto an entire population,” she said.In Maine, Somali immigrants were first resettled in Portland, the state’s largest city. They were then resettled further north, in the Lewiston-Auburn area, where housing is cheaper, said Elizabeth Eames, a Bates College associate professor of anthropology. Population estimates suggest that the Lewiston-Auburn area now has the largest percentage of Somali refugees in the country, with about 8,000 of its 65,000 residents of Somali origin, she said.Such an increase in students who need extra services can test a school district. On February 7, the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, along with local disability rights groups, released the results of a two-year investigation of the Lewiston schools for violations of federal civil rights and disabilities laws. In a letter to Lewiston Schools Superintendent Bill Webster, the group alleged that students of color, including Somali refugees and students with disabilities, are disciplined more often and are less likely to get the support they need.Webster defended the school district’s work in meeting the needs of all students. He noted that the ACLU’s data is several years old, and that last year the system’s five-year completion rate for students from immigrant homes was greater than that for students from homes where English is the primary language. He cited a 78 percent rate for immigrants and a 73 percent rate for native English speakers. In Portland, in addition to teaching newly arrived students English, school officials reach out to immigrant parents through the system’s Multilingual & Multicultural Center. The center also connects volunteer mentors to students and trains teachers to help children who may have endured trauma. The Portland school district currently serves students who speak 60 languages other than English, with Somali and Arabic being the most common, according to Grace Valenzuela, the center’s director. Overall, about 30 percent of the district’s 6,800 students speak a language other than English as their first language. Of those English language learners, almost a third speak Somali, she said.The immigrant experience is familiar to Portland Schools Superintendent Xavier Botana; he came to America from Cuba in the early 1960s. In an open letter after the Casco Bay High confrontation, Botana affirmed the school system’s commitment to all its students, whether they are immigrants, refugees or native-born Americans. On February 6, a little more than a week after the incident, local police charged a white 20-year-old Portland resident with a hate crime and assault, and he pleaded not guilty. He is accused of confronting two Casco Bay students, and brandishing a sharp object after shouting racial slurs to a group of students on the street near the high school. The January 27 incident sparked several rallies and marches in support of the students and against hate. On the following Monday, someone hung pink papers that said “You Are Loved” on the bus shelter in front of the school, near where the incident took place. “Our students acted exactly as we would want them to act,” Botana wrote in his open letter. “They exemplified the ideals on which Casco Bay High School was founded and made us all proud.”Botana’s letter became a political flashpoint in Maine. In it, Botana also criticized President Donald Trump’s travel ban, as well as the president’s intention to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The head of the Maine Republican party accused Botana of using taxpayer money to advocate a political point of view. Botana countered that January’s unsettling local and national events had created a negative climate for immigrant students, and it was his duty as an educator to put them in context.Related: Schoolchildren “have a lot of questions and a lot of fear” in aftermath of Trump victoryNimo Saeed, a Somali immigrant who owns the Mini Mogadishu restaurant, said the police had stopped by recently to check on her and offer assistance if she needed it. She hasn’t experienced any problems, she said, but they would likely pale in comparison with what she experienced back in Somalia.“The American people don’t know what bad is,” she said as she served sweet tea spiced with cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. “We’ve been through a Civil War, we know what bad is.”But Casco Bay High senior Samira Ahmed, 17, who came to the United States with her Somali family when she was only seven and has thrived in Portland, said the alleged assault burst the protective bubble of the school where she has always felt accepted. “It showed the reality of what is happening in the U.S.,” she said.Elizabeth Szatkowski and Sarah Compton, members of the Casco Bay High School parent advisory group, strongly support the multicultural environment in Portland schools.“It has given my daughters the opportunity to hear from other people in authentic ways,” said Szatkowski, whose older daughter is in college and whose younger daughter is a junior at the high school. “It’s not just an add on. It’s part of the fabric of their education.”Compton, who has two sons at the school and is the advisory group’s president, said, “Most of my older son’s friends are Muslim. It’s a world he wouldn’t have been exposed to because our day-to-day community is not that diverse.”Both women, who are white, said one of the biggest challenges has been integrating parents from other cultures into the school’s parent community. Language is a barrier, and also a sense that schools should take care of school life, while parents take care of home life.“We had a group of parents who reached out to multilingual parents to come to school activities and it was difficult,” said Szatkowski, a clinical social worker who runs programs for the mentally ill. “It’s such a …. Western way of being involved in the school.” Across town, at Deering High School, where several student council co-presidents are Muslim immigrants, a few hundred students rallied on the school sidewalk on a recent Friday afternoon. They called it a “Stand of Solidarity” with Casco Bay students and immigrants in general. They held posters that read: “A country built by immigrants should stand tall by its immigrants” and “Spread Love, Not Hate.” Drivers honked their horns in support as they passed in their cars. On the opposite side of the street, mothers in hijabs stood smiling, holding signs of their own: “No Hate, No Fear, No Wall, No Ban” and “Immigrants are Great Neighbors.”Related: Student voices: A daughter of undocumented Mexican immigrants and ‘heartbroken’ by the Muslim travel banDr. Abdullahi Ahmed, Deering’s assistant principal, watched but did not participate.

A principal noticed his teaching talent and encouraged him to pursue a degree in education. He now has a family, a doctorate and a high-profile job.It takes courage for an immigrant to put down roots in an unfamiliar place, Ahmed said, just as it takes courage for a community to open its doors to the strangers in their midst. Schools are on the frontline of this march toward integration and acceptance as they welcome students to life in America. Those children can then help their parents navigate this new world.But both the community and the immigrant must adapt, Ahmed said. “It’s a two-way street.”This story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

21,POLITICS,Supreme Court Torn Over Whether Constitution Should Apply To Cross-Border Shootings,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-border-shootings_us_58ac799be4b002e2bdc78d7e,Civil liability is the only avenue left for parents of a Mexican teenager shot to death by a U.S. Border Patrol agent.,2017-02-21,"Picture of the place where in 2010 Mexican 15-year-old Sergio Hernandez was killed by a U.S. border patrol agent on the Mexican bank of the Rio Grande in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58acad01290000f616f27e13.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― As the administration of President Donald Trump readies a new crackdown on undocumented immigrants, the Supreme Court on Tuesday weighed a difficult case that could open federal courts to Mexican nationals whose family members are killed at the border by U.S. authorities.The sobering case of Sergio Hernandez ― a 15-year-old standing on Mexican soil when he was shot in the head by a U.S. Border Patrol agent from the American side ― found the justices wrestling with whether a non-citizen has any constitutional rights at the border. The answer will determine whether a federal law enforcement officer who violates a person’s fundamental right to not be killed can be sued.“You have a very sympathetic case,” Justice Stephen Breyer told Bob Hilliard, the lawyer representing Hernandez’s parents, who didn’t attend the hearing. The family hopes the American justice system can help them press their civil rights claims against U.S. Border Patrol Agent Jesús Mesa, who killed their son in 2010.According to the parents’ lawsuit, Hernández and other boys were playing in the cement river bank of the Rio Grande, which separates the neighboring cities of El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. Suspecting they were smugglers, Mesa approached the teens and moved to apprehend one. Some began to throw rocks, and Mesa opened fire in self-defense, according to a Department of Justice investigation. Hernández, shot from the opposite side of the river, was killed. At the center of the justices’ concern during oral arguments in Hernandez v. Mesa was whether the court has the capacity to fashion a narrow rule that may provide relief to victims like the parents of Hernández ― without exposing the federal government to civil liability for other kinds of violence abroad.“How do you analyze the case of a drone strike in Iraq, where the plane is piloted from Nevada?” Chief Justice John Roberts asked Hilliard. “Why wouldn’t the same analysis apply in that case?”Hilliard, a longtime trial lawyer who has represented the Hernandez family throughout the case, struggled to give a straight answer on the proper standard courts should apply to cross-border shootings. In 2015, an appeals court ruled that the Constitution doesn’t apply to these kinds of incidents, essentially insulating Mesa and others like him from cross-border liability.“We need to have a rule ... that can be applied in other cases,” said Justice Samuel Alito. “But you need to give us a principle that’s workable.”Time and again, the justices and the lawyers referred back to Boumediene v. Bush, a landmark, post-9/11 precedent that established that foreign-born detainees at the Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba had a due-process right to challenge their detention.Justice Anthony Kennedy was pivotal in that decision, which granted constitutional protections to the detainees. But on Tuesday, Kennedy didn’t seem so sure that civil liability should extend to federal law enforcement officers who fire across the border ― and suggested that the solution instead rests with Congress and the executive branch.“You’ve indicated that there’s a problem all along the border,” Kennedy said. “Why doesn’t that counsel us that this is one of the most sensitive areas of foreign affairs, where the political branches should discuss with Mexico what the solution ought to be?”There is no law on the books that allows litigants to sue federal officials for constitutional violations. But the Supreme Court in 1972 ruled that courts can hear these kinds of cases under specific circumstances. Kennedy cautioned that the court hasn’t extended this doctrine since 1988, and indicated that this may not be the right case to do it.As legal twists would have it, Tuesday’s hearing was the first time the Trump administration presented an oral argument before the justices. The case began under the Obama administration, and Edwin Kneedler, the experienced lawyer who argued for the government, took a strong position against the Mexican teen’s family.This case “gives rise to foreign relations problems, which are committed to the political branches,” Kneedler said.At one point, Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked Kneedler if he had seen video of Sergio’s death on YouTube, which appears to contradict the Justice Department account that Mesa acted in self-defense. “Border policemen are shooting indiscriminately from within the United States across the border,” Sotomayor said.If the Supreme Court rules that the Hernandez family can get no relief in federal court for Sergio’s death, they’d have nowhere else to turn. The Justice Department declined to prosecute Mesa in 2012, and the federal government rejected a separate request from Mexico to extradite the officer there for prosecution. Civil liability is the only avenue left.Justice Elena Kagan suggested that because Hernandez v. Mesa is a “sui generis” case ― limited to an area where there’s no clear line of demarcation between Mexico and the U.S. ― that maybe the Supreme Court should try something more nuanced than an all-or-nothing approach.“The dividing line isn’t even marked on the ground. Isn’t that right? You can’t tell on the ground where Mexico ends and the United States begins,” Kagan said. “I don’t know whether to call it a no-man’s land, but it’s this liminal area, which is kind of neither one thing nor another thing.”Given the complexities of the case, it is possible the court may split 4-4, which would set no legal precedent. To avoid that result, the justices may choose to wait until Neil Gorsuch, Trump’s nominee to the seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, is confirmed. By then, the court may also choose to hold a new oral argument.A decision is expected by the end of June.Trump’s Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday declared open season on undocumented immigrants living in the U.S., saying it will hire thousands of agents to deport “removable aliens” who have been charged or convicted of even minor crimes.Inside the courtroom, Roberts did something else to welcome the Trump era: He acknowledged the 84th attorney general of the United States, Jeff Sessions, who was in attendance. This recognition will be a part of the Supreme Court’s public record."

The other was shot and wounded. Eleven minutes later, as the wounded man, Abd Elfatah Ashareef, 21, lay on the ground unable to move, Azaria, then 19, took aim with his rifle and put a bullet in his head.With the 50th anniversary of Israel’s wartime capture of the West Bank approaching, the trial generated debate about whether the military, in accusing Azaria of violating open-fire rules and its ethical code, was out of touch with a public that has shifted to the right in its attitudes towards the Palestinians.In one poll, nearly half of Israeli Jews said any Palestinian attacker should be killed on the spot.A three-judge military court convicted Azaria of manslaughter last month, a crime that carries a maximum 20-year term. Prosecutors had asked for a three-to-five year sentence, noting the soldier had shot an assailant who had carried out an attack only minutes earlier.Passing an 18-month sentence, the court said Azaria, whom it demoted to the rank of private, had “taken upon himself to be both judge and executioner” and had not expressed regret for his crime.But it said it was passing a lighter sentence than requested partly because it had been Azaria’s first combat experience and his record had been unblemished up until then. Nonetheless, Ilan Katz, one of Azaria’s defense attorneys, said they would appeal the manslaughter conviction.“They are laughing at us,” Ashareef’s father, Yusri, told Reuters after the sentence was announced. The Palestinian government said the decision gave Israeli soldiers a “green light” to carry out “executions” without fear of real punishment.“HE DESERVES TO DIE”It seemed unlikely that the sentence would lead to any significant outbreak of anti-Israeli violence, which has largely waned since a flurry of street attacks that began in October 2015. Palestinians have long accused Israel of using excessive force against lightly armed attackers, and harbor few expectations soldiers will be held accountable.At his trial, Azaria said he believed the Palestinian, though motionless, still posed a danger because his knife was nearby, and that he might have been carrying explosives. “He deserves to die,” Azaria was quoted in the verdict as telling another soldier after pulling the trigger.After the sentencing, there was no immediate comment from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is on an official visit to Singapore and Australia. Shortly after Azaria’s arrest, the right-wing leader took the unusual step of calling the soldier’s family to express his sympathy.Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman, commenting on Facebook after the jail term was announced, said the “terrorist had come to kill Jews and everyone must take this into account.”Rallies for Azaria, some backed by rightist politicians and pop singers, gathered momentum as the trial progressed. “Israel’s Hero,” read one sign at a demonstration attended by dozens of supporters near the courtroom as the sentence was read out.In the courtroom, in a military base in central Tel Aviv, Azaria’s family and friends sang Hatikva, the Israeli national anthem, after the judges left. Azaria, confined to his camp during the trial, was ordered to begin serving his sentence on March 5.(Writing by Jeffrey Heller; editing by Ralph Boulton; Editing by Mark Trevelyan)"

The Wall Street Journal recently reported that intelligence officials have withheld information from the president because they are concerned it could be leaked.Chaos surrounding the National Security Council has come to a head following retired Gen. Michael Flynn’s resignation as national security adviser earlier this month. Flynn announced his split from the White House after he admitted to having misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations Flynn had with the Russian ambassador in December regarding U.S. sanctions against Russia.Trump’s first choice to succeed Flynn, Vice Adm.

He came to me at 4 years old, while still in preschool, and mentioned that he wanted to start a ‘company’ to feed the poor,” Diana recalled. “My husband and I are still not sure what he heard or witnessed to feel this way at such a young age. At the time our children were approximately 4, 3, and 1 year old, and we were just trying to make it through those tough toddler years,” she added.“So, we appeased his request by pulling some food out of our own kitchen and taking him down to the local food pantry to donate it.”Kaden loved how it felt to donate food and asked to go back to the food pantry, so for the next three years, the Newtons continued to visit on a regular basis. During that time, Kaden expanded his role from dropping off food to touring the food pantry and becoming even more emotionally invested in the process. “He was very aware of the families sitting in the waiting room waiting on their food and specifically would inquire to me about the young children there,” Diana recalled. “He also was very aware that many of the food items were not items that those kids could look forward too.

He grew to have a special place in his heart to take care of those young kids that he had seen waiting on their next meals.”Thus, on February 2, 2017, Kaden officially launched “Mac & Cheese and Pancakes” ― the “company” he’d envisioned at age 4.

Within a week of its official launch, “Mac & Cheese and Pancakes” received over 5,000 items from across the country. Local newspapers and television stations shared Kaden’s story and by week two, he’d reached over 10,000 items donated. “His initial goal for ‘Mac & Cheese and Pancakes’ was about 5,000 items, of which 1,000 he hoped could come from the Amazon Wishlist,” Diana told HuffPost. “As of February 19th, the total tally was in excess of 10,300 items, approximately 12,360 pounds.”Though the Newtons have asked their son repeatedly if he feels his work is done now that he’s surpassed his goal, his answer is always no.“Kaden has decided to continue work on ‘Mac & Cheese and Pancakes’ and bring food to as many families as possible,” Diana said. “He is a goal-oriented child who finds tremendous joy whenever a goal is met.

Dallas County Assistant District Attorney Stephanie Martin, speaking to reporters after the sentence came down, called the case “unprecedented” in bringing criminal charges against a doctor for “surgeries gone wrong.”Jurors heard testimony at trial about failed back operations on multiple victims, including a friend of Duntsch’s who was left a quadriplegic. Many of the injured suffered massive blood loss, according to The Dallas Observer.Duntsch lost his medical license in 2013. He was arrested on five aggravated assault charges in 2015. But he was ultimately tried for what happened to one victim, Mary Efurd, who was 74 at the time of her surgery in 2012.Efurd, who was looking for help with back pain, suffered permanent damage from the operation and must now use a wheelchair, the jury was told. “I trusted him,” Efurd testified at trial, according to The Dallas Morning News. “I trusted that he would do what was right.”The husband and daughter of another victim, 55-year-old Kellie Martin, who died in 2012 following back surgery, reacted with tears of joy following the jury’s decision.It “won’t obviously bring my mom back and it won’t heal the 34 people that have been affected,” said daughter Caitlin Martin-Linduff, according to The Associated Press, “but it will bring some sense of justice and particularly some sense of closure.”His defense team tried to suggest that ignorance was an excuse for Duntsch’s behavior. “The problem was that he was not a trained surgeon. He was not a skilled surgeon,” defense attorney Robbie McClung said, according to the Morning News. “He was, according to his peers, at the level of a first-year resident.”But prosecutors said Duntsch knew exactly what he was doing, having spent 17 years in medical school, residency and fellowships.“He obviously knew at some point that what he was doing was criminal,” Dallas County District Attorney Faith Johnson said at Monday’s press conference, according to the Observer."
32,POLITICS,"Milo May Not Be Going To CPAC, But Gay Conservatives Won't Forget The Invite",Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/milo-yiannopoulos-cpac-lgbt-conservatives_us_58abac89e4b07028b7034791,Another slight endured at the annual conservative gathering.,2017-02-21,Milo Yiannopoulos would have been the most high-profile openly gay speaker in CPAC’s history. But he is not the ideal standard-bearer for gay Republicans.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58abad3c280000af8f99a238.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The controversy, like many these days, was ephemeral, but the damage will linger. In less than a day, the organizers of the annual conservative confab CPAC (Conservative Political Action Conference) booked professional provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos to headline the gathering before rescinding the invitation after video emerged of him seemingly condoning pedophilia. It was a momentary embarrassment for the organization. But for the gay rights activists within the Republican Party, it revived the anger and befuddlement that seems to come each year at CPAC, leaving little sense of relief at the outcome.Yiannopoulos would have been the most high-profile openly gay speaker in CPAC’s history. But he is anything but the ideal standard-bearer for these activists. He has a history of bigotry toward other minority groups, including Muslims, Jews and even gays, whom he has insisted should bottle up their pride rather than have it accepted or celebrated. That he was embraced by organizers of the yearly event was yet another indication that gay conservatives are still viewed as a sideshow and not a constituency whose issues remain very raw and serious.“It is an unfortunate realization of a goal for so many,” James Richardson, an openly gay, longtime GOP operative, said before the invitation was rescinded. “For years the LGBT community was blacklisted from CPAC, and now we have an unlikely champion of the movement set to speak. Unlikely, because he is absolutely not a champion. Not at all.”It is an annual tradition for conservative LGBT groups and CPAC organizers to wage private and not-so-private battles about the composition of the conference. Usually these are fought over the smallest of terrain. Gay groups have struggled to be granted the opportunity for mere sponsorship or the chance to host a booth among the dozen organizations in the halls. A modicum of progress has come recently but in curious, minor forms. For instance, the head of the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay rights organization within the party, was allowed to appear at CPAC in 2015, but only on a panel on Russia policy. In 2013, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida turned heads when he labeled marriage a states’ rights issue, yet he was only implying that he didn’t favor a constitutional amendment to forbid it. And last year, a debate was held on the place of gay marriage in the libertarian and traditionalist wings of the party, where a consensus didn’t form on same-sex marriage but instead on religious freedoms. In these recent years, attendance by gay rights activists has dipped as CPAC has been viewed more as a venue for poli-entertainment than a place where an earnest debate about the state and future of conservatism can be had. That Yiannopoulos was invited to speak this year was, for the activists, an illustration of the charade. “There are a lot of us who took a lot of hits over the years to help the conservative movement to evolve on some cultural issues, and this is less than a victory given the nature of Milo’s act and schtick,” said Jimmy LaSalvia, a gay activist who has left the Republican Party. Officials at CPAC, including its chairman, Matt Schlapp, did not comment for this article. But, behind the scenes, officials acknowledged that the Yiannopoulos invitation was poorly thought out. One organizer conceded that gay groups had a right to feel hurt that CPAC was bestowing such a symbolic breakthrough on someone philosophically removed from gay activists in the GOP and with so few accomplishments in their movement. Robert Traynham, a longtime gay GOP operative, suggested that a figure like Rich Tafel, the founder of the Log Cabin Republicans, would have been far better suited for the role. “It seems to me that he would have been much more appropriate compared to Milo, who is a flash in the pan,” Traynham said. “Yes, he does have a following. Yes, he is provocative and you can make the argument that some organizers of CPAC thought that might be a good thing. With the benefit of hindsight, it proved to not be.” As Traynham hinted, Yiannopoulos does, in some regards, reflect the odd moment that the conservative world finds itself in with respect to gay rights. He is, after all, a product of Breitbart News. And long before there was that modicum of progress at CPAC with respect to gay rights issues, it was Andrew Breitbart, the website’s founder, who was demanding it. A staple at CPACs, Breitbart, who died in 2012, often held court and caused stirs with liberal agitators who walked among the attendees. Behind the scenes, he advocated forcefully for gay attendees and issues.“I don’t understand the concept that a gay person cannot be a conservative; there are so many different things that conservatism stands for,” he told The Huffington Post at 2012’s CPAC. “I see the issue from the vantage point that I don’t even think the media can contemplate. I see how the issue has been settled by the American people that we do live in an incredibly tolerant nation.”Yiannopoulos’ rise also has come amid the political ascendance of the alt-right, with President Donald Trump as its most prominent beneficiary or, alternatively, star. And Trump himself has taken a far more open-minded approach to gay rights than prior Republican nominees or presidents. In the age of Trump, it made some sense to have a similarly provocative figure be the one to break boundaries at institutional conservative functions, argued one prominent gay conservative, who asked not to be named so as to not end up associated with another “Milo controversy.” And yet he still wouldn’t have extended the invitation. “I think it was an in-your-face decision, and I wouldn’t have made it,” he said. “It’s a bridge too far and too fast. If you’re going to have a gay conservative speak at CPAC, make it an intellectual argument. This is entertainment.” By un-inviting Yiannopoulos, CPAC officials hoped that they could quickly stem the tide of anger that erupted when they first chose to bring him to the gathering. It certainly appears to have sparked a broader reconsideration within the conservative and nonconservative universe, with Yiannopoulos’ position at Breitbart apparently no longer secure and his book deal having been axed. But for the gay conservative crowd that has locked horns with CPAC on a yearly basis, it’s yet another indignity that they won’t quickly forget.“It doesn’t really change anything for me,” said LaSalvia. “I don’t think he should have been invited in the first place. I think that his schtick cheapened the important work we did. Yes, we pushed the envelope sometimes, but he goes too far, routinely stepping over the line of decency. He shouldn’t have been on the stage to begin with.” "

A live helicopter feed from KHOU 11 showed patients being wheeled out of the building in their beds.Ben Taub has been the scene of at least two other shootings. In 2014, a 58-year-old man shot his female co-worker because she ignored his romantic advances. He then killed himself. And in 2016, an inmate took a medical student at the hospital hostage before a deputy shot the suspect twice.“This is still an ongoing situation,” Acevedo said. “But there’s no evidence yet of an actual shooting.”"

A triangular slab of shopping cart hovers atop them. They’re materials you might find piled high in your attic or garage, and pay them little heed.Through Shrobe’s practice, however, the domestic materials are chopped up, rearranged and reincarnated, forming an unlikely canvas. A ghostly figure hovers atop the amassed materials, his or her invisible face demarcated by a frilly collar and decadent cape. The image of old fashioned nobility is shoved up against the stuff of modern-day detritus, forming a hybrid image that’s hard to place, but harder to shake.“I’ve been collecting objects from in and around my family’s home in Harlem for many years,” Shrobe, a fourth-generation Harlem resident, wrote in an email to The Huffington Post. “Sometimes they make it into a work, sometimes they sit in the studio for months or years before I find their purpose. I’m often drawn to things that speak to a sense of home, things that are commonplace in our communities. They say a lot about us, from social status to the things we consume and the environments we live in.” In his exhibition “Homegrown,” which recently closed at Thierry Goldberg Gallery, Shrobe fuses his found materials into portraits that feel over-crowded and otherworldly. The artists responds to the elitist and exclusive tradition of classical portraiture with a visual display of texture, heterogeneity and abundance, offering an alternative to portraiture’s elitist roots and singular perspective. With the show’s title, Shrobe hopes to address the current political climate, raising the question of who is deemed a “true American” and why. “It came from questioning ideas about our nationalism and what it means to belong to one’s country or home, and the ways I see that being challenged, both now and throughout history,” he said. “It also speaks to ideas about consumption and domesticity and having a connection to the materials I find.”Shrobe invites these materials, including clocks and mirrors and doorknobs and ceiling tins, to speak for themselves, allowing viewers to connect to and identify with them as they please. Through literally slicing up traditions of portraiture and rebuilding them anew, he makes space for a new kind of identity, which embraces multiplicity down to its core. “As a painter, I am always pushing my affinity for painting and interested in what painting can be and how it can function in this contemporary moment,” Shrobe said. “Collapsing divisions between past, present and future gives birth to fragmented portraits, mythological beings and hybridized forms who are not oriented to a specific time or place, but rather floating in a space of disquieting coexistence.”Shrobe’s work, reminiscent of contemporary artist Titus Kaphar, offers a new model for representation, one that acknowledges the complexity and brokenness of its subjects.

38,MEDIA,Breitbart Editor Calls Milo Yiannopoulos Comments 'Indefensible' As His Future With The Site Remains In Doubt,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/breitbart-news-milo-yiannopoulos_us_58ab59e5e4b07028b7030189,The conservative provocateur has already lost a high-profile speaking gig and a major book deal for appearing to condone pedophilia.,2017-02-21,"Milo Yiannopoulos, a conservative columnist and internet personality, holds a press conference down the street from the Pulse Nightclub on June 15, 2016, in Orlando, Florida.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ab5bb5280000af8f99a151.jpeg?cache=Yyu8FnR0uo&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"UPDATE: 2:45 p.m. ― On Tuesday afternoon, Milo Yiannopoulos announced his resignation from his post as senior editor of Breitbart News. “Breitbart News has stood by me when others caved,” he said in a statement. “They have allowed me to carry conservative and libertarian ideas to communities that would otherwise never had heard them. They have been a significant factor in my success. I’m grateful for that freedom and for the friendships I forged there.” Previously:Milo Yiannopoulos’ recently surfaced comments about sexual relationships between older men and minors are “indefensible” and “appalling,” Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow said on Tuesday, though he stopped short of severing ties with the Breitbart senior editor and right-wing provocateur. “It’s all very upsetting and something we take very seriously at Breitbart,” Marlow said on the site’s daily Sirius radio show. He said Yiannopoulos would address his future with the site at a Tuesday afternoon press conference. Over the past 24 hours, Yiannopoulos has lost a major book deal with Simon & Schuster and a high-profile speaking slot at this week’s Conservative Political Action Conference, an event featuring speeches by President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.His career began unraveling this past weekend after the Reagan Battalion, a conservative site, circulated a 2016 interview he gave on the Drunken Peasants podcast. During the interview, Yiannopoulos defended the notion of sexual relationships between 13-year-old boys and older men and, in addressing his own abuse claims, joked about how a priest taught him to give oral sex. Those remarks were apparently a step too far beyond the routine misogyny and bigotry that have propelled Yiannopoulos from Internet personality to increasingly mainstream conservative author and commentator. Until now, his incendiary attacks and outrageous antics had been good for business. He has mocked Muslims, Black Lives Matter protesters, women and transgender people, the latter of whom he described Friday night on HBO’s “Real Time with Bill Maher” as suffering from a “psychiatric disorder.” He’s written approvingly about the “alt-right,” a meme-filled movement with ties to white supremacy and anti-Semitism. And he was permanently suspended from Twitter last year after his followers barraged Ghostbusters star Leslie Jones with abusive and racist tweets. Yiannopoulos’ latest controversy, however, prompted both CPAC and Simon & Schuster ― that latter already dogged by criticism for giving him a $250,000 advance ― to break ties with him on Monday. CPAC rescinded its invitation “due to the revelation of an offensive video in the past 24 hours condoning pedophilia,” Matt Schlapp, chair of the American Conservative Union, said in a statement.Yiannopoulos denied that charge in a Facebook post on Monday. “I am a gay man, and a child abuse victim,” he wrote. “I would like to restate my utter disgust at adults who sexually abuse minors. I am horrified by pedophilia and I have devoted large portions of my career as a journalist to exposing child abusers.”Though Yiannopoulos claimed the videos were “edited deceptively,” he acknowledged being “partly to blame” for the impression they left. Being a victim, he said, “led me to believe I could say anything I wanted to on this subject, no matter how outrageous.” “But I understand that my usual blend of British sarcasm, provocation and gallows humor might have come across as flippancy, a lack of care for other victims or, worse, ‘advocacy,’” he continued. “I deeply regret that. People deal with things from their past in different ways.”While Yiannopoulos responded on Facebook, the typically combative Breitbart News was uncharacteristically quiet amid reports of its staff members’ concerns and even possible upheaval at the site.Breitbart News has vigorously defended Yiannopoulos during previous controversies, running more than a dozen stories about Twitter’s decision to ban him last July. The site closely covers Yiannopoulos’ escapades, which are favorably framed as part of ongoing battle against excessive political correctness in the media and on college campuses. On Sunday, the site published an interview with Yiannopoulos with the headline “Milo: One Gay Brit Has Done More For Conservatism Than 30 Years of Establishment Conservatives.”Marlow did not respond to The Huffington Post’s request for comment on Monday, but did address the controversy Tuesday on air. “Many of you love Milo. Many of you are confused by Milo,” Marlow said. “But all of you have an opinion about him, for the most part. And he was in the news for unfortunate reasons yesterday.”Marlow said Yiannopoulos’ comments were “very troubling and upsetting,” though he clarified that Yiannopoulos said he had never had inappropriate contact with a minor as an adult. He also said Yiannopoulos’ claims of being abused as a child are relevant context for his remarks. While Marlow repeatedly disavowed Yiannopoulos’ comments, he also took aim at liberals, who have normalized similar behavior, he claimed. The circulation of the podcast video appears to be a “coordinated hit” by members of the left, the Republican establishment and the “Never Trump” movement, Marlow added.Yiannopoulos had just come off a chummy interview with Maher on Friday, would have addressed the conservative faithful at CPAC this week and had a likely best-seller coming in June. Since the podcast interview wasn’t recent, Marlow suggested these anti-Yiannopoulos forces waited “until they could do the most damage to his career and to Breitbart, and by proxy, people like Trump and [Steve] Bannon,” he said, referring to the former Breitbart chairman who is now the president’s chief strategist. Yiannopoulos indeed has ties to the Trump White House. In addition to previously working for Bannon, he has received praise on Twitter from Dr. Sebastian Gorka, a former Breitbart writer and current deputy assistant to the president. But Trump himself did perhaps the most to elevate Yiannopoulos’ profile nationally. When violent protests at the University of California, Berkeley led to the cancellation of Yiannopoulos’ scheduled appearance earlier this month, Trump threatened the university’s funding in a tweet to his more than 20 million followers.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ac7f9f280000d59899a452.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt mentioned a “toxic environment” just once during his first address Tuesday to the embattled agency staff.But he wasn’t talking about industry pollution or conserving nature. He was referring to his critics’ political rhetoric.“Forgive the reference, but it’s a very toxic environment,” the controversial new administrator said in the speech, which lasted under 20 minutes. “Civility is something I believe in very much,” he added. “We ought to be able to get together and wrestle through some issues in a civil manner.”Then, at last, he began to outline his vision for the EPA. He described an agency that prioritized making it easier for polluters to comply with regulations. He promised to listen intently to companies before saddling them with new regulations. He admonished his new employees, some fearing layoffs amid looming budget cuts, for acting outside the agency’s legal mandate and running roughshod over states’ rights.“Regulations ought to make things regular,” Pruitt said. “Regulations exist to give certainty to those they regulate. Those we regulate ought to know what’s expected of them so they can place and allocate resources to comply.”He did not mention climate change or environmental destruction. Pruitt, the former attorney general of Oklahoma, was sworn in last Friday after the Senate voted 52-46 to confirm his nomination. His confirmation came a day after Judge Aletia Haynes Timmons of the District Court of Oklahoma County ruled that the Oklahoma attorney general’s office must turn over more than 2,500 emails and correspondence between Pruitt and oil and gas firms. The ruling was in response to a lawsuit from watchdog group Center for Media and Democracy and the American Civil Liberties Union alleging that his office had violated Oklahoma’s open records law.“Scott Pruitt’s going to have a lot of questions to answer,” said Nick Surgey, the director of research at the Madison, Wisconsin-based Center for Media and Democracy, referring to the emails. “The head of the Environmental Protection Agency, on day three, is already talking about putting the interests of the environment against the interests of industry.” Democrats had sought to delay a vote on his confirmation until after those documents were released. Pruitt’s former office is expected to respond by the judge’s Tuesday evening deadline. Pruitt made his reputation suing the EPA 13 times, repeatedly joining oil, gas and coal players ― including Oklahoma Gas & Electric and the Domestic Energy Producers Alliance, an industry-backed group ― in filing lawsuits to halt regulations. He forged what The New York Times in 2014 called an “unprecedented, secretive alliance” between Republican attorneys general and oil and gas companies to undermine environmental regulations. In 2011, he allowed Devon Energy, an Oklahoma oil and gas firm, to write a three-page complaint to the EPA under his letterhead, which he signed. Pruitt also championed the rights of Exxon Mobil Corp. in investigations into whether the oil giant committed fraud by covering up evidence that burning fossil fuels changes the climate. In turn, the fossil fuel industry donated more than $300,000 to Pruitt between 2002 and 2016, and even more money to a political action committee and a super PAC that paid for the former Oklahoma attorney general’s trips to Hawaii and New Orleans. “I believe we as an agency and we as a nation can be both pro-energy and jobs and pro-environment,” Pruitt said Tuesday, regurgitating a line he used during his confirmation hearing last month. “We don’t have to choose between the two.” Pruitt’s contentious confirmation drew scorn from a variety of critics. He even plans to request an around-the-clock bodyguard from his agency, according to a report by E&E News. A senior energy official at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the country’s largest trade group with a history of combatting environmental rules, warned the new administration against repealing a 2009 EPA endangerment finding that classified greenhouse gases as a threat to public health and welfare. The comment underscores growing acceptance of the science of man-made global warming, particularly given that the Chamber’s official policy priorities for 2017 “oppose EPA efforts to regulate greenhouse gases under the existing Clean Air Act, including the endangerment finding.”“There’s going to be hell to pay from, you know, soccer moms and soccer dads all throughout the country,” Christopher Guith, the energy official, said last month, according to a transcript published by the nonprofit Energy and Policy Institute. “People who probably voted for Donald Trump.”President Donald Trump has made slashing environmental restrictions a top priority, and the EPA is a prime target of his regulatory bushwhacking. He tapped Myron Ebell, a once-fringe contrarian who peddles conspiracy theories about climate change, to lead the EPA transition team. Soon after the inauguration, the White House ordered the EPA to freeze grants, putting a vast array of projects and personnel in limbo. That freeze has been lifted, but the White House is considering gutting the EPA’s budget, which makes up just 0.22 percent of federal spending. A policy memo leaked to Axios proposed deep cuts to the EPA’s budget, including axing hundreds of millions from grants to states and Native American tribes, climate programs, and environmental programs and management. Trump’s transition team also instructed agency employees to halt all press releases, social media, blog posts and external speaking engagements ― giving rise to rogue Twitter accounts claiming to represent the views of the silenced regulators. The team announced plans to review all EPA studies before publication, stoking fears that the new administration might stifle research on issues such as climate change. Inside EPA reported earlier this month that Trump is weighing closing the agency’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, which handles both civil and criminal enforcement of the country’s core environmental laws, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Oil Pollution Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act. The move would be part of a broader attack on regulations, including an executive order signed last month requiring agencies to suggest two rules to be axed for every new one proposed. For some, Trump’s proposed cuts may not go far enough. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) introduced a bill to “completely abolish” the EPA by the end of next year, as HuffPost reported.Now that Pruitt is in place, Trump is expected to issue executive orders undoing Obama-era EPA rules on climate and water pollution as early as this week.

41,POLITICS,This McDonald’s Cook Helped Raise The Minimum Wage. Now He Wonders if Trump Will Lower It.,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fast-food-workers-minimum-wage-obama-washington_us_589b98ffe4b04061313b744e,Luis Chiliquinga and his colleagues convinced Obama to sign executive orders improving their pay and working conditions. But these days Trump holds the pen.,2017-02-21,"Chiliquinga, standing to Obama's left as he signed the $10.10 executive order.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/589b9aa825000034080b7d6f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The first time Luis Chiliquinga went on strike, he joined fellow fast-food workers and marched into his McDonald’s inside the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum. He wasn’t satisfied with his $8.25-per-hour wage, and he was tired of burning his hands on hot grease. As the strikers chanted, Chiliquinga walked right up to his manager and held up a protest sign.“I wasn’t scared,” Chiliquinga says of that first walkout, in 2013. If anyone seemed nervous, the 67-year-old says with a smile, it was management: “They were scared.”Chiliquinga has taken part in more than a dozen strikes and protests since then, all of them pillorying federal contractors for paying low wages and opposing unionization among their workers. The rabble-rousing has led to concrete gains. Chiliquinga now earns $12.77 per hour and gets paid time off. He doesn’t believe he’d have either if not for the pressure fast-food workers like himself brought to bear on employers and politicians.Yet Chiliquinga and his striking colleagues accomplished much more than that. They helped shape federal policy in a way that affects hundreds of thousands of other workers. Several of President Barack Obama’s executive orders may not have been issued at all if not for the courage of low-wage contract workers in Washington. Chiliquinga should know: He was invited to stand at Obama’s side in the White House when one of them was signed.Under President Donald Trump, those gains may not be permanent. While on the campaign trail, Trump promised to unwind Obama’s executive orders, and he has already started to make good on that pledge. Chiliquinga wonders if some of the progress he and his co-workers made could be vacated with the stroke of a pen ― even though Trump vowed to bring back good jobs and raise wages for struggling workers like him.“We fought very hard,” says Chiliquinga, a father of three. “We expect a living wage, not a minimum wage. It’s dignity. That’s why we pursued it.”Chiliquinga, who immigrated from Ecuador in 1996, lives in a group house with family in suburban Maryland, about 40 miles from the Air and Space Museum. The commute alone costs him more than an hour’s pay each day. In 2013, he joined a new, union-backed worker group called Good Jobs Nation, made up of D.C.-area fast food workers, janitors and cooks, all of them employed on federal properties. They wanted to call attention to the fact that the federal government underwrites a lot of poverty jobs. If the labor of people like Chiliquinga is funded by taxpayers, they argued, then their employers should be held to a higher standard. They called upon the Obama administration to use the federal government’s contracting power to improve pay and working conditions on federal properties around the country.The workers found allies in prominent liberal members of Congress, like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.). They held rallies, filed complaints against their employers, and appealed directly to the White House. Soon, the president got the message.In 2014, Obama announced that he would set a minimum wage of $10.10 for all workers employed under federal contracts, including people in fast-food joints at government buildings. Democrats wanted to set a nationwide minimum wage at the same level, but Republicans would not give that proposal a vote. Through his executive order, Obama made sure at least some workers would be paid a higher wage.A few months later, the Obama administration issued another executive order, this one creating a new rule punishing contractors with a history of labor law violations. The rule was crafted with input from Chiliquinga’s group. If a firm had a record of ripping off workers or putting them in danger, then the rule would make it harder for them to secure contracts with the government. The idea was to encourage contractors to treat their workers decently if they want to benefit from taxpayer money.Then Obama signed a third executive order related to federal contracts, this one guaranteeing paid sick days for workers. Democrats sought a nationwide paid leave law, but Republicans blocked that proposal just like the minimum wage. The White House estimated the executive order would bring roughly 300,000 workers up to seven sick days per year.Taken together, the executive actions represent a stunning success for the workers’ campaign. Powerful labor groups like the Service Employees International Union lobbied the White House for the reforms, but it was people like Chiliquinga walking off the job that created the public pressure for them. Just as the broader Fight for $15 spurred minimum-wage hikes coast to coast, it was the sight of federal contract workers taking to the streets that gave Obama the mandate to take unilateral action.“It was a consequence of our struggle. If we don’t do strikes, that might never happen,” Chiliquinga explains. “The government needs pressure. They are always under the pressure of the companies. If workers don’t make pressure, then they don’t move.”Already, some of that success has started to unravel since Obama left office. Earlier this month, House Republicans used an arcane procedural maneuver in an effort to undo the new rule barring companies that had committed wage theft from getting new contracts. Chiliquinga and his colleagues showed up at the Capitol to protest the vote, chasing after Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.) in an effort to confront her over gutting the new worker protections. If the Senate follows suit, the Labor Department will be forbidden from moving forward with Obama’s executive order, known as the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces rule. (It is already tied up in court, blocked by a temporary injunction.) By using the Congressional Review Act to kill it, Republicans would assure that the same rule cannot be revived in the future.Trump could reverse the minimum-wage and paid-leave measures, too, by writing his own executive orders vacating them. But doing so may not be worth the political costs. The minimum wage for contractors has become less relevant as more states and the District of Columbia raise their own minimum wages. Meanwhile, Americans overwhelmingly like the idea of hiking the wage floor and requiring employers to provide paid leave. If Trump wanted to abolish Obama’s rules and lower the minimum wage for cont, he would be taking positions out of step with most voters.Still, Trump has made clear he intends to strip regulations, pare back oversight and make life much easier for employers. Chiliquinga says he tries not to think about what Trump may do to the executive orders he and his co-workers helped make a reality. If they are wiped out, it won’t diminish the sense of accomplishment he feels. And if they stand, it won’t change his belief that Trump will work for the executives in the boardroom rather than cooks in the kitchen. “His vision of the economy is in his interests, not workers’,” Chiliquinga says. “That’s why we need to increase the pressure. We have to use our whole heart, and our whole mind, because it’s the only way to change our conditions.”Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

But there are a number of questions about how such a plan would be negotiated and implemented. Even if the U.S. were to somehow convince Gulf States to cover the huge costs of a safe zone, there is the more important issue of how the zones would be enforced.Declaring a safe zone, unlike building a border wall, does not create a physical deterrent that guards a certain area of land. Safe zones necessitate a huge military presence in order to provide protection for civilians, and there can be catastrophic consequences if those forces are unable to keep the area safe.A safe zone in northern Iraq that was briefly implemented in 1991 required 20,000 troops from a number of nations to protect. Analysts consider this safe zone a relatively successful case, but it involved a major military operation and tremendous resources, and it lasted only a few months. Syria’s conflict, meanwhile, looks unlikely to end anytime soon, and presents a far more complex situation than the Iraqi case.Any plan to implement safe zones in Syria and possibly neighboring countries would need to address threats from the Syrian regime, Russian air forces and a multitude of non-state armed groups involved in the conflict. Syrian President Bashar Assad rejected the idea of safe zones in an interview with Yahoo News earlier this month, saying that “it’s not a realistic idea at all.”If the U.S. doesn’t have the cooperation of the Assad government, experts say setting up safe zones in Syria with the aim of protecting internally displaced persons would be seen as a hostile act ― tantamount to carving out a piece of territory.“We can think it’s purely humanitarian, but it’s not going to be perceived as such,” said Daniel Byman, a professor at Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service. “You would need some forces on the ground, as well as air power.”Operating a safe zone would require defending the borders of the territory and policing the people within, particularly against infiltration from Islamic State militants and other armed groups. It could take tens of thousands of troops to properly secure such an area, analysts say.And safe zones can become hugely vulnerable targets if the forces meant to protect them fail to do so. In the Bosnian civil war, the United Nations-designated safe area of Srebrenica became the site of a massacre after Bosnian Serb troops overran the lightly defended town. The forces killed 8,000 Bosnian Muslims, committed rape and sexual abuse and forced tens of thousands to flee.Even if the safe zones were properly protected, analysts say the commitment to enforcing the zones would bring about the potential for increased U.S. intervention in Syria’s war and the dangers associated with that. One of the reasons former President Barack Obama was reluctant to pursue Syrian safe zones was the fear of such an escalation.“There was a concern in the Obama administration that this could lead to a slippery slope,” said Melissa Dalton, a Pentagon official during the Obama administration and current senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Did the U.S. really want to embroil itself in another protracted conflict that could expose U.S. forces and interests to great risk?”Despite the various challenges that safe zones present, they’ve been floated as an option in Syria almost since the start of the country’s conflict in 2011.Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Republican Sens. John McCain (Ariz.) and Marco Rubio (Fla.) have previously called for implementing safe zones in Syria. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan have also promoted the idea as a means of managing the exodus of refugees out of Syria.Trump advocated for safe zones during his presidential campaign, and an early draft of his executive order on immigration that circulated in the days after his inauguration contained a provision calling for “safe zones to protect vulnerable Syrian populations.” That part was left out of the final version of the executive order, for unknown reasons.Some analysts argue that politicians support the idea of safe zones because they see them as a way to help suffering people without actually getting into a war. But the reality tends to be more complicated than that.“This sounds good to most ears because it sounds like a halfway measure, but to me it’s actually more risky than both the alternatives, because you’re still not solving the problems in any way but you bring on a lot of costs and risk,” Byman said.As for Trump’s promise that Gulf States would somehow pay for these safe zones, Byman was skeptical: “That’s not gonna happen.”"

Not even in a final resting place.,2017-02-21,"<p>A photoshopped image showing a depiction of ‘me’ at a concentration camp with a yellow ‘Jude’ star, originally published on a neo-Nazi website and disseminated widely.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ab6808290000fe16f27a3a.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I walked into a concentration camp in Germany – and I walked out. A Jewish woman leaving a Nazi camp defies the odds and realities of millions of human beings.“If you are done with the alt-right you filthy kike, then fuck off to Israel or just get into the oven. Problem solved.” A man wrote me those words, which I read before coming face to face with the crematorium at a Nazi concentration camp in Germany, the very ovens where bodies of millions of Jews were incinerated.I found myself unexpectedly terrorized, shaken to my core — a horrific feeling that resurges upon hearing of or seeing the now near-daily occurrences of anti-Semitism and hate crimes. Never did I imagine visiting a concentration camp. Despite being born to a Jewish mother, I had zero desire and felt no family connection to the Holocaust. But there I found myself in Sachsenhausen: standing trapped within barbed wire and walls, fighting the most intense bone chill of my life, losing hope in humanity and in myself.On the heels of hearing a German parliamentarian negate that anti-Semitism is on the rise in Europe or worldwide, a cab driver affirm that Jews were responsible for 9/11, and a former neo-Nazi quote an Austrian military officer in saying his radical political beliefs would have been welcome had they won the war, I felt paralyzed – staring into the ovens in search of answers, of lessons, of direction.Still, I walked out through the gates of the concentration camp on my own two feet – because I could. Because I can. I retraced the fatal footsteps of 35,000 prisoners who were forced through that very same gate on a now infamous Death March. Even late in World War II, when it was clear that the Nazis were soon to fall to Allied powers, no one stopped to help the fragile souls in the streets of local towns.Houses were eerily close to the camp, adjacent to its walls, lining the perimeter, second story windows above the tops of the stone barriers. Residents cannot say they did not know what was happening, smell the burning corpses, note the ash falling from the sky, hear the screams of death, see the human beings forcibly marched by their doors.Along one border of Sachsenhausen lie former SS barracks. This very building where Nazi forces who tortured and murdered tens of thousands trained, restocked and strategized is now a training ground for modern day German state police.“They don’t see any connection between what was and what is now,” my tour guide responded, when I asked whether anyone recognized or vocalized the troublesome nature of that fact.I found her statement to be particularly terrifying. While the stories are far from identical, if we do not learn from history, it is doomed to repeat. I am ever reluctant to equate anything with the Holocaust and agree wholeheartedly with the statement by Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, in response to President Trump’s tweet asking if we were living in Nazi Germany. “No one should cavalierly draw analogies to Nazi Germany, especially the next leader of free world. It is not only a ridiculous comparison on the merits, but it also coarsens our discourse and diminishes the horror of the Holocaust. The President-elect should apologize for the remark.” We now find ourselves alive at a dramatically different moment in time – though striking similarities to 1930s and 1940s Germany continue to plague me in the form of troubling questions.The Holocaust did not begin with death camps and gas chambers. We say “never again,” but are we doing enough to combat the perilous rise in anti-Semitism, extremism, racism, nativism, xenophobia, Islamophobia, white supremacy, isolationism, the list goes on?Our country denied entry to the St. Louis during World War II; the majority aboard the ship were returned to Europe, where 254 Jews died. A young girl named Anne Frank was refused a visa to the United States; she perished in Nazi concentration camps at the hands of the very perpetrators she was attempting to escape. Is issuing a rash Executive Order to close our borders, ban refugees, and suspend visas to those fleeing veritable religious, ethnic and political persecution and violence the answer?On Kristallnacht (the Night of Broken Glass) in November of 1938, many thousands of synagogues, as well as Jewish homes, schools and businesses were damaged and destroyed throughout Germany. Gravestones in countless Jewish cemeteries were overturned and desecrated. Just yesterday, eleven bomb threats evacuated Jewish centers in cities across the country, while over one hundred headstones were toppled or damaged at a St. Louis Jewish cemetery, violently uprooting peaceful, prayerful places of rest. How does a country, a people, a government, law enforcement respond to this latest act of violence in a string of anti-Semitic hate crimes, which make up the largest portion of religiously-motivated attacks in the U.S. today?“I was just following orders” was a claim made by many Nazis in attempt to defend the indefensible during the Nuremberg trials – and lies at the heart of an ongoing, widespread debate about what does or does not constitute a war crime. Are there not parallels between that and the President of the United States justifying his spreading of lies by saying, “I was given that information” by some other actor?Government-ordered military deportation forces once rounded up millions of children and adults, permanently ripping apart families. The current administration is/was considering mobilizing as many as 100,000 National Guard troops to round up unauthorized immigrants, per an 11-page draft memo obtained by the Associated Press. Should any such action ever be put into motion, what is the best way to protect and defend the mental and physical safety of the most vulnerable, the minorities, the targeted in our own cities and towns – such that young people aren’t hiding terrified in attics?The Nazis rose to power in 1933, as anti-Semitism surged. Anti-Jewish laws were enacted, death camps operationalized, professionals barred from service, work or practice, immigration restricted, synagogues destroyed, shops looted, students expelled from schools, masses forced into ghettos and deported, and six million murdered by 1945. Jews were far from the sole group persecuted: gay and lesbians, political opposition, Gypsies, physically or mentally disabled, communists, priests, the list goes on of other groups targeted because of race, action or belief.“Fire up the ovens,” countless people have told me – in emails and across Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube. “You’re the oven-dodging kike who doesn’t belong in America but in Hell,” I heard, reinforcing the idea that I do not belong in the country in which I was born, in which I am a citizen, in which I have created a life.Where do they want me? Want us? Where do we turn? Where do we go from here?I have never been more acutely aware of the fact that I am Jewish than at this moment in history, with the newfound spike in anti-Semitism and hate crimes throughout the campaign season and since the election of the new president.When asked about the impact of his campaign rhetoric on spiking anti-Semitism in a recent press conference, Trump somehow responded by congratulating himself on his election victory margins – and stated that he knew Jewish people, including his son, daughter, and grandchildren without addressing the topic at all. When asked about how his administration plans to respond to the undeniable surge in anti-Semitism at a subsequent press conference, he responded by calling the Jewish reporter’s question unfair, saying he hated it and found it insulting, and instructed him to sit down without offering any answer whatsoever – aside from blaming the press. Trump called himself the “least anti-Semitic person that you’ve ever seen in your entire life,” though refuses to outright condemn by name, show up alongside, step up to protect the targeted, or order an investigation of the spike in hatred, hate-fueled violence and hate crimes against Jews or other peoples; the President and Administration are deafeningly and dangerously silent on anti-Semitism.An unprecedented 67 bomb threats have been phoned in to 56 Jewish centers across 27 states and one Canadian province since the start of the year has barely made headlines, yet invoked a paralyzing fear and terror in thousands of families, staff and community members of all faiths. A truck purposefully running over young Jews in Israel made the news cycle briefly. New Yorkers discovering and erasing swastikas from subway cars was a feel good story spotlighted for but a moment. A Chicago synagogue defaced with swastikas and a broken window is barely even searchable online.How many swastikas is too many? One. How many slurs? How many hate crimes?We ignore, deny, trivialize and understate horrors and attempt to normalize discrimination or hate speech until there is no possible alternative, until we find ourselves at the entrance of a death camp – metaphorically or in reality. We must remain vigilant and stay sensitized to both language and action, subtle and overt, specifics and generalizations, popular sentiment and government policies.As a Jew, I should not have walked out of that camp alive. I should have died within its walls, succumbed to the most debilitating bone chill of my life, toiled until my body collapsed, withered away without adequate nutrition. But I did not. And I will not.I said Kaddish for those who were murdered in death camps, for those who have been victims of crimes against humanity, for those who perish as the world watches, be it in Aleppo, in Chicago or in the Philippines. This is not solely about Jews, rather all of us, people of color, religious or ethnic minorities, the persecuted, the oppressed, the downtrodden, the needy, the victimized, the marginalized.Who will be the next ones rounded up from their homes? Sent to camps? Targeted by hatred? Decimated in a genocide?I want to be able to say that I would have been there to cross the bridge in Selma with Martin Luther King and John Lewis, that I would have been at the Salt March with Gandhi, that I would have been the one to harbor my Jewish neighbors when the Nazis came. So I stand, I speak, I march with my fellow females at the Women’s March, with my black and brown brothers and sisters in the streets of our cities, with my indigenous and native family at Standing Rock, with the immigrants and refugees who make our country what it is at the airports, with my LGBT community at Pride.I am for myself and my Jewish people, as I am for others. Because this is our continuous struggle for justice – for our humanity, our dignity, our future."
46,QUEER VOICES,"Let's Get ""Bromantic""? How ""Straight Acting"" Is Killing Gay Romance","Jeremy Helligar, ContributorJournalist, blogger and author, ‘Is It True What They Say Abou...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lets-get-bromantic-how-straight-acting-is-killing_us_58abb0c0e4b03250fc905e9f,"The other day an acquaintance's random comment about masturbation led to a revelation of the week.

It's one of my favorite parts of sex.""Him: ""I like the idea of a bro wank. Two dudes jerking off together. Not talking. Just trying to get off.""Me: ""’Bro wank’? Haha. I think it's better when there's intimacy involved.""Yup, he lost me at ""bro wank,"" but unintentionally, he also summed up what, for many, is the current status quo of gay romance – or rather, non-romance – in four short sentences. It begins and ends with two “dudes” acting like “bros.” How ""straight"" can you get - and that's precisely the intention. If you've been on a gay dating/hook-up app, you've likely encountered a large number of men who define themselves as ""straight acting"" and demand it in everyone they pursue or who pursues them. No fems. No queens. No camp. No girly.Centuries of rejection by heterosexuals has led to rejection within. If you can’t beat them, be them. We celebrate gay pride, yet so many of us aspire to being able to pass for straight, the way some desperate and beaten-down blacks used to try to pass for white.It's changed the way we communicate (or not) with each other – in and out of bed. If so many modern gay men weren't so obsessed with being ""straight-acting,"" ""bro wank"" would probably never enter a conversation between two guys sizing each other up as hook-up material.I shouldn't have been surprised. The guy I was talking to is in a relationship with someone he's never actually mentioned during any of our interactions. If they don't have sex in silence, it's probably because they don't have sex at all.But the ""bro wank"" is such a huge red flag, illuminating a behavioral trend that has come to define an expanding segment of the gay population. We've gone from wanting ""straight acting"" to compulsively trying to be “straight acting,” right down to the way we jerk off.It's in every ""Hey man...mate...buddy...bro"" on Grindr. Once you have the muscles and the tattoos (both former emblems of masculinity that have become practically de rigueur among gay men), it's time to walk the walk and talk the talk. I'm not sure if gay men trying to morph into straight men is a form of self-loathing, the natural next evolutionary step in the rejection of ""camp""/""queeny"" gay, or just us trying to be more like the type of guys we'd rather screw.It's as if we're so afraid of being mistaken for a human being with feelings (how feminine) that we're embracing a cliched version of masculinity, one that’s all bro stoicism and repression. It's gotten to the point where my straight male friends often treat me with more tenderness than guys who actually want to sleep with me.This gay “bromance” thing can’t possibly be good for gay romance.I recently met a guy in Newcastle who sent me so many “bro” signals that we both ended up walking out on each other during our second date.We’d slept together at the end of the first one, so I couldn’t understand why he’d asked me out again when he so clearly wanted me in the “bro” zone.He kept going out of his way to avoid having a moment with me on date number two, whether it was to buy a drink for a guy and the girlfriend he’d just proposed to on the karaoke stage, or to excuse himself to go outside and have a smoke every time I looked at him a little too long.When a group of people engaged me in conversation during one of his absences, I lost him for good. I looked everywhere for him, and when I couldn’t find him, I gave up and returned to my hotel.”Hours later, while I was in bed about to drift off into a dream I hoped would be sweeter than my romantic reality, a text arrived from him.“Yeah man I left didn’t want to crowd your thing hope you had fun,” he wrote.He kept repeating the “crowding me” excuse, dropped the phrase “holiday fun,” and then shocked me by insisting on seeing me again. I started to wonder if we’d been on the same date. Was this even the same guy?He did see me again when he came to Syndey the next weekend, and he was as charming and sexy as he’d been on our first date. But the next few times we spoke, he reverted to the “bro” ways of our date number two.Our final text conversation started innocently enough.Me: “Hey there. How have you been?”Him: “Hey man good - been over in Perth working - you good?Forced breeziness. Non sentences. Not good signs. But I took the plunge anyway.Me: “When are you heading back to Newcastle? I’m thinking about another road trip:)”Him: “Monday man”That was it. “Monday man.” Those were the last words either of us ever spoke to each other.In his defense, he’d told me on our third date that he didn’t see himself ever having another relationship. Was he stating a fact of his life or throwing me a hint? He certainly wasn’t going to let language get in the way of that certain-to-be self-fulfilling prophecy.I’m not sure if all those other “bro”-obsessed gays are so steadfastly anti-relationship. Presumably some of them do want to fall in love and have the white picket fence life that can come with it. But it’s hard to connect when your body language and your spoken language are working so hard to casually communicate indifference.My girlfriends used to tell me that I’m lucky to be gay because, unlike many straight men, gay men are so in touch with their feelings. They very well might be, but some of us are so busy trying to act ”straight” that our feelings have become irrelevant.Ashamed as I am to admit it, I can sometimes fall into the “bro” thing, though I would never actually use the word “bro.” At the very least, I’ve learned how to drop a well-placed “man” into everyday conversation.I may even sometimes prefer silence to chatter during sex. But the day I can’t stare into a guy’s eyes and look at him like I’m melting is the day I give up men for good."

I tear up in public sometimes and it’s mildly embarrassing.But as I’ve gotten older I’ve realized that this is not a weakness, it’s a strength.I am definitely more emotional about some things after having a baby. I cannot see the picture of the dead Syrian refugee toddler on the beach without crying. Motherhood makes our empathy raw and painful, so that we can hardly bear to think of a suffering child and what hell their mothers must be enduring.But this is not weakness, this empathy. This is our gift to the world. And make no mistake, it has an undergirding of steel.For too long women have been dismissed for having strong feelings and showing them. Branded “hysterical,” told we’re overreacting, even locked in the room with the yellow wallpaper. No, the Angel of the Hearth is supposed to be ever kind and patient and accepting and happy.And that mild patience is absolutely part of being nurturing and loving. And some of this is no doubt due to our stoic Anglo-Saxon culture, which puts even more pressure on men to maintain the stiff upper lip at all costs.But it is also true when women want to play on the same field as men, we are expected in our patriarchal cultural to behave like men or be dismissed as ‘weak’. The feminist movement has, after much struggle, made it more acceptable for women to behave like men. To be tough and strong. We revere these strong women who can play the man’s game in this man’s world. Rightfully so.But don’t dare show any sign of weakness. Don’t dare “get emotional” during a meeting with male colleagues. Don’t show any vulnerability. Never, ever let them see you cry. And by God, you’d better smile.But being strong and showing emotion are not mutually exclusive. To have the strength to show emotion and share our authentic inner life indicates security and acceptance of the human condition. Real strength comes from self-acceptance, knowing who you are, knowing where your power lies. Feeling secure enough to express your whole and authentic self in your everyday life. In reality, tears are often a very useful indication that we’ve touched on something important.Indeed, I wonder if this greater emotional intelligence is why I have seen many women who feel empowered when they reach middle age, while many men seem to fall into some kind of crisis. Beyond the mid-life crisis cliché of buying convertible sports cars and dating younger women. No, more subtle than that: a withdrawing, an increase in anger, an inability to enjoy the little things in life. A lifetime of repressing emotion takes its toll.In this way, women have an advantage in being “allowed” to cry and show emotion and affection. We also have the advantage in being ok with affectionate, platonic touch, something that is often sorely missing in men’s lives, in our culture which worships the masculine. For men, touch is so often sexualized—there is always the fear of being perceived as a pervert, predator, or of making unwelcome advances (on women or men). Women, as the nurturers, are thankfully not held to this same standard.Feminism has made it ok for women to be like men, and now it’s time to make it ok for men to be more like women. In fact, this is what the world sorely needs. We are suffering greatly from the effects of toxic masculinity, especially in the U.S. Toxic masculinity is what got us our current president—a narcissist devoid of real human emotion, constantly belittling others as “weak” and “losers.” Who can’t bear the thought of any of his male staff being portrayed by women. The horror!But this is not strength. This is the opposite of strength: craving external power to fill the void of insecurity and powerlessness inside.In my life, the strongest people have always been women. It’s the moms and the grandmas and the aunts and the friends who show up, relentlessly and fiercely, time and again. Who do what needs to be done. Who care for the weakest and pick up the pieces and clean up the messes. The mast of the ship you hold onto when the storm rages because you know they are strong and unwavering. And when you mess up, when you fall down, even when you hurt them—they are still there, unwavering, to show you what real love is. That is strength. That is the very bedrock of our humanity.But it’s not just emotional strength. Moms get shit done like no one else on earth. We’ve had the best training. It doesn’t matter how tired we are, kids need to be fed and cared for. And it doesn’t matter how sucked dry we are, they still need love. And so we endure. We get our hearts broken, yes, but—if we do it right—each time our hearts grow a little bigger. Until they are big enough to hold the world. Until there is no such thing as other people’s children. And then we just keep showing up, doing what needs to be done, for our kids and for the world’s kids. Relentlessly. This is our gift to the world.So don’t apologize anymore for feeling deeply, for being sensitive. For having empathy for other humans. For caring and for showing it. Instead, say: catch up. The world needs you.Previously published as ‘Why the World Needs Men Who Cry’ in The Wild Word magazine. www.thewildword.comFor more great Wild Word essays see:Why as a Christian Leader I am Choosing Resistance by Reverend Rachel KesslerAmerica, the Rest of the World is With You by Mike HemburyThe Beginning of the End of Donald Trump by Maria Behan"
48,POLITICS,A Watergate Prosecutor And Nixon Scholar Grade Trump After One Month,"Jim Robenalt, ContributorAuthor, Lecturer, Lawyer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-watergate-prosecutor-and-nixon-scholar-grade-trump_us_58ac5e1ae4b03250fc905f45,"Sadly, a little more than a month after his inauguration, he seems to be well beyond the Nixon paranoia.",2017-02-21,"<p>Justice Breyer, Jill Wine-Banks, Bob Woodward</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ac5e55280000ca3a99a39b.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As an Assistant Watergate Special Prosecutor who prosecuted President Nixon’s top aides and a scholar who has studied Nixon’s presidency, we wrote in the Huffington Post right after the election to warn President-elect Trump to beware of the consequences of some of his Nixonian tendencies. We now can grade him on how he is doing against those warnings. Spoiler alert: it ain’t pretty.We wrote that it was easy to see how these two men are alike—authoritarians, privately vulgar, thin-skinned, programmed to attack detractors, and disrupters who want to stick it to an establishment that rejected them.We passed along five pieces of advice, core lessons from the wars of Watergate. Our hope was that Trump would learn from Nixon’s downfall and clean up his act.Sadly, a little more than a month after his inauguration, as we look at those five points and grade him, he seems to be well beyond the Nixon paranoia, especially in his hatred of the press, his blind loyalty to incompetent and shady political advisers, and his tendency to brazenly battle with reality.1. Don’t Lie To The American People.This was a central problem for Richard Nixon (remember the saying was: “it’s not the crime, it’s the cover-up”) – and it is for Donald Trump too.Nixon thought he could lie with impunity because if “the President does it, it’s not illegal,” and because he was sure the world would never find out about his taping system, so he’d never be caught. But Nixon worked behind the scenes.Unlike Nixon, Trump lies openly and with seeming indifference to getting caught. He has fibbed about everything from the size of his inaugural crowd and electoral college win, to unfounded allegations of massive voter fraud, to an alleged terrorist attack in Sweden.He does this in an era of Google and instant fact-checking. Are these lies just to distract the public from the substance of his policies or his obvious lack of knowledge of foreign affairs and basic government? Or are they to condition many in America to “alternative facts” such that they start to ignore the truth as politically meaningless?Whatever the reason, lying in office carries a big risk for the Trump administration and the country. This is no longer a game of “follow the shiny object.”One lie can start a process that is difficult to reverse. In Nixon’s case, officials lied to the F.B.I and the grand jury and some received hush money to keep the cover-up going, until one-by-one they finally cracked and gave up other top officials in an effort to lessen their own criminal jeopardy. In the end, all of these officials went to jail, and Nixon had to resign.We think Mr. Trump fails to see how lying in office differs from lying in a campaign—there are consequences and laws that apply once you are in power.Take General Flynn, the National Security Adviser who President Trump was forced to fire for lying about discussing sanctions with the Russian ambassador before the inauguration. One, of course, is instantly reminded of Nixon’s treachery in undercutting President Johnson’s efforts to end the Vietnam War in Paris negotiations before the 1968 election. Nixon’s back-channel overtures to South Vietnam, urging them to hold off until he was elected, were called “treason” by Lyndon Johnson in a phone call with Republican Senator Everett Dirksen.Flynn’s lie was repeated by top administration officials, including the Vice President—possibly with the VP not knowing it was lie, but by some accounts, President Trump was fully aware that Flynn was lying and that the VP was repeating the lie.Reports are that General Flynn also lied to the F.B.I. about these discussions. Lying to the FBI is a federal crime and is exactly the sort of obstruction of justice that started the chain reaction that led to Nixon’s resignation. And this cover-up is potentially worse than Watergate because Flynn’s underlying actions were more than a felony burglary—his exploits potentially interfered with the conduct of foreign affairs, providing aid and comfort to an enemy.Once administration officials like Flynn start lying to federal investigators, they put themselves at risk for criminal prosecution.That leads to the hiring of lawyers, who in turn counsel clients to cut deals to avoid serious jail time, and so begins the cascade.One informant reveals another, and each new person in jeopardy tries to strike a plea bargain, which leads to more and more damning evidence emerging.If there is more to the Russian hacking and sanctions story, it will come out under this sort of pressure. So, in addition to being immoral and illegal, it is dangerous to start lying. Like Nixon, Trump has set the tone so that his top aides think lies are just acceptable “alternative facts.”Our grade: F.2. Be On Guard Against Isolation.We warned Trump that the presidency is the world’s loneliest job and urged him to find ways to listen to voices outside of his family and closest advisers. At the very top of a huge governmental bureaucracy, a president ironically sits in an office that fosters extreme remoteness.While there were encouraging signs that President Trump has appointed some “adults in the room” to his cabinet (Tillerson, General Mattis, General Kelly), the fact is that he seems to be advised by (some would argue controlled by) a small group of insiders (Bannon, Priebus, Conway, Miller) and his family members. These people are complete neophytes in the ways of government and are purposely creating chaos and provoking partisan infighting.This sort of isolation worked against President Nixon. He often knew little about the whole truth of a situation (John Ehrlichman, for instance, did not tell him about the Ellsberg psychiatrist break-in until well into the Watergate scandal). Moreover, this small inner-circle for Nixon proved to be an echo chamber that caused him to believe he was succeeding when his popularity was sinking. His loss of Congressional support was the final undoing of Nixon—something that Trump risks if he continues to run his office like it is a hostile electoral campaign.Our grade: F.3. Don’t Seek Revenge for Every Perceived Slight.The drive for revenge was probably Richard Nixon’s greatest flaw. He kept an enemies’ list and his tapes reveal a man whose actions were often motivated by an overpowering need for personal vengeance. Nixon regularly banned reporters who worked for major news outlets from the White House if he read what he considered to be a disparaging story in his morning press briefings.Trump’s recent tweet that “the press is the enemy of the people” is both chilling and a frontal assault on the First Amendment. It echoes Nixon’s talk to Henry Kissinger and Al Haig on December 14, 1972. Nixon was consulting with Kissinger and Haig about bombing Hanoi to force peace negotiations that had stalled by bombing civilian centers to terrorize the enemy into a settlement.Yet in the middle of this confab, Nixon, like a school teacher, admonished his National Security Adviser to beware of the press and others. “And also never forget,” he said on tape, “the press is the enemy, the press is the enemy, the press is the enemy; the establishment is the enemy, the professors are the enemy, the professors are the enemy. Write that down on the blackboard one hundred times and never forget it.”Trump’s repetition of this and his need to have an enemy, a foil, is highly corrosive. Little can get done in Washington without cooperation and unity.Our grade for Trump: F.4. Hire A Strong White House Counsel.We urged Mr. Trump to hire a White House Counsel who is experienced in ethics and criminal law and who would be willing to risk his or her position by telling the unvarnished truth to the President, even, or especially, when that wasn’t what he wanted to hear.The word is that Trump’s White House Counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, was told by the then Acting Attorney General Sally Yates that General Flynn had lied about his call with the Russian ambassador and was vulnerable to blackmail by the Russians. This supposedly was revealed to White House Counsel many weeks before Flynn was forced to resign.It is not clear if McGahn failed to demand immediate attention to this dangerous situation or if he was unable to cause the necessary results. Whichever it is, it shows that McGahn is either a weak lawyer who did not act decisively or that he did and his client paid little attention to him. Both are bad signs.While we didn’t predict the Monday Night Massacre when Trump fired his Acting Attorney General, like our advice to Trump about having a strong and independent White House Counsel, we would have urged him to have an independent Attorney General and to applaud rather than fire her for having the courage to stand up to him in fulfilling the constitutionally-mandated role in our system of checks and balances.Our grade: F.5. Have A Presidential Historian on Staff. Mr. Trump, who seems to have spent little time studying American history and the presidency, would benefit from adding a presidential historian to his White House staff. So far, like our other advice, he hasn’t followed this suggestion.Our grade for Trump: F. OUR CONCLUSION:We want this country to continue as a great democracy and do not want the impeachment that faced Nixon to face Trump. His actions, though, raise serious concerns that we are wading into another time of Constitutional crisis—all self-inflicted, all predictable, and all unnecessary.Jill Wine-Banks (formerly Wine Volner) was a Watergate prosecutor, known for her cross-examination of President Nixon’s secretary Rose Mary Woods. She is former General Counsel of the Army, Chief Operating Office of the American Bar Association, law firm partner, Motorola executive, and consultant.Jim Robenalt is the author of January 1973, Watergate, Roe v Wade, Vietnam, and the Month That Changed America Forever, and is a contributing author to The Presidents and the Constitution, A Living History (Gormley ed.).

54,THE WORLDPOST,UK Government Defends Trump's State Visit Amid Protests,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-britain-may_us_58ab6472e4b07028b7031569,Thousands of protesters gathered outside parliament to oppose the trip.,2017-02-20,People hold banners as they gather to protest against President Trump.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ab652125000017600ba414.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"LONDON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - The British government on Monday defended its decision to offer U.S. President Donald Trump a lavish state visit and an audience with the queen this year, defying protests outside parliament and dissent from lawmakers.Prime Minister Theresa May’s government wants to reaffirm the “special relationship” with the United States and secure a trade deal as Britain prepares to leave the European Union.“In the light of America’s absolutely pivotal role we believe it entirely right that we should use all the tools at our disposal to build common ground with President Trump,” junior foreign minister Alan Duncan told parliament.He described state visits as Britain’s “most important diplomatic tool,” saying Trump’s trip would go ahead as planned.The visit has spurred 1.8 million people in Britain to sign a petition saying he should not be given a state visit because it could embarrass Queen Elizabeth.As parliament debated that petition on Monday - a symbolic discussion which has no power to force the government to withdraw its invitation - around 7,000 protesters gathered outside with placards bearing slogans such as “Dump Trump, Fight Bigotry.”“It’s about the rise of hate and extremism, which is personified by Trump. It’s not just about him, but he represents what’s happening in the world at the moment,” protester Alison Dale, 61, told Reuters.“The invitation was kneejerk, and made us look desperate. Now we’re leaving the European Union, it’s clear we’re just desperate for trade deals, and we look weak.”Since taking office in January, Trump has sparked global protests over plans to ban migrants from seven Muslim-majority countries, and from women activists who call him misogynistic.Trump says his immigration orders are aimed at protecting the United States and that his opponents have misrepresented his intentions.Prime Minister May has said she will not consider canceling the visit. Managing the backlash adds to her diplomatic “to-do” list as she sets about reuniting a country divided over Brexit and negotiating a divorce with European trading partners.RALLYING POINTThe debate, hosted in a packed side room of parliament rather than the main debating chamber, gave lawmakers a platform to air a wide range of views on Trump.“It’s difficult to know whether to be appalled at the morality of this invitation, or just astonished at the stupidity of the invitation,” said Scottish National Party lawmaker Alex Salmond. Previously Trump has clashed with Salmond over his investments in Scotland.Critics focused on accusations of sexism and referred to his immigration policies, while other lawmakers argued Trump should come to Britain, but should not be given the high honor of a state visit, which would involve lavish displays of royal pageantry and a banquet hosted by the queen.Crispin Blunt, head of parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee, said a head-of-government visit by Trump would be appropriate this year but a full state visit should wait until 2020, the 400th anniversary of the Pilgrim Fathers’ settlement in New England.“If we don’t take the hype out of this debate, with all the people who signed this petition, there is every possibility that of course this visit is then going to become a rallying point for everybody who is unhappy both with the direction of American policy, or British policy or anything else,” he said."

Henson turned in one of the best performances this year in “Hidden Figures,” the true story about the black women who were an integral part of NASA’s early space program. Alongside Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe, Henson effectively carries the film as physicist and mathematician Katherine Johnson. But while the film has received many accolades this awards season, including a SAG award for the cast, some have questioned why Henson did not receive acting nominations at the two of the biggest awards ceremonies of the year: the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards.Ted Melfi, director of the Oscar-nominated “Hidden Figures,” said that while he was “disappointed” to see Henson receive no major actor noms, he believes the snubs are probably a result of Hollywood politics ― not Henson’s talent. “Yeah, I was disappointed,” Melfi told The Huffington Post. “But the way it runs is you’ve got to get out there, working the campaign trail. I mean, that’s what I’ve been told ― this is the first time I’ve been through this.”According to Melfi, Taraji working 17-hour days on the set of “Empire” during awards campaign season probably factored into her lack of big nominations.“Taraji is on a series... She’s working her butt off on her show constantly. She’s done everything she possibly can to support [the film]. She’s amazing. But at the end of the day, she has a full time job.”Still, while Henson will not be up for an Oscar at this Sunday’s ceremony, the director believes that her work speaks for itself.“I think her work in ‘Hidden Figures’ is stunning, and groundbreaking,” Melfi says.“Anyone who could watch her on ‘Empire’ as Cookie and then see her in [’Hidden Figures’] and not think she’s one of the greatest actresses around ― I just don’t understand that.”“Hidden Figures” will compete for three awards at the Oscars on Feb. 26, including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actress for Octavia Spencer. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article stated that “Hidden Figures” is about the black women who contributed to the first manned mission to the moon. The film actually depicts the women who helped NASA launch a man into orbit."

All of these positive lifestyle changes may cause people to assume that the devices will also help them lose weight. That’s a reasonable assumption, but there is actually very little evidence that fitness trackers, alone, will lead to weight loss.“Many new technologies, and dietary supplements and new diets, are sold to the public with little actual research behind them. Wearable technology to encourage fitness is no different,” Aaron E. Carroll recently wrote in The New York Times, pointing to a study first reported on last year.In fact, fitness tracker users lose less weight than people who track their activity manually through a website, according to a two-year weight loss study of nearly 500 overweight or obese adults.The study, conducted at the University of Pittsburgh and published in JAMA in 2016, found that participants who relied on a fitness tracker to monitor weight loss actually lost, on average, more than 5 pounds less than similar participants who tracked their activity through a website.It’s important to note that the study only looked at people who were participating in a weight loss program that included a host of resources, including a low-calorie diet plan, physical activity goals and both group and individual counseling. And while one group lost more weight than the other, both groups lost weight and improved physical fitness.The study underscores the idea that tackling the tough business of weight loss may require a multi-pronged approach ― and slapping a wearable on your wrist will only help if you’ve committed to a lifestyle overhaul.But that doesn’t mean your Jawbone or Fitbit is useless: Apart from weight loss, a wearable device might just make you happier: The built-in alarms nudging you to stand up, take a break and walk more steps can be part of a healthier lifestyle. And research shows that just going for a walk can increase your happiness almost immediately.Sounds worth it to us.H/t The Upshot"

But this year, thousands of people are marking the holiday by protesting President Donald Trump. “Not My Presidents Day” rallies are taking place Monday in more than two dozen cities, including Los Angeles, New York City, Chicago, Austin, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Denver and Washington, D.C. Olga Lexell, 24, helped plan the protest at LA’s city hall. The Facebook invite for the event spurred interest from other cities, and Lexell recruited volunteers in New York and Chicago to set up protests there. Most of the sister rallies were organized independently by grassroots volunteers and are focused on how Trump’s plans affect their cities.Lexell said LA residents are most concerned with “the immigration ban, losing our health care, deportation raids, anti-climate policies, sanctuary city funding and the wall that Trump thinks he’s going to put up.”Protesters in the city shouted “Lock him up,” echoing the anti-Hillary Clinton “Lock her up!” chant that was common at Trump’s campaign rallies.Thousands of people also rallied in New York, gathering outside Trump International Hotel and Tower to hoist colorful signs that defended refugees, condemned the president’s Cabinet picks, and called for his impeachment. Families and individuals of all ages chanted “Not my president!” and “Black lives matter!”Mercedes Vizcaino, 42, works in New York City and came to Monday’s protest with a friend who is a science teacher.“I think it’s important to take a stand and not be complicit about what’s going on in the country,” Vizcaino said. “Democracy as we know it is being challenged. ... My freedoms that I’ve cherished and perhaps never thought about disappearing, right now I know they may be taken away.”Bryan Berge, an attorney for the city of New York, came to the protest with his two daughters, ages 5 and 3. “[Trump’s] policy ideas are very frightening and the people he listens to are ideological zealots who have no place in the higher rungs of government,” he said.Berge, 33, said he was concerned about how Trump’s policies will affect his daughters’ future.“The risk of a debilitating trade war or an actual war is higher than it’s been in many, many years,” he said. Richard Rumph, a retired New York City elementary school teacher, said he couldn’t recall attending a rally before Trump took office. He joined in on Monday partly because he objects to Betsy DeVos, the education secretary.“DeVos basically has no understanding of public education,” said Rumph, 66. “She’s going to push charter schools and public education is going to go down the tubes.”In Chicago, several hundred protesters rallied outside Trump International Hotel and Tower. People listed a number of concerns that brought them out to the protest — including immigration, funding for science and arts programs, reproductive rights and what they referred to as Trump’s “immature” and “authoritarian” tendencies.Bianca Castro, 15, had a day off school for Presidents Day and attended the Chicago protest with two of her friends. The three young women noted some of their classmates and friends — especially undocumented immigrants — feel a new level of fear under Trump.“They’re staying home. Some of their parents have been taken away or warned,” Bianca said.The “Not My Presidents Day” events are the latest in a wave of protests that have followed Trump’s inauguration, starting with the women’s marches on Jan. 21. After Trump imposed a contentious executive order halting refugee resettlement and travelers from several Muslim-majority countries, protesters rallied at airports around the country. Last week, the “Day Without Immigrants” movement inspired rallies and shuttered businesses nationwide.“Pretty much all of the people who volunteered to help us organize turned out to be women,” Lexell told The Huffington Post in an email. “Women are really leading the charge with the anti-Trump resistance.”Former Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn (D) was in the crowd in Chicago, gathering signatures for a local ballot initiative. He said the uptick in protests since inauguration was necessary in the Trump era. “Freedom of assembly, freedom to protest, freedom of the press — these are all freedoms under attack by Trump,” Quinn said. “We’re going to resist authoritarianism. That’s what Trump is — an authoritarian.”Trump tweeted last month that Americans have the right to protest, but soon returned to criticizing the rallies. White House press secretary Sean Spicer has also claimed that protesters sometimes get paid to demonstrate.Lexell said Monday’s protests had mostly been organized through Facebook and word of mouth. She planned the LA event with Heather Mason, one of her friends. “I don’t think either of us had ever organized any kind of protest or rally of this size before, but it just felt like something we had to do to have our voices heard,” Lexell said. “Lately I’ve been afraid because of the overwhelming anti-immigrant sentiment he’s building; I’m an immigrant myself, so that’s terrifying to me.”Mason, 28, said she thinks Californians have a responsibility to lead the resistance to the administration’s efforts. “After Trump was elected I cried and was physically ill honestly,” Mason said. “I felt miserable and depressed for days. And then I joined the Action Group Network and began brainstorming with friends as to what we could do to feel less useless.”Lexell added that for her, the only upside to Trump’s win was that she’d gotten more involved in politics, donating to progressive causes and organizing with groups like the Sister District Project. “My entire ‘recent calls’ list on my cellphone is all members of Congress, which is definitely new for me,” she said.This article has been updated with more details from protests.How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

The 1999 Supreme Court ruling required states to integrate people with disabilities into their communities, rather than institutionalize them, whenever possible. Coelho is one of several prominent disability rights activists who have embraced Perez’s candidacy based on his disability rights record.With just a few days left before the contentious election, Perez and the other eight remaining candidates are pulling out all the stops. On Saturday, New Hampshire Democratic Chair Ray Buckley announced that we was dropping out of the contest and endorsing Perez’s chief rival, Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.). In addition to Ellison and Perez, other candidates vying for the top post are South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Idaho Democratic Party Executive Director Sally Boynton Brown; South Carolina Democratic Party Chair Jaime Harrison; media strategist Jehmu Greene; Robert Vinson Brannum, Veterans Committee chair of the NAACP’s Washington, D.C., branch; Milwaukee attorney Peter Peckarsky and Ohio activist Sam Ronan."

Instead, she’d received instead a decidedly unsexy Joni Mitchell CD, and their marriage is left strained. Unfortunately for fans, the upcoming mini-sequel to the hit film won’t fill us in on what Harry and Karen have been up to.According to director Richard Curtis, the new script won’t include Thompson or a tribute to Rickman, who died in 2016, per Digital Spy. It’s just too tough.“You know, dealing with Alan is very complicated,” Curtis told the Press Association, so a tribute is “not really” part of the plan. He also confirmed the actress won’t be able to participate.The project, announced last week, will be made in celebration of Red Nose Day, a biennial event that supports the British charity Comic Relief that Curtis co-founded in 1985. Original cast members including Hugh Grant, Keira Knightley, Colin Firth, Bill Nighy, Liam Neeson, Andrew Lincoln, Thomas Brodie-Sangster and Rowan Atkinson are all set to appear ― so at least we’ll find out what happened after that creepy nighttime cue-card scene between Juliet (Knightley) and her husband’s best friend, Mark. (Lincoln, who played Mark, has said his character “is a stalker.”)“It’ll certainly be a nostalgic moment getting back together and recreating their characters 14 years later,” Curtis said in a statement last week.It’s set to air March 24 on BBC One and May 25 on NBC.

In May, 2016, the massive West Antarctic ice sheet began tearing apart. My colleagues sounded the alarm that the melting could destabilize enormous areas of ice, resulting in global sea rise of more than 10 feet. “We present observational evidence that a large sector of the West Antarctic ice sheet has gone into irreversible retreat,” said NASA’s Dr Eric Rignot. “It has passed the point of no return.”The only unknown is how quickly a 10-foot sea level rise will occur.Rignot and his coauthors cautiously estimate an epic sea level rise in the coming centuries.Eminent climate scientist, Dr James Hansen, former director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, has spent his entire career tracking the effects of climate-altering carbon dioxide released from burning subsidized fossil fuels. In the lead-up to the Paris Climate Agreement, Hansen warned: “It’s crazy to think 2C is a safe limit.”Man-made heat, infused into the oceans from heat-trapping fossil fuels, has doubled since 1997. That’s the equivalent energy of detonating one atomic Hiroshima-style bomb every second for 75 straight years.“The ice sheets are losing mass faster and faster, with a doubling time of about 10 years,” Hansen said. “If that continues, we would get sea level rise of more than six feet by 40 to 50 years.”Since 2011, the Larsen C ice shelf, West Antarctica, developed a rift of approximately 110 miles in length.

East Antarctic ice sheets are now showing telltale signs of a huge melt well underway.Eight thousand dazzling superglacial lakes were revealed in August, 2016, along the Langhovde Glacier, East Antarctic, from observation taken between 2000 and 2013. Those superglacial Antarctic lakes resemble the melt-water lakes on Greenland, which is currently thawing at a much faster rate than Antarctica. Superglacial lakes influence both ice motion and ice shelf stability.Another East Antarctic ice sheet, the Totten Glacier, is losing between 63 and 80 billion metric tons of ice annually or 32 feet in thickness each year. The Totten Glacier contains enough water to raise oceans globally by 11 feet.The consequences on an 11-foot sea level rise are unimaginable.

They are the single most numerous creatures in the Southern Ocean. Krill feed the entire ecosystem: from seabirds to seals and penguins to the colossal filter-feeding whales.Already, krill populations have plummeted by as much as 80 percent in the western Antarctic Ocean. Krill require sea ice in order to survive their first winter. They feed on sea ice algae and plankton; it is central to their existence.Researchers from the University of Western Australia detected the cascading effects of missing krill. They recorded skinnier humpback whales migrating northward to their winter calving grounds in northwestern Australia. Fewer krill directly impacts the humpback’s ability to reproduce. Once these magnificent monarchs of the sea leave their summer feeding grounds, they mostly fast until returning the following summer. Females must bulk-up on krill, adding mega tons of blubber in order to feed calves their rich caloric milk during the winter.In addition to vast amounts of missing Antarctic sea ice, China intends to increase its 32,000-metric-ton catch of Southern Ocean krill up to 2 million metric tons annually.

This time he held a self-serving “campaign rally” designed to show his supporters and himself that he has not repeatedly failed and that his historically low approval ratings are “fake news.”For well over a year now, myself and many other columnists have documented the narcissistic and, frankly, bizarre behavior of Donald Trump the candidate and now the 45th President. In fact, there has been widespread debate within the mental health community regarding Trump, however, that debate has not been a dispute about whether or not he shows “world-class” narcissism but if he meets the criteria for a clinical diagnosis of a personality disorder.The need for a clinical diagnosis is often an administrative matter (e.g., for billing, insurance claims, etc.) and whether or not Trump has been labeled “mentally ill” does not change the glaring fact that his extreme narcissism undermines his ability to discharge the duties of the Presidency, places him at an unprecedented level of ethical and financial conflict, and represents a danger to the United States, our Constitution, and the American people. President Trump’s rationale behind Saturday’s rally in Melbourne was to have a chance to be “among my friends and among the people.” He went on to say that he sought to “speak to [the crowd] without the filter of the fake news.” In other words, Mr. Trump wanted to soothe his vulnerable ego and feed his insatiable need for adulation - without being held accountable for his words or opening himself up to criticism. Ever the malignant narcissist, the President wanted greater control over what he could say and to whom he could say it; a luxury that he has not been afforded in the east wing of the White House with the press on hand. At the rally, Trump described his ascension to the Oval Office as a “movement that has never been seen before” – a statement with which many historians might disagree. He then proceeded to dance along the web of lies that has covered his brief tenure as Commander-in-Chief: the transition has “gone smoothly” and with “incredible progress,” illegal immigrants continue to execute terrorist attacks across Europe (including Sweden?!), the media has concocted false stories about him and the internal workings of the White House, and that his support has been “massive.” Note: Only about 9,000 people attended the Melbourne rally compared to the 17,000 anti-Trump marchers in West Palm Beach and Miami alone on the Saturday after Inauguration Day. Of course, there was no mention of the ongoing questions surrounding Russian election interference nor his ties to Russia, the rapid departure of National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, or his continued violation of the Emoluments Clause to the U.S. Constitution. What was included were transparent nods to (1) his evangelical Christian base with the First Lady reciting the Lord’s prayer (let’s just set aside the many Biblical verses that speak of giving aid to refugees and the less fortunate…ahem…’Muslim Ban’) and (2) his African American supporters with a highly visible group of Blacks for Trump seated right behind the podium. (Click on the previous link to learn more about the history of this group of which Mr. Trump may or may not be aware). Make no mistake, calling this event a campaign rally as opposed to a Presidential address was intentional and served to take advantage of the looser restrictions placed on a campaign event. Air Force One was used as a prop during Trump’s dramatic entrance…24 hours after the White House said it would not be used in such a way. In addition, Team Trump called this the President’s third straight “working” weekend at Mar-a-Lago (aka the Southern White House or the Winter White House) but this too is more fact-twisting to (poorly) skirt the significant ethical concerns raised by conducting White House business at a private, for-profit club owned by the President.This President is determined to change facts to fit his worldview rather than changing his worldview to fit the facts. This behavior, no matter what it is called, does not belong anywhere near the White House any longer. "

We are the American people.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ab487d280000230099a0c4.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When I see or hear the phrase, “Fake News,” written or uttered by President Trump or his Fakers who seek to undermine the nation’s confidence in the news media and the men and women of the press, my anger rises to levels I’d really rather not have to deal with… and yet, it rises. From the advent of alternative facts to the Bowling Green Massacre, to the Terrible Events of Friday Night in Sweden, to being Enemies of the American People, I’ve had just about enough from the Fakers.My anger and disgust rise because I was a part of the news media from the day I began delivering the Cincinnati Enquirer to readers in Wilmington, Ohio, in 1961. I was 12 then, and within five years, I was a photographer and reporter for the Northern Virginia Sun in Arlington, Virginia. It was a small daily, but it blanketed a lot of territory. We covered everything from social events, high school sports, the police beat, and the riots that left large swaths of Washington, D.C. burning in the late 1960s.None of what the Sun published was fake news. It was real, and it was valuable to our readers and to the Arlington community as a source of timely, informative, and, we hoped, respected information.When I went off to college in Colorado, I landed a job as a reporter for the ‘Longmont Daily Times-Call’, in a (then) small town just north of Boulder. The ‘Times-Call’ is an advocacy news journal, covering local town council meetings and raising awareness of the education, police, health, and human services needs of thousands of families in the region. The ‘Times-Call’ was important to Longmont and the surrounding rural towns and farms farther out on the plains, because it was the source of agriculture news—notably reports on the beet crop so vital to the sugar factory that brought revenue to that part of the Front Range. Our farm news sections were always among the most popular and well-read. Nothing fake about the farm market report.We helped one small community obtain a state grant for an ambulance to make sure rural patients could get to the hospitals in Boulder or Denver; we reported on a failing water purification plant, and made sure—through stories and pictures—the local authorities acted to repair the system and keep clean water running into rural homes and farms. It was all real news, nothing fake about any of our stories or pictures. Here is just one example of a “not fake” news story running recently in the ‘Times-Call’: “Longmont woman hopes her breast cancer journey prompts checkups by others.” Not Fake.And I was just one of thousands of hometown, local news reporters across the country who covered dozens of beats and wrote hundreds of stories every week, every month, every year. Many of us climbed from those humble newsrooms, with typewriters and hot-lead presses, to larger journals in bigger cities, and we worked at our craft as computers replaced typewriters, and printing presses digitized. But while we grew with the times, learned new skills, adapted to a faster pace (and downsizing), one thing never changed: the news itself. It didn’t somehow transmogrify from real stories about real people living real lives, into fake news.Cities still need clean water, and reporters write about that—it’s not fake news. Just ask the thousands of citizens of Flint, Michigan, if their local and regional news sources, like the ‘Detroit News’, are putting out fake news. No. They’ve been doggedly reporting on a major crisis because the news media, a free press, will not let up on local officials or the state or national government.Down in Dothan, Alabama, Lance Griffin of the ‘Dothan Eagle’ reported last week on the cost ($51,000) to clean up a local fuel spill. Now, $51,000 may not sound like a lot when compared to the national budget, but if you’re a taxpayer in Dothan, you want to know what’s going on with your money. The story was not fake news. It had an impact on the community.The Fakers seem to forget, conveniently, how fact-based technology is helping keep people alive, and stories like this in the Lincoln, Nebraska ‘Journal Star’, “Technology and tenacity keep woman’s heart beating,” are not fake.The Cheyenne, Wyoming, ‘Tribune Eagle’ just last week reported on a city council vote to approve affordable housing. That’s not fake news. It’s important news to the community.When it comes to reporting stories about America’s places of worship and our big hearts that welcome so many people into our communities and homes, there is nothing fake about stories like this one about 181-year-old St. Paul’s Episcopal Church in Franklin, Tennessee, as reported last week in Nashville’s ‘Tennessean’. The faith of the congregation at St. Paul’s—like the faith of congregations throughout the nation—is as real as the news stories that report on all their good work at home and around the world. Witness this story of faith in the ‘Natchez Democrat’. That’s Faith News. Not Fake News.I could go on for pages citing local newspapers and reporters who deal in nothing but real news. Just run through these recent stories in the ‘Louisville Courier-Journal’; the ‘Farmington (New Mexico) Daily-Times’; or the ‘Abilene Reporter-News’. We don’t do fake. We can’t do fake. Reporters and their newspapers—print or digital—would not last a month if what they reported was untrue. America’s newspapers are having a hard enough time financially—they don’t need Trumped-up anger from the White House about fake news doing even more damage to their already battered spirits.Some journalists have given more than battered spirits to the profession. They have given everything in the name of real news. Step away from your Fake News megaphones, Mr. Trump and all your Fakers, and read this report of the 1,230 journalists killed since 1992. There is nothing fake about their deaths in pursuit of the truth.Read more in my blog “But What If I’m Write?”"

At other times, it is an impenetrable chasm of misunderstanding.The latter was my experience this past weekend, as I stood with several dozen like-minded Ohioans to demonstrate our concern for protection of the environment in the central square of our red-state small town. Our mostly silent demonstration soon found accompaniment in the bullhorn-amplified voices of some local evangelists determined to save our souls. Or possibly just shout us down. Our small, but growing, weekly demonstrations seem to have struck a chord with some of our neighbors.As a little bit of background, for the past four weeks, members of our local community, concerned—if not flat-out distressed—at the new presidential administration have organized weekly demonstrations in the town square. Each Saturday at noon for a half hour we hold up signs on a particular issue (healthcare, the environment, immigration). Drivers honk in support as they drive past. Some throw us a dirty look or a rude gesture, but overall the response has been quite positive.As it happens, we have been getting some local press and decent word of mouth, which is no doubt what has drawn the attention of our new friends from “Operation Save America.” While we hold up signs saying “Don’t make America Sick Again” and “Save the Planet for our Children,” these fine individuals shout at us about the evils of Islam and declare that God will use “extreme vetting” at the pearly gates.I am aware these men (and they are all men) do not represent mainstream Christian belief, even in conservative Christian circles. At the same time, they do represent the same religious tradition (if an extreme version of it) as the 80% of white evangelicals who opted to support the current administration in the 2016 election. As someone who grew up in the religiously conservative south, I possess more than a passing familiarity with the so-called “Christian Right.”Yet, for all that I share a background with those on the other side of the proverbial political street, it has been a struggle these past few months to see so many people with whom I share a faith support political positions that run so fundamentally counter to my deepest-held religious convictions. My identity as a Christian and as a priest is not somehow incidental to my participation in those weekly demonstrations in the town square. Rather, my involvement is deeply bound up in my religious identity. I insist on speaking out for the cause of healthcare because I believe that all people deserve the dignity of affordable quality treatment for their medical conditions. I do not believe any individual should become burdened with overwhelming debt because they happen to have the misfortune of developing a pre-existing medical condition. I will speak out for the rights of refugees to find a sanctuary where they can live in safety and with a degree of human dignity. I believe our natural environment deserves protection as God’s good creation. These beliefs are utterly fundamental to my faith, being as I am a person who follows a teacher who declared “blessed are the poor” and “whoever welcomes the least of these welcomes me.”These are the beliefs that are apparently so anathema to my co-religionists that more extreme representatives of their faith feel compelled to shout us down on a Saturday afternoon. A part of me would like to brush them off in my own high-minded and self-righteous judgment. At the same time, I recognize that I am as much of a mystery to conservative Christians as they are to me. Many conservative Christians supported now-president Trump based on the hope for the appointment of pro-life Supreme Court judges. For them, I am anathema—a self-proclaimed Christian leader who supports access to safe and legal abortion.When I think about my more conservative brothers and sisters, I can find no solution to the impasse in which we find ourselves. We share a faith and, presumably, a similar conception of God. Yet we inhabit realities vastly separated from one another. If that chasm of understanding exists between myself and my fellow Christians, I can only imagine how pronounced that chasm remains among all those other self-contained bubbles that define our society. As we all try to speak into this present political reality, it can seem as though we all are just shouting at one another through a bullhorn. Our message washes over the “other side”, and theirs sweeps over us in turn.Even as I flirt with my sadness at the chasms that divide us, I remind myself that my goal is not to shout over the people with bullhorns. My hope is that that our faithful presence week after week acts as a brief moment of solidarity for others with moderate to progressive political views who may feel isolated in such a conservative area. Maybe we remind others, including conservatives, who are uneasy with our president’s authoritarian language, that they are not alone. That is enough for me.Previously published as ‘Why Resistance is the Moral Choice’ in The Wild Word magazine. www.thewildword.comFor more great Wild Word essays see:America, the Rest of the World is With You by Mike HemburyThe Beginning of the End of Donald Trump by Maria BehanMy Awakening at Standing Rock by Sarah DrummWhy Trump Supporters Must Begin America’s Healing by Reverend Rachel KesslerSurviving a Long Winter with Kids by Jami Ingledue"

68,POLITICS,Republicans Are Using An Arcane Tool To Handcuff Federal Agencies,Laura Barrón-López and Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-cra-federal-agencies_us_58a7776ae4b045cd34c1a44c,And it could have long-term consequences.,2017-02-19,"President Donald Trump dismantles the Department of the Interior's Stream Protection Rule, meant to protect waterways from from coal mining operations, at the White House on Feb. 16, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a7782e290000f616f2733b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― While President Donald Trump distracts the public with his angry tweets, Republicans in Congress have been busy undoing federal regulations that agencies have been working on for years.GOP lawmakers are dismantling regulations they deem overreaching and burdensome using an obscure law known as the Congressional Review Act, or CRA, which can be used to undo any regulation within 60 days of its finalization. The law, passed in 1996, also bars agencies from writing a “substantially” similar rule after the initial rule has been blocked ― a major concern for legal experts and advocates. The CRA came to be under legislation pushed by then-Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.). Lawmakers wanted an easier way to undo regulations, even though agencies can only issue them according to statutes written by Congress. Congress had only used the CRA once before Trump took office, which is another reason people are concerned about its implications. There isn’t a whole lot of legal precedent concerning how and when it should be used. In 2001, Republicans used the CRA to undo a Clinton-era regulation creating new workplace ergonomics rules to prevent repetitive injuries. The agency that wrote the rule ― the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ― never touched ergonomics standards again.Ergonomics may sound silly, but the rules weren’t about desk jockeys dealing with carpal tunnel syndrome. Think more like meat-packers crippled by repetitive injuries ― those are the people the regulation would have helped the most. “Ergonomic injury is very common among poultry processing workers, both because repetitive knife cuts and hoisting heavy birds on and off the assembly line cause debilitating carpal tunnel,” explained University of Maryland law professor Rena Steinzor, formerly president of the Center for Progressive Reform. When the Obama administration considered allowing faster line speeds at poultry plants in 2012, labor groups opposed the move as dangerous and urged OSHA to write new a new rule to make the work safer; poultry plant workers already suffer injuries at twice the rate of the general workforce. Steinzor, who has testified before Congress on regulations, credits the 2001 CRA resolution targeting ergonomics as the reason OSHA decided not to write a new rule, though the agency didn’t cite it in its formal denial of petitions to take action on behalf of poultry workers.OSHA “cowered,” said Steinzer. “It was battered. It stopped dealing with ergonomics.” Republicans’ desire to rip up Obama-era rules is no surprise, but using the CRA to do so could have a chilling effect on federal agencies that lasts for years. In the last month, the House has pushed through 13 “resolutions of disapproval” reversing Obama-era regulations, including a Labor Department rule blocking contractors that have repeatedly violated workplace standards from receiving new contracts. The Senate is expected to take up that measure soon, and the House is also eyeing other Labor Department regulations that qualify for CRA action. What makes passing a disapproval resolution under the CRA so easy is that you only need a simple majority to do it, meaning Democrats in the Senate can’t use a filibuster to stop it. “The most interesting and troubling thing about this is that it may very well be the ultimate block on modernizing workplace standards,” said Celine McNicholas, labor counsel for the Economic Policy Institute. The lack of precedent when it comes to the use of the CRA creates a tricky situation for all branches of government, since the agencies are still required to issue rules on specific issues, but can’t do so in a way that replicates their previous rule. The CRA states that a rule “may not be reissued in substantially the same form,” and that the agencies cannot issue “a new rule that is substantially the same” ― unless Congress passes a new law requiring a rule on that subject. McNicholas noted that because the CRA has been used only once before, there has not been a judicial review, nor is there any case law defining how agencies should proceed. “We’re in uncharted territory here,” she said.Even the 60-day limit on using the CRA is fuzzy, because the time frame is 60 legislative days after finalization, not actual days. The Congressional Research Service reported last fall that any rule agencies finalized after May 30 last year is potentially subject to disapproval ― which means as many as 145 rules are subject to potential repeal.The main reason the CRA is not used more often is that presidents generally don’t want to overturn rules their agencies have created, and will veto any “resolutions of disapproval” that make it through Congress. Republicans passed five CRAs between 2009 and 2016, but Obama vetoed all of them. It’s the time period shortly after the White House switches parties and the reigning party controls both chambers of Congress when the stars align for the CRA. And it’s not just labor rules Republicans are throwing out. In the first few weeks of the Trump administration, Congress has passed CRAs undoing a Social Security Administration rule meant to keep mentally ill people from buying guns, and a Securities and Exchange Commission rule requiring oil, gas and mining companies to disclose their payments to foreign governments. The foreign disclosure rule in particular puts the SEC in a bit of a bind, because under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act Congress passed in 2010, companies must provide this kind of information to regulators. Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), who co-authored the law, expressed great frustration with his Republican colleagues who helped write Dodd-Frank but then voted in support of the CRA chopping up the SEC rule. Cardin said he talked to Republican colleagues who had supported that piece of Dodd-Frank, hoping to convince them to flip their vote. It didn’t work.“What the Senate did with the CRA, what Republicans did on a straight party-line vote, is outrageous,” Cardin said. “It’s an abuse of the CRA, compromises America’s leadership, and delays substantially ― and perhaps even the quality ― of the disclosures that will have to take place.”Cardin admitted that the SEC took too long to write the rules Dodd-Frank required, as it’s been almost seven years since Congress passed the law. But undoing them now, Cardin said, would damage the country’s international credibility when it comes to fighting corruption, and would make it more difficult for the SEC to find another avenue for fulfilling the Dodd-Frank mandate.But the SEC will need to try, Cardin said, because he isn’t holding his breath in hopes that Congress will advance any other anti-corruption legislation anytime soon.Environmental advocates have been some of the loudest opponents the CRA. Republicans have already targeted three Interior Department regulations; Trump signed a bill undoing regulations to protect waterways from from coal mining operations on Thursday. Two other bills targeting rules from the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management are expected to come up for a vote in the Senate when lawmakers return on Feb. 27. One of those BLM rules cracks down on the amount of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, that natural gas producers are allowed release in drilling operations on federal land. The other rule updated BLM guidelines on when and where to allow development on federal lands and provided more opportunities for the public to weigh in on those decisions. If the Senate follows the House in undoing both rules, environmental advocates will inevitably challenge agencies to write similar regulations ― opening the door to potential lawsuits. “It’s unfortunate that they have decided to take a tool that has such a lack of precedence and that is so blunt and extreme,” said Josh Mantell, energy campaign manager with the Wilderness Society. “We understand there may be issues with some of these regulations, but the idea that you’d throw the entire thing out and not allow anyone to move forward just traps us in the past.” Mantell added that there could be some loopholes for agencies if they want to write a similar rule later. They could issue the regulation under other statutes, or a new administration could direct a different agency with similar jurisdiction to take it on. Still, he said, it’s unfortunate that “five-year processes, with an extreme amount of public engagement, are wiped out through the CRA.”One of the rules Republicans put up for a disapproval vote in the House last week came as a surprise to a lot of people, since the rule hadn’t received any significant attention when it was issued. It has to do with urine. In 2012, Congress passed a law that would allow states to make people filing for unemployment insurance submit to drug tests. Democrats hated the idea, but they agreed to the provision in exchange for getting Republican support for an expensive extension of long-term unemployment insurance.Democrats didn’t agree to allow states to just do whatever they want, however. As a compromise to the compromise, the legislation said states could only test people in occupations for which such testing is common, such as jobs with a public safety component. And the bill instructed the Labor Department to come up with a regulation controlling how states decide which workers should be subject to urinalysis. Democrats were confident the department wouldn’t allow states to test too many people.  But Republicans neglected to give the Labor Department a deadline for writing those rules. The agency took its time, and didn’t release a proposed rule until 2014. Congressional Republicans and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) complained that the draft regulation wouldn’t let states drug test enough people. But the rule only received 16 public comments; contentious rules can get tens of thousands of comments.The Labor Department issued the final version of the regulation last August ― which is within the timeline for disapproval under the CRA, according to the Congressional Research Service. The delay in drafting the rule could guarantee its demise, as Republicans seek to expand drug testing for the poor and jobless. A former Labor Department official said the agency was mindful of the CRA, but had no way of knowing exactly when the cutoff would be. Also, nobody expected Trump to be president.“When you have a rule with 16 comments and you’re making significant changes to address those comments, we didn’t think of this as a CRA target,” the former official said. Now that the CRA resolution targeting urine passed the House, the Senate will need to vote before it can head to Trump’s desk. Theoretically, once the urinalysis rule is gone, the Trump Labor Department could reissue a new version that Republicans like better. The CRA language about what constitutes “substantially” similar regulations has never been tested, and it doesn’t say who is the arbiter of what is too similar. It might be up to Congress. But it’s also possible that Congress strikes the rule and the Labor Department can’t issue a new one. Republicans could try to pass a new drug testing law, but Senate Democrats would probably keep that from happening. Then states will be left with no authority to drug test unemployment claimants at all.The use of the Congressional Review Act “is only the first step” for Republicans when it comes to undoing regulations, said Steinzor. “We’ve gone DefCon 1,” she said. “There’s worse still to come.” How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

The Senate is expected to take up that measure soon, and the House is also eyeing other Labor Department regulations that qualify for CRA action. What makes passing a disapproval resolution under the CRA so easy is that you only need a simple majority to do it, meaning Democrats in the Senate can’t use a filibuster to stop it. “The most interesting and troubling thing about this is that it may very well be the ultimate block on modernizing workplace standards,” said Celine McNicholas, labor counsel for the Economic Policy Institute. The lack of precedent when it comes to the use of the CRA creates a tricky situation for all branches of government, since the agencies are still required to issue rules on specific issues, but can’t do so in a way that replicates their previous rule. The CRA states that a rule “may not be reissued in substantially the same form,” and that the agencies cannot issue “a new rule that is substantially the same” ― unless Congress passes a new law requiring a rule on that subject. McNicholas noted that because the CRA has been used only once before, there has not been a judicial review, nor is there any case law defining how agencies should proceed. “We’re in uncharted territory here,” she said.Even the 60-day limit on using the CRA is fuzzy, because the time frame is 60 legislative days after finalization, not actual days. The Congressional Research Service reported last fall that any rule agencies finalized after May 30 last year is potentially subject to disapproval ― which means as many as 145 rules are subject to potential repeal.The main reason the CRA is not used more often is that presidents generally don’t want to overturn rules their agencies have created, and will veto any “resolutions of disapproval” that make it through Congress. Republicans passed five CRAs between 2009 and 2016, but Obama vetoed all of them. It’s the time period shortly after the White House switches parties and the reigning party controls both chambers of Congress when the stars align for the CRA. And it’s not just labor rules Republicans are throwing out. In the first few weeks of the Trump administration, Congress has passed CRAs undoing a Social Security Administration rule meant to keep mentally ill people from buying guns, and a Securities and Exchange Commission rule requiring oil, gas and mining companies to disclose their payments to foreign governments. The foreign disclosure rule in particular puts the SEC in a bit of a bind, because under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act Congress passed in 2010, companies must provide this kind of information to regulators. Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), who co-authored the law, expressed great frustration with his Republican colleagues who helped write Dodd-Frank but then voted in support of the CRA chopping up the SEC rule. Cardin said he talked to Republican colleagues who had supported that piece of Dodd-Frank, hoping to convince them to flip their vote. It didn’t work.“What the Senate did with the CRA, what Republicans did on a straight party-line vote, is outrageous,” Cardin said. “It’s an abuse of the CRA, compromises America’s leadership, and delays substantially ― and perhaps even the quality ― of the disclosures that will have to take place.”Cardin admitted that the SEC took too long to write the rules Dodd-Frank required, as it’s been almost seven years since Congress passed the law. But undoing them now, Cardin said, would damage the country’s international credibility when it comes to fighting corruption, and would make it more difficult for the SEC to find another avenue for fulfilling the Dodd-Frank mandate.But the SEC will need to try, Cardin said, because he isn’t holding his breath in hopes that Congress will advance any other anti-corruption legislation anytime soon.Environmental advocates have been some of the loudest opponents the CRA. Republicans have already targeted three Interior Department regulations; Trump signed a bill undoing regulations to protect waterways from from coal mining operations on Thursday. Two other bills targeting rules from the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management are expected to come up for a vote in the Senate when lawmakers return on Feb. 27. One of those BLM rules cracks down on the amount of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, that natural gas producers are allowed release in drilling operations on federal land. The other rule updated BLM guidelines on when and where to allow development on federal lands and provided more opportunities for the public to weigh in on those decisions. If the Senate follows the House in undoing both rules, environmental advocates will inevitably challenge agencies to write similar regulations ― opening the door to potential lawsuits. “It’s unfortunate that they have decided to take a tool that has such a lack of precedence and that is so blunt and extreme,” said Josh Mantell, energy campaign manager with the Wilderness Society. “We understand there may be issues with some of these regulations, but the idea that you’d throw the entire thing out and not allow anyone to move forward just traps us in the past.” Mantell added that there could be some loopholes for agencies if they want to write a similar rule later. They could issue the regulation under other statutes, or a new administration could direct a different agency with similar jurisdiction to take it on. Still, he said, it’s unfortunate that “five-year processes, with an extreme amount of public engagement, are wiped out through the CRA.”One of the rules Republicans put up for a disapproval vote in the House last week came as a surprise to a lot of people, since the rule hadn’t received any significant attention when it was issued. It has to do with urine. In 2012, Congress passed a law that would allow states to make people filing for unemployment insurance submit to drug tests. Democrats hated the idea, but they agreed to the provision in exchange for getting Republican support for an expensive extension of long-term unemployment insurance.Democrats didn’t agree to allow states to just do whatever they want, however. As a compromise to the compromise, the legislation said states could only test people in occupations for which such testing is common, such as jobs with a public safety component. And the bill instructed the Labor Department to come up with a regulation controlling how states decide which workers should be subject to urinalysis. Democrats were confident the department wouldn’t allow states to test too many people.  But Republicans neglected to give the Labor Department a deadline for writing those rules. The agency took its time, and didn’t release a proposed rule until 2014. Congressional Republicans and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) complained that the draft regulation wouldn’t let states drug test enough people. But the rule only received 16 public comments; contentious rules can get tens of thousands of comments.The Labor Department issued the final version of the regulation last August ― which is within the timeline for disapproval under the CRA, according to the Congressional Research Service. The delay in drafting the rule could guarantee its demise, as Republicans seek to expand drug testing for the poor and jobless. A former Labor Department official said the agency was mindful of the CRA, but had no way of knowing exactly when the cutoff would be. Also, nobody expected Trump to be president.“When you have a rule with 16 comments and you’re making significant changes to address those comments, we didn’t think of this as a CRA target,” the former official said. Now that the CRA resolution targeting urine passed the House, the Senate will need to vote before it can head to Trump’s desk. Theoretically, once the urinalysis rule is gone, the Trump Labor Department could reissue a new version that Republicans like better. The CRA language about what constitutes “substantially” similar regulations has never been tested, and it doesn’t say who is the arbiter of what is too similar. It might be up to Congress. But it’s also possible that Congress strikes the rule and the Labor Department can’t issue a new one. Republicans could try to pass a new drug testing law, but Senate Democrats would probably keep that from happening. Then states will be left with no authority to drug test unemployment claimants at all.The use of the Congressional Review Act “is only the first step” for Republicans when it comes to undoing regulations, said Steinzor. “We’ve gone DefCon 1,” she said. “There’s worse still to come.” How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

The law, passed in 1996, also bars agencies from writing a “substantially” similar rule after the initial rule has been blocked ― a major concern for legal experts and advocates. The CRA came to be under legislation pushed by then-Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.). Lawmakers wanted an easier way to undo regulations, even though agencies can only issue them according to statutes written by Congress. Congress had only used the CRA once before Trump took office, which is another reason people are concerned about its implications. There isn’t a whole lot of legal precedent concerning how and when it should be used. In 2001, Republicans used the CRA to undo a Clinton-era regulation creating new workplace ergonomics rules to prevent repetitive injuries. The agency that wrote the rule ― the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ― never touched ergonomics standards again.Ergonomics may sound silly, but the rules weren’t about desk jockeys dealing with carpal tunnel syndrome. Think more like meat-packers crippled by repetitive injuries ― those are the people the regulation would have helped the most. “Ergonomic injury is very common among poultry processing workers, both because repetitive knife cuts and hoisting heavy birds on and off the assembly line cause debilitating carpal tunnel,” explained University of Maryland law professor Rena Steinzor, formerly president of the Center for Progressive Reform. When the Obama administration considered allowing faster line speeds at poultry plants in 2012, labor groups opposed the move as dangerous and urged OSHA to write new a new rule to make the work safer; poultry plant workers already suffer injuries at twice the rate of the general workforce. Steinzor, who has testified before Congress on regulations, credits the 2001 CRA resolution targeting ergonomics as the reason OSHA decided not to write a new rule, though the agency didn’t cite it in its formal denial of petitions to take action on behalf of poultry workers.OSHA “cowered,” said Steinzer. “It was battered. It stopped dealing with ergonomics.” Republicans’ desire to rip up Obama-era rules is no surprise, but using the CRA to do so could have a chilling effect on federal agencies that lasts for years. In the last month, the House has pushed through 13 “resolutions of disapproval” reversing Obama-era regulations, including a Labor Department rule blocking contractors that have repeatedly violated workplace standards from receiving new contracts.

71,GREEN,California Braces For More Rain After Storm Kills At Least 7,Lydia O'Connor,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-deadly-storms_us_58a9dba8e4b045cd34c2b194,Rains that clobbered Southern California are making their way north.,2017-02-19,Schoolchildren race back to their bus after getting caught in heavy rain during a school excursion in Los Angeles on Friday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a9fba525000017600ba08e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There’s no reprieve in sight from the deadly rains battering California. Intense precipitation that’s killed at least seven people in Southern California is shifting north and carries the potential for widespread flooding, the National Weather Service warned Sunday. Lights rains along the Central Coast and Northern California are expected to intensify Sunday afternoon and last through the beginning of the week as a warm front moves across the region with possible 45-mile-per-hour wind gusts, NWS meteorologist Roger Goss said. Some areas could see up to 10 inches of rain through Monday. These storms will continue to test the limits of California’s water infrastructure, UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain said.“[T]he present situation is very similar to those which have historically resulted in major levee failures in the Central Valley and Delta regions,” he wrote Sunday on his blog Weather West. “Undoubtedly, this week’s weather will be a serious stress test for California’s aging water infrastructure. Indeed, the potential exists this week for severe flood-related impacts of a magnitude not seen in many years. This is a storm to take seriously!”With more rain on the horizon, crews continue to repair damage to spillways at Northern California’s Oroville Dam, where an excessively wet winter has overwhelmed a massive reservoir and forced nearly 200,000 people to temporarily evacuate. Much lighter rains are expected to persist in Southern California, where some areas could experience up to an inch of rain on Sunday. Intense precipitation that fell throughout the region Friday and Saturday marked the biggest storm in five years and claimed at least seven lives, The Weather Channel reported.Dangerous road conditions contributed to most of the fatalities, with flooded roads sweeping away cars and causing them to hydroplane. In one Friday incident, a man was electrocuted when storms downed a tree branch, which took out multiple power lines and landed on his vehicle. He died by coming into contact either with the electrified line or with charged water, the Los Angeles Fire Department said. Mudslides closed several freeways, more than 50,000 Southern Californians lost power, and at least two sinkholes opened up in roadways. These storms are only the latest to clobber California this winter. In just the first five months of the water year, which starts in October, the state has experienced 70 inches of rain. In an average year, the state receives just 50 inches, water and climate expert Peter Gleick noted. “California is currently in the midst of one of its wettest winters on record, and precipitation since January 1st has already led to widespread water-related impacts,” Swain wrote Sunday, pointing to inundated agricultural lands, continuous landslides and mudslides and stress on reservoirs reaching capacity.“All of this water is severely taxing California’s water storage, conveyance, and flood protection systems.”"
72,POLITICS,"In Campaign-Style Rally, Trump Promises New Immigration Action, Obamacare Replacement",Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-melbourne-florida-rally_us_58a8dbf4e4b045cd34c25db5,The president was at ease among his supporters.,2017-02-19,"President Donald Trump stands next to Gene Huber, a supporter he invited onstage at a rally in Melbourne, Florida, on Feb. 18, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a8dc7e25000034080b9efc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Addressing an adoring crowd of supporters in Melbourne, Florida, on Saturday, President Donald Trump promised new action to restrict immigration next week, and a plan to replace the Affordable Care Act soon after that.“I’ve ordered the construction of a great border wall, which will start very shortly. And I’ve taken dramatic action to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country,” Trump said at the rally in a hangar at the Orlando-Melbourne International Airport, drawing some of the loudest cheers of his speech.Trump acknowledged, however, that a federal appeals court had halted his earlier attempt to ban refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the country. After criticizing the ruling by the panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, he announced his intention to proceed with alternative plans.“We will do something next week. I think you’ll be impressed,” Trump said. “Let’s see what happens. Here’s the bottom line: We’ve got to keep our country safe.”It was not clear if Trump meant that his administration will try to challenge the 9th Circuit’s ruling at the Supreme Court, or if he’ll instead issue a modified executive order that might avoid some of the legal challenges of the directive he issued late last month.Trump went on to cite alleged instances of refugee-perpetrated crimes and terrorism in Europe as evidence that the U.S. should adopt a more restrictive refugee policy.Naming a host of different European countries and cities, Trump suggested that there had been a terror attack in Sweden the previous night.“You look at what’s happening in Germany, you look at what’s happening last night in Sweden. Sweden. Who would believe this? Sweden,” he said. “They took in large numbers. They’re having problems like they never thought possible.”Many observers promptly pointed out that no such attack had occurred in the Scandinavian nation.He also repeated his false claim that the United States has already let in thousands of people who “there was no way to vet.”In fact, refugees undergo the most rigorous vetting process of any immigrants admitted to the United States, often waiting upwards of two years to be cleared for entry. Trump’s now-halted travel ban froze the admission of all refugees for 120 days and indefinitely barred refugees from Syria.But Trump reiterated his plan to create so-called safe zones to protect civilians in Syria, a controversial proposal that he cut from an earlier draft of his travel ban. “We’re gonna have the Gulf States pay for those safe zones. They have nothing but money,” Trump said Saturday.The president also claimed that he would unveil a proposal for replacing the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, in two weeks.“We are going to be submitting, in a couple of weeks, a great health care plan that’s going to take the place of the disaster known as Obamacare,” Trump said, prompting applause. “It will be repealed and replaced.”Trump’s professed timetable echoes comments he and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) made at separate press conferences on Thursday, when they claimed the White House and Congress would be rolling out their replacement plan some time next month.On Saturday, Trump did not provide much additional detail about what the plan will entail, other than to say, “Our plan will be much better health care at a much lower cost.” Most experts believe there is virtually no way to maintain levels of insurance coverage, reduce costs and ensure quality of care without some combination of the regulations, subsidies and individual insurance mandate that form the nucleus of the ACA.Congressional Republicans initially planned to repeal the landmark health care law when they took office in January and replace it later at a time to be determined. Angry constituents have since accosted dozens of Republican members of Congress at town hall meetings, demanding to know how they would replace the law.In response to public uproar and Trump’s own admonitions, they have slowed down their efforts to deliberate over how best to execute the law’s repeal. Trump’s boisterous gathering in Florida comes on the heels of a similar rally on Friday at a Boeing factory in North Charleston, South Carolina.Holding campaign-style rallies is an unusual, if not unprecedented, move for a sitting president ― let alone one rounding out the first month of his presidency.But Trump, who has at times been visibly frustrated with his administration’s early stumbles and the coverage of the White House press corps, was evidently in his element among his throngs of supporters. First lady Melania Trump made her first public appearance since the inauguration to introduce him and recite the Lord’s Prayer. Trump then launched into his typical campaign themes, castigating the media, lavishing praise on his supporters and running through his ordinary talking points about bringing jobs back to the country and eliminating the crime he claims is plaguing America’s cities.At one point, Trump harkened back to the theatrics that made him such a skilled campaigner. Spotting Gene Huber, a supporter he had seen interviewed on television, Trump invited him on stage with him.“I saw this man on television just now ― you,” Trump said, pointing to Huber in the audience. “He said, ‘I love Trump. Let Trump do what he has to do.’ That’s my guy right there.”“Let him up, let him up ― I’m not worried about him. I’m only worried he’s gonna give me a kiss,” he said, apparently addressing the Secret Service.Huber, clad in a black Trump t-shirt, made his way through the barriers and onto the stage, clearly overcome by emotion. Trump hugged him and asked him to address the crowd from the podium.“Mr. President, thank you sir. We the people, our movement is the reason why our president of the United States is standing here in front of us today,” Huber said. “When President Trump, during the election, promised all these things that he was gonna do for us ― I knew that he was gonna do this for us.”“A star is born. A star is born,” Trump declared when he was done as the crowd chanted “U-S-A!”Although the crowd of Trump supporters inside the hangar was thousands-strong, there was also a sizable contingent of protesters across the street.“I felt compelled to come, even though I was a little frightened because this is not always an easy thing,” Elizabeth Faiella, who was protesting, told CNN. “But I don’t want the world to think that this gentleman represents how we feel ― about immigrants, about our environment, about our justice system.”"

(Reuters) - A SpaceX Falcon rocket blasted off on Sunday from a Florida launch pad once used to send NASA astronauts to the moon, a step forward for billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk and his company’s goal of ferrying astronauts to the International Space Station.The 229-foot tall (70-meter) Falcon 9 soared off a seaside launchpad at the Kennedy Space Center at 9:39 a.m. ET carrying a Dragon cargo ship bound for the station.Nine minutes after blastoff, the main section of the rocket flew back to a landing pad at nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, the eighth successful touchdown for Space Exploration Technologies Corp.“Baby came back,” Musk wrote on Twitter, celebrating the re-landing, which came a day afterSpaceX decided to delay the mission 13 seconds before launch due to concerns about the steering system in the rocket’s upper stage, the company said.Sunday’s launch was the first for SpaceX from Launch Complex 39A, originally built for the 1960s-era Apollo moon program and later repurposed for the space shuttles.The pad was last used for the final space shuttle launch in 2011. In 2014, SpaceX signed a 20-year lease to use pad and has spent millions remodeling it.The launch was also SpaceX’s first from Florida since an accident in September heavily damaged what had been the company’s prime site at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, located just south of the NASA spaceport.Last month, SpaceX resumed flying its Falcon 9 rockets using a second launch pad in California, where the first stage of the rocket also nailed its re-landing.The company plans to reuse the rockets, slashing costs and allowing it to offer reduced pricing.The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which hired SpaceX to fly cargo to the station after the shuttle program ended, closely monitored the launch to learn more about the company’s operations before it clears the company to fly NASA astronauts on SpaceX rockets.SpaceX and Boeing Co  are scheduled to begin flying crew to the station by the end of 2018. A Government Accountability Office report last week said both companies face technical hurdles that likely will delay their programs.SpaceX aims to have the Florida launchpad damaged in last year’s explosion up and running by this summer.(Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Alan Crosby)"

Dr. William Barber at the Moral March on Raleigh, N.C., on Feb. 11.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a8ee962900002600f2752a.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There are many theories about how Donald Trump was elected president. One explanation is to take a saying that Trump is fond of and flip it: Many Americans had lost so much—decent jobs, a secure retirement, their homes, and the confidence that their children will be better off than they are—they got tired of losing and took a chance on a candidate who promised to be on their side. But Trump’s pledges on the campaign trail—to create 25 million good jobs, help working-class Americans get ahead, and end the days of “hedge fund guys getting away with murder [while] the middle class are getting absolutely destroyed”—are taking a back seat to the interests of Wall Street, the wealthy and the far right.Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) noted that it took only an hour on Inauguration Day for Trump’s “populist words delivered on the steps of the Capitol to ring hollow.” Minutes after he was sworn in, Trump overturned a mortgage fee cut, making it harder for low-income Americans to buy a home. Just weeks into his presidency, he made it easier for Wall Street to prey on people’s retirement savings and, while surrounded by Wall Street bankers, signed an executive order gutting Wall Street reforms enacted after the Great Recession.When he accepted the Republican nomination, Trump said he would deliver for the “forgotten men and women of our country”—laid-off factory workers and communities crushed by the shifting economy. The penthouse populist audaciously claimed: “I am your voice.” But there is a big disconnect between what Trump says and what he does. Tick through his advisers, Cabinet choices and Supreme Court nominee, and there’s nary an advocate for the working-class voters Trump courted. He has surrounded himself with a who’s who of businesspeople and billionaires who have amassed huge wealth by outsourcing, cutting and automating jobs, and slashing workers’ salaries, pensions and health insurance—elites who have prospered as America’s “forgotten men and women” have fallen further behind.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin made a fortune foreclosing on homeowners like a 90-year-old woman who was targeted for a 27 cent payment error. Wilbur Ross, the secretary of commerce, has been called a vulture investor for squeezing profits from troubled companies by slashing jobs and gutting pensions. Trump’s secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, has spent decades—and many millions—lobbying to destabilize and defund public schools in order to expand for-profit charter, virtual, private and home schools. Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price was confirmed despite concerns over his practice of introducing legislation to benefit companies he has invested in. And if Price gets his way, 18 million Americans in the next year alone, including millions of children from low-income families, will lose access to healthcare through the Affordable Care Act and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.While, in a victory for workers, Andrew Puzder withdrew from consideration as secretary of labor, other key confirmations remain, notably Neil Gorsuch for a lifetime appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court.People for the American Way describes Gorsuch as a “judge who has dependably acted to protect the interests of big businesses at the expense of ordinary Americans.” Among the examples PFAW cites is the Hobby Lobby case, in which Gorsuch ruled that corporations are people and so can use their religious beliefs to deny employees insurance coverage for contraception. And, in the “freezing trucker” case—in which a truck driver was fired after he left his disabled vehicle to find help and escape subzero temperatures—Gorsuch again sided with the corporation rather than the employee.We’ve never seen anything like the Trump presidency. The administration’s strategy to flood the zone with Twitter attacks, alternative facts and appalling executive orders is dizzying—and that’s the point. Trump wants us to be off balance. He wants to do what he wants, without checks and balances. But that plan has been disrupted by a citizenry that is rising up to be that check and balance. From the 5 million callers who overwhelmed the Senate switchboard to protest DeVos’ nomination, to the worldwide women’s marches, the hundreds of actions in public schools across the country in support of immigrant rights, airport protests of the travel ban, and Jews and Muslims rallying together to say “Never again!”True populists listen to the people. Instead of repeating the preposterous claim that he is the voice of the people, Trump should listen to what we’re saying. We want real economic opportunity. We need affordable, high-quality health care. We support good neighborhood public schools. We cherish freedom and pluralism. And we will stand up against hatred, discrimination and bigotry. Until January 2017, most Americans had only been spectators to dire assaults on democracy. Given the real and present threat, we’ve become active participants in its defense and fortification."
78,IMPACT,Empathy As Resistance In Trump’s America,"Ben Railton, ContributorProfessor and Public Scholar of American Studies",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/empathy-as-resistance-in-trumps-america_us_58a9d915e4b0b0e1e0e20c7a,"Recently, and of course very belatedly, I had the chance to watch the Netflix original documentary series Making a Murderer",2017-02-19,"<p>Three children make signs for the immigration protest at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, Sunday, January 29, 2017.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a9dd542500002a000ba04c.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Recently, and of course very belatedly, I had the chance to watch the Netflix original documentary series Making a Murderer (2015). As many friends had assured me I would be, I was struck by a number of elements of the series, from the egregious, repeated failures of the justice system to many moments of quiet but profound humanity captured by the filmmakers. A second season will air later this year, and I’m sure all those elements and more will be present as the stories of Steven Avery, Brendan Dassey, Teresa Halbach, and many more figures continue to play out.I was particularly struck, however, by a quote from late in the first season’s tenth and final episode. Robert Henak, one of Steven Avery’s post-conviction attorneys and a consistent advocate for his innocence and release, remarks, “Until it happens to you or to your son or daughter or someone else that you love, it’s easy to ignore all of the problems in the system. But I can guarantee you that once it happens to somebody you love or to yourself, it’ll be very clear.” Henak’s thoughts reminded me immediately of a troubling and potent section from “Crossing the Water,” the last story in Louise Erdrich’s short story cycle Love Medicine (1993). Speaking of his father, a Native American activist who has become a convicted criminal and wanted fugitive, narrator Lipsha Morrissey notes, “You will think a man don’t get two consecutive life sentences for nothing beneath the U.S. judicial system. You’ll keep thinking that, too, unless you happen to rub against that system on your own. Then things will astonish you. I promise they will.”Henak and Morrissey are both commenting specifically on our collective blindness to the problems with the justice system, of course. But both are also making a second, more overarching, and even more frustrating point still: that it is only when we experience such problems ourselves that we can appreciate or even comprehend them. That it is difficult if not impossible, that is, for those of us fortunate enough not to have personal or familial such experiences to empathize sufficiently with those who have, empathy without which we likely will neither understand nor care about the system’s failings.It’s easy to see confirmation for Henak and Morrissey’s points in two current issues that remain significantly and frustratingly under-covered in our collective conversations. Like Steven Avery, well more than 2 million Americans are currently incarcerated, a system of mass incarceration that dwarfs any other in the world. Like both Lipsha’s father Gerry Nanapush and historical AIM leaders such as Leonard Peltier, many of the Native American activists and protesters at Standing Rock have been attacked and arrested by law enforcement authorities for defending their homes and communities. And despite award-winning books and social media movements, both issues remain largely absent from our national conversations, as evidenced by their near-total invisibility during the 2016 presidential debates and campaign between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.Despite the rising numbers of incarcerations, most Americans are not personally affected by the issue, just as most have no personal connection to the Dakota Access Pipeline’s presence and effects. In the absence of such links, we seem palpably unable to muster sufficient empathy to engage with these issues in any meaningful collective way. The same could be said of far too many other horrific national crises: the fact that Flint, Michigan has not had clean drinking water for years; that nearly 1000 Americans were killed in police shootings in 2016; that more than 20% of American children live in families below the poverty line; that the Obama administration had deported more than 2.5 million undocumented Americans by 2015, a number that will likely rise far higher under the Trump administration. I would argue that each of these stories should be a source of continued collective outrage—but for the vast majority of Americans unaffected by any and all of them, sufficient empathy seems hard to come by.Yet Trump’s new, even more aggressive deportation policy has indeed met with outrage and resistance from a wide spectrum of Americans, and I believe that can help us see a different point to Making a Murderer and Love Medicine. While both of those cultural texts were created for many purposes, it’s fair to say that both work hard to tell stories that their audiences might not otherwise have learned, and certainly not have learned with the complexity and accuracy and humanity they deserve. When those stories are told, and told well, they can produce precisely the sort of engagement and empathy that can and do inspire further awareness and action—just as the stories of Trump’s deportations and the American lives and families affected by them have already begun to inspire activism and resistance en masse.Indeed, many if not most of the mass protests and actions we’ve seen in this first month of the Trump presidency seem to have arisen directly out of such empathetic responses. Perhaps the most overt and inspiring examples are the airport protests that followed immediately upon the administration’s executive order issuing travel bans on immigration and refugees. Driven by empathy for the individuals, families, and communities affected by this order, Americans all over the country descended on airports to support those communities, in philosophical but also potently practical and legal ways (such as lawyers working pro bono on airport floors on their behalf). And these empathetic protests, in turn, led to further news stories and coverage, expanded our collective awareness and conversations, and produced new levels of both empathy and action.The problems that confront Americans—from those being created by Trump every day to those that go back far further into our history—are numerous, widespread, complex, and challenging. They will require collective responses that go far beyond awareness and protests. But we can’t respond at all if we don’t know or don’t care. At their most cynical, Henak and Morrissey’s comments suggest that most of all will never be sufficiently affected to find our way to such empathy. But at their most hopeful, their texts tell a different story, one that can help elicit precisely such empathetic responses and actions. As we’re seeing unfold around us, that empathy can and must be a potent mode of resistance in Trump’s America."

How could we tell the difference between loyal Japanese Americans and the few spies, saboteurs, and terrorists that were assumed to be among them?

81,HEALTHY LIVING,9 Signs You’re Dealing With An Emotional Manipulator,"Dr. Travis Bradberry, ContributorTalentSmart, President and 'Emotional Intelligence 2.0,' Coauthor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/9-signs-youre-dealing-with-an-emotional-manipulator_us_58a732fae4b026a89a7a2a2b,Emotional manipulators are easy enough to spot if you know what to look for.,2017-02-19,<p>Emotional manipulators defy logic. They derive satisfaction from controlling you and creating chaos. Dr. Travis Bradberry shows you how to spot them and keep your distance. </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a733bc25000029000b9b7d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We all know what it feels like to be emotionally manipulated. It can be extremely effective, which is why some unscrupulous individuals do it so much.A few years ago, Facebook, in conjunction with researchers from Cornell and the University of California, conducted an experiment in which they intentionally played with the emotions of 689,000 users by manipulating their feeds so that some users only saw negative stories while others only saw positive stories. Sure enough, when these people posted their own updates, they were greatly influenced by the mood of the posts they’d been shown.Facebook caught a lot of flak over the experiment, primarily because none of the “participants” gave their consent to join the study. Perhaps more frightening than Facebook’s faux pas was just how easily people’s emotions were manipulated. After all, if Facebook can manipulate your emotions just by tweaking your newsfeed, imagine how much easier this is for a real, live person who knows your weaknesses and triggers. A skilled emotional manipulator can destroy your self-esteem and even make you question your sanity.It’s precisely because emotional manipulation can be so destructive that it’s important for you to recognize it in your own life. It’s not as easy as you might think, because emotional manipulators are typically very skillful. They start out with subtle manipulation and raise the stakes over time, so slowly that you don’t even realize it’s happening. Fortunately, emotional manipulators are easy enough to spot if you know what to look for.1. They undermine your faith in your grasp of reality. Emotional manipulators are incredibly skilled liars. They insist an incident didn’t happen when it did, and they insist they did or said something when they didn’t. The trouble is they’re so good at it that you end up questioning your own sanity. To insist that whatever caused the problem is a figment of your imagination is an extremely powerful way of getting out of trouble.2. Their actions don’t match their words. Emotional manipulators will tell you what you want to hear, but their actions are another story. They pledge their support, but, when it comes time to follow through, they act as though your requests are entirely unreasonable. They tell you how lucky they are to know you, and then act as though you’re a burden. This is just another way of undermining your belief in your own sanity. They make you question reality as you see it and mold your perception according to what is convenient to them.3. They are experts at doling out guilt. Emotional manipulators are masters at leveraging your guilt to their advantage. If you bring up something that’s bothering you, they make you feel guilty for mentioning it. If you don’t, they make you feel guilty for keeping it to yourself and stewing on it. When you’re dealing with emotional manipulators, whatever you do is wrong, and, no matter what problems the two of you are having, they’re your fault.4. They claim the role of the victim. When it comes to emotional manipulators, nothing is ever their fault. No matter what they do—or fail to do —it’s someone else’s fault. Someone else made them do it—and, usually, it’s you. If you get mad or upset, it’s your fault for having unreasonable expectations; if they get mad, it’s your fault for upsetting them. Emotional manipulators don’t take accountability for anything.5. They are too much, too soon. Whether it’s a personal relationship or a business relationship, emotional manipulators always seem to skip a few steps. They share too much too soon—and expect the same from you. They portray vulnerability and sensitivity, but it’s a ruse. The charade is intended to make you feel “special” for being let into their inner circle, but it’s also intended to make you feel not just sorry for them but also responsible for their feelings.6. They are an emotional black hole. Whatever emotional manipulators are feeling, they’re geniuses at sucking everyone around them into those emotions. If they’re in a bad mood, everyone around them knows it. But that’s not the worst part: they’re so skillful that, not only is everyone aware of their mood, they feel it too. This creates a tendency for people to feel responsible for the manipulator’s moods and obliged to fix them.7. They eagerly agree to help—and maybe even volunteer—then act like a martyr. An initial eagerness to help swiftly morphs into sighs, groans, and suggestions that whatever they agreed to do is a huge burden. And, if you shine a spotlight on that reluctance, they’ll turn it around on you, assuring you that, of course, they want to help and that you’re just being paranoid. The goal? To make you feel guilty, indebted, and maybe even crazy.8. They always one-up you. No matter what problems you may have, emotional manipulators have it worse. They undermine the legitimacy of your complaints by reminding you that their problems are more serious. The message? You have no reason to complain, so shut the heck up.9. They know all your buttons and don’t hesitate to push them. Emotional manipulators know your weak spots, and they’re quick to use that knowledge against you. If you’re insecure about your weight, they comment on what you eat or the way your clothes fit; if you’re worried about an upcoming presentation, they point out how intimidating and judgmental the attendees are. Their awareness of your emotions is off the charts, but they use it to manipulate you, not to make you feel better.Overcoming ManipulationEmotional manipulators drive you crazy because their behavior is so irrational. Make no mistake about it—their behavior truly goes against reason, so why do you allow yourself to respond to them emotionally and get sucked into the mix?The more irrational and off-base someone is, the easier it should be for you to remove yourself from their traps. Quit trying to beat them at their own game. Distance yourself from them emotionally, and approach your interactions with them like they’re a science project (or you’re their shrink if you prefer that analogy). You don’t need to respond to the emotional chaos—only the facts.Maintaining an emotional distance requires awareness. You can’t stop someone from pushing your buttons if you don’t recognize when it’s happening. Sometimes you’ll find yourself in situations where you’ll need to regroup and choose the best way forward. This is fine, and you shouldn’t be afraid to buy yourself some time to do so.Most people feel as though because they work or live with someone, they have no way to control the chaos. This couldn’t be further from the truth. Once you’ve identified a manipulator, you’ll begin to find their behavior more predictable and easier to understand. This will equip you to think rationally about when and where you have to put up with them and when and where you don’t. You can establish boundaries, but you’ll have to do so consciously and proactively. If you let things happen naturally, you’re bound to find yourself constantly embroiled in difficult conversations. If you set boundaries and decide when and where you’ll engage a difficult person, you can control much of the chaos. The only trick is to stick to your guns and keep boundaries in place when the person tries to cross them, which they will.Bringing It All TogetherEmotional manipulators can undermine your sense of who you are and even make you doubt your own sanity. Remember: nobody can manipulate you without your consent and cooperation.What are some other signs of emotional manipulation? Please share your thoughts in the comments section below, as I learn just as much from you as you do from me. If you’d like to learn more about overcoming emotional manipulation, my book Emotional Intelligence 2.0 can help."

Spain has faced pressure from its European Union neighbors over the past several years to take in more refugees. The country has thus far only accepted a fraction of the refugees it said in 2015 it would accept. It pledged to take in more than 17,300 refugees ― largely from Italian and Greek refugee camps ― by late 2017; so far it’s accepted just 1,100.By contrast, Germany accepted 280,000 asylum seekers last year and 890,000 in 2015, according to Germany’s Ministry of the Interior. “Think of us as a people, not as a crisis,” Meera Zaroor, a Syrian refugee in Spain, told Al Jazeera interviewers. “We are not a crisis and didn’t come here to steal people’s houses or their jobs.

I really miss him.”Rhino’s previous owners had small children, and Rhino was large and fast enough to knock them down, according to Today.com. The family was forced to give him up for adoption, but a child in the family was sad to see their friend go.“The family told our receiving staff the notebook was written by one of their kids,” shelter spokesperson Guinnevere Shuster told Today.com. “It was​ filled with information about Rhino for his new​ ​family​.”The note explained that Rhino is a “striped dream” who doesn’t like water, snow or cats. The note’s author also requested that Rhino lives in a “safe house.”“He is a really amazing puppy,” the note reads. “Rhino needs lots of attention and loves people.”The note was a first for the shelter, DeAnn Shepherd, marketing director for the facility, told Fox 13. But it showed just how much the family’s kid loved the dog.“It was very heartbreaking to see from his perspective, his relationship and friendship with this dog,” Shepherd told Fox 13. “But we hope that he sees the story and knows that his best friend is going to find a new home.”The Humane Society of Utah called the author of the note a “brave young child who took the time to write these notes and recommendations.”“Please remember, surrendering a pet is never an easy decision,” the shelter wrote on Facebook on Saturday. “But they are doing what is in the best interest of the pet.”And if the note is any indication, Rhino’s previous family really cared about their dog.Rhino will be put up for adoption on Sunday.
