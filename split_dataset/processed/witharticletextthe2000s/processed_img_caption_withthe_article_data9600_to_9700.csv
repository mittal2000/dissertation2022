Critics of this shift say it's a soft-on-crime approach, but research backs the effectiveness of the approach in reducing recidivism and the costs of re-incarceration. Government has been re-thinking the purpose of imprisonment — away from the tough-on-crime tack, and putting more thought to addressing the root causes of why crime happens, and finding solutions to those issues for the people doing time. This focal shift is also evident in other societies around the world, evident in the creation of more purpose-built prisons.The newest and largest prison in the UK just opened in Wrexham, North Wales, with capacity for 2,100 male prisoners, and features a firm focus on rehabilitation in everything from staff core values to prison programming. While offenders are indeed serving time as punishment for crimes they’ve committed, all of the men at HM Prison Berwyn will eventually be released into their communities, and the guiding belief at the ""super prison"" is that those released should be ready and able to lead productive and sustainable lives, and won't re-enter an environment that encourages their previous criminal behaviors. The presiding principle in designing the HM Prison Berwyn is to create an environment that allows as much normalcy as possible, to ensure the transition out of incarceration is easy and swift. Nelson Mandela wrote about the importance of a sense of normality behind bars when he was imprisoned for 27 years. Making the experience in custody similar to that of being in the community is the cornerstone of the rehabilitative goals at HMP Berwyn. It even includes shifts away from old terminology, using ""room"" versus ""cell,"" calling inmates by preferred names, establishing real relationships with staff, and having inmates be responsible for their own schedules as much as possible. This is where one of HMP Berwyn’s more controversial features comes in —a laptop in every twin room. The laptops cannot access the internet, but are seen as important components to establishing normalcy, building IT skills, and reinforcing self-sufficiency. The man use their laptops to schedule visitations, complete educational work, and for administrative tasks such as ordering meals and doing their own shopping. The use of laptops also cuts down on staff work by eliminating paperwork that needs to be physically processed, and allows staff more time to foster relationships and contribute to rehabilitation. Each room also has a phone. Credit is earned, and calls can only be made to approved and verified numbers. All calls are recorded. The prison also features a library, visiting room with a play area for children, soccer pitches, gyms, and educational and vocational facilities. Programs offered are based on need, as well as by current labor market demands. Staff is selected with the ethos of rehabilitation in mind, and must adhere to six core values: sustainability, accountability, integrity, collaboration, respect, and realizing potential. This culture ensures that the focus is not solely on punishment, and encourages relationship building. All of this may seem soft on crime to some, but in the end it does a better job rehabilitating offenders, reducing recidivism, and reducing incidences of suicide, violence, and prison riots. Time incarcerated is used constructively. Men see this prison as offering them a real chance to change their lives. Similar principles have taken hold in parts of the US prison system, too. Increased focus on changing lives and reintegrating ex-prisoners into communities pushes the country away from mass incarceration and overly harsh punishments for non-violent offenses. It's too easy to focus only on the crimes committed and to forget that the majority of those committing them will be released. What kind of people do we want coming back into society? We can plan for what kind by providing education, vocational skills, a sense of normalcy, and allowing some personal responsibilities. Looking at innovative prisons such as HM Prison Berwyn as possible models, and gauging their successes with an eye to emulating them is something that should be on the minds of those in charge of our criminal justice system.

1,WOMEN,Periods Are More Than A Hassle,"Cristina Ljungberg, ContributorFounder Giving Wings",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/periods-are-more-than-a-hassle_us_5927ee89e4b0d2a92f2f42dd,"Take a moment to think about some simple yet staggering facts. Today, more than 800 million girls and women around the world",2017-05-26,"<p>Girls in Nairobi, Kenya learning about menstrual cups with The CUP foundation.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5927efc22000003b0016f08d.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Take a moment to think about some simple yet staggering facts. Today, more than 800 million girls and women around the world are menstruating. Cumulatively, over the course of a lifetime, this adds up to an average of six to eight years. No matter where these girls and women are in the world, most of them would agree on one thing: Managing your period is a hassle. But for most girls and women, it’s also a barrier preventing access to basic human rights.The global context of menstruation is of deep-rooted stigma and inequities. There are serious, persistent gaps in policies, funding, infrastructure, and markets. The unacceptable result is that girls and women lack the knowledge, support systems, facilities and access to affordable products. Even with scant global research on this issue, if women and girls are unable to participate in social, public, or school life, it holds them back from achieving their full potential.When I found out about this alarming situation, one thing was clear: Periods are a serious challenge that needs more attention and funding. Giving Wings, a family foundation, strives to find innovative, interesting and sustainable programs and companies that disrupt the problematic, scary, and sometimes life-threatening relationship girls and women have with their periods. After four years, some questions still keep us up at night, and if there is a menstrual genie out there, here are our three wishes:Wish 1: Affordable, available and sustainable period solutions. Why have we not built the necessary markets? Globally, around 88% of all girls don’t have access to commercial products to manage their periods. Some of the world’s most common products are cloths, newspaper, toilet paper, and leaves. The dominance of global multinational brands means the prices are too high in many parts of the world, and distribution channels continue to be inadequate. Moreover, the market for local products and solutions are seriously underdeveloped, which hampers accessibility and affordability of solutions. There are companies like AFRIpads (http://www.afripads.com) and ZanaAfrica (http://www.zanaafrica.org) breaking new ground in local markets, but how can we make sure that girls and women have access to a choice of products globally?Wish 2: Empowered and knowledgeable girls and support systems. Why are periods not integrated more into our education systems? Taboos around periods are globally pervasive, and our education systems reflect it. The lack of attention and time spent discussing what is a critical biological function is baffling. The lack of comprehensive sexual health education, including a focus on periods, is dangerous not just for girls, but boys as well. This is compounded when teachers and parents perpetuate stigma and taboos about periods. In South Asia, a study found that 33% of girls in school had never heard of menstruation prior to experiencing their first period, and 98% of girls were unaware that menstrual blood came from the uterus. In other countries, like Iran, around 50% of girls think it’s a disease. How can we empower women if we don’t give them the knowledge and tools to understand their own bodies?Wish 3: Increased funding to this long-overseen issue. Why aren’t periods on the agenda when we talk about development? Today very few funders are focusing on menstruation and menstrual health. This has led to an underfunded sector that no one talks about. Several organizations work on menstrual health through water, sanitation, and hygiene programs or through adolescent sexual and reproductive health. These siloed approaches are ineffective and uncoordinated. Practitioners and funders alike should start addressing, lifting up, and prioritizing menstrual health to ensure women and girls succeed in all aspects of their lives. This means more funding – grants, donations, loans, venture capital or private equity -- into the menstrual health sector, taking periods seriously as an issue that needs to be addressed. There is a powerful untapped potential of girls and women, if only we would engage in these discussions and address these gaps. Joining a global movement, together with others, we aim to build a sustainable, inclusive world where girls can thrive. One way of doing that is through addressing periods. May 28th is Menstrual Health Day, an opportunity to raise awareness of the challenges women and girls face due to their periods and to collectively find solutions. Our sector is small but growing fast. Join us in the work of empowering women and girls to equal opportunities and rights!Maverick CollectiveAs a member of Maverick Collective, an initiative of PSI, I have decided to focus on menstrual health through PSI Nepal. Maverick Collective members partner on PSI programs to tackle critical challenges faced by women and girls through innovative projects to develop game-changing interventions.

Take Britain's betting industry, for example, which according to a recent report by Deloitte directly contributes in excess of £2.3 billion to the nation's GDP. This is the result of a progressive approach to legalising and regulating sports betting in the UK, which has in turn monetized the sector and enabled the government to access additional tax revenues. The macroeconomic climate is creating something of a perfect storm for the market, however, while other factors mean that there are likely to be challenges ahead for the remainder of 2017 and beyond. The Facts and Figures Behind the Growth Aside from generating £2.3 billion towards the UK's GDP, the British betting industry is also a key creator of jobs. More specifically, it directly supported 38,800 positions of employment in 2011, and this has increased incrementally as major high-street brands such as Ladbrokes have increased their offline presence since this time.  Paddy Power is the latest bookmaker chain to reveal significant first-quarter growth numbers in 2017, with revenues increasing to £416 million and showcasing a 23% rise on the corresponding figures from the previous year. Not only this, but this growth industry also have a more far-reaching impact on the nation's economy as a whole, with a cumulative economic footprint of £5 billion in terms of Gross Added Value (GAV). Much of this has to do with the market's continued willingness to invest in the UK high-street, which has become an increasingly overlooked entity in the age of digital technology and e-commerce. Behind the Headline Numbers: The Challenges Facing Bookmakers This growth aside, the industry is facing a number of familiar and unique challenges in the current climate. In terms of the former, bookmakers have suffered from numerous political upsets in recent times, including the EU referendum vote and the election of Donald Trump as U.S. President. Leicester City's 5000/1 title triumph and Champions League run also qualified as one of Freebets upsets of the season, and altogether these events cost British bookmakers considerable sums of money.  The macroeconomic climate, which has been partially triggered by Brexit and exacerbated by the upcoming General Election, is also likely to take its toll later in 2017. As the value of the pound continues to trade within an increasingly narrow range against the U.S. Dollar (USD) and the Euro (EUR), for example, so too retail inflation has soared to 9% and taxation levies in the industry have increased. The latter point is particularly important, as the betting market often emerges as a so-called 'soft target' for HM Treasury during challenging economic times. As if to underline this, the Machine Games Duty (MGD) tax now applies a 20% levy to corporeal fruit machines and similar similar slots, and is thought to have cost operators an additional £60 million per annum (which equates to an estimated £7,000 per shop). Can the Market Continue to Thrive? The robust growth of the UK's traditional betting sector will come as a surprise to some, particularly given the exponential rise of the online market. In fact, technological advancement has actively enabled major high-street bookmakers to grow, by enhancing the typical customer experience and making it easier for customers to place in-store wagers. Whether this can be sustained has yet to be seen, particularly with the online sports betting and casino market claiming an ever-expanding market share (virtual casinos generated 33% of all gambling revenues in 2016). The traditional industry is certainly poised to enjoy continued success in the near-term, however, while it is also well-placed to cope with a challenging macroeconomic climate while evolving further as a result.

Collins IIIIt’s 8:00pm. The world around comes to a sudden halt. Cars break mid highway as phones are put away and conversations paused. A nation unites in complete stillness, and for an entire minute, no sound can be heard for miles but the cry of a siren.This soul penetrating ring is the official start of Yom Hazikaron - Memorial Day in Israel; the national day of remembrance set aside for honoring fallen heroes who died in active duty defending the Jewish homeland, and for the thousands of civilian victims of terror. Throughout the next 24 hours, graves are visited, ceremonies held, and tears shed. By law, all places of entertainment are closed and tv stations mark the solemnity of the day. One channel screens the entire list of names of all those being remembered.23,544 - The number of Israeli soldiers remembered this past May 1.3,117 - The number of victims of terror in Israel also remembered this past May 1.21 Million - the number of cases of beer purchased to wash down the 818 hot dogs consumed per second during “peak hot dog season”, kicked off on Memorial Day in the United States just a few weeks later. This is in memory of the 1.3 Million members of the armed services who lost their lives in conflict, and the  42+ Million veterans who have served the United States during war time. Barbecues, beer, beef, 2 for 1 sales, marathons, auto racing, and travel - this is what Memorial Day looks like for the average American. It is the unofficial start of the summer season, a day for busting out the white pants, and enjoying a day off work.An Israeli friend of mine visiting the U.S. experienced Memorial Day here for the first time last year. “I was at first horrified,” she explained to me. “I was expecting something similar to what we do in Israel. I couldn’t understand how you are all so happy - drinking, going to the beach, having barbecues, on the day you are remembering the people who sacrificed their lives for you. But then an American friend explained to me that it is not meant to be a solemn day here - that instead of mourning you choose to celebrate the many freedoms the U.S. cherishes; the freedoms that the army fights to protect.”She paused to think, then continued. “It makes sense; you should of course celebrate your wonderful country - but it could never be this way for us on Memorial Day in Israel. I don’t want you to think I am judging you; for us, it is just different. There is not a single person who is not directly affected by the conflicts we face. We all know someone personally in active duty, and we all know someone either in our immediate circles or extended circles who has died because of the conflict. I think until we have security and peace with our neighbors, it will continue to be an extremely sad day for us.”My friend’s remarks got me thinking. How did the U.S. Memorial Day become what it is? How did it start? And have we come so far as a country to merit a day of pure celebration marked with little to no solemnity for the average American?Most Americans know that Memorial Day, despite its festive nature, is about honoring the nation’s war dead. Few Americans, however, and including myself until recently, know the real history of the holiday. For an in depth look at the history and transformation of the day, I highly recommend the book “Race and Reunion”, by David W. Blight, a professor of history and the director of the Gilder Lehrman Center for the Study of Slavery, Resistance and Abolition at Yale. For a quicker summary, see the article he wrote for The New York Times in May of 2011, “Forgetting Why We Remember”.The very first Memorial Day commemoration occurred on May 1, 1865. It was the last year of the Civil War, and Charleston, S.C. had been taken over by the Union Troops. When the Confederate Troops fled, they left behind a mass grave of Union Prisoners, hastily buried after being kept in horrific conditions on what had once been the town race track.According to archival evidence discovered by Blight, “after the Confederate evacuation of Charleston black workmen went to the site, reburied the Union dead properly, and built a high fence around the cemetery. They whitewashed the fence and built an archway over an entrance on which they inscribed the words, ‘Martyrs of the Race Course’.”Along with White Abolitionists, the Black people of Charleston, mostly former slaves, staged a procession of 10,000 around the track.“The war was over, and Memorial Day had been founded by African-Americans in a ritual of remembrance and consecration. The war, they had boldly announced, had been about the triumph of their emancipation over a slaveholders’ republic. They were themselves the true patriots,” Blight explains.Many early Memorial Day events on the Union side took on a similar character of both solemn honoring of the Union dead, as well as remembering the importance of the emancipationist cause. Only a short while later, as reconstruction ended in the South and unity became a political necessity, a new Memorial Day took shape. This day honored both the Union and Confederate fallen soldiers, dropping the struggle for equal rights of all Americans and emancipation from the conversation, replacing it with a call for moving forward together as a new nation.In a 2007 op-ed for the New York Times, referencing Blight’s work, Adam Cohen argues the disservice done to our country by forgetting the original meaning of Memorial Day. He explains that “When Woodrow Wilson spoke at Gettysburg on the 50th anniversary of the battle, in a Memorial Day-like ceremony, he avoided the subject of slavery... and declared ‘the quarrel’ between North and South ‘forgotten.’ The ceremony was segregated, and a week later Wilson’s administration created separate white and black bathrooms in the Treasury Department. It would be another 50 years before the nation seriously took up the cause of racial equality again.”Perhaps dropping this aspect of the holiday from the national conversation seriously delayed the Civil Rights Movement.After WWI, the meaning of Memorial Day expanded to become about the fallen in all of our nation’s wars. Over time, the holiday took on a more and more commercial character to become what it is today. Yes, graves are still decorated, government memorial services and parades are still held, but nearly all sense of sanctity and solemnity have been lost.Cohen asserts, “Memorial Day... began with the conviction that to properly honor the war dead, it is necessary to honestly contemplate the cause for which they fought.”This, I believe, is why Israel’s Memorial Day is so starkly different from that of the United States. The narrative of Yom Hazikaron is one that not only honors the fallen, but is connected to the causes for which they died - the 2000 year old struggle for Jewish self determination, security, and peace in their indigenous homeland; for the idea that no blood, including Jewish blood, is cheap; and for the hope that all life on Earth will be treated as precious. The meaning of Yom Hazikaron and the weight it carries is woven into the very fabric of Israeli society; it is in the tossing and turning at night of every mother with a child serving out his/her mandatory conscription in the IDF, in the threat of terrorism that looms regularly, and in the too many friends and loved ones lost on all sides of the conflict. This trauma and hope is what that 8pm siren and the events of the day urge Israelis to come together and contemplate. Yes, the Jewish People have achieved unprecedented levels of autonomy and dignity with the blessing that is the modern state of Israel. Part of their dream has been realized. For this, Israelis celebrate boldly and proudly on Yom Ha’atzmaut (Israeli Independence Day which comes right after Israeli Memorial Day). Until there is peace, however, the struggle of the Jewish people and their fallen heroes remains unfinished, and Israel’s day in memoriam is a day in mourning.Though there is nothing inherently wrong with honoring the memory of America’s fallen soldiers by celebrating the freedoms we treasure, when we become so far detached from the causes for which they died and the original meaning of the holiday, we do a disservice to the country and ideals we intend to celebrate.Perhaps if on the U.S. Memorial Day we contemplated more directly the causes for which our soldiers have fought and fallen, from the Revolutionary War, through the Civil War, all the way to our current War on Terror - maybe we would realize that while we have cause to celebrate, we also have reason still to mourn.As Memorial Day Weekend in the U.S. approaches, I find myself thinking about the wars we continue to fight as a country both abroad and at home.I am thinking of the victims of the recent attack in Manchester and their families. I am praying for the triumph of all peace-loving people against hatred and radical extremist perversions of Islam.I am also thinking about Richard W. Collins III; the 23 year old black student who had just been commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Army and was soon to train in defending the U.S. against chemical attacks. This amazing young man was cut down in his prime; murdered this past weekend by a 22 year old white student at a bus stop for refusing to move. Though officials say it is too early to claim this a hate crime, it is being investigated as such as the perpetrator was a member of a white supremacist facebook group “Alt-Reich: Nation”, known for espousing hate against Black people. Many are calling the murderer a “home grown terrorist,” and the murder a lynching. Time will tell what his motives were, but without a doubt we are living in an era all too stained by racial inequality, partisan intolerance, and senseless hatred.Are we truly connected to the causes for which our soldiers fought and continue to fight? Do we as a nation have with enough significance and clarity the conversation around the continued struggle for civil rights (the natural extension of emancipation)? Does every American in practice have the equal right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness? The answer, unfortunately, is no.Yes, I will be having a beer this Memorial Day. Life is too precious to stop celebrating. However, I will also be taking time with my family to reflect and honor the memory of our soldiers the best way we can: by connecting to their causes and by remembering that their fight is not done. Indeed, we have much to celebrate, but we also have a long ways to go."

Experts say such disasters disproportionately affect women, who do more unpaid tasks than men.SIPEPA, ZIMBABWE – As the sun’s morning rays stretch across the sky, a long line of women carrying bundles of firewood on their heads walks past the Sipepa Rural Hospital in remote western Zimbabwe. They proceed to the hospital’s backyard where close to 900 villagers have lived in tents since their homes were destroyed by flooding after a tropical storm, Dineo, hit in February.The displaced – mostly women and children – survive on aid from humanitarian agencies and the government’s social welfare services. Some men stayed behind in their villages to look after what little livestock and family possessions they had left, but many of the women are single mothers or grandmothers and have only their own income to rely on.For many, it’s been months since they’ve earned a cent. As vendors and subsistence farmers, they used to earn a small income, but the floods destroyed their fields, their belongings and their livestock.Sharon Mapanga, 35, is a mother of six and works as a vegetable trader. She has been unable to travel to the markets since her home was flooded.“If it was a normal year, by February I’d start ordering onions and tomatoes from the market and, after some months, I’d have something to pay for school fees when the second term comes [in May],” she says. “But now I’m just sitting here in one place doing nothing.”Mapanga’s predicament is shared by many of the women she lives alongside in the hospital yard. Her tent-mate, Anna Sibanda, worries about whether she’ll ever be able to restart her cattle business and continue putting her three children through boarding school.A 2016 report by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs shows that, compared to men, women are more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. In emergency situations, such as floods, women perform an even higher amount of unpaid work – such as tending to children or cooking – than usual.“Due to lack of safety nets, limited social protection policies in the agriculture sector and the invisibility of care work, the impact of a disaster is often more severe for rural women,” says Christina Kangawari, the international project manager of ActionAid Zimbabwe. The international NGO has measured women’s unpaid care work across the globe and found women perform a higher number of unpaid tasks compared to men.Kangawari urges the government to make national budgetary provisions to recognize unpaid work responsibilities such as child care, finding water and fetching firewood. Yet, at present, the cash-strapped government largely depends on international donors to provide emergency aid.At the Sipepa camp, women spend their days doing communal chores, taking turns cooking, cleaning toilets or picking up rubbish around the hospital yard. On cooking duty, Sibusiso Sibanda, 40, feels frustrated. Before the floods, she was looking for a job as a cook, but she says she will have to wait to be resettled before she resumes job-hunting.Jeselina Masuku is feeling impatient, too. This 67-year-old rural farmer lost all but three of her 35 goats to the floods. She now shares a tent with 28 other people, and wants to move away so she can start her life anew.

Wong,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2017-glaad-studio-responsibility-index_us_59260761e4b061d8f81f0a6d,A new GLAAD study examines a troubling reality for LGBTQ people in Hollywood.,2017-05-25,"Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast"" featured one of 2016's most-buzzed-about queer moments, but as a whole, it wasn't a great year for LGBTQ people on the big screen. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5926f69b2000003a0016ed79.jpeg?cache=5MZl27jGJT&ops=crop_163_386_1774_1500%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"“Moonlight” proved to be the little movie that could this year, winning Best Picture over the splashy, big budget musical “La La Land” at the Academy Awards in February. Seeing an independent, coming-of-age tale that tackled homophobia, racism and patriarchal norms clean up at the Oscars felt like a victory on many levels. However, a new report finds that the film’s success was very much an anomaly, and when it comes to Hollywood and the LGBTQ community, things are not getting better. Despite much-buzzed-about queer moments in “Beauty and the Beast” and “Star Trek Beyond,” only 18.4 percent of 125 major movies released in 2016 featured characters who identified as LGBTQ, according to GLAAD’s 2017 Studio Responsibility Index. It’s a slight uptick from the previous year, when the report found that 17.5 percent of movies released in 2015 contained queer characters. GLAAD officials, however, say that the figure is still troubling, especially given the fact that most of the queer characters we do see are based on “outdated stereotypes” played for “cheap laughs.” GLAAD launched the first Studio Responsibility Index in 2012 in an effort to “map the quantity, quality, and diversity of LGBTQ characters in films released by the seven major studios,” President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis explained in her introduction to the report. Each film is evaluated not just for inclusion of queer characters, but also the presence of general LGBT content and anti-LGBT language or “humor,” according to press notes. This year’s edition introduced a five-point scale for ranking the films released by Disney, Fox, Lionsgate, Paramount, Sony, Universal and Warner Brothers over the 2016 calendar year. The system was revised, Ellis explained, to “hold Hollywood studios to a higher standard reflective of the LGBTQ inclusion that is thriving in other forms of media.”If only the studios had risen to that occasion. Disney, Sony and Lionsgate received “failing” grades, while Fox, Paramount and Warner Bros. were labeled “poor.” Universal fared slightly better, receiving an “insufficient” grade. None of the studios earned a “good” or “excellent” grade. Only nine of the 23 major studio films to include an LGBTQ character(s) passed GLAAD’s Vito Russo Test, which measures how those characters are presented in the context of the film in a similar way to the Bechdel Test. Once again, it was a slight uptick from last year’s report in which eight of 22 inclusive films released in 2015 passed, the lowest percentage in the study’s history.“Films like ‘Moonlight’ prove there is a huge opportunity to not only tell LGBTQ stories worthy of Oscar gold,” she said in a press release, “but to open the hearts and minds of audiences here and around the world in places where these stories can be a lifeline to the people who need it most.”Read more about the 2017 GLAAD Studio Responsibility Index here.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5926c0bc1600002200ddcc09.jpeg?cache=oJtBcNvm9y&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Multiple media outlets rescinded their endorsements of a Republican congressional candidate after he was charged with assaulting a reporter. The Billings Gazette, the Missoulian and the Helena Independent Record had all endorsed Greg Gianforte, who is running to fill an open U.S. House seat in Montana. But they all changed their minds after Gianforte was arrested for assaulting Guardian journalist Ben Jacobs at a campaign event on Wednesday.Jacobs, who was taken to the hospital in an ambulance, said that Gianforte grabbed his neck and body-slammed him, breaking his glasses. Fox News journalists who were at the scene corroborated this account, as did an audio recording. Police arrested Gianforte, who has blamed Jacobs for the altercation, and charged him with misdemeanor assault. Newspapers quickly pulled their support for the Republican candidate.“Three weeks ago, the Missoulian endorsed Gianforte because we took him at his word that he would set aside his personal beliefs, listen to Montanans and be their voice in the House,” the paper said in a statement. “He showed Wednesday night that he lacks the experience, brains and abilities to effectively represent Montana in any elected office.... he does not represent Montana values and he should not represent us in Congress.”"

In an eyewitness account published on the Fox News website, Acuna described how she and two colleagues were in Gianforte’s office when the candidate “grabbed” Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs “by the neck with both hands and slammed him on the ground.” This account directly contradicts the Gianforte campaign’s claim that Jacobs, a “liberal journalist,” was the aggressor ― a claim also disputed by Jacobs’ audio recording of the incident.But even as Fox News’ online report was being shared widely on social media Wednesday night, the network’s right-leaning primetime lineup ― Tucker Carlson, “The Five” co-hosts and Sean Hannity ― ignored it.Meanwhile, CNN and MSNBC, which didn’t have reporters witness the event, covered the congressional candidate’s violent outburst. MSNBC brought Jacobs on air during the 8 p.m. hour and even mentioned Fox News’ online report of the incident during the 10 p.m. hour.Fox News’ primetime handling of the incident again underscored how the network’s news-focused reporters and anchors sometimes cover major stories very differently than its conservative opinion hosts, who appear reluctant to highlight stories that may be unflattering to President Donald Trump or the Republican Party. Last week, for example, Fox News’ primetime lineup dismissed or downplayed a bombshell report that Trump asked then-FBI Director James Comey to stop investigating former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Fox News anchor Bret Baier returned to the story immediately after Hannity’s 10 p.m. show ended. Fox News first mentioned Acuna’s account on air around 1:30 a.m., as part of a short news break during a re-airing of “Hannity.” Fox News reporter Griff Jenkins also mentioned Acuna’s account on “Fox & Friends First,” and Jacobs’ audio recording was played during the show. The assault was covered a few times, albeit briefly, on “Fox & Friends,” a reliably pro-Republican program. Co-host Brian Kilmeade directed viewers to the website to read Acuna’s story on the incident.“Fox News and FoxNews.com have been on top of the developing Greg Gianforte story since it broke last night,” a Fox News spokesperson told HuffPost. “This includes publishing our first-hand account of the incident and covering all of the evolving news leading up to the Montana special election throughout the day across all of our platforms.” It was during the 9 a.m. hour, when the network transitions away from “Fox and Friends” to breaking news coverage, that Acuna gave her account in person. “I did see the whole thing, when Gianoforte grabbed him by the neck, both hands, slid him to the side, body-slammed him, and then got on top of him and started punching and yelling at him,” she said.

Today, with the support of the Reteti Elephant Sanctuary, locals are working to save endangered calves.Photojournalist Ami Vitale traveled to the baby elephant orphanage to document community relations with the animals for National Geographic.Reteti opened in August as part of a network of community groups in the region working to foster sustainable development and wildlife conservation. Elephant keepers there try to rehabilitate wounded calves and reunite them with their herds, when possible.Elephants are ecosystem “engineers,” Vitale notes. They feed on low brush and bulldoze small trees, which promotes the growth of grasses and attracts other grazing animals.But ivory poachers have caused elephant numbers to dwindle, with the African elephant population plummeting by more than 110,000 over the past decade, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. At least 33,000 elephants are killed for their tusks annually.In the past, members of local tribes feared elephants and weren’t interested in trying to save them, Vitale explained. But now, largely thanks to sanctuaries like Reteti, villagers are working to protect the estimated 6,000 elephants that live alongside them.“We take care of the elephants, and the elephants are taking care of us,” one of the Reteti caregivers told Vitale. “We now have a relationship between us.”Take a look at Vitale’s stunning photographs below.

Reading the comic seemed to serve as an a-ha moment for many women that put words to their experience. It’s the same topic being addressed by one dad who’s trying to send the message to other men that doing your share of the work isn’t “helping out.” Dad and HuffPost blogger Mike Reynolds, also known as Everyday Girl Dad, posted on Facebook about a moment of realization he had while making lunches for his kids, when he thought of himself as giving his wife a “break.” “Truth be told, I probably make lunches the most often in our house because my brain wakes me up early,” he wrote. “But the simple fact that I thought of making lunches as ‘helping’ reminded me of how unfairly labour can be distributed in the household. Imagine the privilege, or lack of understanding, to be able to refer to doing work around the house as ‘helping.’”He went on to remind himself, and other fathers who might be reading, that doing domestic chores and childcare tasks are just part of your job as a parent and adult member of the household. “Making lunches, washing dishes, sweeping up dirt, folding laundry, picking up LEGO, signing tests, writing book order cheques, remembering it’s hot lunch day, getting money for popcorn day, feeding the cat, cleaning the kitty litter isn’t ‘helping out,’ it’s ‘equitably splitting labour,’” he writes.Reynolds is the father to two daughters, 5-year-old Charlotte and 7-year-old Leah. Reynolds told HuffPost he tries to talk about the division of labor as often as he can because he wants his daughters to grow up knowing there are no prescribed roles for them just based on their gender. “I’m not an expert, I am just a guy who makes mistakes, but wants to use those mistakes to get better at being a partner and a parent,” Reynolds told HuffPost. “I think messages like this coming from an average guy like me makes it easier to understand how this same thing can be happening in other families.” Reynolds has also created a line of T-shirts and sweatshirts featuring phrases that fight stereotypes about masculinity and fatherhood. The slogans on the shirts include, “Dads for daughters dating...and other choices they make for themselves” and “Not my body, not my choice.”Reynolds suggests in his Facebook posts that men should be careful not to pat themselves on the back for “helping,” that they check their own privilege regularly, and that they talk about these issues with their partners. More than anything, he tells HuffPost he suggests listening to women.“There is so much information out there about emotional labor, gender roles in the family, and the ways we can change this that it is really easy to figure out that this is a very real thing.

Reading the comic seemed to serve as an a-ha moment for many women that put words to their experience. It’s the same topic being addressed by one dad who’s trying to send the message to other men that doing your share of the work isn’t “helping out.” Dad and HuffPost blogger Mike Reynolds, also known as Everyday Girl Dad, posted on Facebook about a moment of realization he had while making lunches for his kids, when he thought of himself as giving his wife a “break.” “Truth be told, I probably make lunches the most often in our house because my brain wakes me up early,” he wrote. “But the simple fact that I thought of making lunches as ‘helping’ reminded me of how unfairly labour can be distributed in the household. Imagine the privilege, or lack of understanding, to be able to refer to doing work around the house as ‘helping.’”He went on to remind himself, and other fathers who might be reading, that doing domestic chores and childcare tasks are just part of your job as a parent and adult member of the household. “Making lunches, washing dishes, sweeping up dirt, folding laundry, picking up LEGO, signing tests, writing book order cheques, remembering it’s hot lunch day, getting money for popcorn day, feeding the cat, cleaning the kitty litter isn’t ‘helping out,’ it’s ‘equitably splitting labour,’” he writes.Reynolds is the father to two daughters, 5-year-old Charlotte and 7-year-old Leah. Reynolds told HuffPost he tries to talk about the division of labor as often as he can because he wants his daughters to grow up knowing there are no prescribed roles for them just based on their gender. “I’m not an expert, I am just a guy who makes mistakes, but wants to use those mistakes to get better at being a partner and a parent,” Reynolds told HuffPost. “I think messages like this coming from an average guy like me makes it easier to understand how this same thing can be happening in other families.” Reynolds has also created a line of T-shirts and sweatshirts featuring phrases that fight stereotypes about masculinity and fatherhood. The slogans on the shirts include, “Dads for daughters dating...and other choices they make for themselves” and “Not my body, not my choice.”Reynolds suggests in his Facebook posts that men should be careful not to pat themselves on the back for “helping,” that they check their own privilege regularly, and that they talk about these issues with their partners. More than anything, he tells HuffPost he suggests listening to women.“There is so much information out there about emotional labor, gender roles in the family, and the ways we can change this that it is really easy to figure out that this is a very real thing. I really think there is no better way to learn about this, though, than by listening to women talk about how these things show up in their lives.”The HuffPost Parents newsletter, So You Want To Raise A Feminist, offers the latest stories and news in progressive parenting.

On Thursday, Philippine army helicopters and special forces were deployed to restore order as fighting forced civilians to flee the city. Amid the conflict, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday said he is considering expanding martial law “throughout the country” to combat the threat of extremism.“I will not hesitate to do anything and everything to protect and preserve the Filipino nation,” Duterte said.Rights groups are extremely concerned about Duterte’s mention of nationwide martial law, warning that an expansion of police and military powers could further deteriorate human rights in the country. Duterte has been carrying out a brutal “drug war” since taking office that has left around 9,000 people dead, as emboldened police and vigilante groups commit extrajudicial killings of alleged drug dealers and users with impunity. “Martial law must not be an excuse nor an opportunity to limit or ignore human rights,” Rachel Chhoa-Howard, a researcher for Amnesty International, told HuffPost.Duterte said last year that he was “tempted” to aid his violent crackdown on drugs by declaring martial law ― a measure that would allow military intervention into domestic affairs and the detention of citizens without charge. This is only the second time that martial law has been invoked in the Philippines.The current state of martial law is intended to last 60 days, the maximum allowed by the constitution, and only applies to the island of Mindanao. But in a video released Wednesday, Duterte suggested it could be extended longer. The president claimed that he would be “harsh,” and that his use of martial law would not differ from that of former dictator Ferdinand Marcos.“This is deeply disturbing, given that Amnesty International documented tens of thousands of victims of human rights violations including extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detention, torture and enforced disappearances over the period of the Marcos regime,” Chhoa-Howard said. Marcos kept the Philippines under martial law for 14 years, until he was ousted from power in 1986.Duterte’s comments on martial law came on the same day that The Intercept published a leaked transcript of an April phone call between the leader and U.S. President Donald Trump. In the call, Trump effusively praised Duterte for doing an “unbelievable job on the drug problem.” The Philippines has long been fighting an Islamist militant insurgency in the country’s south, and in the last year the Abu Sayyaf militant group has drawn increased attention as it carried out high-profile kidnappings of foreign nationals. The extremist group beheaded a German hostage in February, as well as two Canadians in 2016.The attack on Marawi this week is believed to be an Abu Sayyaf operation in coordination with the ISIS-inspired Maute terror group.Abu Sayyaf is loosely linked with ISIS, and pledged allegiance to the group last year. Along with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and splinter group the Moro National Liberation Front, Abu Sayyaf is one of the groups that make up a wider insurgent movement that affects southern Philippine politics.

Greek police say they intercepted several suspected packages addressed to Greek, German and International Monetary Fund officials in the past two months.But Thursday’s blast, in which an unnamed police official said two others in the vehicle were also hurt, was the most prominent since a booby-trapped package killed a guard for then Public Order Minister Michalis Chrysohoidis in 2010.Papademos, a low-key figure who was more of a technocrat than a politician, was catapulted to the forefront of Greece’s debt crisis when he became caretaker prime minister from late 2011 to May 2012, fusing a fragile governing coalition between socialists and conservatives.The country remains in recession with the highest unemployment rate in Europe, and a stalled creditor review has interrupted payouts under its international bailout program, its third since 2010.Papademos also served as central bank governor from 1994 to 2002, and as vice-president of the European Central Bank from 2002 to 2010.A health ministry official said Papademos suffered injuries to his chest and abdomen after opening a package in his moving car.Greek media reported the vehicle was armored, containing the blast within its interior.Footage from the scene, at a busy intersection in central Athens during rush hour, showed a black vehicle with its hazard lights on, virtually undamaged save for extensive cracks on the front windscreen.“I felt my car shake ...it was like a small earthquake,” an eyewitness told Greece’s Skai TV. He said he saw the doors of the vehicle be prised open from the blast.“It was total panic,” he said.Papademos has been in retirement since stepping down as caretaker prime minister in May 2012.A Greek central bank source said Papademos had just left the Bank of Greece building when the explosion occurred. It was unclear whether the suspect package had been delivered there.A police source said fragments of an envelope found at the scene of the incident suggested it was delivered to the Academy of Athens, of which Papademos is president.An envelope containing bullets and addressed to Greece’s general secretary for public revenue was intercepted at a post office branch in Athens on Tuesday.In March, police intercepted eight suspect packages at a postal sorting center in Athens, days after letter bombs were sent and detected at the German Finance Ministry and the IMF in Paris. The rigged package to the IMF exploded, injuring an employee.(Reporting by George Georgiopoulos, Renee Maltezou, Karolina Tagaris and Michele Kambas; Editing by Andrew Heavens and John Stonestreet)"

They found 15 rubber and wooden boats full of people, while many others were swimming or floating in the water nearby.But the Aquarius’ rescue was interrupted when two individuals who purported to be coast guard members disembarked from a ship marked with official Libyan coast guard seal and flags. The men, armed with what looked like AK-47s, boarded one of the rubber dinghies with approximately 100 migrants aboard, she said. They then proceeded to take everyone’s valuables. “We could see from the Aquarius that one guy put his Kalashnikov in the air and fired three shots, then they started the rubber boat’s engine [to head back towards Libya],” she said. “People started jumping overboard.”MSF and SOS Mediterranee ended up pulling 67 people out of the water from that one boat and rescued 1,004 individuals from all the boats in total that day, she added. The victims came from various countries, including Nigeria, Guinea, Ghana, and Bangladesh. Miraculously, no one died because most were wearing life vests. Many of the migrants journeying across the Mediterranean never learned to swim, Kreey noted. “When the Libyans pointed their weapons at us, asking us to give them all our money and cell phones and telling us to jump in the water, we did what they said,” one Gambian survivor told the rescue groups. “I was not afraid; I preferred to die at sea rather than being repressed and to die in Libya.”This type of situation is unusual, Kreey said, but it’s a reminder of just how precarious these missions are, especially when dealing with a failed state like Libya.In most cases the Libyan coast guard has ships stationed in the area where non-governmental organizations perform rescue missions but they don’t interfere, she added. Sometimes, however, the Libyan coast guard perform the rescue themselves and bring the migrants and refugees back to Libya.  Libya is a completely lawless state, with an economy that runs in large part on trafficking of all kinds. The many, many migrants that are stuck in Libya waiting to board boats towards Europe are a core component of this exploitive economic model. The country’s authorities have failed to crack down on the human rights abuses, and now have even more of an incentive to keep migrants within Libya’s borders.Many European countries have found themselves overwhelmed by a mass influx of migrants and refugees in the last few years. The European Union agreed to offer Libya’s U.N.-supported government more than $200 million in March to prevent migrants from traveling to Europe by training its coast guard to perform search and rescue operations.But according to Kreey, several people who had boarded the Aquarius have attempted to cross the Mediterranean before. They tell NGO staff that when they were transported back to Libya by the coast guard, they were “brought to a detention center and had to either work their way out or pay their way out of detention.” “We’re hearing widespread allegations of torture and ubiquitous levels of rape among women,” said a coordinator with the SOS Mediterranee who asked to remain anonymous due to death threats. Many rescued migrants board the Aquarius with bullet wounds and scars they say are due to extensive torture. In addition, the fact that members of the Libyan coast guard boarded the raft to scare migrants and seize their valuables demonstrates a blatant disregard for the wellbeing of people in distress, said Annemarie Loof, an MSF operational manager. “Their behavior was reckless — if not directly threatening — to the people on the boats.”It’s even more concerning given that the Libyan coast guard has been receiving training from the European Union, Kreey said. The EU’s maritime search and rescue mission, Operation Sophia, started the second phase of its training program with the Libyan coast guard and navy in January.Operation Sophia did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

But last Friday, 63-year-old Duvinson Jeanty was right alongside his son receiving a bachelor’s degree of his own. Duvinson and his 27-year-old son Benjamin both graduated from William Paterson University in New Jersey and are the first in their family to receive college degrees. Duvinson, a Haitian immigrant, retired from his 25-year stint as a New Jersey Transit bus driver in 2013 to become a full-time student at the university. “It’s always been my dream, my goal to finish college,” Duvinson told CBS New York. Like Duvinson, Benjamin didn’t take the straight and narrow path in his pursuit of higher education. After a year at Rutgers University in 2008, he left the school and began working in the fast food industry. Three years later, he realized he wanted to pursue something he felt was more purposeful. “I starting making good money, and making money is cool, but how am I serving the community? How am I helping others?” Benjamin told Fox News. Part of the inspiration for Benjamin’s change of heart came from witnessing how passionate his dad was about obtaining an education. Instead of returning to Rutgers to pursue psychology, Benjamin enrolled at William Paterson, where his dad was already studying finance.“He was my biggest cheerleader and inspiration,” Benjamin told InsideEdition.com. “There were some times I’d come home from work or class late and I’d see him studying and it would encourage me. Seeing him walk across the stage and get his diploma was indescribable.”"

During his confirmation hearing in January, Sessions failed to disclose he met with Kislyak twice in 2016 when asked about Trump campaign connections to Russian officials. After The Washington Post revealed that Sessions met with Kislyak twice, the attorney general recused himself from any Justice Department investigation into Russian meddling in the U.S. campaign. Sessions, who advised Donald Trump during the presidential campaign, insisted at the time that his meetings with Kislyak were normal and that the Russian ambassador was just one of a number of diplomats who sought meetings with him. Sessions later amended his testimony to the Senate to include his meetings with Kislyak.The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a HuffPost request for comment Wednesday. A statement was related in a Twitter message, however.Sessions is the third Trump official facing scrutiny for failing to disclose information while seeking a security clearance. Michael Flynn, fired as Trump’s national security adviser in February after misleading Vice President Mike Pence about conversations with Kislyak, also failed to disclose income from Russia when he applied for a renewal of his security clearance last year, according to The New York Times. Jared Kushner, Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law, warned the FBI a day after submitting his security clearance forms that he had failed to list foreign contacts.“In the Bush Administration someone who lied on a security clearance form would have been out the door within 24 hrs,” Richard W. Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota and the chief White House ethics lawyer for George W. Bush, said on Twitter."

At the same time, her partner (Anna Martine Freeman) tells Alice that he identifies as transgender. Though Brittain’s play grapples with themes of sexuality and identity, “Rotterdam” is ultimately a romantic comedy and, as such, concludes on an upbeat note for its central couple. The playwright, whose theatrical résumé also includes “A Super Happy Story (About Feeling Super Sad)” and “The Sexual Awakening of Peter Mayo,” told HuffPost that he began writing the play after several of his close friends came out to him as transgender. At the time, he said, he hadn’t seen many trans characters depicted in theater. “Over the years, I’ve tried to include LGBTQ characters in my work, even when they’re not the leads,” Brittain said. Over time, he became interested in “the idea of a character who have come to terms with their sexuality, who would then have to reconcile with their partner’s sense of identity,” and then find a way to reconcile the relationship. Brittain, who identifies as straight, said he was aware that his perspective on queer issues could be interpreted as “problematic” and, as such, went to extra lengths to “do the legwork” and be “respectful” as he wrote “Rotterdam.”“There was a slight worry in my mind that it would seem cynical. I am aware that I carry a huge male privilege into this arena,” he said. “I know I’m writing about other people’s experiences... I like to think that I take that responsibility very seriously.” To that end, critics seem to be on board with Brittain’s work. “Rotterdam,” which premiered at London’s Theatre 503, has received almost universal acclaim since its 2015 debut. The Evening Standard called it a “lively, sensitive, hard-hitting piece about love, gender and sexuality,” while The Stage praised it for “managing to speak eloquently about a complex issue.” It went on to make history in April when it nabbed an Olivier Award (the British version of a Tony Award) for Outstanding Achievement in an Affiliate Theatre. That honor made it the first play to feature a transgender protagonist to win an Olivier. Ultimately, Brittain would be happy if “Rotterdam” encouraged conversations about LGBTQ relationships outside of the theater, too. “I think the play raises some questions more so than it comes down to specific answers,” he told HuffPost. “It would great if people came away thinking, ‘I need to educate myself and find out more,’ and that those who have already educated themselves see it as a positive contribution to that conversation.”Jon Brittain’s “Rotterdam” runs at 59E59 Theater in New York through June 10.

26,POLITICS,American Seeking Trump Administration Help Turns 18 In Egyptian Jail,Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/american-egyptian-jail_us_5927556fe4b06f6080532c15,"Ahmed Hassan, locked up since December, says he just wants to finish his studies.",2017-05-25,Ahmed Hassan's family lived in New Jersey before moving back to Egypt some years ago.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59275d681600002100ddcec5.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― An American caught up in the Egyptian government’s ongoing wave of repression turned 18 on Thursday behind bars, where he has been since December.“Six months of my life have been wasted with no reason,” Ahmed Hassan told HuffPost Thursday during a brief phone call permitted by the authorities. “Today’s my birthday and I’m in jail right now. ... I’m so sad, and physically I’m just down.”Egyptian police seized Hassan in December, when he tried to block the arrest of his uncle for a minor building code violation. He has been jailed with adults since then. A judge handed him a one-year sentence in February.Hassan is one of up to 20 Americans believed to be held by the Cairo government, which human rights advocates say is engaging in the cruelest crackdown in recent Egyptian history. The teen wrote to President Donald Trump about his case in April, seeking intervention, and lawmakers from his home state of New Jersey have repeatedly sought Trump administration help as well.Last month, Trump loudly celebrated his role in personally intervening to push Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi to release U.S. citizen Aya Hijazi, an aid worker. But advocates for Hassan and the other detainees have complained of inaction since then.“The U.S. embassy in Cairo didn’t do anything for me,” Hassan said. “They came to see me for just two minutes and sat in the office of the police officer. They didn’t see where I am, where I live, where I eat. ... Just came to say, hello, how’s it going?”That story is consistent with a letter the State Department sent to Hassan’s congressional representatives this month. The letter, shared with HuffPost, said consular staff would be willing to help him change incarceration facilities if he chooses.Hassan said he is confined in a room with 23 adult men, “sleeping in a very, very small place” and surviving on small portions of bread. His family is in Egypt, where they moved from New Jersey some years ago, but relatives are only allowed to see him for a few minutes each week, Hassan said. “Because I’m an American citizen, they don’t want to do anything easy to me. They didn’t want me to get out,” Hassan said. “When they know that I’m an American citizen, they tell me: ‘You think that because you’re an American citizen you will get out? You will still be in jail.’”Hassan, in his March 25 letter to Trump, wrote: “I am proud to be an American. I beg you to defend my right to be free.”He said he believes video footage of his arrest proves he did nothing wrong. In a video shared publicly by Egyptian American activist Mohamed Soltan, two figures who appear to be in uniform stand on either side of a man and march him toward a vehicle. A figure ― presumably Hassan ― tries to stop them, and one of the apparent security officers begins to beat him. The man fights Hassan to the ground and then drags him into the vehicle.Hassan said he hopes to continue his studies once he’s released.For now, there’s no evidence of serious Trump administration action on his behalf. Sens. Cory Booker (D) and Bob Menendez (D), and Rep. Frank LoBiondo (R), all of New Jersey, asked the president to raise the matter during a meeting with Sisi in Saudi Arabia last weekend. Hassan’s lawyer, Praveen Madhiraju of the nonprofit Pretrial Rights International, told HuffPost on Thursday he had not heard that Trump acted on the request. "

What's not to love?,2017-05-25,House Speaker Paul Ryan speaks on Thursday about the Congressional Budget Office's scoring of the GOP's health care legislation and the outlook for raising the U.S. debt ceiling.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5927287e1600002100ddcdc5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― House Republicans have finally seen an updated Congressional Budget Office score for the American Health Care Act, and while the legislation reportedly would be disastrous ― 23 million fewer people with insurance over 10 years, plus higher costs for people with pre-existing conditions and women seeking maternity care ― Republicans showed little remorse for passing the bill. “I said for weeks I had zero confidence in the CBO,” Rep. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) told HuffPost on Thursday. “You would never hire them to manage your retirement plan, so it came out exactly what I expected it to be.”Marshall dismissed concerns that the CBO indicates it would become more difficult for people with pre-existing conditions to purchase insurance in states that waive certain Obamacare regulations and that those people would see their premiums “increase rapidly.”“The CBO’s crazy,” Marshall said, adding that sick people would be “even better protected with our legislation than they would before.”The report issued Wednesday said the GOP bill would save $119 billion over 10 years, but that savings would come from slashing $834 billion from Medicaid and cutting taxes that were used to fund Obamacare by about $600 billion. The CBO also said low-income seniors, sick people and women seeking maternity care could all face significantly steeper prices, while healthy people in states that waive protections for the vulnerable could see their premiums fall by as much as 30 percent.But many Republicans have cast doubt on the CBO, citing the federal agency’s 2010 score for the Affordable Care Act as proof that the scorekeepers can be wrong. Of the more than 20 Republicans HuffPost asked for a reaction, almost all of them shrugged off the CBO report and remained supportive of the bill.“The CBO is very good at crunching budget numbers,” Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) said. “It has demonstrated it doesn’t have the first clue about how [health care] markets work.”McClintock went on to cite missed Obamacare projections on small premium increases and the number of people who would enroll in the exchanges. (The CBO said there would be around 24 million people electing insurance through the exchanges, while the number ended up being closer to 10 million. And the CBO was off on the number of people who would be helped through Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion: The projection said around 10 million when the number was closer to 14 million.)“So their policy discussions are helpful,” McClintock said. “They are often wildly inaccurate.”Health policy experts have acknowledged some of the missed projections for Obamacare. But the Commonwealth Fund also said “the CBO’s projections were closer to realized experience than were those of many other prominent forecasters.” And a fact check of how close the CBO projection was for Obamacare concluded that the analysts were not “way, way off.”Still, Republicans have a point that the CBO was overly optimistic about the effects of Obamacare. Premiums have gone up, and fewer people have enrolled in the exchanges as a result. And that false optimism in 2010 has led Republicans to conclude that the CBO is overly pessimistic now.“CBO has been wrong on so many fronts it ain’t even funny,” Rep. Bill Johnson (R-Ohio) said.“There have been so many false assumptions by CBO,” Johnson added. “But what they did verify is that our health care plan ― the American Health Care Plan ― reduces the deficits and lowers premiums.”When HuffPost raised the point that the CBO score said the GOP health care bill would not lower premiums for sick people in states that waived protections for people with pre-existing conditions, Johnson said, “Sure it does. I don’t believe them.”The CBO also said older people with low incomes would face substantially higher premiums. For example, a 64-year-old making $26,500 a year is expected to pay more than $16,000 a year in premiums for health insurance, even after a tax credit is applied. That same person would pay $1,700 a year in premiums under Obamacare.But Republicans said they simply don’t trust the CBO score and generally seemed unconcerned that 23 million people may lose their health insurance.Rep. Daniel Webster (R-Fla.), who was on the fence about the bill until the day before the May 4 vote, said 23 million people electing not to buy health insurance as a result of the GOP bill was “basically a picture of when people are not forced to buy broccoli, they don’t eat it.”Only Republicans who voted against the health care bill seemed to take the CBO report seriously.Vulnerable Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) said she continued to have “a lot of other concerns about the bill.” Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), chairman of the moderate Tuesday Group, seemed concerned that other Republicans haven’t addressed how many people are projected to lose insurance as a result of this bill.“Too many people are going to be without coverage as a result of legislation that was haphazardly constructed and hastily considered,” Dent said. “And it’s part of the reason why we have an issue here.The one Republican who seemed generally upset by some of the CBO’s projections was the man who was instrumental in reviving the bill: Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who chairs the conservative Freedom Caucus. Meadows continued to defend the bill after the CBO score was released, pointing to the high-risk pools that states would need to create to waive certain protections for people with preexisting conditions. But after reading a couple of paragraphs about less healthy people facing higher premiums, he began tearing up and talking about what the health care bill meant to him.“I lost my sister to breast cancer,” Meadows said Wednesday. “I lost my dad to lung cancer. If anybody is sensitive to pre-existing conditions, it’s me. And I’m not going to make a political decision today that affects somebody’s sister or father, because I wouldn’t do it to myself. And so I tell you that in the most earnest of ways that we’re going to get this right, not just because of my sister and my dad, we’re going to get it right for the American people because that’s the right thing to do.”Meadows also suggested that he would be willing to keep more of the Obamacare taxes to help keep more people on Medicaid and to offset the cost of health insurance for sick people.“In the end,” Meadows said, “what we’ve got to do is make sure there’s enough funds there to handle pre-existing conditions and drive down premiums. And if we can’t do those [two] things, then we will have failed.”Still, Meadows remained supportive of the bill, and his less-than-enthusiastic reaction was the exception, not the norm. When HuffPost asked Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.) for her take on the CBO score ― which, again, says 23 million fewer people will have insurance, that sick people could face significantly steeper costs, and that women could have to pay around $1,000 a month more for insurance that covers maternity care ― Foxx said, “I think it’s great.”House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) expressed relief over the score. Republicans had held onto the bill for two weeks and not sent it to the Senate because they feared it would not save the requisite $2 billion it needed to keep its reconciliation status.“I’m actually comforted by the CBO report because it shows, yeah, we’re going to lower premiums,” Ryan said.Laura Barrón-López contributed to this report."

This followed her being separated from her parents, brother and sister.“I can’t tell you everything that was going on because you might cry with me,” she said in a recent interview with Captivate Media Consulting, in which she recounted her harrowing life story.Begam’s longtime desire to receive her diploma was first shared in 2010, when she visited with students at Wayzata High School where her granddaughter worked as a secretary.There, while speaking with students, one asked her what her biggest regret was.“I expected her to say, I wish we would have run, I wish we would have hidden, I wish we would have saved pictures,” teacher Candice Ledman recalled to KARE-TV. “She said, ‘The one thing I regret is not getting my high school diploma.’”Begam shared that her parents were both highly educated people, with her father, who was a rabbi, having served as a chaplain in the Polish army.At the war’s end, against her greatest hope, she learned that her family had perished at the Auschwitz concentration camp.“You try not to remember everything but it’s not easy,” she said in her interview.At the age of 17, she married another Holocaust survivor and moved to the U.S. Having never finished school, however, remained a sore spot in her heart. Upon hearing of her longing, Ledman said she asked the school’s administrators if they could make Begam’s dream a reality.The request was initially turned down and not brought up again until a new principal came to the school, Scott Gengler. Once he heard the family’s request, he granted almost immediate approval, Ledman said.“It’s 71 years overdue,” Gengler told KARE-TV of the request.Asked in her interview if she had any advice she’d give others, Begam answered: “Just try to do your best.

An hourslong gun battle ensued, in which at least five people including civilians and soldiers were killed.But the surveillance camera video, obtained and independently verified by Amnesty International, contradicts parts of their story and offers graphic evidence of the armed forces’ oft-unreported atrocities, rights groups allege.It purports to show uniformed troops dragging an injured, unarmed man along the ground on the night of May 3.

In late 2006, the government deployed thousands of troops in an escalated effort to address the crisis, but the ongoing intervention is widely considered to be a failure.Nieto, who took office in 2012, promised to shift away from militarization as the main strategy to quash cartel operations, but his government has faced widespread criticism for making minimal progress on that front.

Lush, the activist-minded cosmetics company, was kicking off an anti-capital punishment campaign at its Michigan Avenue store, complete with speakers, including a death row exonoree, and a mini-documentary about wrongful convictions. Lush launched a special edition of its signature product, the bath bomb, to raised funds for the campaign, and it has drawn the notice of Teen Vogue, the beauty and lifestyle site Refinery29 and others. At a store where customers typically come to sample beauty products or maybe enjoy a bachelorette party, neither the setting nor the audience was typical of the traditional anti-death penalty contingent ― and that’s exactly what advocates want.Anti-death penalty advocates have looked to recent successful social justice movements as a blueprint. The goal, they say, is for the anti-death penalty movement to make the same progress as issues such as marriage equality and environmental protection, and to move from a back-burner issue to wider acceptance.“We used to be in a lot of churches and vigils exclusively,” Diann Rust-Tierney, executive director of the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, said at the Chicago event (the NCADP is a beneficiary of the campaign). “But now, opposition to the death penalty is the mainstream. Why not have it here?” Such partnerships seem poised for success: Activists can capitalize on a company’s broad reach and mainstream status to amplify and normalize a message, while the company can align with an issue that reinforces its identity at a time when a brand taking a socially conscious position is not only common but even advantageous. Rust-Tierney said at least 20 national organizations ― from pharmaceutical companies to the travel, entertainment and tech conglomerate Virgin ― have taken a stance against the death penalty.“What Lush is doing is taking an activist position against the death penalty, and they feel that’s consistent with their corporate mission, which has been involved wth social justice for some time,” said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit that compiles and analyzes data on capital punishment.Dunham agrees that, by all indications, the anti-death penalty movement has edged its way into mainstream acceptance, as polls show. “The phenomenon is not new, but it is emerging now that you have it associated with a product that has broader commercial appeal,” Dunham said of Lush’s effort. “A restaurant is one thing, when you have a small but reliable clientele. A company that sells products to the general public is a different story. But it’s part of the same phenomenon that shows the trend continues to evolve.”Though support for the death penalty remains strong, particularly among older and more politically conservative people, it has fallen over the past few decades: 80 percent of Americans backed the death penalty in the mid-1990s, according to Gallup polling; last year, support had fallen to 60 percent. Dunham notes that anti-death penalty support is in part generational. “It’s more like the issue of marriage equality and climate change, where the younger you are, more often than not it’s not even an issue — you’re more likely to wonder why there even is a death penalty,” he said. The death penalty is also increasingly viewed as a social justice issue because of racial and economic bias in sentencing, said Dunham. As a result, the anti-death penalty movement fits in with other social justice issues, like criminal justice reform, income inequality and racism. The growing opposition to the death penalty includes high-profile figures such as Pope Francis and institutions including the Democratic Party, which added abolition of the death penalty to its platform last year. “When one of the two major political parties has a plank in its platform about something, you can’t say that the issue is that far outside the mainstream.” For decades, death penalty opposition was championed by a set of reliable groups that included liberal lawmakers, criminal justice reformers and progressive Catholics.The tent has broadened considerably to include groups like political conservatives and evangelical Christians. Leno Rose-Avila, executive director of Witness to Innocence, which supports those who have been exonerated after serving time in prison, hopes to make it an even bigger tent. “One of the areas we missed over the years was not reaching women and not reaching young people,” Rose-Avila said. “We were successful in some levels with legislatures, which were usually older men. But we found there was new demographic out there that hasn’t been reached.”“Look at the environment, Black Lives Matter, immigration ― they’re youthful movements,” he added. “You don’t see too many gray hairs out there.”Rose-Avila recalls working in the South for Amnesty International in the late 1980s when the nonprofit made the same kind of outreach to youth that anti-death penalty groups are making now: The 1988 Human Rights Now! campaign was a multi-city tour that featured artists such as Bruce Springsteen, Tracy Chapman and Sting. It was underwritten by the philanthropic arm of Reebok. “Every movement needs a major stakeholder,” noted Rust-Tierney, of the NCADP. Advocates are aware that pushback will continue even as the anti-death penalty movement advances ― just as it has with gay rights. In last November’s election, California, Nebraska and Oklahoma passed pro-death penalty ballot referendums. It also remains a fraught emotional issue, especially for the families of murder victims. Rust-Tierney hopes the current campaign and others that may follow will reach more people ― including victims. “There’s no right or wrong way for victims to feel about the death penalty. Having the conversation is the victory. We also want to put the focus back on healing. The death penalty traumatizes everyone it touches.” "

The pop star, wearing a pantsuit designed by a Parsons graduate, was there to be honored by the fashion school for her work as both a style icon and a humanitarian. The singer’s acceptance speech was directed at the students, and how they deserve much more credit for their contributions to the world than they receive. “You should be celebrated for every aspect of your growth and your growing pains,” Rihanna, who partnered with Donna Karan to lead a school fellowship program, said. “You should be celebrated for your creativity, for your fearlessness, for your persistence and determination. You should be celebrated for all the effort that you put into building your future, for being different, for not being given enough credit—for not having to use eye cream! My point is, we often tear our youth down when we should be building them up. At the end of the day, our future is in their hands.”The singer gave a similarly inspiring message in March, when she accepted Harvard’s Humanitarian of the Year award, saying: “You don’t have to be rich to be a humanitarian, to help somebody. You don’t have to be famous. You don’t have to be college-educated.”Later in the evening during the Parsons gala, Rihanna revealed the winner of the “Design Fellowship Program.” Through the program, three Parsons students will get the chance to work on a fashion merchandise line in Haiti for Rihanna’s Clara Lionel Foundation.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59273981200000290016eef6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A Pennsylvania dad’s viral Facebook post is spreading a safety message for parents of young baseball players. On May 16, John Curtin posted a photo of his son’s Under Armour heart guard shirt ― a special garment designed to protect athletes from potentially deadly blows to the chest. “For all you parents that have children that pitch, do me a favor and run out and buy a heart guard shirt for your child,” Curtin wrote in the caption. “My 11 year old Ryan wears one, and it literally might have saved his life today.”The dad described his son’s scary ordeal. “He was pitching and one of the hardest hit line drives came back and hit him straight dead center in the chest and the heart guard absorbed the hit. He was in a lot of pain but a lot better than the alternative.”One of Ryan’s coaches, who is an EMT, reportedly told Curtin that if his son hadn’t been wearing the heart guard shirt, the outcome might’ve been a lot worse. “It was one of the scariest moments I ever had with my kids,” the dad wrote, adding that he took his son to urgent care for chest X-rays. Curtin’s post has been shared over 94,000 times. He told Scary Mommy that the X-rays came back clear, and Ryan is OK. There is debate surrounding the effectiveness of chest protectors in preventing commotio cordis ― a rare but often fatal disruption of the heart’s rhythm due to blunt impact to the chest area. Still, for many parents, the possibility of protection that heart guards promise give them peace of mind. “If you want your child to wear one fine, but don’t think that nothing can still happen,” wrote one commenter.Added another, “Parenting is about protecting your children from as much as humanly possible, not weighing the odds.”"

Forty-three percent of survey respondents said they knew someone who received disability or survivors’ benefits from Social Security, according to a 2010 poll by AARP. (Asked if they knew someone simply “on Social Security,” more than two-thirds said they did.) Mulvaney insisted disability insurance shouldn’t count as Social Security because President Donald Trump promised during the campaign that he would never support cutting Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid. Trump’s budget, which Mulvaney unveiled this week, breaks that promise by proposing cuts to both Medicaid and Social Security. Because it doesn’t target Social Security’s retirement insurance component, Mulvaney dubiously claims the proposal doesn’t break Trump’s promise. “If you ask 999 people out of 1,000, [they] would tell you that Social Security disability is not part of Social Security,” Mulvaney said on Monday. “It’s old-age retirement that they think of when they think of Social Security.”If 43 percent of Americans have heard of Social Security Disability Insurance, per the AARP poll, then that means Mulvaney’s assertion is not correct.And, as the progressive think tank Center on Budget and Policy Priorities notes, even Republicans amenable to cutting Social Security Disability Insurance have talked about the program as a basic part of Social Security.“Social Security provides vital financial support for more than 57 million beneficiaries,” House Speaker Paul Ryan’s (R-Wis.) congressional website says. “Social Security also provides critical benefits to widows and those with disabilities.”As a teenager, Ryan and his mother received Social Security survivors’ benefits after his father’s death, another element of the program that Mulvaney’s narrower definition of Social Security excludes.Getting the benefits “helped me pay for college, it helped her go back to college in her 50s where she started a small business because of the new skills she got,” Ryan recalled during the 2012 vice presidential debate.Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has also discussed the importance of Social Security survivors’ benefits for his younger sister, when both their parents died in a short span of time.And Rep. Sam Johnson (R-Texas), chairman of the Social Security subcommittee on the House Ways and Means Committee, has spoken about the program as a crucial source of insurance in the event of a severe disability.“For years I’ve talked about the need to fix Social Security so that our children and grandchildren can count on it to be there for them, just like it’s there for today’s seniors and individuals with disabilities,” Johnson said in December.In fact, it was a Republican who first created the Social Security Disability Insurance program. President Dwight D. Eisenhower expanded Social Security to cover workers with disabilities and their dependents in 1956. From that point on, Social Security became known as the Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance program.The disability benefits part of Social Security was a natural extension of the program’s mission to enable workers to contribute toward a fund that would provide them income for times when they are no longer capable of working. Disability benefits, like Social Security retirement benefits, are based on a certain percentage of a worker’s previous earnings, rather than need, like some means-tested welfare programs.Some policy experts who helped conceive of Social Security in the 1930s favored making disability benefits part of the original program, according to a history on the Social Security Administration website. They were overruled by colleagues concerned about the cost of adding those benefits, and critics in the private disability insurance industry, delaying its passage for an additional two decades."

A new virtual reality gallery offers 360-degree views of some of America's best underwater treasures.,2017-05-25,"The ""Christ of the Abyss"" statue is located in the Key Largo Dry Docks Sanctuary Preservation Area of Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. In addition to attracting numerous invertebrates that have attached to its surface, giving it a colorful living texture, this nine-foot bronze statue is a popular destination for snorkelers and divers.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/592690671600002100ddcbb7.jpeg?cache=v2vLNUuYvC&ops=scalefit_970_noupscale,"The United States is home to many underwater treasures: the haunting shipwrecks of Thunder Bay, the colorful corals of Gray’s Reef, the barnacle-covered statue of Christ in the Florida Keys.For most Americans, however, these sights are out of reach. Though half of the U.S. population lives within 50 miles of a coast, only a tiny fraction — fewer than 5 percent, according to some industry estimates — actively dive or snorkel.But thanks to an online project spearheaded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, everyone can now experience these underwater wonders in vivid detail. Diving knowledge isn’t required and you won’t even get wet; all you need is a smartphone, tablet or computer.The Virtual Dive Gallery, launched earlier this month, allows users to explore U.S. national marine sanctuaries online. There are currently 360-degree, virtual reality images of five sanctuaries available: the ship graveyard of Thunder Bay in Lake Huron, the Florida Keys, Gray’s Reef in Georgia, Flower Garden Banks in the Gulf of Mexico, and the coral reefs around American Samoa. A virtual reality headset isn’t necessary to enjoy the images, but makes the experience all the more true to life.“We can put a window to the ocean in the palm of someone’s hand and let them explore the underwater world and national marine sanctuaries through that window,” Mitchell Tartt, chief of the NOAA Office of National Marine Sanctuaries’ Conservation Science Division, told The Verge this week of the VR gallery.This window doesn’t introduce people just to the beauty of underwater environments, but to the tragedies found there too. Climate change, pollution and other human actions are damaging many marine sanctuaries in the U.S., said NOAA — destruction that many Americans will never see firsthand. The virtual gallery is a way for people to better connect with these problems by witnessing the degradation for themselves.“Sometimes, seeing really is believing,” Chiara Zuccarino-Crowe, tourism and recreation coordinator at NOAA’s Office of National Marine Sanctuaries, told HuffPost in an email Wednesday. “The majority of the public doesn’t have regular opportunities to go scuba diving or snorkeling, so they can’t experience these environments first-hand. The virtual dive galleries let us bring sanctuaries to the public. The thrill of seeing them in a totally new way ― as if you were there underwater ― makes the environmental and resource protection issues more tangible.”The gallery currently includes images from American Samoa of staghorn corals before, during and after a 2015 bleaching event. Bleaching, caused by warming temperatures and pollution, is devastating reefs worldwide.People can also explore images of bleached corals in Flower Garden Banks, and invasive species like lionfish, which are wreaking havoc on ecosystems in sanctuaries like the Florida Keys.“Being in the middle of a coral reef undergoing a bleaching event ― and being able to flash forward a couple months at the click of a button to see the extent of coral death or recovery ― really underscores the urgency in addressing the stressors impacting our marine environment,” Zuccarino-Crowe said. The virtual gallery is a collaboration between NOAA’s Office of National Marine Sanctuaries and the privately funded XL Catlin Seaview Survey, a global project aimed at documenting the health of the world’s reefs. It has been many years in the making, beginning back in 2014.Since then, divers have been collecting images from marine sanctuaries across the U.S. using cameras enclosed in waterproof boxes. No extra lighting is used unless the shoot takes place more than 10 feet underwater, Tartt told The Verge. This way, viewers are offered a more authentic experience. “Part of what I like about these images is not to post-process them too much,” Tartt said. “Part of the engaging part is to make them look like they would look like if a diver went there.” NOAA said it will continue to add virtual dives to the gallery as more images become available.

The force of the collision left a massive hole in Pewabic's side and the wooden steamer sank in less than four minutes. Many of its passengers went down with the vessel, making the incident one of the most tragic losses in Great Lakes maritime history.

Though half of the U.S. population lives within 50 miles of a coast, only a tiny fraction — fewer than 5 percent, according to some industry estimates — actively dive or snorkel.But thanks to an online project spearheaded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, everyone can now experience these underwater wonders in vivid detail. Diving knowledge isn’t required and you won’t even get wet; all you need is a smartphone, tablet or computer.The Virtual Dive Gallery, launched earlier this month, allows users to explore U.S. national marine sanctuaries online. There are currently 360-degree, virtual reality images of five sanctuaries available: the ship graveyard of Thunder Bay in Lake Huron, the Florida Keys, Gray’s Reef in Georgia, Flower Garden Banks in the Gulf of Mexico, and the coral reefs around American Samoa. A virtual reality headset isn’t necessary to enjoy the images, but makes the experience all the more true to life.“We can put a window to the ocean in the palm of someone’s hand and let them explore the underwater world and national marine sanctuaries through that window,” Mitchell Tartt, chief of the NOAA Office of National Marine Sanctuaries’ Conservation Science Division, told The Verge this week of the VR gallery.This window doesn’t introduce people just to the beauty of underwater environments, but to the tragedies found there too. Climate change, pollution and other human actions are damaging many marine sanctuaries in the U.S., said NOAA — destruction that many Americans will never see firsthand. The virtual gallery is a way for people to better connect with these problems by witnessing the degradation for themselves.“Sometimes, seeing really is believing,” Chiara Zuccarino-Crowe, tourism and recreation coordinator at NOAA’s Office of National Marine Sanctuaries, told HuffPost in an email Wednesday. “The majority of the public doesn’t have regular opportunities to go scuba diving or snorkeling, so they can’t experience these environments first-hand. The virtual dive galleries let us bring sanctuaries to the public. The thrill of seeing them in a totally new way ― as if you were there underwater ― makes the environmental and resource protection issues more tangible.”The gallery currently includes images from American Samoa of staghorn corals before, during and after a 2015 bleaching event. Bleaching, caused by warming temperatures and pollution, is devastating reefs worldwide.People can also explore images of bleached corals in Flower Garden Banks, and invasive species like lionfish, which are wreaking havoc on ecosystems in sanctuaries like the Florida Keys.“Being in the middle of a coral reef undergoing a bleaching event ― and being able to flash forward a couple months at the click of a button to see the extent of coral death or recovery ― really underscores the urgency in addressing the stressors impacting our marine environment,” Zuccarino-Crowe said. The virtual gallery is a collaboration between NOAA’s Office of National Marine Sanctuaries and the privately funded XL Catlin Seaview Survey, a global project aimed at documenting the health of the world’s reefs. It has been many years in the making, beginning back in 2014.Since then, divers have been collecting images from marine sanctuaries across the U.S. using cameras enclosed in waterproof boxes. No extra lighting is used unless the shoot takes place more than 10 feet underwater, Tartt told The Verge. This way, viewers are offered a more authentic experience. “Part of what I like about these images is not to post-process them too much,” Tartt said. “Part of the engaging part is to make them look like they would look like if a diver went there.” NOAA said it will continue to add virtual dives to the gallery as more images become available.

On May 22, I headed to Tamil Sangam in southern New Delhi. It was a very hot day around 40 degrees. A little girl carrying a jar bigger than her body caught my eyes. ""I came to get water, but I only filled the jar about half way up,"" she said. Her friends were holding a bucket of water each. Some of them were full of water, and some of them were empty. The girl with the jar said, ""There will be no more water today.""Tamil Sangnam is a slum in southern New Delhi. In this region, water pipes are not properly installed and most residents get water supply using their water buckets. They get drinking water once a week when government-sponsored water tankers arrive. However, local residents were fed up with continued droughts and lack of water. Devendra Singh (51), who has been selling fans for more than 20 years, said, ""I took a shower for the first time in a week when it rained a few days ago. I usually don't wash properly because there is no water. We suffer severe water scarcity every year. But this is not what irritates us most. All of us hate them.""The object of his anger was the ""Water Mafia"", an informal group of locals that illegally dig a well or steal water from the government, and then resell it at a premium. I was able to hear the details of the water mafia's threats. They have damaged plastic hoses of water tankers that came once a week and intentionally damaged the government-sponsored water tanks, making it impossible to supply water to the residents. Then they were selling water at an expensive price to residents who did not get water in time. One of the local residents said, ""I want to get mad at them, but I can't. Police aren't on our side. Without them, we have to get water from the Yamuna Rive, which is 30 kilometers away.""Kundan (41), the father of six, is also suffering because of the water mafia. ""I have to spend 3,000 rupees ($46) out of a monthly salary of 13,000 rupees ($200) on clean water. By saving this, I could send my children to a better school,"" he said. ""I'm just waiting for the monsoon to come.""One resident claimed, ""The water that should be supplied to us is stolen by the water mafia and it's supplied to shopping malls and hotels."" He said, ""Every day, I watch them delivering water to nearby malls and hotels late at night and early in the morning.""To find the truth, I headed to the shopping mall the resident mentioned, at midnight on Tuesday.

It wasn't a government-sponsored one, but a private water tanker.As I was looking closely at the water tanker, the driver came up. When I asked him, ""Where does the water come from?"" He replied, ""You don't need to know,"" with a ""go away"" gesture. After asking few more questions, he said he brought the water from Yamuna River. After completing the water supply, the driver drove off. In less than ten minutes, the next water tanker stopped near the mall. This driver didn't answer anything, neither.

46,GREEN,Ponca Tribe Leader Arrested At Standing Rock Explains Why The Fight Continues,"Kristina Puga, ContributorJournalist and Founding Editor of WiserWithAge.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ponca-tribe-leader-who-got-arrested-at-standing-rock_us_59262d5ce4b090bac9d46b76,"“We are one of the cancer capitals of the world...""",2017-05-25,<p><em>Casey Camp Horinek speaks inside of the United Nations COP21 Climate Negotiations during a WECAN International event</em> </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/592630dd1600002800ddcb63.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Casey Camp-Horinek has a gentle demeanor, with her long, salt and pepper-colored hair and lyrical voice. However, there is searing fire behind her caring, dark eyes.She was born into the Ponca Nation, a Native American tribe originally from the Nebraska/South Dakota area, and which is now scattered throughout the U.S. Camp-Horinek lives in north-central Oklahoma, where approximately 800 reside.In addition to being a mother, grandmother, and councilwoman of the Ponca Nation, Camp-Horinek – who turns 69 next month – is an activist for all of us.Camp-Horinek was one of the thousands peacefully protesting at against the Dakota Access Pipeline at Standing Rock, North Dakota, last year. And last month, she came to New York City accompanying other indigenous women leaders from across the U.S., and around the world, for the conference, ‘Indigenous Women Protecting Earth, Rights and Communities’, presented by the Women’s Earth and Climate Action Network (WECAN) to educate the public, as well as CEO’s and shareholders, about renewable energy, earth awareness, and indigenous issues.“Many of us believe in a seven generation philosophy,” explains the indigenous leader about why she does not give up fighting for justice. “We believe that our people, the past seven generations before, have prayed for us to live in a good way. It is our responsibility in the decisions that we make that we should care for seven generations to come.”Camp-Horinek hails from a large family. She’s been married 48 years and has four adult children and over a dozen grandchildren.“I feel very very fortunate that our family is very integrated in terms of being able to hang out with one another,” she says. “Our grandchildren visit us regularly. We travel, pray, eat and laugh together. Intergenerational life is part of indigenous life. What drives me to activism and environmentalism is a duty of a grandmother, woman, wife, and daughter to carry on the relationships of all living things and caring about what happens to the generations to come.”Going to Standing Rock, last summer and autumn, was part of that duty.“It was a horrible, racist, militarized situation,” says Camp-Horinek. “We had more than a thousand arrested, made into less than human feelings.”On October 27, 2016, she says 141 people, including herself, and her sons, were arrested while praying.“They wrote numbers with markers on our arms… I’m Standing Rock 138,” says Camp-Horinek, adding that she’s not washing off the ink until she goes to trial in July so she can show the judge. “They put us in these bear cages in a basement…[and] they had militarized tasers, mace and pepper spray in containers the size of fire extinguishers.”She says growing up on the reservation, she and her people have become used to living with racism, but now she feels they also have to deal with environmental racism.She describes a Taiwanese business that’s producing carbon, as well as Oklahoma gas lines, fracking, and earthquakes happening as a result of it, as “an environmental genocide” on her people.“We are one of the cancer capitals of the world – children and elders are dying of cancer,” says Camp-Horinek. “There is a long process that brought us to this. The way the federal government has failed its responsibility to the indigenous people.”Her grandfather was born in northern Nebraska, where the original Ponca people came from.“In Oklahoma, there are 39 recognized tribes,” says Camp-Horinek. “The other six are there from forced removal. We had no choice but to leave to ‘Indian territory’ – putting us in one general location – on reservations. My grandfather was eight at the time of the forced removal.”“In one generation, we had to leave our hunting, growing organic food and fishing,” she continues. “One in three of us died in our Trail of Tears, and we had to depend on the government commodity foods.”She says being forced to have white flour, white sugar, and dairy – all foods that were foreign to the bodies of her people, caused them to develop all sorts of ailments.“Now we have the highest diabetic rate on earth,” says Camp-Horinek.Read the rest of the story on WiserWithAge.com."

For many working in especially-targeted agencies, the magnitude of these cuts will have considerable implications. Here in Boston, EPA workers are rallying against the proposed cuts by gathering at the State House in a show of opposition. Essentially, the administration’s cuts decimate the EPA by 31 percent, eliminating almost 4,000 jobs from the agency itself. Efforts to keep clean our streams and waterways are being eliminated, and there are deep cuts to the monitoring of the safety of our tap water (even in communities like Flint, Mich.). Regional conservation efforts are being scrapped, along with funding for environmental disaster cleanup. Wasted food is one of the most significant drivers of climate change. Efforts to reduce and control it are being eliminated under this budget. If food waste were a country, it would be the third largest greenhouse gas emitter behind both the United States and China. 3.3 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide is the byproduct of the harvesting, production, packaging, and transporting of food that ends up rotting in landfills. The water wasted in those same processes is equivalent to the volume of Europe’s largest river. We currently grow and produce more than enough food to feed every single person on the planet, and that includes the estimated 9 billion world population in the next 30 years. As a food rescue in Massachusetts, Lovin’ Spoonfuls runs on the premise that hunger and food insecurity are not problems of supply, but rather of distribution. By summer’s end, we will have rescued and diverted 7 million pounds of food from landfills. Each week, the 50,000 pounds of food we recover reaches more than 35,000 hungry people in Massachusetts. The proposed cuts by the Trump administration not only pose a severe threat to the health of the planet, but threaten public health, too. Along with EPA cuts, over $4 billion is expected to be cut from HUD, where essential Community Block Grants live, and SNAP funding — on which 45 million Americans rely — by more than a quarter. The costs of defunding safety-net programs that feed, house and care for people only sets in motion a higher cost down the road. Keeping veterans and seniors in their homes with nutritious meal delivery offers dignity, respect and ultimately better health. In the world we live in, food is political. But on the ground, the immediate work that can be done is logistical. Tailoring solutions within the supply chain, looking at communities by their demographics, geography and current resources all become valuable factors and tools that we use to move food with intent and purpose, creating best practices for safe, reliable and consistent distribution of healthy nutrition.Wasting food is perhaps the most avoidable and solvable problem we’ll see in our lifetime. Reframing hunger and access as consequences of poor or nonexistent distribution rather than supply is our guiding principle. Our work is on the ground, accessible to the community at large each day. But we, like so many other social service providers are limited by policy, and the underlying priorities therein. When managed and stewarded properly, the arms of government that create policy are essential to the health and future of our planet. It is the responsibility of us all to call for the protection and preservation of these agencies. It is time to step up, and step in - to keep and defend these priorities, even when our leaders have abandoned them."

You make ignorant statements and foolish decisions. That is a quick summary of Donald Trump’s first overseas trip as United States President. In Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Tel Aviv, Israel, and Rome, Italy, foreign leaders are scratching their heads and asking two questions. “How did such an fool get to be President of the United States?” and “How can we use this idiot for our own advantage?”In Saudi Arabia, Trump posed for pictures, received a medal, and danced with medieval swordsmen. Then he agreed to sell United States military fighters to a government already committing genocide on one of its neighbors and financing militant, rightwing, Islamic orthodoxy around the world. By some estimates, Saudi Arabia has given $100 billion dollars to radical Islamic groups, the same groups Trump wants to stop. Trump may not remember but Osama Bin Laden and 15 of the World Trade Center terrorists were Saudi citizens. In his speech, Trump announced that these same Saudis would be the United States’ Sunni Muslim ally against Shia Iran. To hell with Saudi human rights abuses, its treatment of women, and its denial of citizenship rights to the children of guest workers born in the country. About one-third of the population of Saudi Arabia is officially considered guest workers. Freedom House, an American organization, ranks Trump’s friend Saudi Arabia among the 11 least free countries in the world today.Perhaps Donald Trump forgot that in the past he accused Saudi Arabia of masterminding 9/11, killing gays, and enslaving women. It is the same country that Trump wanted to ban from exporting oil to the United States. In an interview with CNBC, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who was part of the Trump Saudi entourage, was ecstatic over the group’s welcome in the Saudi Kingdom. He commented that he did not witness a single protester or placard. Apparently Ross was unaware that public demonstrations are illegal in Saudi Arabia.The Sunni-Shia division originated almost 1400 years ago. It started with a dispute over leadership of the Islamic religion after the death of Muhammad in 632. But the real conflict is a struggle for supremacy in the Islamic world, first between the Ottoman Turkish Empire and Persia, and now between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Contemporary battlefields include Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen, where the Saudis air force is bombing civilians, and Pakistan. The Taliban in Afghanistan are Sunni. So are Al Qaeda and ISIS. Hezbollah is Shia. Now Trump, with all his lack of knowledge, is drawing the United States deeper into this quagmire. Nothing positive will come of it.After leaving Saudi Arabia, Trump and his “posse” traveled to Israel where he threw himself and the United States into the middle of another intractable conflict. On landing in Israel, Trump announced he was seeking an historic peace deal between Israel and Palestinians living in Israeli occupied territories, but offered no plan for a solution. Trump then offended Arab groups by visiting occupied East Jerusalem and praying at a Jewish holy site wearing a yarmulke. Trump isn’t Jewish, so the act was just symbolic and infuriating.Trump told Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu that he wants his to work with Saudi Arabia to promote regional peace but never hinted at whether this would involve the end of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories and the formation of an independent Palestinian state. The problem, of course, is in the details. The Saudis are committed to an Arab Peace Initiative adopted by the 22 members Arab League in 2002. In exchange for peace between Arab states and Israel, Israel must withdrawal from occupied Palestinian territory back to borders established prior to the 1967 war. It must also agree to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip with East Jerusalem as its capital and to a “just” solution to the Palestinian refugee issue.Israel immediately dismissed this proposal and since 2002 has added new settlements in occupied Palestinian territories. Netanyahu has shown little inclination toward concessions and many members of his governing coalition call for a complete Israeli annexation of the entire West Bank. An additional problem is Palestinian division. A weak and discredited Palestinian Authority administers parts of the occupied West Bank, but Hamas, which the United States and Israel consider a terrorist organization, governs the Gaza Strip.While the mainstream press in the United States that Trump continually denounces was respectful of Trump’s diplomatic escapade, the Israeli press was much less generous. A headline in the Jerusalem Post declared “All Pomp And No Substance In Trump's Historic Israel Visit.” The article focused on how, in “all his public appearances, he managed to avoid using the term ‘two-state solution’,” and despite Trump’s “insistence that Israel and the Palestinians can reach his coveted ‘deal’,” he “clearly doesn’t have a plan of how to get there.” One opinion essay in Haaretz described the Trump visit as an “absurd series of empty gestures.” Another argued that Trump has “zero credibility among Palestinians, thanks to his aversion to the words ‘Palestinian state’ and ‘Israeli occupation’.”In Rome, Pope Francis welcomed the touring Trump entourage despite previous well-expressed disagreements. An initial photograph showed a smiling Trump but a stone-faced Pop. They then met in the pope’s private study for about half an hour with only an interpreter present. Trump called the meeting “great” and “fantastic.” A Vatican statement described the meeting as “cordial.” It expressed the Pope’s hope the Roman Catholic Church could collaborate with the Trump administration on “health care, education and assistance to immigrants,” which is as unlikely as Trump producing peace in the Middle East. The world can hardly wait to learn what “great” and “fantastic” ideas Trump shares with world leaders this week in Belgium at a dinner of representatives from NATO nations and in Sicily at the more selective summit meeting of the Group of 7 powers that include Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Stay tuned!Note: In a remark that may have been a faux pas, bad geography, or just plain dumb, Donald Trump told a meeting with of Israeli government officials that his entourage "" just got back from . . . the Middle East. We just got back from Saudi Arabia.” Many in the audience visibly grimace, especially because Arab nationalists denounced the founding of Israel in the Middle East as European occupation of Arab lands. If you don’t believe it, you can watch Trump on video, which I am sure many in the Middle East are doing.Follow Alan Singer on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ReecesPieces8 "
49,IMPACT,The White House Budget Would Increase Hunger Across America,"Kate Maehr, ContributorExecutive Director and CEO of the Greater Chicago Food Depository",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/white-house-budget-would-increase-hunger-across-america_us_59263641e4b0627b74360d41,"We need to find opportunities to strengthen, not dismantle, programs that help low-income families.",2017-05-25,<p>James and Stefanie Poggi with their son at the Hines VA food pantry in December.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5926d83b1600002b00ddcc35.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On a recent Thursday, U.S. Marine Lance Corporal James Poggi visited Edward Hines, Jr. VA Hospital on the western edge of Chicago with his wife Stefanie and their young son for one of his regular physical therapy sessions. James is learning to walk again after having his left foot surgically amputated – a necessary procedure to aid his recovery from an injury sustained during a 2010 tour of duty in Afghanistan. At the Hines VA, the Poggi family often stops by the weekly veterans food pantry to pick out fresh produce, chicken and other grocery staples. Like more than 40,302 veterans in Illinois, James Poggi lives below the poverty line. He is unable to work, and Stefanie is his primary caregiver. Fortunately, the family of four has food to eat and medical care thanks to a strong network of public programs and private charity. In addition to VA benefits and Social Security Disability Insurance, the Poggi family receives $372 per month in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits on their LINK card, which helps buy some, but not all, of the groceries needed for a family of four. The Hines VA food pantry, operated in partnership with the Greater Chicago Food Depository and AmeriCorps with volunteers from the Red Cross, helps fill the gap at the end of most months. The family also utilizes the federal Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) to help pay their gas and electric bills. Together, these lifelines keep James, Stefanie and their two children healthy, warm and fed as he focuses on recovery and physical therapy.On Tuesday, the White House released its FY 2018 budget proposal, which calls to reduce SNAP by more than $193 billion over 10 years while cutting $27 million from The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) next year. While we realize this is the first step in a lengthy budget process, these recommendations set a tone that things could get much worse for families at risk of hunger.The proposed cuts to SNAP would come largely from shifting a significant portion of benefit costs to the states. Considering the grim reality of Illinois’ budget, this is an unrealistic demand that would likely result in the state being forced to limit eligibility or reduce benefits for all SNAP recipients.The White House’s budget also suggests applying additional time limits and work requirements on able-bodied adults without dependents who receive SNAP benefits. While this is framed as an incentive for unemployed SNAP recipients to rejoin the workforce, our experience tells us that such rules would effectively take benefits away from struggling households with no regard for the availability of jobs in their community.The circumstances that brought James Poggi and his family to need food assistance are unique. But, they are not alone in their struggle to put food on the table. Each year, more than 812,000 of our neighbors turn to the Food Depository’s local network of 700 food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters and programs. More often than not, a person facing hunger in our community is either working, living with a disability, a child or a senior.The proposed cuts give anti-hunger advocates, including nonprofit food banks like the Greater Chicago Food Depository, grave concern about the future of SNAP – our nation’s frontline defense against hunger. Every day, SNAP protects our neighbors from the worst cases of hunger. It lifts millions of households out of poverty and, according to Moody’s Analytics, generates $1.22 in economic activity for every $1.00 in benefits. SNAP is effective, efficient and essential.The White House budget goes further, proposing to eliminate several vital programs, such as LIHEAP energy assistance, that keep millions of Americans like the Poggi family from going hungry by providing assistance for basic services. Without LIHEAP, more struggling households would be forced to choose between buying food and keeping their heat on in the winter.Another program targeted for elimination is the Corporation for National and Community Service, which includes AmeriCorps, VISTA, Senior Volunteer Corps and the Social Innovation Fund. In Illinois, more than 13,000 people are serving at nonprofits and strengthening their communities through these programs, including the AmeriCorps members who staff the weekly veterans food pantries at Hines VA and Jesse Brown VA Medical Center.At a time when 42 million Americans are at risk of hunger, a strong and coordinated public-private response is the only way to meet the need. Private charities, including the 200 food banks in the Feeding America national network, are striving to do more for our most vulnerable neighbors. We ask that our leaders in Washington, D.C. do the same, and find opportunities to strengthen, not dismantle, programs that help low-income families like James and Stefanie Poggi keep food on their tables."
50,POLITICS,House Democrats See 'Medicare For All' As The Answer To Trumpcare,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-conyers-single-payer-health-care-political-winner_us_5925a104e4b00c8df2a0da51,Rep. John Conyers' single-payer bill has never been this popular.,2017-05-24,Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) has been introducing a single-payer bill since 2003. It now has 111 co-sponsors -- a significant majority of the House Democratic Caucus.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5925a481200000290016ea4d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"House Democrats on Wednesday touted unprecedented majority support for a bill that would expand Medicare to the entire U.S. population, reflecting a growing liberal consensus behind single-payer health insurance. Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), who has been introducing single-payer legislation since 2003, said at a press conference that Democrats must counter the Republican bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act with support for “Medicare for all.” “Obviously we’re all united in opposition to Trumpcare. That’s easy,” he said. “People know what we’re against, but we want to promote more what we are for.”The press conference was scheduled to take place hours before the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released its assessment of the updated version of the Obamacare repeal bill that the House of Representatives passed earlier this month.Conyers was joined by Democratic Reps. Bonnie Watson Coleman (N.J.), Steve Cohen (Tenn.), Ro Khanna (Calif.), Jamie Raskin (Md.), Keith Ellison (Minn.) and Mark Pocan (Wis.), the newly elected co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.Like many progressives, Conyers has long said that the problems bedeviling the American health care system are rooted in its reliance on private insurance.“We will never get universal care built on a foundation of private, for-profit insurers,” he said. “The only way we will get there is the way every other advanced country on the planet has, through a universal system like expanded Medicare.”Critics like Conyers argue that Obamacare is flawed because of too little, not too much, government intervention. The reform law enlarged private insurance rolls by requiring anyone in the individual market above a certain income level to seek coverage in government-regulated private insurance exchanges ― and providing them subsidies to do so. Now the number of insurance options in these markets has begun to dwindle because for-profit companies find it too costly to cover new enrollees, who tend to be sicker than the general population.There are a number of ways that the federal government could entice insurers to stay in the exchanges, such as reimbursing them for their highest-cost cases and improving how they enforce the individual insurance mandate. But if private insurers were not part of the equation, these triage measures would be unnecessary.Progressive single-payer advocates say that these challenges, along with the unprecedented political threat to Obamacare from President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans, have created the right political moment to push their ideal into the party’s mainstream. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who turned “Medicare for all” into a progressive rallying cry with his insurgent presidential campaign, plans to introduce companion legislation to Conyers’ bill in the Senate this summer. His single-payer bills have not attracted any co-sponsors in the past. The growing level of support for Conyers’ bill suggests this time might be different. The legislation, known as the Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act, has 111 co-sponsors ― including Dels. Eleanor Holmes Norton of D.C. and Gregorio Sablan of the Northern Mariana Islands, who can’t vote on legislation on the House floor. Still, it is a solid majority of the 193-member House Democratic Caucus and the most support such legislation has ever received. The bill has even attracted support from some fiscally conservative members like Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.).The previous high-water mark for Conyers’ bill was in 2008, when 93 of his colleagues got behind it. The Democratic caucus was much larger at the time, however, so the bill’s supporters constituted a smaller proportion. Last Congress, the bill attracted just 63 co-sponsors.House Assistant Minority Leader James Clyburn (D-S.C.) and Democratic Caucus Chair Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.), both members of leadership, have co-sponsored the bill.Yet single-payer legislation would undoubtedly face a steep climb, even if Democrats took back the House in 2018. Currently, Medicare requires co-payments from seniors and people with disabilities above a certain income level.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said earlier this month that “the comfort level with a broader base of the American people is not there yet,” and encouraged activists to try to enact single-payer plans at the state level first.In addition to extending Medicare coverage to the whole population, Conyers’ bill would improve on Medicare’s coverage levels by having the government pick up the entire tab for everything from preventive care visits to dental care.To pay for this expansion, the law would increase personal income taxes by 5 percent for higher earners, institute a new tax on worker payroll, and levy new taxes on investment income and financial transactions. But Conyers’ bill is also deliberately vague on some of the details. Aside from the income tax hike, the legislation does not specify the levels of all the new taxes, or the earnings thresholds where they would take effect. But a 2013 analysis of the bill by Gerald Friedman, an economist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, assumed that the new high-income surtax would increase taxes on households earning $225,000 or more by 6 percent, and the payroll tax would levy new 3 percent or 6 percent taxes on employers of all workers.Ultimately, the taxes on workers and employers would be a net financial win for the country, saving Americans nearly $600 billion a year in lower health care costs, according to Friedman.But when the reality of those upfront tax increases sets in for members of Congress, it could be a tough sell.What’s more, several efforts to wring savings from private health care providers during the crafting of Obamacare collapsed as Democrats succumbed to industry pressure en masse. Since Conyers’ bill envisions that the government will use its bargaining power to bring costs into line with those of other countries, it could face similar resistance from providers.State-level experiments with single-payer health insurance face similar if not greater challenges due to the size of their risk pool. Vermont tried to adopt a single-payer health insurance plan in lieu of Obamacare, but gave up when the costs of transitioning to the the new system proved too great. Some progressive groups, including the National Nurses United, are now throwing their weight behind a serious effort to create a single-payer health insurance system in California. The plan could cost as much as $400 billion a year, according to a legislative analysis released Monday and conducted at the request of state lawmakers promoting the policy. Half of that amount would have to be raised through new taxes.Challenges notwithstanding, progressive activists and Democratic lawmakers are tired of asking for less than what they really want and encountering unified Republican opposition anyway. Even if it stands no chance of approval in the short-term, they say that a push to expand the popular Medicare program is a political winner that can help Democrats take back Congress. At Wednesday’s press conference, Pocan observed that town hall discussions about implementing “Medicare for all” draw a more enthusiastic response than any other issue. He said the issue was widely praised at a town hall he recently held in in Kenosha, Wisconsin, which is in Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan’s district.Indeed, 60 percent of Americans favor extending Medicare to the entire population, according to an Economist/YouGov poll from April.Ellison, who is deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee, emphasized that no one in the DNC would tell lawmakers and candidates what position to take on a given issue ― but the power of suggestion is fair game.“I recommend that you win your election, and I think a good way to do it is to support the Conyers bill,” he said."

Among the several gifts Francis gave Trump, the pope tucked in a copy of his 2015 encyclical on the environment, “Laudato Si.” The encyclical is a fiery and urgent call to action on climate change ― an issue that Trump and members of his administration have denied in the past.After receiving the encyclical, along with another document written by the pope that promotes peace and nonviolence, Trump told the pope: “Well, I’ll be reading them.” If the president does in fact follow through with that promise, Trump will find several points of contention. In the 184-page “Laudato Si,” Francis makes the case that climate change is inherently a moral and spiritual issue that disproportionately affects the poor and the marginalized. The encyclical outlines Francis’ belief that the environmental crisis facing the world today is caused by human activity, and that the world’s leaders must act swiftly to confront what he calls a “global problem with grave implications.” “Humanity is called to recognize the need for changes of lifestyle, production and consumption, in order to combat this warming or at least the human causes which produce or aggravate it,” Francis wrote in the encyclical. Francis also criticized local and national governments that refuse to address climate change in the long-term, focusing instead on short-term political gains.“In response to electoral interests, governments are reluctant to upset the public with measures which could affect the level of consumption or create risks for foreign investment,” Francis wrote. “The myopia of power politics delays the inclusion of a far-sighted environmental agenda within the overall agenda of governments.” Since taking office, Trump has moved quickly to derail America’s actions to combat climate change, including rolling back Obama’s Clean Power Plan, a policy limiting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. Catering to fossil fuel interests, Trump has promised to revive America’s dying coal industry, increase oil and gas production, and open up now-protected areas of the Arctic and Atlantic oceans to drilling. And he has proposed sweeping cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency and other scientific agencies. A longtime climate change skeptic who has dismissed the phenomenon as “bullshit” and a Chinese “hoax,” Trump also vowed on the campaign trail to pull the U.S. out of the historic Paris Agreement on climate change. In signing the accord, nearly 200 countries committed to slashing carbon emissions in an effort to prevent global temperatures from spiraling to the 2 degrees Celsius mark. A final decision is expected after the conclusion of a G-7 summit in Italy later this month, although White House sources told HuffPost earlier this month that Trump is leaning toward an exit. The Vatican Secretary of State, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, raised the issue of climate change during Trump’s meeting with the pope on Wednesday and encouraged the president to remain in the Paris agreement. The United States’ Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, told reporters that Trump “hasn’t made a final decision” on the agreement and likely will not until “after we get home.”New York senator Chuck Schumer suggested Wednesday that if Trump does follow through on the pope’s homework, the president may change his mind on climate change. “If President Trump reads the pope’s writings, I’m confident he’ll not withdraw from the [Paris climate change] agreement,” Schumer told reporters. “We gotta get him to read it.”"

Blake Farenthold's evidence? ""Stuff circulating around on the internet.""",2017-05-24,"In this file photo from 2011, Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas) speaks during a press conference.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5925a86c1600002200ddc99e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas) furthered a right-wing conspiracy theory on Wednesday when he said the July 2016 hacking of Democratic National Committee emails may have been “an insider job.”WikiLeaks released tens of thousands of internal DNC emails last summer, just weeks after committee staffer Seth Rich was fatally shot while walking to his Washington, D.C., home. The timing fueled the conspiracy theory that Rich had given the DNC documents to WikiLeaks, and that the DNC, Democratic Party and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton may have had him killed as retribution.There is no evidence to support those claims, but Farenthold alluded to them on CNN anyway.“There’s still some question as to whether the intrusion at the DNC server was an insider job, or whether or not it was the Russians,” he said in response to a question about Russian hacking during the 2016 election.“There’s stuff circulating on the internet,” he said when CNN’s hosts pressed him for evidence. “Yet the D.C. police nor no federal investigator has had a look at the DNC computer. ... To me, we need to let the feds look at it.” Until last week, “stuff circulating on the internet” about the DNC murder conspiracy was largely relegated to niche far-right websites and online forums like Reddit and 4Chan. Then Fox News and its D.C-based affiliate published separate, thinly sourced stories that tried to link Rich to WikiLeaks. The stories sparked headlines across the right-wing web, and earned ample real estate on Fox News: Sean Hannity, “Fox and Friends” and Fox News contributors like Newt Gingrich have repeatedly pushed them. The stories, however, were always suspect ― the only named source was Rod Wheeler, a Fox News contributor who relied on secondhand information and has a history of pushing baseless conspiracies on air ― and they quickly fell apart.Wheeler, a private investigator, has recanted his initial claims. The D.C. police, the FBI and Rich’s family all dismissed the links between the former DNC staffer and WikiLeaks. U.S. intelligence officials, meanwhile, said in January that the leaks were a result of a Russian hacking operation; police have said Rich was likely killed during a botched robbery attempt. Fox 5, the D.C. station, published a new story last week, acknowledging that Wheeler had backtracked. Fox News issued a retraction and pulled the story from its website on Tuesday afternoon, but Hannity continued to peddle the conspiracy on Fox News radio.Rich’s parents published an editorial in The Washington Post on Tuesday, begging people to stop pushing the “unspeakably cruel” conspiracy theories to further “their own political goals.”"

Instead, it should have collected a percent of the smaller, post-tax “net” fare.Uber said it realized the error last Friday, after it revamped how it shows drivers their earnings and discovered their commissions violated the terms of service.The company told HuffPost it would refund drivers’ backpay they’re due, plus 9 percent interest. The average driver should receive around $900.“We are committed to paying every driver every penny they are owed - plus interest - as quickly as possible,” said Rachel Holt, Regional General Manager, US & Canada, in an emailed statement. “We are working hard to regain driver trust, and that means being transparent, sticking to our word, and making the Uber experience better from end to end.”But New York’s Independent Drivers Guild said the news is just one more sign of an industry in need of regulation.“Uber’s theft of drivers’ hard-earned wages is the latest in a long history of underhanded tactics in this industry,” IDG founder Jim Conigliaro Jr. told HuffPost in an emailed statement. “Year after year, companies like Uber, Lyft, Juno and Gett become more valuable and year after year they find new ways to take advantage of hard-working drivers,” he added. “This is exactly why we have been calling for industry-wide pay protections to stop the exploitation of New York’s drivers once and for all.” It’s unclear if Uber drivers in other cities have been subject to similar miscalculations. The company said it is reviewing that possibility but has yet to find another instance. While Uber calculates its take based on drivers’ “net” fares, ride-hailing competitor Lyft told HuffPost its commissions still are based on its drivers’ gross fares, as its agreement specifies.“In New York, we deduct commissions and administrative fees from gross fares, as per our driver agreement,” a Lyft spokesman said in an emailed statement. “We also pay sales tax on gross fares as required by law.” "

Park boundaries are sometimes,2017-05-24,Reindeer herders are seen near Numto Lake in western Siberia. Russia’s recent decision to redraw park boundaries to allow oil development in the area has prompted protests from Indigenous people.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5925e14c1600002100ddca9b.jpeg?cache=GCw53b9fJv&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Russia’s northern Indigenous people have reason to view their national parks system with suspicion. Park boundaries are sometimes rolled back to make way for resource development, while protected areas often pose an impediment to traditional hunting and fishing activities.Russia’s Numto nature reserve in western Siberia contains a sacred lake, endangered cranes and valuable wetlands for the Nenet and Khanty peoples. The area was also the site of an Indigenous rebellion against the Soviet state during the 1930s, in protest at forced collectivization and the persecution of traditional leaders. Last year, the nature reserve’s borders were redrawn by the regional government to make way for new drilling operations for the oil company Surgutneftegas, forcing out Indigenous groups once again. In protest, reindeer herders recently built a traditional tent in the heart of Moscow.That may help explain why Russia’s Indigenous people don’t always welcome new parks and protected areas. Critics contend that these designations offer no guarantees there won’t be future industrial activity, and they also sometimes prevent Indigenous people from hunting or fishing in the area.So as Russia declares 2017 the Year of Ecology and Protected Areas, Indigenous groups have reason to be wary. Natural resources minister Sergei Donskoi recently projected a 22 percent increase of protected areas, particularly national parks, by 2025. Franz Josef Land was recently folded into Russkaya Arktika National Park to become Russia’s largest protected area, covering an archipelago roughly the size of Ireland. Borders for new parks will be drawn in the Barents region of Karelia and another around the 350-year-old pines and tundra of Murmansk. A federal reserve will also protect parts of the New Siberian Islands, known as the land of the mammoths for its abundance of unearthed tusks, among others in more southern regions.Many of these lands support wild medicines, reindeer and timber used by roughly 250,000 Indigenous people who form 41 recognized groups. In response to future park plans, the Russian nongovernmental organization Center for Support of Indigenous Peoples of the North will soon host Indigenous leaders from Siberia to the Far East for a strategy workshop titled, “National Parks and Indigenous Peoples: Risks and Opportunities.” The organization’s director, Rodion Sulyandziga, notes that this will be the first time such a broad range of Indigenous groups will gather to discuss national parks, and plans are underway for an even larger event, which will include politicians, in September.One concern is that Russia’s new focus on national parks also involves a move away from a designation intended to allow Indigenous people to continue their hunting and fishing traditions. A framework for these territories, known as Traditional Nature Use of Indigenous Minority Peoples of the North, was laid out 16 years ago, but it hasn’t been implemented in practice. That leaves Indigenous groups with few channels to assert their rights in the current political climate, say critics.“We have to compromise with government because as Indigenous peoples, we are like between two rocks,” said Sulyandziga. “The first one is industrial development and extractive industry, followed by land grabbing and pollution. On the other hand it’s conservation policy, which also in many cases is coming into conflict with Indigenous people in terms of traditional lifestyle and activities.”Protected areas are speckled across Russia and total roughly 12 percent of the country, with different designations offering varying degrees of protection. All may pose some problems for Russia’s Indigenous groups.Zapovedniks, or “strict nature reserves,” provide a high degree of ecological protection and generally restrict human use and access. Traditional activities like hunting and fishing generally require a special permit. National parks ban mining and oil-and-gas extraction but encourage recreation and tourism. Meanwhile, territories of traditional nature use have yet to be implemented at the federal level and those at the state level tend to be ignored, according to the International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs, or IWGIA. The group also reports that the word “conservation” was removed from the definition of these territories in 2013, further undermining their status.For all of these designations, the Russian government has been known to unilaterally change rules and rewrite boundaries. According to Greenpeace and IWGIA, the state reduced the size of Indigenous land by roughly half in the far eastern territory of Khabarovsk to encourage migration. Also last year, WWF Russia raised the alarm when the state downgraded the already-strained status of Zapovedniks, the strict nature reserves, by permitting ski resorts and hotels in these areas.Some critics have nicknamed Zapovedniks “paper parks” for their failure to adequately protect the environment due to budget cuts and lack of enforcement for illegal harvesting of timber and wildlife. On top of all this, many Indigenous and environmental NGOs have been declared foreign agents by the Russian state, creating legal difficulties for these groups.Meanwhile, as Russia promotes new tourism operations on the Franz Josef Land and Novaya Zemlya archipelagos, pressure mounts on these delicate Arctic ecosystems. Johannes Rohr, a consultant for IWGIA, notes that in the volcanic islands of Kamchatka of the northeast, home to Steller’s sea eagles, snow sheep and hot springs, tourist operators have hired Indigenous dance groups to perform while Indigenous access to the national park is restricted.“It’s not to say this is a deliberate policy by the state of disenfranchising and expropriating the Indigenous groups,” he said. “It’s more like as soon as local business and administrations sense there is money to be made this will almost always go to the disadvantage of the Indigenous population.” He takes a rather pessimistic view of Russia’s park-focused year of environment, highlighting what he sees as a steady erosion of Indigenous rights since 2001. “If [the Russian government] would enshrine protection into conservation areas, we could go against at the grain. It could be an opportunity. But my hopes for breakthroughs are kind of limited.”For his part, Sulyandziga remains hopeful. It took three years of intense negotiation with all levels of government, but the creation in 2016 of a national park in the Bikin river basin, known as the Russian Amazon in the far southeast of the country, marked a first for Indigenous co-management of a protected area. The Udege are directly involved in overseeing the park with permanent members on an advisory board. They were also able to fight to reserve 8,000 square kilometers (3,089 square miles) of the territory for Indigenous use.Sulyandziga sees this as a new model for Russian parks, and hopes the upcoming workshops can prepare other Indigenous groups to negotiate similar arrangements. Even Rohr, while hardly optimistic, describes Bikin National Park as the only one with “some chance of it becoming not a total disaster.”The trouble lies in how Russia’s national parks and reserves are about nature, not people, said Sulyandziga. “In principle, we cannot look at national parks and protected areas as a solution for Indigenous peoples, because we need our own self-governance.”This article originally appeared on Arctic Deeply.

It will always be brighter than you could ever dream ― so trust her.” Published on Tuesday, the essay is a heartwarming message about the trials and tribulations so many teen girls face: fights with parents, high school crushes, learning to love your body and figuring out how to be comfortable and happy in your own skin. “Love your stretch marks, Danie. They are the roadmap of your strength,” Brooks wrote for number 5 on the 11-point list. Number six? Don’t cry too much when you’re not asked out to prom. “One day that boy you had a crush on, you’ll run into him at the grocery store and discover he has three baby mamas and works at Verizon. Not even as a manager,” Brooks wrote. “And the other dude, you’ll realize he doesn’t even have enough courage to pursue his dreams. How would he ever be able to handle yours? Again, be patient. One day you will bring all the boys to the yard. They will be sliding in those DMs, girl. That phrase will make more sense in 2017.”The OITNB actress is no stranger to preaching self-love and body acceptance. Brooks modeled for Lane Bryant for the clothing company’s body positive campaign #ThisBody in 2016. The actress is also a spokesperson for R29’s The 67% Project, a multimedia initiative promoting body positivity and plus-size visibility that launched in September. In her R29 essay, Brooks reminded her teenage self that no matter what happens in life, she always needs to “operate out of love.” “You are not an ordinary 15 year old, and that is okay. That doesn’t make you better or less than anyone. But what you must not do is dim your light,” she wrote. “You have a lot of love to give and believe it or not, it is not as easily accessible for others to give the same. People have a lot of hang ups that will make them guarded, but continue to operate out of love. It will always win.”Head over to Refinery29 to read Brooks’ full essay. "

Terry McAuliffe (D) pardoned an undocumented mother of two on Wednesday for a years-old conviction for driving without a license in the hope that it will help spare her from deportation. But the fact that she is no longer defined as a criminal might not matter to the Trump administration. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained Liliana Cruz Mendez, the 30-year-old originally from El Salvador, last Thursday when she went to the agency for a routine check-in. ICE had repeatedly allowed her to remain in the U.S. in spite of a 2006 removal order for crossing the border illegally and a 2013 misdemeanor conviction for driving without a license, which she could not obtain because of her status.Her case now becomes another test for President Donald Trump, who claims his focus is on criminals but has detained scores of non-criminals as well. Cruz Mendez can’t be defined as a criminal anymore ― the question is whether ICE cares. The agency indicated after McAuliffe’s pardon announcement that nothing has changed.“ICE took Ms. Cruz Mendez into custody based on a final order of removal issued by an immigration judge in April 2006,” agency spokeswoman Carissa Cutrell said in an email. “Even without any criminal convictions, she is still subject to removal from the United States based on that final order of removal.”Cruz Mendez’s supporters, from advocates to politicians, have not claimed she is not subject to removal. Instead, they argue she has contributed greatly to her community and should be allowed to remain in the U.S. with her husband and children. “Taking Liliana away from her kids & husband won’t make VA safer,” McAuliffe tweeted after announcing his pardon. “Feds need to focus on public safety threats & real immigration reform.” Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.), who has advocated for Cruz Mendez’s relief, said afterward that he was “very pleased but still cautious” because the pardon doesn’t change the deportation order, even if it takes away her conviction. “The Trump administration and ICE seem determined to deport anyone who comes across their path who is in the country without papers,” Beyer told HuffPost. “So the simple fact that she’s undocumented in the Trump mind makes her a criminal.” Cruz Mendez is seeking a stay of removal, which would allow her to remain in the country. Nick Katz of the advocacy group CASA, which is working on her case, said they are hopeful the pardon will help her receive that stay. “It really weakens the foundation of ICE’s argument for why they were saying that she needs to be removed from the United States, and we hope this will weigh strongly in their consideration,” Katz said. He said they plan to push governors to issue pardons in similar situations for immigration-related crimes in an effort to keep people out of deportation proceedings. For now, Cruz remains in detention. Beyer said he hopes Trump can consider what deporting her would do to her children, noting that the president said he was moved by images of violence against children in Syria. “Maybe he could be moved by the idea of a mother being separated from her children by thousands of miles for no credible reason,” he said. “Nobody’s life is going to be helped by this, although many will be hurt.” "

It’s stunning,” said Mats Andersson, vice chairman of the Stockholm-based foundation, in a telephone interview with the Thomson Reuters Foundation.The survey, released in advance of this week’s G7 summit of advanced economies in Italy, also found that 85 percent of people think the United Nations needs reforms to be better equipped to address global threats.About 70 percent of those surveyed said they think it may be time to create a new global organization – with power to enforce its decisions – specifically designed to deal with a wide range of global risks. Nearly 60 percent said they would be prepared to have their country give up some level of sovereignty to make that happen.“Whether it’s the specter of nuclear conflict over North Korea or the planet tipping into catastrophic climate change, the need for effective global cooperation has never been greater,” Andersson said.The Global Challenges Foundation, created in 2012 by a Swedish risk specialist and philanthropist, looks for more effective solutions to cross-border problems and ways to resolve the mismatch between long-term problems and short-term political and market focuses.TRUMP NOT LISTENING?Following the G7 meeting, U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to make a decision about whether to pull the United States out of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, aimed at keeping global temperature increases to relatively safe levels.But the Global Challenges Foundation found that 84 percent of the Americans it surveyed would be prepared to make changes in their current living standards if it would prevent future climatecatastrophes, such as irreversible melting of Arctic and Greenland ice, with accompanying large-scale sea level rise.Nearly two in three Americans also agreed with the statement that “a single individual can negatively impact global cooperation on risks”. Respondents in other parts of the world – apart from South Africa – were less likely to agree.That environmental issues and climate change now rank near the top of global worries about catastrophic threats for many people suggests “something has shifted in the past couple of years”, Andersson said. “I really hope that political leaders will realize the mandate they seem to have to act.”The report looked at a wide range of potential global catastrophes, from use of nuclear weapons to ecological collapse, asteroid impacts and the potential attempts to manipulate the world’s atmosphere and biological systems to deal with runaway climate change, in a process known as geoengineering.Geoengineering is dangerous, the report noted, because “its deployment could have dramatic impacts on climate stability”, because one country or individual could unilaterally attempt it, and because “there are currently no governance frameworks to manage the risks”.

A message reading “Planet Earth first,” a play on Trump’s “America first” foreign policy slogan, was shown on the iconic basilica.“Climate change is the ultimate threat of our generation, and real world leaders are taking action now to safeguard our people,” Jennifer Morgan, Greenpeace International’s executive director, said in a statement. “Ahead of his meeting with the Pope, we delivered to Trump a message that his first priority must be to people and planet, not the profits of polluters. Trump cannot stop the clean energy transition and should instead focus on accelerating it.”Trump is expected to meet with Pope Francis inside the Vatican on Wednesday as part of his first foreign trip as president. The pope has long called for international action on climate change, saying the phenomenon is “a global problem with grave implications” and one of the “principal challenges facing humanity.” He has urged world leaders to remain in the Paris climate deal, even as Trump has threatened to leave the agreement.The White House has done little to assuage the fears of environmentalists since Trump took office. In the administration’s first 100 days, officials proposed slashing the Environmental Protection Agency’s budget, scrapped clean air and water regulations and moved to weaken many Obama-era climate regulations.International leaders and even officials within Trump’s Cabinet have urged the president to remain in the Paris Accord. Even Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the former chairman of Exxon Mobil, has advised the president to remain in the deal, according to reports from The New York Times.It’s still unclear what Trump will decide, and meetings have been continually postponed in recent months. However, some have remained optimistic that the president will remain in the pact as the rest of the world moves forward on the issue.“If Trump decides to abandon the Paris deal, he will not only harm the planet but also his own country,” Andree Boehling, an energy expert at Greenpeace Germany, said in a statement. “It would be ecologically and economically foolish to try and slow down the clean energy transition. People across the world are demanding action and it’s time to deliver.”"
63,POLITICS,AARP Health Care Ads To Target Key Republican Senators,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/aarp-health-care-ads-key-republican-senators_us_5925cc9ee4b00c8df2a13981,The seniors group is spending over $1 million.,2017-05-24,"In a new AARP ad aimed at sinking the Republican Obamacare repeal bill, an accountant explains to an older couple how the bill would cost them.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5925e4f81600002100ddcaad.png?cache=5aU8TplmV6&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"AARP, the nation’s largest seniors group, is launching a seven-figure television advertisement buy asking Republican senators in key states to vote against the Obamacare repeal legislation the House of Representatives passed earlier this month.The ads are due to begin this week in the home states of Sens. Jeff Flake (Ariz.), Cory Gardner (Colo.), Dean Heller (Nev.), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Dan Sullivan (Alaska). AARP plans to spend at least six figures on the ads in each of the four states where they air.The senators AARP is targeting are all either moderate, or ― in the cases of Flake and Heller ― up for re-election in 2018. “Older Americans are very worried about the cost of their health insurance,” AARP executive vice president Nancy LeaMond said in a statement announcing the ad buy. “AARP is taking a strong stand against the American Health Care Act for one simple reason: it is a bad bill.” AARP, which represents 38 million Americans age 50 or older, is “urging Senators to scrap the AHCA and start over,” LeaMond added.AARP’s 30-second ad focuses on two of the House bill’s most controversial features: a waiver allowing states to opt out of federal regulations protecting people with pre-existing conditions, and an increase in the age rating that would allow people over 50 to be charged five times more than younger individuals. AARP has dubbed the latter provision an “age tax.” Obamacare, by contrast, allowed insurers to charge people over 50 a maximum of three times more than younger people.In the ad, an older couple named the Hutchinses learns how much these aspects of the law will cost them during a visit with their accountant at an office not too subtly named Ryan and Associates Financial & Tax Services.Mr. Hutchins has asthma, which the accountant tells him is a pre-existing condition. “Insurers can charge thousands more for that,” the accountant says. “This is going to be a big bill.”The ad concludes with a narrator telling viewers to call one of the five senators and tell them to vote “no on the health care bill.”Along with the advertising campaign, AARP is also asking its members to call their senators to voice their opposition to the House bill.AARP played an important role in making the Republican health care bill that passed the House politically radioactive. It launched internet ads featuring a talking squirrel that denounced the bill’s provision permitting insurers to charge older Americans more.The campaign AARP announced Wednesday, however, is the organization’s first foray into paid television advertising over the Obamacare replacement bill, suggesting the influential group is increasingly worried that the legislation has a chance of passing into law.Hours after AARP announced the ad campaign, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released an updated estimate of the Republican bill’s impact on health insurance coverage. The bill would result in 23 million fewer Americans having insurance, according to CBO.Like most political advertisements, AARP’s video elides some policy nuances. The House health care bill partially offsets the 5-to-1 age rating with tax credits to buy insurance on the exchanges; those credits increase as customers age. But AARP has argued the credits are inadequate to defray the potential cost increase for older Americans, since the credits max out at twice as large as those younger individuals receive.In addition, the law would allow states to opt out of Obamacare’s community rating regulations that obligate insurers to set premiums based on regional costs, rather than charge exorbitant amounts for pre-existing conditions. House Republicans tried to address these concerns by requiring states that waive these rules to set up high-risk pools to cover people with pre-existing conditions at rates they can afford. But conservative and liberal experts alike believe the funding in the bill is far too low to accommodate the cost of covering those people.There are some early signs that AARP could get its wish that the Senate start from scratch. Almost immediately after the House passed its version of the law earlier this month, several Republican senators declared their intention to craft an entirely different law."

Each day, instead of receiving news from police about a break in their son’s unsolved slaying, they are bombarded with phone calls from reporters asking about the “lies or conspiracies” being spread about him, they wrote.“That nightmare is what our family goes through every day.” Seth Rich was gunned down near his home in the Washington neighborhood of Bloomingdale in July 2016 in what police believe was a botched robbery. “We have seen no evidence, by any person at any time, that Seth’s murder had any connection to his job at the Democratic National Committee or his life in politics,” Rich’s parents wrote. “Anyone who claims to have such evidence is either concealing it from us or lying.”“Still,” Mary and Joel added, “conservative news outlets and commentators continue, day after painful day, to peddle discredited conspiracy theories that Seth was killed after having provided WikiLeaks with emails from the DNC. Those theories, which some reporters have since retracted, are baseless, and they are unspeakably cruel.”Even after Fox News retracted and removed its story Tuesday, network host Sean Hannity continued to push the conspiracy theory about Rich. On his radio show Tuesday, Hannity blasted his critics as “phony hypocrites” for continuing to report on probes into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.“And all you in the liberal media, I am not Fox.com or Fox News.com,” he said. “I retracted nothing.”Unsubstantiated theories about Rich’s death have been embraced by users on conspiracy websites and among right-wing commentators, with some going as as far as to suggest that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton played a part in his murder.Mary and Joel Rich wrote Tuesday that their son’s murder has been “turned into a political football.”“Every day we wake up to new headlines, new lies, new factual errors, new people approaching us to take advantage of us and Seth’s legacy,” they said. “It just won’t stop. The amount of pain and anguish this has caused us is unbearable. With every conspiratorial flare-up, we are forced to relive Seth’s murder and a small piece of us dies as more of Seth’s memory is torn away from us.”Read the full Washington Post op-ed here. "

In a Long Island, New York district that Trump won by 23 percent, Democrat Christine Pellegrino defeated Republican Thomas Gargiulo in the race for a seat in the New York State Assembly. Pellegrino served as a delegate for Bernie Sanders at the Democratic National Convention last year, the local Patch reported.The seat Pellegrino won on Tuesday had been held by Republican Joseph Saladino, who resigned earlier this year after being appointed to a local office. He had defeated his Democratic opponent in 2016 by 37 points. Prior to 2016, however, that same district voted twice for President Barack Obama, per Ballotpedia. Democrats are also celebrating an upset in a New Hampshire district that Trump won by 7 points in November. Democrat Edith DesMarais defeated Republican Matthew Plache in a special election for a seat in the state’s GOP-controlled House of Representatives, WMUR reported. That seat had been held by Republican Harold Parker, who resigned to join the administration of Republican Gov. Chris Sununu. While neither election will change the balance of power, Democrats are hoping the victories may signal a change in the political leanings of the country.According to The Hill, in the past eight years, Republicans have gained control of 27 state legislative chambers that were once held by Democrats. Following the 2016 general election, the GOP controlled 56 percent of the nation’s state legislative seats. The stakes will be even higher in two upcoming special elections for the U.S. House of Representatives. Democrat Rob Quist is hoping for an upset win over Republican Greg Gianforte in a race for Montana’s sole house seat later this week, while in Georgia, Republican Karen Handel aims to keep her district red in a race against Democrat Jon Ossoff next month.

Trump asked Surgeon General Vivek Murthy to resign in late April. He still has an acting director running the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Although he backtracked on his reported plan to essentially gut his Office of National Drug Control Policy, staffers would be wise to polish their resumes. Trump’s new budget proposal cuts all federal drug prevention programs by roughly 11 percent. The former director of the CDC, Dr. Tom Frieden, vented on Twitter that the 1.2 billion cut to his former agency would thwart efforts at preventing the complications that come with heroin use such as HIV infections.These moves follow Trump’s recent endorsement of the House’s health care bill that would no longer require insurance companies to cover treatment for addiction. If signed into law in its current form, more than a million Americans could potentially lose their access to treatment services. That bill cuts Medicaid by $880 billion. And Trump’s proposed budget goes even further, with another $616 billion cut to Medicaid over 10 years that would effectively cripple the government’s ability to fund and expand care.Drug policy advocates have been angered and baffled by these proposals. They expected Trump to show more commitment to combating the opioid crisis after claiming to be so moved by heartbreaking stories from grieving families on the campaign trail. “The two major challenges to the administration’s response to the opioid epidemic is one ― they’ve been slow to develop a strategy and the second thing is they are supporting legislation that would totally undercut people who are addicted,” explained Joshua Sharfstein, associate dean at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “That’s probably number one. You need a strategy and you need to help people get care.”Sharfstein isn’t the only one confused as to what the actual strategy is behind Trump’s approach to the opioid crisis. Some of the reforms Trump has pursued have been duplicative. In late March, for instance, Trump created a commission to study the opioid epidemic ― work that will surely replicate Surgeon General Murthy’s own report published late last year, and the ongoing mission of the ONDCP, also known colloquially as the drug czar’s office.Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Trump wanted to downsize the drug czar’s office by 95 percent. Trump has since backed away from these proposed cuts. But the move, which would have resulted in the loss of 33 staffers, sparked heavy criticism from experts in the field. In an email to his staff, acting drug czar Richard Baum called the move “frankly heartbreaking.” Advocates have also found Trump and his administration’s approach antiquated and misinformed. At a recent stop in Charleston, West Virginia, as part of his “listening tour” on the opioid crisis, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price endorsed faith-based treatment programs over medication-assisted treatment.“If we’re just substituting one opioid for another, we’re not moving the dial much,” he said. “Folks need to be cured so they can be productive members of society and realize their dreams.” The comments were in conflict with established scientific research that has shown that along with counseling, using synthetic or semi-synthetic opioids like methadone or buprenorphine (commonly sold as Suboxone) gives addicts the best chance at recovery. The medications have also been shown to dramatically reduce overdose deaths.Murthy, by then removed from his Surgeon General post, tweeted that “Science, not opinion, should guide our recommendations and policies.”Sen. Edward Markey (D-Mass.), in a statement to HuffPost, had a similar reaction. “The science is clear and the results are compelling. As we face a national opioid crisis, we need to use all the tools we have to help people achieve recovery, not reignite deep-held unscientific biases and stigma surrounding the treatment of opioid use disorders,” he said.Price also found himself at odds with his own agency’s experts. Under Obama, HHS spent millions in grants to expand opioid addiction medication in hard hit areas. It also revised federal regulations so that doctors can treat more patients with buprenorphine. But beyond those differences, Price’s comments illustrate a larger flaw in the Trump administration’s approach to the opioid crisis. As Daniel Raymond, deputy director of planning and policy for the Harm Reduction Coalition, noted, when you get rid of the experts, “you are going to end up with various agency heads freelancing.”A robust drug czar’s office would have helped keep Price in check. Under Obama, the office moved the country towards a more humane approach to addiction. Drugs such as heroin were treated as a public health problem more so than a law enforcement one. “The ONDCP at its best is a science and evidence based office that helps to move the right type of policy across the federal government,” said Regina LaBelle, the former chief of staff for both of Obama’s drug czars. “Every other agency has lots of other missions. The ONDCP’s sole mission is to deal with drug control issues.”Drug czars haven’t always been successful either in policing politicians or implementing a broad policy using the best evidence-based practices across the federal government. The office has a complicated history. Some czars have used it as a bully pulpit to support the more draconian aspects of the drug war. Others have tried to use it to promote science over myth.Lee Brown, a former drug czar under President Bill Clinton, told HuffPost that politicians often didn’t want to hear his message of valuing treatment over incarceration. “Often times,” Brown said, “Congress didn’t want to be seen as being soft on drugs. The easiest way to avoid that accusation was to support law enforcement and interdiction.”Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the former general and drug czar in the late ‘90s, recalled similar spats he had with then-New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who tried to slash methadone programs serving 2,000 residents with opioid addictions. McCaffrey saw Giuliani’s grandstanding as a gift ― a rare public quarrel that allowed him to defend methadone and explain its success. “We denounced Giuliani who went batshit with rage,” McCaffrey said. “He denounced me in the press and on and on.” The two didn’t talk privately.  “He would have strangled me like a wet chicken,” McCaffrey joked.Giuliani ultimately backed down.While, Price didn’t get into a public spat with the drug czar’s office, he did face complaints from hundreds of addiction specialists. In response to his remarks, roughly 700 addiction experts wrote the HHS Secretary a letter characterizing his “substitution” comments as “grossly inaccurate,” insisting that he “set the record straight.” In a subsequent newspaper op-ed, Price didn’t address the controversy but mentioned that improving access to medication-assisted treatment was part of his agency’s strategy in taking on the opioid epidemic.A few days earlier, however, Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly called for a rebooting of the drug war tactics of the early ‘80s ― a policy that the two previous drug czars had denounced.“We have to develop a comprehensive drug demand reduction program in United States that involves everybody—involves professional sports, Hollywood, involves governors, mayors. involves parents, priests, involves everybody,” Kelly said. “We can reduce the amount of drugs consumed in the United States significantly. Never go to zero but we can reduce it. But until we do, we’ll be fighting at best a neutral battle on the border.”Raymond isn’t hopeful that the drug czar will regain its status within the Trump administration. Without an empowered drug czar, he worries that more budget cuts and tin-eared listening tours will be the norm. “Even if Congress preserves [the drug control] office,” he said, “they are not going to listen. That office may linger on in some diminished form but it won’t play a central coordinating role that was so crucial in the previous administration.”"

Trump asked Surgeon General Vivek Murthy to resign in late April. He still has an acting director running the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Although he backtracked on his reported plan to essentially gut his Office of National Drug Control Policy, staffers would be wise to polish their resumes. Trump’s new budget proposal cuts all federal drug prevention programs by roughly 11 percent. The former director of the CDC, Dr. Tom Frieden, vented on Twitter that the 1.2 billion cut to his former agency would thwart efforts at preventing the complications that come with heroin use such as HIV infections.These moves follow Trump’s recent endorsement of the House’s health care bill that would no longer require insurance companies to cover treatment for addiction. If signed into law in its current form, more than a million Americans could potentially lose their access to treatment services. That bill cuts Medicaid by $880 billion. And Trump’s proposed budget goes even further, with another $616 billion cut to Medicaid over 10 years that would effectively cripple the government’s ability to fund and expand care.Drug policy advocates have been angered and baffled by these proposals. They expected Trump to show more commitment to combating the opioid crisis after claiming to be so moved by heartbreaking stories from grieving families on the campaign trail. “The two major challenges to the administration’s response to the opioid epidemic is one ― they’ve been slow to develop a strategy and the second thing is they are supporting legislation that would totally undercut people who are addicted,” explained Joshua Sharfstein, associate dean at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “That’s probably number one. You need a strategy and you need to help people get care.”Sharfstein isn’t the only one confused as to what the actual strategy is behind Trump’s approach to the opioid crisis. Some of the reforms Trump has pursued have been duplicative. In late March, for instance, Trump created a commission to study the opioid epidemic ― work that will surely replicate Surgeon General Murthy’s own report published late last year, and the ongoing mission of the ONDCP, also known colloquially as the drug czar’s office.Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Trump wanted to downsize the drug czar’s office by 95 percent. Trump has since backed away from these proposed cuts. But the move, which would have resulted in the loss of 33 staffers, sparked heavy criticism from experts in the field. In an email to his staff, acting drug czar Richard Baum called the move “frankly heartbreaking.” Advocates have also found Trump and his administration’s approach antiquated and misinformed.

Once again, we’re seeing Trump put polluters ahead of the safety our families. This budget will make our communities sick while lining the pockets of the fossil fuel industry.This budget’s severe cuts single out our clean air and water and our attempts to fight climate disruption. It’s a lot to dig through, so I narrowed it down to some of the worst of the worst.Trump’s budget takes an axe to the Environmental Protection Agency - and not just to its core programs. This budget hacks away at grants to states, cutting them by 45 percent. These grants provide essential financial assistance to states and tribes to help them develop and implement environmental programs like pollution clean-up. Trump’s budget also indiscriminately eliminates more than 50 EPA programs, including Energy Star, America’s favorite program for saving money through energy efficiency; the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program, which conducts research on how chemicals affect our bodies; and infrastructure assistance to Alaska Native Villages, which provides sanitation services for rural communities in Alaska.The targets of these budget cuts are actually wildly popular with Americans. For example, by a nearly two-to-one margin, Americans oppose Trump making substantial cuts to the EPA’s budget. According to a recent survey by Quinnipiac University, 72 percent of U.S. voters say it’s a “bad idea” to significantly cut funding for scientific research on the environment and climate change. Meanwhile, two-in-three Americans who voted in the 2016 presidential election (65 percent) said they would oppose any effort by the Trump administration to take away the EPA’s ability to set limits on carbon pollution from power plants.We will fight this budget every step of the way. Our families and communities deserve strong public health and environmental standards, not rollbacks that will handcuff the agencies charged with protecting our clean air, clean water, and so much more.

Gratisography/Pexels Léa Barreau Tran, Sciences Po Bordeaux and Marc Abélés, École des Hautes Études en sciences sociales (EHESS)Anthropologist Marc Abélés latest research focused on luxury markets and arts across the globe, a topic he touched on at length with Léa Barreau Tran, from Sciences Po Bordeaux, during an interview published here as part of our ongoing series Globalisation Under Pressure. Léa Barreaux: It’s rather unusual to associate luxury with globalisation because they seem so alien to one another. Luxury is often considered as an “illegitimate” subject in anthropology. You, Marc Abélés, have taken a different approach in establishing a global anthropology of luxury. Can you tell us more?Marc Abélés: Luxury is a universal phenomenon. It is just as present in our society as it is in societies far removed from ours, in both space and time. It appears in various forms, depending on the group’s specific history and culture. Bronislaw Malinowski, one of the pioneer scholars of anthropology focused on the circulation (kula-trading system) of precious goods (ceremonial necklaces and bracelets) in the Trobriand Islands, which he compared to the jewels of great European families in his ethnographic research.Malinowski chiefly sought to uncover the significance of these objects and the symbolic and political connotations that determined the manner in which they were circulated. Well known to anthropologists, the potlatch, a gift-giving system among Native Americans, illustrates this phenomenon too. Its lavish spending, competition to impress and consumption of wealth has been extensively studied, namely by American anthropologist Franz Boas.I also want to examine the political, symbolic and economic issues inherent in all forms of exchange, through the prism of the circulation of luxury goods. I am simply doing it in a very different context than that of traditional anthropology. These days, luxury commerce is carried out on a global scale and represents a significant portion of the world’s economy. At the end of the 20th century, the luxury industry, along with other sectors of the economy, underwent a dual process of concentration of ownership and financialisation. It is one of France’s few growing sectors and it makes up the bulk of our exports, along with the arms and aeronautic industries. In light of this, I can’t see why luxury should be treated as an “illegitimate” subject.Also, we should ask ourselves why there is such a need to ascribe legitimacy in the field of social sciences. Did you know that Pierre Bourdieu, the sociologist best known for The Weight of the World kicked off his academic journal Actes de la recherche en sciences sociales with an extensive article on fashion?Léa Barreaux: You’ve been studying the anthropology of globalisation for a long time. These days, your focus is on China, a country with a huge appetite for luxury goods and one of the world’s leaders in counterfeit products. Has China’s influence revolutionised the very nature and definition of luxury in the globalised world? What does it say about our own idea of authenticity?Marc Abélés: Actually, rather than trying to eradicate the counterfeit market entirely, which would be quite simply impossible, China has made real efforts toward limiting the worst excesses of counterfeiting. For example, in 2006, the Chinese government closed one of its counterfeit industry’s major outlets, the Xiangyang Road market in Shanghai.That being said, one of the characteristics of luxury is to give rise to imitation, as a kind of counterpoint. This dialogue between “fake” and authentic contributes to the value placed on luxury products.Léa Barreaux: The globalisation of luxury goods is also felt in the field of contemporary art. On the one hand, it has given artists greater freedom of movement across national borders and a wider audience; on the other, it has increased speculation in the art market. As an anthropologist, how have you seen these trends manifest?Marc Abélés: There is a great deal of overlap between luxury commerce and the contemporary art market. Most businesses in the luxury sector involve artists in their creation process – they create foundations to promote contemporary art, and in some cases, also run auction houses. Luxury has become a global industry. It is under constant threat of homogenisation and trivialisation. Companies essentially want to project an image of extraordinary refinement by associating what is currently most priced in contemporary art with their brand.Looking at the Art Basel Miami Beach contemporary art fair, it was clear to me that this event is not solely designed for collectors; it also provides a platform for businesses in the luxury sector to promote their products. Looking at these kinds of events from within isn’t enough: we need to understand their impact on the city and the way they create connections between the rich and privileged, and a general public that is hungry for cultural symbols.Léa Barreaux: Establishing a global anthropology of luxury brings up a range of political issues and reveals the transformations that modern-day capitalism has undergone. How do you hope to contribute to these discussions without making prescriptive judgements about the positive and negative aspects of globalisation?Marc Abélés: We cannot distinguish the trends affecting the industry and commerce of luxury from broader changes within capitalism. Anthropology provides a multifaceted point of view by approaching luxury as a total social artefact. As for prescriptive judgements, luxury is often associated with wealth, which can lead to it being condemned (as evidenced by the amount of moralising literature that has been published on the subject since ancient times). I think we should remember instead that, in 1871, members of the Paris Commune published a manifesto in which they celebrated luxury and made it their aim to bring it to the people.After all, the right to luxury could constitute a legitimate claim. Luxury is neither an illegitimate subject for social science, nor one that is inherently off-limits to ordinary citizens.Translated from the French by Alice Heathwood forFast for Word.Léa Barreau Tran, Chercheure associée à Les Afriques dans le Monde (LAM), Sciences Po Bordeaux, Sciences Po Bordeaux and Marc Abélés, Directeur de recherches, École des Hautes Études en sciences sociales (EHESS)This article was originally published on The Conversation.

Bronislaw Malinowski, one of the pioneer scholars of anthropology focused on the circulation (kula-trading system) of precious goods (ceremonial necklaces and bracelets) in the Trobriand Islands, which he compared to the jewels of great European families in his ethnographic research.Malinowski chiefly sought to uncover the significance of these objects and the symbolic and political connotations that determined the manner in which they were circulated. Well known to anthropologists, the potlatch, a gift-giving system among Native Americans, illustrates this phenomenon too. Its lavish spending, competition to impress and consumption of wealth has been extensively studied, namely by American anthropologist Franz Boas.I also want to examine the political, symbolic and economic issues inherent in all forms of exchange, through the prism of the circulation of luxury goods. I am simply doing it in a very different context than that of traditional anthropology. These days, luxury commerce is carried out on a global scale and represents a significant portion of the world’s economy. At the end of the 20th century, the luxury industry, along with other sectors of the economy, underwent a dual process of concentration of ownership and financialisation. It is one of France’s few growing sectors and it makes up the bulk of our exports, along with the arms and aeronautic industries. In light of this, I can’t see why luxury should be treated as an “illegitimate” subject.Also, we should ask ourselves why there is such a need to ascribe legitimacy in the field of social sciences. Did you know that Pierre Bourdieu, the sociologist best known for The Weight of the World kicked off his academic journal Actes de la recherche en sciences sociales with an extensive article on fashion?Léa Barreaux: You’ve been studying the anthropology of globalisation for a long time. These days, your focus is on China, a country with a huge appetite for luxury goods and one of the world’s leaders in counterfeit products. Has China’s influence revolutionised the very nature and definition of luxury in the globalised world? What does it say about our own idea of authenticity?Marc Abélés: Actually, rather than trying to eradicate the counterfeit market entirely, which would be quite simply impossible, China has made real efforts toward limiting the worst excesses of counterfeiting. For example, in 2006, the Chinese government closed one of its counterfeit industry’s major outlets, the Xiangyang Road market in Shanghai.That being said, one of the characteristics of luxury is to give rise to imitation, as a kind of counterpoint. This dialogue between “fake” and authentic contributes to the value placed on luxury products.Léa Barreaux: The globalisation of luxury goods is also felt in the field of contemporary art. On the one hand, it has given artists greater freedom of movement across national borders and a wider audience; on the other, it has increased speculation in the art market. As an anthropologist, how have you seen these trends manifest?Marc Abélés: There is a great deal of overlap between luxury commerce and the contemporary art market. Most businesses in the luxury sector involve artists in their creation process – they create foundations to promote contemporary art, and in some cases, also run auction houses. Luxury has become a global industry. It is under constant threat of homogenisation and trivialisation. Companies essentially want to project an image of extraordinary refinement by associating what is currently most priced in contemporary art with their brand.Looking at the Art Basel Miami Beach contemporary art fair, it was clear to me that this event is not solely designed for collectors; it also provides a platform for businesses in the luxury sector to promote their products. Looking at these kinds of events from within isn’t enough: we need to understand their impact on the city and the way they create connections between the rich and privileged, and a general public that is hungry for cultural symbols.Léa Barreaux: Establishing a global anthropology of luxury brings up a range of political issues and reveals the transformations that modern-day capitalism has undergone. How do you hope to contribute to these discussions without making prescriptive judgements about the positive and negative aspects of globalisation?Marc Abélés: We cannot distinguish the trends affecting the industry and commerce of luxury from broader changes within capitalism. Anthropology provides a multifaceted point of view by approaching luxury as a total social artefact. As for prescriptive judgements, luxury is often associated with wealth, which can lead to it being condemned (as evidenced by the amount of moralising literature that has been published on the subject since ancient times). I think we should remember instead that, in 1871, members of the Paris Commune published a manifesto in which they celebrated luxury and made it their aim to bring it to the people.After all, the right to luxury could constitute a legitimate claim. Luxury is neither an illegitimate subject for social science, nor one that is inherently off-limits to ordinary citizens.Translated from the French by Alice Heathwood forFast for Word.Léa Barreau Tran, Chercheure associée à Les Afriques dans le Monde (LAM), Sciences Po Bordeaux, Sciences Po Bordeaux and Marc Abélés, Directeur de recherches, École des Hautes Études en sciences sociales (EHESS)This article was originally published on The Conversation.

The success of the strategy lies in getting people tested and on treatment so they are virally suppressed and no longer infectious. 90-90-90 is working and we are on the precipice of ending the deadliest pandemic in human history. News that the current administration is proposing significant cuts to AIDS funding globally is tragic, however, for the people around the world who will die, and for the incredible progress made. Specifically, the current budget proposes to reduce U.S. spending on AIDS relief by about $1.1 billion out of a $6 billion budget, which comes primarily through PEPFAR, the President’s Emergency Program for AIDS Relief started by former President George W. Bush and largely credited with 15 years of steady global progress against the disease.The State Department says that all people currently on treatment will be able to continue (how that’s possible given roughly 20% cuts was not made clear). But say that is possible, the bigger problem is that in much of the developing world, and in sub-Saharan Africa that carries two-thirds of the world’s HIV/AIDS burden, roughly half of the population is under age 15 and most new infections are occurring in youth ages 15-24. That means the fire – now nearly under control ― will coming roaring back if the supply of medication for new infections runs dry. So, in other words, these cuts would not just stall progress, they would actually spark an inferno, a massive increase in HIV incidence and continued death and devastation around the world.The great challenge for public health officials with regard to epidemics is that once they get rolling, they fuel themselves. Much like a raging forest fire, the first challenge is not to extinguish the fire, but rather to “get it under control.” Epidemics are like this too. The ultimate public health challenge with regard to HIV, beyond treating the afflicted, is forestalling its future spread. And that takes tools. We now have highly effective antiretroviral Therapy (ART) that cannot only save the life of the person on treatment but also suppress the virus in the infected person.However, tools alone can’t stop a raging fire. You need a strategy, like firebreaks, to weaken it to the point where it can no longer fuel itself. In the case of the HIV epidemic, that firebreak strategy is 90-90-90. A couple years ago, the epidemiologists at UNAIDS determined that if we can achieve viral suppression in three-quarters of all people living with HIV, we can achieve that tipping point, leading to the end of the epidemic. And with proper adherence to ART, we have the tools to achieve viral suppression.So, how do we get three-quarters of the world’s HIV-infected to be virally suppressed? First, we need to find them. Second, we need to move them onto treatment. And third, we need to monitor and support their adherence until they achieve viral suppression. A tall order, but we don’t need 100 percent success to achieve this. We need 90-90-90. We need to find 90 percent of the HIV cases, move 90 percent of those cases onto treatment, and then we need 90 percent to achieve viral suppression. Ninety times 90 times 90 roughly equals the three-fourths reduction required to reach the tipping point.But just last month, a team of researchers at UCLA published an article on the likelihood of 90-90-90 being achieved in the region with the world’s highest HIV burden, sub-Saharan Africa. Their conclusion? NO. Why? Because the vast majority of people living with HIV are in remote, rural areas, far from care. As two organizations dedicated to achieving 90-90-90 in southern rural Malawi, an AIDS hotspot and one of the poorest countries in the world, we respectfully disagree. We are seeing firsthand that these targets can, in fact, be achieved at the far end of the road and the numbers back that up. Today, at 73-89-91, Malawi is well on its way to the tipping point.As the UCLA study argues convincingly, remote areas hold the key to ending the epidemic. Success there is irrefutable evidence that success is achievable on a global scale.But just how do we impact 90-90-90 in remote and rural settings? First: We extend the healthcare grid. GAIA and The Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation (ETAF) have partnered for years, using mobile health clinics to deliver clinical personnel and medical supplies to remote locations to provide primary healthcare, including HIV testing and care. Second: We staff the healthcare grid In response to the extraordinary shortage of health professionals – 65% of public sector nursing jobs are vacant in Malawi – GAIA implements a nursing scholarship and training program that is also supported by ETAF. Third: We work to prevent new HIV infections – keeping girls in school, for example, which is a proven protective factor against HIV ― as well as implement testing programs to find new cases, rapidly link them to treatment and provide follow-care to ensure adherence. While the majority of people living with HIV in Africa are women, we have special programs for men who are far more likely to remain undiagnosed, transmit the infection, and die of the disease quite simply because they are further from each of the three 90s.Since its launch in 2003, PEPFAR has saved millions of lives. In 2016, almost 12 million people (of the 18.2 million people on treatment) had access to ART through PEPFAR-funded programs, nearly two million babies were born HIV-free to infected mothers, and more than six million orphans and vulnerable children received care and support.PEPFAR funding has been the steady firehose and a key to world progress. Our work has confirmed that achieving 90-90-90 is possible in even the most challenging settings… but this window of opportunity will not remain open indefinitely. The key is to get the firebreaks built before the wind shifts, which is why you’ve heard bipartisan calls for maintenance and expansion of PEPFAR funding in the Trump administration budget. ETAF and PEPFAR recently announced a $4 million partnership to support programs in Mulanje. PEPFAR’s commitment in the region is critical to its progress.The time to put this fire out is now. If we lose momentum, the fire rages on.Todd Schafer is the Chief Executive Officer of GAIA, the Global AIDS Interfaith Alliance. The Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation has partnered with GAIA to bring quality village-based healthcare to Malawi’s Mulanje District, working together toward achieving UNAIDS 90-90-90 target in this HIV/AIDS hotspot. Ingrained and well-trusted in the community that consists of 577 villages, the GAIA Elizabeth Taylor mobile health clinics have provided over 1 million patient care visits free of charge since 2008."
81,POLITICS,Donald Trump's Latest Budget Still Takes An Ax To Environmental Protection Agency,Kate Sheppard and Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-budget-environmental-protection-agency_us_592449d8e4b034684b100247,The president's proposal would cut the agency's budget by nearly one-third.,2017-05-23,"President Donald Trump, flanked by Vice President Mike Pence, left, and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, plans to cut funding to the EPA to $5.65 billion.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5924547c2000004700cb230d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The latest version of the Trump administration’s 2018 budget will still cut the budget for the Environmental Protection Agency by nearly one-third.The budget proposed on Tuesday would cut funding to the agency to $5.65 billion ― a 31.4 percent reduction. As far as the EPA goes, the proposal doesn’t appear to have changed drastically from the so-called “skinny budget” released in March. Science and health advocates decried the cuts. The proposal “takes a wrecking ball to agencies that protect our health, safety and environment,” said Ken Kimmell, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists and former Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection commissioner, in a statement. The lower budget would mean “taking our environmental cops off the beat and allowing those who would seek to pollute to get away with it.”The budget proposes eliminating funding to every program to deal with global warming, including the Clean Power Plan, the first federal policy to put limits on carbon dioxide pollution from the utility sector, by far the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. “Clearly this is about declaring war on [the fight against] climate change,” said Elgie Holstein, a senior director at the non profit advocacy group the Environmental Defense Fund. “It’s not a particular surprise, though it’s deeply disappointing.” In March, Trump signed an executive order instructing EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt to review the Clean Power Plan, which had already been stayed by the Supreme Court. Despite this, the EPA is legally required to regulate carbon dioxide emissions under a separate 2007 Supreme Court decision, which found that the public health risk posed by greenhouse gases means the agency should take some action.Low-income people and communities of color, who disproportionately live in high-pollution areas, will bear the brunt of the cuts. “These cuts will only guarantee more pollution which will likely trigger more asthma attacks, and more lead in our drinking water,” Adrianna Quintero, executive director of the nonprofit Voces Verdes, said in a statement. “For Latinos who often live in counties that frequently violate air pollution standards, this could mean serious trouble. For African Americans who already suffer the highest incidence of asthma, this could be a matter of life and death.”If implemented, the proposed EPA cuts could stymie the Trump administration’s own pledge to return power to state regulators and boost local infrastructure. The budget suggests slashing grants to state regulators by at least 30 percent, according to the National Association of Clean Air Agencies, which represents roughly 40 local groups. That means less monitoring of air quality and delayed building permits for companies looking to expand or build new facilities.It also jeopardizes local agencies’ ability to meet Clean Air Act standards. State regulators are responsible for devising annual implementation plans, which are submitted to the EPA and function as a sort of contract between state and federal agencies. The budget, advocates said, sets them up for failure.If state agencies don’t meet the standards, federal regulators are legally required to withhold highway funds, constrain economic development aid and, in the worst cases, come in and impose their own plans on local jurisdictions“EPA should do this based upon public health and welfare,” said Bill Becker, executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies. “But if that isn’t enough, they should do this to prevent the states and localities [from facing federal sanctions].”Local agencies will likely raise permitting fees on companies to make up the difference.“States have a legal responsibility under state, local and federal law to carry out environmental permitting and environmental regulations and enforcement,” said John Walke, clean air director at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “The Trump budget turns a blind eye to those legal responsibilities with the farcical claim that states may be able to make it up somehow.”“I’ll tell you how they’ll do it,” he added. “They’ll do it with fees on industry.”Since taking office, Pruitt has focused heavily on appealing to heavily polluting industries that he’s accused his predecessors at the EPA of mistreating. He’s made visits to coal mines and given speeches at oil and gas conferences. But in recent weeks, he has also ramped up calls to improve use of the Superfund, a program for cleaning up toxic waste sites that The Washington Post described as the “one part of the EPA that the agency’s new leader wants to protect.” Still, the proposed budget dissolves one-third of the program’s funding.“It’s a lot of doublespeak,” said Mary Gade, a former EPA regional administrator under President George W. Bush. “This budget is very, very draconian in terms of the Superfund.”This story has been updated with comments from Adrianna Quintero and John Walke."

Now they say Donald Trump's carelessness doesn't count.,2017-05-23,"“I don’t think the president broke the law,"" said Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), when asked if it was careless for President Donald Trump to share classified intel with Russian officials.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59249af11600002200ddc722.jpeg?ops=crop_472_300_2575_1686%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Last summer, in an effort to hurt Hillary Clinton’s presidential candidacy, Senate Republicans introduced a bill to strip security clearance from “any officer or employee of the federal government who has exercised extreme carelessness with classified information.”The bill was never going anywhere. It was a political jab at Clinton, who was mired in drama over her use of a private email server for official communications when she was secretary of state. Republicans unveiled the bill one day after then-FBI Director James Comey concluded that Clinton had committed no criminal wrongdoing, though he said she and her team were “extremely careless” with sensitive information.The legislation expired last year, and it’s largely forgotten now. But in light of President Donald Trump’s reported revelation of highly classified intelligence to Russian officials in the Oval Office this month, which potentially jeopardized critical intelligence sources embedded with ISIS, HuffPost tracked down co-sponsors of the bill to see if they think their “carelessness” standard should apply to Trump.Unsurprisingly, they did not.“The president’s ability to communicate whatever he wants to, without it being a breach of the law, is very clear,” said Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.). “An employee has a very different function.”Asked if he considers it “extremely careless” that Trump leaked classified intelligence to Russian officials,” Scott dryly repeated, “I don’t think the president broke the law.”“Call Alex in my office,” said Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), the bill’s author.Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) said the bill applies to all federal employees except the president. Rounds said he still trusts Trump with classified information, but conceded that Trump’s missteps on this front could be diminishing his political capital.“It never helps,” he said. “It never helps.”Some senators were less amused by this story than others. Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho) said the bill only applies to people who carelessly handle information, not someone “who has the right and intentionally discloses” such information.Getting a bit testy, Risch said he has no opinion on whether it was careless for Trump to share classified intelligence with Russian officials because he wasn’t part of that conversation.“I’ve heard speculation. I’ve heard them say, ‘Oh, it could have endangered someone, oh, it could have done―,’ I don’t know what the conversation was,” said Risch. “His job is to coordinate with other countries, just as the intelligence community is, to share information about mutual threats.”Sens. James Inhofe (R-Okla.) and Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) both emphasized that Trump has only been accused of revealing classified information to the Russians, and that people should wait until investigations into the matter are finished before drawing conclusions. There are currently House, Senate and Justice Department probes into whether Trump and his team had ties to Russians who interfered in last year’s election to help Trump win.“Let’s wait on the special counsel and the two intelligence committees, and then they’ll figure all that out,” Roberts said.Asked if he sees irony in Republicans backing legislation to go after Clinton for carelessness while backing off those charges when it comes to Trump, Roberts replied, “There’s irony in every corner and closet in Washington.”"
86,POLITICS,President Trump's Average Approval Rating Dips To Just Below 40 Percent,Ariel Edwards-Levy and Grace Sparks,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-average-approval-rating_us_59245d35e4b03b485cb57cc2,And more of the latest polling news.,2017-05-23,"President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump wave as they board Air Force One to travel to Rome from Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv, Israel, May 23, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59245db02000003a0016e657.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump’s average approval rating just reached a new low, according to HuffPost Pollster’s aggregation of publicly available surveys.Trump’s ratings took a noticeable dip in March after Republicans failed to pass a bill repealing the Affordable Care Act. They stabilized in the low 40s for much of April. In the past month, however, his ratings have taken a more significant downturn. His average approval rating stands at just below 40 percent as of Tuesday afternoon, with his disapproval rating at nearly 56 percent. Polls tend to fluctuate, and the dividing line between 40 percent and 39 percent isn’t itself especially significant. But regardless of the exact numbers, Trump, who began his term without the honeymoon period experienced by most modern presidents, is now in worse shape than ever. By comparison, former President Barack Obama never saw his average approval rating fall below 42 percent.Individual pollsters who’ve tracked Trump’s ratings this month have measured strikingly similar downward shifts. Of the six pollsters who’ve released multiple surveys taken in May, five found Trump’s net approval rating ― the difference between his “approve” and “disapprove” numbers ― falling by between 7 and 9 points, as of Monday evening. The sixth, the Ipsos/Reuters tracking poll, shows him down by 11.MORE OF THE LATEST POLLING NEWS:ATTENTION TO HILLARY CLINTON’S EMAILS DOMINATED 2016 ― HuffPollster, on a presentation delivered Saturday during this year’s American Association for Public Opinion Research conference: “During last year’s election, the polling firm Gallup regularly asked Americans if they’d read, heard, or seen anything about the presidential candidates in the last few days. Those who had ― usually two-thirds or more of the public in any given week ― were asked to elaborate. The researchers then pulled out the words used by the public to describe what they were hearing about both candidates, as part of an effort to figure out what information was reaching voters and staying with them. In a chart of the most common words used in relation to Clinton between last summer and Election Day, the word ‘email’ quite literally crowds out the rest, with several of the other most prevalent words also alluding to perceptions that she was scandal-plagued... Many of the words surrounding Donald Trump also related to unflattering stories ― ‘women,’ for example, which likely encompasses everything from his litany of demeaning comments about women to the accusations he faced late in the campaign of sexual harassment and assault. But no one topic completely dominated the public’s impressions of him or his campaign.” [HuffPost]ABOUT A TENTH OF PARTISANS SWITCHED SIDES LAST YEAR ― A new report finds that partisan identity is “sticky” but not immutable, with young Republicans relatively likely to have abandoned their party. Pew Research: “Some of the power of partisanship comes from its relative immutability: Most people remain loyal to a political party. But over a 15-month period encompassing the 2016 presidential campaign, about 10% of Republicans and Democrats ‘defected’ from their parties to the opposing party. Those who switched parties were less politically engaged than people who stayed with their parties. And among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, young people were far more likely than older adults to leave the GOP….Only about half (53%) of those under 30 who initially identified as Republicans or leaned Republican consistently remained with the party over four subsequent surveys. Among older Republicans, 80% or more consistently identified as Republicans or leaned Republican.” [Pew]‘OUTLIERS’ ― Links to the best news at the intersection of polling, politics and political data:- Most Americans say they’re bothered that Trump reportedly shared classified information with Russia.

87,THE WORLDPOST,Trump Praises Bahrain Days Before Brutal Crackdown,Nick Robins-Early,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-bahrain-crackdown_us_59247495e4b03b485cb5accb,Trump's embrace of authoritarian leaders may be giving free rein to government repression.,2017-05-23,"U.S. President Donald Trump shakes hands with Bahrain's King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa at the Gulf Cooperation Council leaders summit in Riyadh, May 21, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59249c5f1600002100ddc72a.jpeg?ops=crop_9_344_1967_1120%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Days after President Donald Trump praised U.S. ties with Bahrain and vowed to mend any “strain” in the countries’ relationship, the Gulf state launched a violent security raid that led to the death of one protester and dozens of arrests. Bahraini security forces on Tuesday raided the home of prominent Shiite cleric Sheikh Isa Qassim in the village of Diraz. Demonstrators had been taking part in a sit-in outside Qassim’s after authorities revoked the cleric’s citizenship last year on vague charges of aiding a foreign state.Bahrain’s suppression of human rights and violent put-down of protests has created tensions with the U.S in the past. Former President Barack Obama’s administration advocated for reforms and restricted some arms sales. But Trump has taken a different approach, appearing to ignore human rights concerns in dealings with Bahrain, potentially giving the kingdom a free hand to quell dissent.Trump met with Bahrain’s King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa on Sunday, and pledged more amicable relations. “Our countries have a wonderful relationship together, but there has been a little strain, but there won’t be strain with this administration,” Trump said during the meeting.The raid continues a crackdown on dissidents by Bahrain’s Sunni authorities, who have targeted activists and prominent members of the country’s Shiite majority since political uprisings swept the region in 2011.The shift in White House rhetoric on Bahrain continues Trump’s conciliatory line on strongmen and authoritarian governments that have shared interests with Washington. During Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia last weekend, he praised a Saudi airstrike campaign in Yemen that has killed thousands of civilians, and complimented Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi for “doing a tremendous job.”Trump’s first foreign visit has seen a prominent focus on securing arms deals and bolstering support for regional powers that want to constrain Iran. Trump announced Saturday that he had struck a $110 billion sale of arms to Saudi Arabia. In late March, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson decided to waive human rights conditions on the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Bahrain. The Obama administration struck the deal, worth billions, with the caveat that Bahrain refrain from certain rights abuses. Human rights groups condemned the Trump administration’s move to remove those assurances, saying that it would give Bahrain a green light to ramp up repression.Human Rights Watch issued a statement following Tuesday’s raid in Bahrain, saying that the timing of the operation, two days after Trump’s friendly meeting, “can hardly be a coincidence.” Although the U.S. has a long history of looking the other way on human rights when it is strategically or economically beneficial, the Trump administration has at times signaled that it is willing to do away with even the most milquetoast of condemnations if it could jeopardize potential deals.Tillerson summarized the White House view in a speech this month to State Department employees, in which he said that putting too heavy of an emphasis on other nations accepting American values “really creates obstacles to our ability to advance our national security interests, our economic interests.” Despite that sentiment, he claimed that the U.S. would not leave its values on the sidelines."
