Then he decided to hold off as long as possible.“Having subtracted myself from this political fracas and all of the mayhem of the digital media, I kind of found the center of the cyclone, it is very peaceful in my bubble of ignorance,” Chandler said.To ensure that bubble doesn’t pop before he’s ready, Chandler has avoided newspapers, TV and the internet. When he goes outside, he wears headphones so he doesn’t overhear any presidential news. Chandler also asks others to help him continue his ostrich-like approach to the election by wearing a sign that reads, “I don’t know who won, and don’t want to. PLEASE DON’T TELL ME.”“I divert my gaze from newspaper boxes … I don’t venture out very often, and when I do I wear my headphones and my sign, and people have been very respectful of my decision,” Chandler told the “Today Show.”Chandler knows his blissful ignorance can’t last forever.As he told Atlanta TV station WXIA: “I’d like to make it to 2020, but I’ll be lucky to make it to [tomorrow],” he said."
1,POLITICS,Donald Trump Denies That He Asked Argentinian President For Help With Building Permits,"Ben Walsh, Roque Planas, and Paul Blumenthal",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/president-elect-trump-argentinian-president_us_58332bb1e4b030997bc087da,An Argentine journalist says the president-elect raised the issue during a congratulatory call.,2016-11-21,Donald Trump has vowed to resolve the massive conflicts of interest created by his sprawling business organization.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/583350a6180000270c30f49a.jpeg?cache=SWTu4Ii4gA&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In a phone call with Argentine President Mauricio Macri, President-elect Donald Trump asked for help with permits for an office tower that bears his name, an Argentine journalist alleged Sunday. Spokespeople for Macri and Trump subsequently denied that allegation on Monday. But the episode raises further questions about how the incoming U.S. president will separate his business interests and his new political powers — if at all.During his show “Periodismo Para Todos,” journalist Jorge Lanata said Sunday that Trump raised the permit issues during a congratulatory call with Macri.“This still hasn’t emerged, but Trump asked for [Macri] to authorize a building he’s constructing in Buenos Aires,” Lanata said. “It wasn’t just a geopolitical chat.”Argentine newspaper La Nación’s report of Lanata’s comments was first flagged in the U.S. press by political news site Talking Points Memo. Jason Miller, a spokesperson for Trump, vehemently denied Lanata’s report: “Not true. Argentina’s president said not true also.”A spokesman for Macri did also deny the allegation. “That issue was not part of the conversation between president Mauricio Macri and President-elect Donald Trump,” Argentinian embassy spokesman Iván Pavlovsky told The Huffington Post. “The subject both leaders talked about was the institutional relationship, and they briefly mentioned the personal relationship they have had for years.” (Macri’s father, Franco, was a construction magnate and worked with Trump in New York in the 1980s.)Macri, however, told Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun on Monday that Trump’s daughter (presumably Ivanka) was also on his congratulatory call. “I have known her since her infant days,” he said.The claim that Trump asked for help moving forward with the tower deal first arose during Lanata’s opening monologue, which was peppered with one-liners, leading some to suspect that it was intended as a joke.But Lanata based his comments on reporting by journalist Romina Manguel, who joined a roundtable discussion later on the show. Manguel also said that some members of the Buenos Aires city council are rethinking whether to renew YY Development Group’s permits to build the tower due to concerns over the president-elect’s stake in the deal.“They talked about the little details of the [Buenos Aires] city council, capitalism and the tower they want to build,” Manguel said on the Canal 13 program.“It’s a scandal that Trump, when Macri makes a phone call on state business, that Trump, the president-elect of the United States, asks about a private business,” journalist Maxi Montenegro added, after Manguel detailed her reporting.Trump has said that he will resolve the massive conflicts of interest created by his sprawling business organization by establishing what he describes as a blind trust run by his children. But such an arrangement fits no definition of a blind trust, which holds unknown assets and is run by neutral third-party administrators.Further, Trump has named his children to the executive committee of his presidential transition. Trump knows his business interests well, as does anyone looking to curry favor with him ― his name, after all, is stamped on the side of his buildings ― and his children are tied to their father’s success.Indeed, there is already alarming evidence that Trump’s children are too involved in his business and official presidential responsibilities to provide any meaningful separation of the family business from state duties. On Nov. 17, Trump met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Ivanka Trump also attended the meeting, photos distributed by the Japanese press show. Ivanka’s presence at the meeting came after Trump’s transition team said she, along with her two brothers, would run the family business in a “blind trust.”Since his shock victory, Trump also met with Indian real estate developers who are licensing his name on a number of buildings in the country. Before his win, Trump’s business partner in the Philippines was named as the country’s trade envoy to the United States. Trump and his children maintained very close contact with his South American business partners during the campaign. Both Felipe Yaryura and Moses Yellati of the YY Development Group attended Trump’s election night victory party at the Hilton in midtown Manhattan at the invitation of Trump’s children. Yaryura told La Nación that he was able to congratulate Trump on his victory.In other interviews, Yaryura and Yellati detailed other special access they were granted throughout the campaign. Both attended the debates between Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. The YY Development Group provides the Trump Organization’s main foothold into South America. The company licenses the Trump name for projects in both Uruguay and Argentina. Trump Punta del Este is a luxury residential property featuring 129 residences on Uruguay’s Atlantic coastline; it is slated to open in 2018. According to local reports, 60 percent of the Punta del Este homes are sold, mostly to Argentine businessmen, with a few going to wealthy Uruguayans and Americans. The commercial tower set for development in Buenos Aires, Argentina, is awaiting the appropriate permits from the city council. Trump’s business partners are hoping to open it in 2020.“This is a historic moment and I have faith that it’s going to be spectacular for Argentina,” Yaryura told La Nación. “You know when you feel like the planets are aligning?”“If we take advantage of this, we’ve got very good years coming,” he added. “With a lot of work, this is going to be very good.”A spokeswoman for YY did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In April, Trump formed a new company, TC Marks Buenos Aires LLC. Among Trump’s hundreds of business ventures listed in his financial disclosure to the Federal Election Commission, “marks” often refers to deals where Trump licenses his brand to a building or product without a controlling ownership stake in the building or company itself.This article was updated with a report from Asahi Shimbun."
2,GREEN,Police In North Dakota Clash With Oil Pipeline Protesters,"By Chris Michaud, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-dakota-oil-pipeline-clashes_us_5832929ae4b030997bc02862,The Morton County Sheriff’s Department described the situation as an “ongoing riot.” Protesters disagree.,2016-11-21,Law enforcement officers surrounded demonstrators protesting the Dakota Access pipeline in North Dakota on Sunday night.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/583293631700002600e7b814.jpeg?cache=s6FNiG3TUB&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(Reuters) - Hundreds of protesters opposed to a North Dakota oil pipeline project they say threatens water resources and sacred tribal lands clashed with police who fired tear gas at the scene of a similar confrontation last month, officials said.An estimated 400 protesters mounted the Backwater Bridge and attempted to force their way past police in what the Morton County Sheriff’s Department initially described as an “ongoing riot,” the latest in a series of demonstrations against the Dakota Access Pipeline.A statement from the agency said one arrest had been made by 8:30 p.m. local time (0230 GMT Monday), about 2 1/2 hours after the incident began 45 miles (30 miles) south of Bismarck, the North Dakota capital. About 100 to 200 protesters remained after midnight.The Backwater Bridge has been closed since late October, when activists clashed with police in riot gear and set two trucks on fire, prompting authorities to forcibly shut down a protesters encampment nearby.The Morton County Sheriff’s Department said officers on the scene of the latest confrontation were “describing protesters’ actions as very aggressive.”Demonstrators tried to start about a dozen fires as they attempted to outflank and “attack” law enforcement barricades, the sheriff’s statement said.Police said they responded by firing volleys of tear gas at protesters in a bid to prevent them from crossing the bridge.Activists at the scene reported on Twitter that police were also spraying protesters with water in sub-freezing temperatures and firing rubber bullets, injuring some in the crowd.Police did not confirm those reports, but later said protesters had hurled rocks, striking one officer, and fired burning logs from slingshots.The clashes began after protesters removed a truck that had been on the bridge since Oct. 27, police said. The North Dakota Department of Transportation closed the Backwater Bridge due to damage from that incident.The $3.7 billion Dakota Access project has been drawing steady opposition from Native American and environmental activists since the summer.Completion of the pipeline, set to run 1,172 miles (1,185 km) from North Dakota to Illinois, was delayed in September so federal authorities could re-examine permits required by the Army Corps of Engineers.Plans called for the pipeline to pass under Lake Oahe, a federally owned water source, and to skirt the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation by about half a mile. Most of the construction has otherwise been finished.The Standing Rock tribe and environmental activists say the project would threaten water supplies and sacred Native American sites and ultimately contribute to climate change.Supporters of the pipeline, owned by Energy Transfer Partners, said the project offers the fast and most direct route for bringing Bakken shale oil from North Dakota to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries and would be safer than transporting the oil by road or rail."
3,POLITICS,Trump's National Security Adviser Changed His Mind About Turkey Coup Attempt After His Firm Got Involved,Jessica Schulberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mike-flynn-turkey-coup_us_58324909e4b099512f8376d4,"Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn said in July that the military's attempt to overthrow the government was ""worth clapping for."" Now he calls Turkey an ally.",2016-11-21,"Michael Flynn, national security adviser to President-elect Donald Trump, now says Turkey is one of America's most critical allies. In July, he cheered for an attempted military coup against its president.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58324a441700002500e7b785.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― When a faction of the Turkish military attempted to overthrow President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in July, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn celebrated the coup effort as something “worth clapping for.” But a Dutch company headed by a man with ties to Erdogan’s government hired Flynn’s intelligence firm about two months later. Since then, Flynn has dramatically reversed his public position on the failed putsch in Turkey. Earlier this month, he wrote a piece in The Hill hailing Erdogan’s Turkey as a critical U.S. ally and calling on the Obama administration to extradite the cleric Ankara has accused of orchestrating the coup. At the time of the attempted coup, Flynn viewed Erdogan as an Islamist who was leading Turkey down the wrong path. As the violent effort to oust the Turkish president unfolded, Flynn addressed an audience in Cleveland, where he was promoting his book on radical Islam. “Probably most of you don’t know, but there’s an ongoing coup going on in Turkey right now,” Flynn said during remarks. Turkey, Flynn warned, had begun “to move toward Islamism.”“This is Turkey under Erdogan ― who is actually very close to President [Barack] Obama,” Flynn said, speaking at the Cleveland chapter of ACT for America, a group that describes itself as “the [National Rifle Association] of national security.” “If the military succeeds,” Flynn continued, “one of the things that the military immediately said is, ‘We recognize our responsibilities with NATO, we recognize our responsibilities with the United Nations, we want to make sure that the world knows, we are, we want to be seen as a secular nation.’” The audience cheered. “That is worth clapping for,” Flynn said. By the next day, it was clear the attempted coup had failed ― in part because even Erdogan’s critics in Turkey preferred his increasingly authoritarian rule to a military takeover.In the months since, Erdogan has used the event as justification to further consolidate his power. He has also accused Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen of orchestrating the putsch from Pennsylvania, where he lives in self-imposed exile. Ankara has pushed Washington to extradite Gulen, but he denies orchestrating the coup and the Department of Justice has said it doesn’t have sufficient evidence to send him back.These days, Flynn, who was recently named national security adviser to President-elect Donald Trump, is pushing a different view on Turkey’s president and the July effort to oust him.“We need to see the world from Turkey’s perspective,” Flynn wrote in a piece published on Election Day. “We must begin with understanding that Turkey is vital to U.S. interests. Turkey is really our strongest ally against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), as well as a source of stability in the region.”From Turkey’s point of view, Flynn wrote, failing to extradite Gulen is like “harboring Turkey’s Osama bin Laden.” He compared Gulen to Sayyid Qutb and Hasan al Banna, leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood, and to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who led the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran.In a stark reversal from his July comment about Obama and Erdogan’s closeness, Flynn accused the Obama administration of “keeping Erdogan’s government at arm’s length ― an unwise policy that threatens our long-standing alliance.”In his contribution to The Hill, Flynn failed to disclose that his intelligence firm had recently inked an agreement with a Dutch consulting group headed by a businessman who has ties to the Turkish government. Lobbying registration paperwork filed in September shows that Flynn Intel Group was hired by Inovo BV, a company founded by Kamil Ekim Alptekin. Alptekin is the chairman of the Turkish-American Business Council and helped arrange Erdogan’s visit to Washington earlier this year. Robert Kelley, Flynn Intel Group’s chief counsel, is the group’s registered lobbyist. According to the paperwork, Inovo BV hired Flynn’s firm to provide advice on funding bills for the Departments of State and Defense. The Daily Caller was the first to report on the lobbying registration.While Flynn is not himself a lobbyist, Alptekin told The Intercept that Inovo BV paid Flynn’s company “tens of thousands of dollars” for world affairs analysis. Alptekin said he has met Flynn but does not have influence over his views.Trump’s transition team has said it will impose a lifetime ban on administration officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government after leaving government.Flynn, who ran the Defense Intelligence Agency before being pushed out in 2014, was an early supporter of Trump’s presidential bid. Well-respected by his peers during his military career, he has made a series of startling comments since retiring. “Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL,” Flynn tweeted in February. While campaigning for Trump, he led chants of “lock her up” against Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. The former DIA chief has encouraged his fans on Twitter to follow conspiracy theorist Mike Cernovich.Despite his inflammatory rhetoric, Flynn, with his decades of military experience, was considered by many to be one of the more serious individuals in the national security arena to endorse Trump. But his comments from July, juxtaposed with his recent opinion piece and his firm’s lobbying ties to Erdogan, suggest that the former DIA chief’s foreign policy positions can be shaped by the highest bidder. Flynn did not respond to a request for comment.“It’s problematic,” Henri Barkey, the director of the Middle East program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, said. “Which Flynn are we dealing with? Is it the Flynn who got money lobbying for Turkey or is it the Flynn who is worried about what he calls ‘Islamic extremism’?”James Jeffrey, a career diplomat who served as the U.S. ambassador to Turkey from 2008 to 2010, downplayed the significance of Flynn’s early support for the attempted coup. “That was the initial response of many people … particularly those in the U.S. military who were angry at Erdogan for being lukewarm in the fight against ISIS,” Jeffrey said. “Flynn was just more open in talking about it.” Once Gulen and his followers were accused of orchestrating the coup, Jeffrey said, “people changed their mind.” But it’s not just Flynn’s contradictory statements that worry some Middle East analysts. It’s the fact that he spoke out in favor of a military takeover at all. “I have serious concerns with Erdogan,” said Matt Duss, the president of the Foundation for Middle East Peace. “But the idea that a military coup would’ve solved these problems is a fantasy.”In the same speech where he praised attempts to overthrow Turkey’s president, Flynn spoke admiringly of Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the military general who led the 2013 coup in Egypt to overthrow Mohamed Morsi, the democratically elected Muslim Brotherhood member.Since Sisi’s takeover, Duss said, “repression has gotten worse and it’s provided a huge boon to groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS who have been arguing that democracy is a dead end.”Do you work in a federal agency?

Coal makes up nearly three-quarters of the Canadian electrical industry’s greenhouse gas emissions, and over 8 percent of the country’s total carbon footprint.“Taking traditional coal power out of our energy mix and replacing it with cleaner technologies will significantly reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, improve the health of Canadians, and benefit generations for years to come,” McKenna said in a statement. “It sends a clear signal to the world that Canada is a great place to invest in clean energy.”Roughly 80 percent of Canada’s electricity currently comes from zero-emission sources, McKenna said. Under the new regulations, that number should increase to 90 percent over the next 14 years. Other countries, including Austria, Denmark, France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, have also accelerated their plans to wean themselves off coal, according to The Wall Street Journal. But the move comes as the U.S., Canada’s largest trading partner, seems set to scale back environmental regulations and bolster the coal industry once President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year.Trump campaigned hard in coal country, promising to put miners back to work by slashing pollution restrictions and scrapping President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, which would have forced the utility sector to use more renewable energy. Most of the coal industry’s biggest players have gone bankrupt over the last two years, in large part because of ill-conceived bets on the future of Chinese economic growth. Even coal barons who backed Trump admit the coal industry isn’t coming back.Trump is considering pulling out of the historic climate treaty reached in Paris last year, which has prompted some countries to threaten to place a carbon tax on any goods imported from the U.S. Should Trump make good on his promises, the U.S. won’t be the only developed country flirting with a fossil fuel so dirty its emissions shroud cities like Beijing in dense, toxic smog. Japan ― still reeling from 2011 disaster at the nuclear power station in Fukushima ― plans to build a dozen new coal-fired plants, pollution from which could cause up to 10,000 premature deaths. Australia, which rolled back environmental regulations under “environmental vandal” Prime Minister Tony Abbott, struggles with some of the dirtiest coal-fired plants of any rich country. “This is a necessary prerequisite for tackling climate change, but will also make a significant contribution to reducing air pollution and also unlock investment in clean alternatives,” Ben Caldecott, a sustainable finance program director at the University of Oxford, said of Canada’s announcement.“Other developed economies must also act, particularly Japan ― which is wrongly planning a new generation of coal-fired power stations ― and Australia, which has the oldest and most inefficient coal-fired power stations found anywhere in the world,” he added.To be sure, Canada isn’t completely getting rid of coal. Some electricity produced by coal-fired plants equipped with technology to capture and store carbon emissions will remain. The world’s first carbon-capture coal plant opened in Saskatchewan in 2014. The $1.47 billion facility compresses emissions into liquid form and pumps the byproduct into an aquifer deep underground.Critics say the deal to build the plant provided a massive subsidy to Canada’s oil industry, and stunted clean energy projects such as new wind turbines in the region. Early experiments in carbon capture have already caused leaks, blowouts and earthquakes.“As if this wasn’t enough, fossil fuel companies are actively lobbying to shift responsibility and liability for storing and monitoring buried emissions to the public,” environmental advocacy group Greenpeace wrote in a July memo on carbon capture technology. “Put simply, carbon dioxide storing is so risky that these polluting industries expect governments to step in and take responsibility for storage sites once they’ve closed. In the event of a leak, the people, not polluters would bear the consequences.” "

Alex Myteberi wrote a letter to Obama in August to ask if 5-year-old Omran Daqneesh could stay with his family. A photograph of Omran, covered in ash and blood after he was injured in an airstrike in Aleppo, gained worldwide attention and served as a chilling reminder of the devastation in Syria.“Can you please go get him and bring him to our home?” Alex, who lives in New York, wrote in his letter. “We’ll be waiting for you guys with flags, flowers and balloons. We will give him a family, and he will be our brother.”Obama took a moment to speak to Alex when the Myteberi family toured the White House earlier this month. The administration shared a video of the meeting on Facebook Thursday.“You being so nice and kind, hopefully it makes other people think the same way,” Obama told Alex. “So I was very proud of you.”In his letter, Alex wrote that he would teach Omran math and that Omran could teach him another language. He promised to share his bike and toys.Obama first read Alex’s letter at the United Nations Leaders’ Summit on the Global Refugee Crisis in September. “The humanity that a young child can display, who hasn’t learned to be cynical, or suspicious or fearful of other people because of where they’re from, or how they look or how they pray ― we can all learn from Alex,” Obama said in his September speech. Valbona Myteberi, Alex’s mother, told Hudson Valley’s Journal News that meeting Obama was “an emotional and amazing surprise.”“Alex loved the moments with the president,” she said. “He is a shy little boy, but when he saw the president, his eyes lit up and he was completely drawn to him.”More than 10,000 Syrian refugees have resettled in the U.S., and Obama has boosted the country’s commitments to alleviating the refugee crisis, setting a target of resettling 110,000 refugees in fiscal year 2017. However, President-elect Donald Trump’s attacks on refugees have left the fate of resettlement programs uncertain. Trump said during his campaign that he would end Syrian refugee resettlement entirely and deport Syrian refugees who had already settled in the country.Here’s the full text of Alex’s letter:Dear President Obama, "

But the verdict is still out on whether it should be.Take a look at how it works, dish by dish:The blades on the drone propellers can be used to peel potatoes before boiling them. They can also peel carrots.Frying the carrots is just a matter of flying them outside to a vat of oil and holding that position for 25 minutes. Easy peasy.The drone blade makes cutting the carrots simple.Cutting parsley is also a snap, though it’s not the neatest method.The drone really comes in handy when you want to whip potatoes, cream, pumpkin pie and gravy all at the same time.Buttering rolls, on the other hand, is a real challenge. But, hey, nothing worth doing is easy.But while a drone can make some cooking more efficient ― like blending ― the results aren’t exactly visually appealing. No wonder the company says “We do not recommend trying this at home” on its YouTube page.H/T UPI.com"

The 26-year-old man, who fled from police on Sunday after officers tried to arrest him on two felony warrants, emerged from between her clothes and said: “Don’t be scared, little girl.”“I started screaming bloody murder,” Presley told KFOR.Presley’s parents heard her cries and came running.

Her father, who was not identified, grabbed Cox, but he got away after a brief scuffle and fled with $100 of Presley’s birthday money.Police spotted Cox walking along a nearby street the following morning and arrested him on the outstanding warrants, plus two more charges of burglary and escape from arrest.

While welcoming him to the play, Dixon told the veep-to-be he was concerned how the new administration would treat the country’s diverse population and hoped the play inspired him to work on behalf of all Americans. But Van Zandt wasn’t having it.“It was the most respectful, benign form of bullying ever. But bullying nonetheless,” Van Zandt said on Twitter Saturday. “And by the way, human rights must be won, not asked for. When artists perform the venue becomes your home. The audience are your guests. It’s taking unfair advantage of someone who thought they were a protected guest in your home.”Many praised the cast for openly addressing a politician who has attempted to institute anti-LGBTQ policies and has supported “conversion therapy” in his career. Van Zandt wrote that he disagrees with what Pence represents, but “I don’t tolerate bullying in any form.”Van Zandt, who has said in the past that he’s Independent and has spoken out in support of LGBTQ rights, added, “A guy comes to a Broadway show for a relaxing night out. Instead he gets a lecture from the stage! Not a level playing field. It’s bullying. You don’t single out an audience member and embarrass him from the stage.

13,LATINO VOICES,Sessions Disqualified All Dominicans. Senators Must Now Disqualify Him.,"Anthony Reyes, ContributorCommunications Director for the California State Senate, forme...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sessions-disqualified-all-dominicans-senators-must_us_58334c61e4b0eaa5f14d491c,What he said about Dominicans was discriminatory and soul-crushing.,2016-11-21,"Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL) arrives in the lobby of Republican president-elect Donald Trump's Trump Tower in New York, New York, U.S. November 14, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58334f8c180000270c30f498.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“Fundamentally, almost no one coming from the Dominican Republic to the United States is coming here because they have a provable skill that would benefit us and that would indicate their likely success in our society.”Those slanderous words were spoken on the floor of the U.S. Senate this century by Donald Trump’s appointment for Attorney General, Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama.Next time you are relaxed by the dulcet tones of a bachata crooner, remember how generations of Dominicans will never be calm if the U.S. Senate confirms someone who dismissed them as unworthy of America.Political differences are one thing, but hate speech is quite another. Sen. Sessions crossed the line with those remarks, and if the U.S. Senate has any sense of moral decency, they should disqualify him from holding the title of the nation’s chief law enforcement officer.All Latinos were disgusted by Donald Trump’s comments on Mexicans, we felt he was speaking about all of us. But the election is over and now we all have a duty to furiously challenge every one of his appointments that echo his violent ignorance.The Senate has a responsibility to help this novice president-elect appoint the best people to his cabinet and Sen. Sessions is objectively not the right choice during these scary times for minorities.What Sen. Sessions said was not only discriminatory and soul-crushing, it is completely untrue.Oscar de la Renta, Junot Diaz, and Julia Alvarez are just a few of the many Dominican-Americans who have made great contributions and succeeded in the United States.Labor Secretary Tom Pérez is wrapping up his successful term as the first Dominican-American cabinet official and we just elected the first Dominican to Congress.Christopher Columbus actually arrived in the Dominican Republic when he “discovered” America.And let’s talk about America’s favorite pastime and how so many Dominican-born players have come to dominate Major League Baseball. It doesn’t get any more American than that.Yes, it’s ridiculous I have to say this but Dominicans are also doctors, lawyers, teachers, and business owners who contribute to their communities ― including the bodegas owners who serve as anchors for their neighborhoods.Sen. Sessions impugned the value of every person emigrating from the Dominican Republic and dismissed whether they have any skills to contribute to this country.I was born in the Dominican Republic and came to the United States with my family when I was a year old. I became a U.S. citizen and no it was not part of an elaborate scheme. My mother showed me the value of a great education so I could make something of myself and give back to this country.I grew up in New York City in Washington Heights and Inwood, studied at Andover and George Washington University, where I came to believe that diversity makes us stronger and better as a society.Sen. Sessions has built a career refusing to share this belief.While Sen. Sessions might guffaw at my career in NBC News , MSNBC, the U.S. Treasury Department under President Obama, and my work today in the California State Senate, my desire to succeed and contribute to the future of this country should not be doubted.Now it is time for the U.S. Senate to get to work, especially Senator Chuck Schumer who represents the most Dominican-Americans in the country and will now lead the Democratic Caucus.Senator Schumer has an obligation to his constituents ― and all Americans ― to do everything possible to block Senator Sessions from being in charge of our civil rights.Justice must be blind and equal, yet Sen. Sessions has a history of prejudice and discrimination focused on color lines.The only thing he is blind to is the fact that diversity, tolerance, and inclusion of people of all walks of life are core American values, enshrined in our laws, and critical to our economic prosperity.With every choice for his cabinet Donald Trump has an opportunity to unite this country and assure all ethnic and religious minorities they will be included in our country’s social fabric.Instead, the president-elect is appointing people hell-bent on puncturing this fabric and seems more concerned about signaling to white nationalists this country only belongs to them.If Sen. Sessions was not confirmed to serve as a federal judge by a Republican Congress in the 1980’s because of his 19th century views on race, are Republicans today so emboldened by Trump’s awakening of bigotry to allow him to lead the Justice Department in the 21st century?While my former colleagues in journalism chase the latest Trump tweet, am I to believe Dominicans matter less than the many groups Sen. Sessions has disparaged before?And are senators really so concerned about being collegial to one of their own they would rather pass on restoring a sense of collegiality among ethnic groups in this nation?Every U.S. senator who voted in the general election with their moral conscience has to do the same with their vote to confirm the next U.S. attorney general.This is one of your only chances to make sure the American dream for so many citizens does not become a real-life nightmare."

Photo taken October 27, 2016.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58337fdc1700000805e7bb9e.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A historical and unprecedented gathering of many tribes to protect the water started in April 2016 at the Standing Rock Indian reservation in North Dakota, but the mainstream media has failed in covering it.Last night as I watched Facebook live feeds of water protectors enduring water cannon blasts in sub-degree temperatures, LRAD sound cannons, rubber bullets, pepper spray, mace, tear gas canisters and bean bag blasts. I couldn’t believe it wasn’t making headline news. After several hours national reports finally started appearing, but they were incorrect and one-sided.Morton County Sheriff spokesman Rob Keller told NBC that no water cannons were used and water was only deployed to put out fires set by water protectors. At the same time, I was watching it happen live. Where’s the responsible reporting? Where’s the responsible investigating? Where are the live video feeds showing the violence?And when the story does get reported in national media, it is unbelievably one-sided. Even this morning, NBC and CBS news shared short snippets of Morton County Sheriff’s department press release that stated, “They were using water cannons to put out fires that protestors started…” At the same time, the two stations were showing a short video of the water protectors being doused by a water cannon in sub-degree temperatures. Really? And there was no mention of the police brutality, no quotes or press releases from the water protectors.They are missing quite a remarkable story. This historic gathering started with a handful of youth and has grown to thousands of people from all over the world, coming in solidarity to protect the water. The Dakota Access Pipeline project plans to drill under the Missouri River, the lifeline for 18 million people who rely on it for their water. If completed, the Dakota Access Pipeline will transport 470,000 barrels of crude oil per day.So what’s historical about this event? Well, imagine the Democrats, Republicans, independents and liberals, putting their differences aside and standing unified in this decade for one cause? Probably not, right? But such solidarity is happening in Standing Rock.Thousands of Native Americans from different tribes have united in opposition of the pipeline. They are Navajo, Hopi, Apache, Lakota, Dakota, Comanche, Cherokee, Crow, Cree, Oglala Sioux, and Tlingit, just to name a few. They all have different cultures, beliefs, and religions. In fact, many of these tribes historically have been enemies for years.Added to their numbers in opposition are non-Native Americans and foreign indigenous people forming a global international gathering, a spiritual group of peaceful people. They call themselves water protectors, not protestors, because they are prayerful. The water protectors are attempting to restore and heal the balance of nature and man―for our future, survival and for all humanity.This once-in-a-lifetime gathering should be celebrated! But, it’s not.Last night, the water protectors clashed with militarized police and National Guard troops on the Highway 1806 Back Water Bridge north of the Oceti Sakowin camp. A press release by Standing Rock Medic & Healer Council stated, “…Approximately 300 injuries... At least 26 seriously injured people had to be evacuated by ambulance to 3 area hospitals... One elderly went into cardiac arrest at the bridge frontline, CPR was administered and he was revived. No fatalities have been reported…” Dallas Goldtooth, Indigenous Environmental Network, also has confirmed a water protector, Sophia Wilansky, sustained a critical injury last night and is now facing an amputation of her arm. Sophia was struck directly by a concussion grenade last night on the frontline.It’s unbelievable to think that in 2016, a virtual national media blackout has continued with occasional excerpts since April. Finally, when Sunday’s violence aired nationally, it wasn’t reported correctly ― just handled as an afterthought. If this type of violence and inhumane acts weren’t happening on United States soil, the United States might be the first to get involved to stop it. The national and international news media would be spinning stories of the inhumanity, showing the brutality, the hurt, the afflicted and the destruction, pulling at our heartstrings, so they could get our support and aid.I wonder whether there’s another reason for this injustice. Is it the influence of strong corporate backing for the $3.8 billion pipeline, or is it really the color of one’s skin? Do the research, seek the truth, and you will start feeling what I feel ― disgust."

A lifeline for millions, the railways suffer from chronic underinvestment, which has left it with aging tracks and outdated rolling stock.Rescue teams worked through the night with cranes and cutters to disentangle the train before police halted the search of the 14 carriages that derailed in the early hours while most passengers slept.“The rescue operations are over. We don’t expect to find any more bodies,” said Zaki Ahmed, the police inspector general in the city of Kanpur, about 65 km (40 miles) from Pukhrayan, the crash site.All of the carriages, some crumpled beyond recognition, have since been removed from the tracks.The crash came during India’s busy wedding season and media said blood-stained bags of saris and wedding cards carried by at least one wedding party on board were scattered beside the wreckage.The derailment injured close to 200 people, scores of them seriously, officials said. After the tragedy, relatives thronged hospitals in a search for survivors.A railways spokesman said the train carried 1,000 people traveling on reservations, but 700 more were estimated to have squeezed into the unreserved carriages.AGEING BADLYThe largely colonial-era railway system, the world’s fourth largest, carries a saturation-level total of about 23 million people daily. Aging badly, its average speeds top just 50 kph (30 mph) and train accidents are common.The crash is a stark reminder of the obstacles facing Prime Minister Narendra Modi in delivering on his promise to turn the railways into a more efficient, safer network befitting India’s economic power.Modi this year pledged record levels of investment and has announced a new high-speed line funded by Japan, but the main network has made little progress on upgrading tracks or signaling equipment.He has also shied away from raising the highly subsidized fares that leave the railways with next to nothing for investment. By some analysts’ estimates, they need 20 trillion rupees ($293.34 billion) of investment by 2020.Modi held a political rally on Sunday about 210 km (130 miles) from the crash site in Uttar Pradesh, which heads to the polls early next year in an election his Bharatiya Janata Party is vying to win.Mayawati, the state’s former chief minister who uses only one name and is a Modi critic, said the government should have “invested in mending tracks instead of spending billions and trillions of rupees on bullet trains,” media reported.Junior railway minister Manoj Sinha said a fractured track might have caused the train to roll off the rails on its journey between the central Indian city of Indore and the eastern city of Patna. The government has ordered an inquiry to determine the precise cause.Sunday’s crash is India’s worst rail tragedy since the collision of a passenger and a goods train in 2010, which the government blamed on sabotage by Maoist rebels.In 2005, a train was crushed by a rock and another plunged into a river, each disaster killing more than 100 people. In what was probably India’s worst rail disaster, a train fell into a river in the eastern state of Bihar of 1981, killing an estimated 500 to 800 people."

The decision (to run) for a fourth term is - after 11 years in office - anything but trivial,” Merkel told a news conference after a meeting of senior members of her conservative Christian Democrat (CDU) party convened to prepare for the election.Some 55 percent of Germans want Merkel, Germany’s eighth chancellor since World War Two, to serve a fourth term, with 39 percent against, an Emnid poll showed on Sunday, highlighting that despite setbacks, she is still an electoral asset.Merkel has steered Europe’s biggest economy through the financial crisis and euro zone debt crisis and has won respect internationally, for example with her efforts to help solve the conflict in Ukraine. U.S. President Barack Obama last week described her as an “outstanding” ally.With Trump’s victory in the United States and the rise in support for right-wing parties in several European states, some commentators see Merkel as a bastion of Western liberal values.“Angela Merkel is the answer to the populism of this time. She is, as it were, the anti-Trump,” party ally Stanislaw Tillich, premier of the state of Saxony, told the RND newspaper group, adding she stood for reliability and predictability.However, her decision last year to open Germany’s borders to around 900,000 migrants, mostly from war zones in the Middle East, angered many voters at home and dented her ratings.Her party has slumped in regional elections in the last year while support for the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) has swelled.In September, after a heavy defeat for the CDU in a Berlin state election, a humbled Merkel surprised the country by saying she wished she could turn the clock back on the migrant crisis, though she stopped short of saying her policy was a mistake.BIG TASKS AHEADIf re-elected, her responsibilities will range from helping lead talks with Britain on its withdrawal from the EU, soothing tense relations with Turkey, a crucial partner in the migrant crisis, and developing a relationship with Trump.Domestically, her biggest challenge will probably be managing the integration of refugees in an increasingly divided society and keeping Europe’s powerhouse economy on track.An Emnid poll on Sunday put Merkel’s conservative bloc down one point at 33 percent, nine points ahead of her nearest rivals, the Social Democrats (SPD), with whom she shares power.In a system where coalition governments are the norm, many pollsters see another ‘grand coalition’ as the most likely option after the election, although the rise of the AfD makes coalition arithmetic more complicated.The SPD has not decided whether its chairman Sigmar Gabriel, Vice Chancellor and Economy Minister, will run against Merkel.One of the SPD’s deputy leaders, Ralf Stegner, said it would be a mistake to underestimate Merkel but that the “myth of invincibility” was over.Merkel, who grew up in Communist East Germany, is a physicist who only became involved in politics after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. She is seen as a talented negotiator but has also shown a ruthless streak.A Protestant woman in a mainly Catholic and male-dominated party, at least when she became its leader in 2000, Merkel never built up a regional power base but over the years she has sidelined her main male rivals and has no obvious successor.She still requires the official backing of her Christian Social Union (CSU) allies in Bavaria, who have fiercely criticized her open-door migrant policy. CSU head Horst Seehofer welcomed her decision on Sunday.“We now want the trust of the population for another four years and therefore it is good that we have clarity,” he said.Germany has no limit on the number of terms a chancellor can serve. By standing again, Merkel, who said she wanted to serve the full fourth term, could end up matching the 16 years in office of her former mentor, Helmut Kohl.

An admirer of late British prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, he is a rare economic liberal in largely statist France.Fillon also received the support of Bruno Le Maire, seen as having come fourth or fifth in the vote.The most centrist of the seven contenders in the primaries, Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, who was fighting Le Maire for the fourth spot, threw her weight behind the 71-year-old Juppe.Socialist President Francois Hollande, who is deeply unpopular, has yet to announce whether he himself will stand again.With the Left very divided and a majority of voters seen in opinion polls to be opposed to seeing the far-right National Front in power, the chosen center-right nominee is likely to defeat party leader Marine Le Pen in an expected election run-off next May.But while polls have consistently shown Juppe would easily beat Le Pen, there have been no recent surveys on how Fillon would fare in such a match, in further evidence of how unexpected his top spot on Sunday was.Polls have shown that Fillon, who had received backing by opponents of France’s gay marriage laws, is much less popular than Juppe amid left-wing voters, which could make it harder for him to get their vote versus Le Pen.Until a week ago, Fillon, a social conservative with economically liberal ideas, trailed Juppe and Sarkozy badly in polls and had not been expected to go through to round 2 of the primaries.Juppe, a moderate conservative campaigning on an inclusive, “happy identity” platform, had for months been ahead in polls.But over the past week the contest has been transformed into a tight race between the three men.Sarkozy has sought to tap into populist sentiment while Fillon is proposing tough measures to shake up the economy."

The government has ordered an inquiry to determine the precise cause.Sunday’s crash is India’s worst rail tragedy since the collision of a passenger and a goods train in 2010, which the government blamed on sabotage by Maoist rebels.In 2005, a train was crushed by a rock and another plunged into a river, each disaster killing more than 100 people.

I heard a few boos. I wasn’t offended by what was said.”The hit show depicts the life of America’s first treasury secretary, Alexander Hamilton, through hip-hop and traditional Broadway numbers. Following the performance, the actor Brandon V. Dixon, who plays America’s third vice president, Aaron Burr, told the crowd that Pence was in the audience, thanked the Indiana governor for attending, and proceeded to implore the incoming 48th vice president to renounce his and his running mate’s often divisive rhetoric. The statement was written by the cast with input from the show’s creator, Lin-Manuel Miranda, and its producer, Jeffrey Seller, as reported by Broadway.com.“We, sir — we — are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights,” Dixon said. “We truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us.”Social media footage and audience accounts of Pence’s arrival in the theater back up the vice president-elect’s recollection that there was a mixture of applause and boos as he took his seat in the Richard Rodgers Theatre. Pence’s reply stood in sharp contrast to the alarmed tweets President-elect Donald Trump fired off about the matter, which not only misrepresented the tenor of Dixon’s remarks, but the audience’s behavior, too.“Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing,” Trump tweeted early Saturday morning. “This should not happen!”“The Theater must always be a safe and special place,” the president-elect tweeted in another post. “The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!”Trump renewed his attacks against the audience and cast members Saturday night, tweeting, then deleting, then reposting his displeasure with the incident and criticizing the show, which has received near-universal acclaim from critics. “The cast and producers of Hamilton, which I hear is highly overrated, should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior,” Trump tweeted. The “controversy” erupted at just the right time for Trump, who had suffered a major political setback on Friday when it was announced that he would pay out $25 million in a settlement of a group of civil lawsuits brought against him regarding his now-defunct Trump University. Trump had previously dismissed the lawsuits’ merits and vowed to never settle out of court. "

And his elevation comes as Trump’s own rise was spurred along in part by racism and anti-Semitism. That aspect of Trump’s success inspired hundreds of Jewish scholars to declare last week that “our reading of the past impels us to resist any attempts to place a vulnerable group in the crosshairs of nativist racism.” Schumer’s own knowledge of the past includes very personal reminders of what anti-Semitism has wrought. His grandfather came to the United States long before the Holocaust, but his great-grandmother stayed behind in Eastern Europe, and was there when Hitler’s forces arrived.“They gathered them all on a porch in the Ukraine,” Schumer recalled Friday during an interview with The Huffington Post. It was 1941 or 1942. “They said, ‘All come here.’ They said to my great-grandmother, ‘You all have to come with us.’ She said, ‘No, we’re not moving.’ They machine-gunned them all down, 17 or 18 of them, kids, old people, every one of them.”He has heard a Trump adviser speak approvingly of America’s imprisonment camps for Japanese-American citizens during the war.“It sends shivers down your spine,” Schumer said.He’s also well aware that the man Trump has named as his top White House counselor and political adviser is Steve Bannon, whose Breitbart News website was a virtual platform for white nationalists during the presidential campaign.“The bigotry — I mean, take Bannon. Breitbart News trafficked in bigotry almost every week, and it’s just appalling that this guy’s in a high-up position in the White House,” Schumer said.But he pointed to the strength of the American system as a reason that a racist, white nationalist government will not take hold.“Barack Obama talked to Trump, and said the presidency is sobering,” Schumer said. “Trump has an obligation — any time any bigotry comes out of anyone near him, including people he’s appointed — he’s got to condemn it strongly. We’ll see if he does.”Schumer agreed that Trump has not condemned the bigotry so far.“Nope,” he said, promising that he and Democrats would. “We will. We’ll be really strong on that stuff.”Children of Schumer’s era in his Brooklyn neighborhood — and many still today — are taught of the Holocaust and warned that it can happen again.“I have enough faith in the American structure, in the American people. As long as we’re strong and vigilant and not afraid, that it won’t happen here,” Schumer said.He said he believes he and Democrats can work with Trump without legitimizing the anti-Muslim, anti-Semitic, anti-LGBTQ, anti-woman bigotry displayed by Trump and so many of his supporters.“What you have to do is not, quote ‘compromise’ with him, but challenge him,” Schumer said. “He did make some promises we support. If he wants to call China a currency manipulator, which I’ve been asking for for five years, I’m not going to vote no because he’s calling for it.”The biggest area where Democrats are primed to work with Trump is on infrastructure, rebuilding America’s roads, bridges, airports and other vital systems. Schumer reaffirmed that intention to HuffPost, but insisted any agreement must include a massive program.“It’s got to be large and bold — a trillion dollars makes sense,” Schumer said. “It’s got to be real new expenditures. The idea you can do this with tax breaks, tax incentives isn’t going to get the job done. And, it cannot cut existing programs.”Schumer was not convinced Trump could come up with such a plan.“He won a lot of the blue-collar areas on a Democratic message on trade, on carried interest [tax breaks for hedge funds], on transportation, on infrastructure,” Schumer said. “Well, we’re going to challenge him. Break your promise to the blue-collar world, or work with us and split with the right, the Republican establishment, which hates these things.”While Trump’s tweet Sunday suggested he’s at least offering Schumer a chance to talk, it came with yet another reminder of the anti-Semitism simmering all around Trump.The president-elect appears to have first tweeted a misspelled version of Schumer’s name, and described the senator in a way that was favored by Hitler’s propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels, and is still used by anti-Semites today."

31,POLITICS,The Hubris Of The Clinton Ground Game,"Christian Parenti, ContributorAuthor, Tropic of Chaos: Climate Change and the New Geography ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-hubris-of-the-clinton-ground-game_us_5831cebce4b099512f835e78,"This piece was first published in Jacobin under the headline ‘Garbage In, Garbage Out.’ It is now becoming clear that Clinton’s",2016-11-20,"John Podesta, Campaign Chairman, and Robby Mook, Campaign Manager for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, inside the campaign headquarters, June 28, 2016 in Brooklyn, NY.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5831d2c01a00002500cc8dd9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This piece was first published in Jacobin under the headline ‘Garbage In, Garbage Out.’It is now becoming clear that Clinton’s ground game — the watchword for defenders of her alleged competence — was actually under-resourced and poorly executed. Like so much else in this election, her field strategy was hostage to the colossal arrogance and consequent incompetence of the liberal establishment.At the heart of the failure was the notion of the “new emerging majority.” According to this argument — pushed by, among others, John Judis and Ruy Teixeira — women, Latinos, blacks, and skilled professionals who support the Democrats were becoming the demographic majority. Thus the traditional white working-class base of the Democratic Party could be sidelined.Back in July Chuck Schumer summed it up: “For every blue-collar Democrat we lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia, and you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin.”From this theory and strategy flowed a deeply flawed set of tactics, and a badly fumbled get-out-the-vote (GOTV) effort.A labor organizer in Ohio, who wished to remain anonymous, reports that Clinton’s early GOTV effort there focused on Republicans in the mistaken belief a significant number of them could be peeled away. This play largely failed. And it also involved serious opportunity costs: traditional Democratic constituencies like African Americans and the white working class were neglected, and Clinton ended up badly under-performing Obama among both groups, especially in the Rust Belt.Only in the last two weeks, according to this labor source, did the Democratic Party outreach effort really switch back to traditional Democratic voters. By then, it was too late. Due to lack of preparation, the voter lists guiding the effort had not been updated. Because poorer voters tend to relocate more frequently than home-owning suburbanites, many addresses were wrong. And for lack of more frequent contact the campaign was often unsure about the voters’ current political attitudes.And when the campaign finally showed up in the African-American, Latino, and white working-class areas they got lots of “so you only come by once every four years?”A union staffer in Pittsburgh reports a similar pattern, saying that Clinton’s Brooklyn headquarters failed to invest in a locally generated plan to reach out to African Americans who lived in parts of Pennsylvania other than Pittsburgh and Philly. There are, of course, black communities all over the state. However, without money from the campaign this local effort struggled for lack of literature, vehicles, etc. And with no resources, enthusiasm faded.The same geographical tone deafness was seen in the campaign’s decision to place its Pittsburgh headquarters in an upscale part of town. At one point this fall, a group of immigration rights activists even staged a sit-in at the campaign office to protest their community’s marginalization within the effort.The Clinton campaign’s assumption seems to have been that actual people living on the ground in actual places knew less about the population around them than did the data-savvy professionals at campaign headquarters in Brooklyn.Another labor organizer lamented in an email about the awful campaign Hillary ran in the northern Midwest. When local leaders started to panic at the apparent traction Trump was gaining in these regions and urged the Clinton campaign to send the candidate into the Rust Belt, the geographic ulcer of corporate globalization, nothing happened. Clinton largely stayed away from the counties she lost; but Trump was all over them. Counties that Obama had carried four years ago experienced fifteen- to twenty-five-point swings in Trump’s favor.In Nevada, by contrast, where organized labor has Las Vegas on lockdown, high rates of union density and regular contact between unions and their members translated into a successful Democratic Party get-out-the-vote effort and a handy Clinton victory.Even Obama has taken a shot at the Clinton campaign ground game and its flawed “demographics as destiny” theory. At a press conference earlier this week, he said: “I won Iowa not because the demographics dictated it, but because I spent eighty-seven days going to every small town and fair and fish fry and VFW hall.”By mid-October, the bad news from the field had filtered up into some sections of the party leadership.South Carolina representative Jim Clyburn told the Daily Beast in an October 16 story: “I’ve seen some good GOTV plans. On paper they’re great. The question is what about implementation? It’s one thing to see what you need to do, it’s something else to execute.” He cited Colorado in particular.Similarly, G. K. Butterfield, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, worried out loud about the lack of campaign investment in African-American communities in his home state of North Carolina, which Obama lost by fourteen thousand votes in 2012.“I don’t know why we have been unsuccessful in being able to make the case for a significant investment in grassroots get out the vote,” Butterfield said. “On the Clinton side and on the DSCC side, I’ve been trying to get them to increase their commitment. They have made some investments, but it’s not enough.”Instead, the Clinton campaign went all in on TV ads. Meanwhile, field offices suffered. In 2012 the Obama campaign had 789 field offices; this time around, Clinton only had 489 nationwide.It gets worse. With too few people on the ground and the local knowledge of grassroots activists being shunned, the campaign apparently started feeding garbage to its computers and thus got garbage in return.The computer-obsessed Clinton campaign — having lost touch with people but not big data — seems to have inadvertently turned out Trump voters!Writing in The Huffington Post last week, Becky Bond and Zack Exley, both veterans of the Sanders campaign, noted: “Volunteers for the Clinton campaign in Pennsylvania, Ohio and North Carolina,” working from computer-generated lists, “have reported that when reminding people to vote, they encountered a significant number of Trump voters. Anecdotal evidence points to anywhere from 5 to 25 percent of contacts [being] inadvertently targeted to Trump supporters.”So much for those brainiac, glued-to-the-screen whiz kids. They lacked nouse, street smarts, soul, real-world experience, a grip on reality.As one union staffer told me: “What they seem to have missed is that the way to reach blacks, Latinos, and women is the same way you reach the white working class: progressive economics, and knock on their doors. And guess what? The allegedly ‘racist’ and ‘sexist’ white working class is cool with a multicultural coalition as long as you give them the progressive economics. On the other hand, it turns out that downplaying the progressive economics loses everyone except the skilled professionals.”Connected to the theory of the new emerging majority and its distorting effect on the GOTV effort was the recently revealed “Pied Piper” strategy, in which the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee deliberately sought to boost Trump’s profile. A memo attached to a hacked email from April 2015 cited Trump as a possible candidate who the Clinton campaign wanted the mainstream media to elevate, mistakenly believing he would be easy to beat.Few personify this arrogance-breeds-ignorance-breeds-incompetence concatenation better than John Podesta, chair of Clinton’s campaign. Podesta blames Russia for hacking his emails. That may or may not be what happened; the CIA, NSA, and Defense Intelligence Agency have not corroborated the claim.But what we do know, thanks to digital forensics of the hacked emails, is that Podesta clicked twice on a not-so-sophisticated fishing email asking for his password. We also know from the same emails that John Podesta lost his cellphone in a taxi on January 19, 2015; and that his password was “p@ssword.”With leadership like that, the rest makes sense.A point for the Left in all this: the DNC’s ideas are not only bad because they don’t advocate the social-democratic redistribution we would like to see — they are also bad because they don’t work at a purely technical level.Their arrogance and contempt for the working class produced a flawed political theory, which in turn produced a bad strategy, which in turn produced a tactically inept ground game.Too busy congratulating themselves and concurring with each other, the Clintonites couldn’t even get the rudiments of the campaign correct."

U.S. President-elect Donald J. Trump pictured with supporters </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5830bd421a00002200cc8d1b.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Raise your hand if your predicted Trump’s victory when he announced his candidacy. Almost no one believed you. The U.S. economy showed gains in several metrics used to judge its success—since Obama took office. Hillary would make that case, while adding the longer list of shared achievements in the last eight years. We admired Bernie, but his age and idealistic agenda reminded realists that a more visibly matured Obama struggled to push a comparatively moderate platform. So Hillary, the imperfect messenger of supported causes, would run against Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio and perhaps even struggle against John Kasich. People would believe that forecast—the popular expectation in June 2015.Trump bulldozed everything in his way to the Republican nomination. His approach gave us a tired list of adjectives used to describe him. By extension, and mistakenly, anyone counted as a Trump supporter suffered the demonizing condemnation of that label—with “angry” and “uneducated” being the least extreme label qualifiers. Without question, a number of his supporters embody the spirit of the demonizing adjectives: a list so constantly repeated you can recite five items now yourself—and off by heart.The list, however, creates a part of the problem. What about the other Trump supporters? Our ability to easily recite the list left us without any terms to describe middle-of-the-road people who found some valid ideas in Trump’s platform. Hold on, what valid ideas did Trump have? The automatic shutdown. So secret supporters held secret thoughts, with little intellectual curiosity and attention placed on their line of reasoning. Fearful of the label, they were left no real avenue to express their thoughts, except the ballot box, reversing the Bradley effect.If you didn’t know any lonely Trump supporters, like Troy, then Michael Moore criticizes your sense of “shock” over his victory, arguing you have lived in a bubble and did not pay enough attention to the other side. If you did know Troy existed, we often assumed what was important to him. The list. The disqualifiers. The liberal media, coworkers, and international actors kept harping on the disqualifiers. Despite Troy’s many endearing qualities, the disqualification strategy ignored the fact his own views on gender equality were also unfortunate. So while ethically valid, the disqualification approach often precluded any discovery of what actually mattered to Troy, or discussed the merits of his attraction. Mainstream media did not focus on such discovery, and even refused to pan cameras to show crowds in rallies, making the counter-active labeling of “dishonest media” an easy sell. Keeping the secret, to avoid the label, showed as much desire for our approval as it did our failure to master the art of disagreement—on topics that were “settled”.There will be a beautiful door—in the wall—for people to come in, legally! Most countries in the world have rapists, criminals and drug dealers. It’s not a uniquely Mexican affair. Supporters like Troy focused on the words “when Mexico sends its people, they are not sending their best”. For secret voters, his comments were about the “smart” government of Mexico, and an assertion they do not always police the boundaries for national convicts, rather than a sweeping definition of all neighbors south of the border. The politically correct class, however, developed “and some, I assume, are good people” into a notion that Trump was anti-Mexican—and every subsequent comment was read in light of that very first campaign speech.There are some bad hombresIs it racist for angels moms to explain that undocumented migrants killed family members in crimes, ranging from hit-and-runs to shoot-outs? Even if they acknowledged their experience was not a generalization. Yet angel moms were still largely dismissed. What did we think: Paid actors? Not progressive? Not smart enough to believe Hillary also cared about borders? U.S. citizens and documented migrants commit crimes too, so why was it taboo to include harder to trace migrants in our conversation? Or admit the more liberal “pathway to citizenship” for all might not correct the concerns of bereaved family member—among the hurting folk Kasich pointed out.They have to pay: NATO & AlliesSupporters like Troy had to watch this zero sum conversation. Phrased as two mutually exclusive options: “American allies need to invest more in their own defense spending, so that America can redirect the surplus its currently being relied on to provide” or “that reckless Trump position leaves allies vulnerable to attacks by shared enemy states. Or will make the U.S. a mercenary.” Yet Trump raising this idea, like much of his business-like a/b testing, might lead to a smart third option: Trump eventually maintaining the commitment to allies—and—allies paying their fair share, so finances could be diverted back to Troy’s family. Nothing encouraged Troy to think about the “and” — just the recklessness.He is treating me unfairlyJudge Curiel was truly American, using birth as the esteemed litmus test. Yet some dared to accept the human possibility that Curiel’s membership of La Raza Lawyers Association and mainstream interpretation of Trump’s comments about Mexico (the country of the couple who gave birth to him) could inform his broader views on Trump. While all of his affiliations are celebration worthy, Troy may not have accepted the politically correct notion that Curiel was a robot, averse to being offended. Immune from seeing Trump differently, and any other conclusion, was surely racist.Until we figure out what the hell is going onTrump declaring an offensive ban is of secondary importance if roughly 49% of the population actually supports the ban. We undermine the fact some Americans have not had the privilege of having Muslim friends, classmates, neighbors, colleagues and lovers. For those who have not, like Bob, a member of Troy’s coterie, the unfamiliarity gives rise to questions asked of many other unfamiliar minorities, which is not, should I be afraid (we generally know the answer to that) but am I allowed to be afraid? The ban came after an attack on U.S. homeland, amid mixed views on the “responsibility” of the Muslim community in denouncing and resisting terror attacks. Familiarity, migrants and homeland attacks did not come together for all voters in the way we assume it should for nuanced city people. By the way, if we don’t reach out to the unfamiliar, if we keep distance—are we better?Our jobs are fleeing the country, folks: The Rust BeltThe well-measured economic recovery under Obama, conceivably, did not extend to Troy. Keeping historical perspective of others left behind, Troy’s particular demographic lost jobs in the manufacturing sector. Troy made daily choices between paying for power supply or feeding his children. Add to that, the deliberate fantasy of a self-funding candidate, not beholden to lobbyists who help companies outsource jobs. My older brother forced me to concede that some people did not have the privilege of thinking about the negative messages a Trump presidency sends to the world. Troy cared more about voting for a well-identified solution to urgencies in his own world. Promises are just step one, yet Troy prioritized personal factors, relegating the factors itemized on the list—a distinction separating many Trump supporters from voters.Knock them the hell outMartha Raddatz. Second debate. One of the rare media voices who offered thoughts on why launching a surprise attack on ISIS might be a bad idea—in contrast to a detailed strategy that provides timelines ISIS could access. While Troy might concede Trump probably lacked any real plans, this approach could make sense to people like Troy when Trump did make a plan.I like veterans who weren’t captured, okay?Veterans in the U.S. are often overlooked, including those who are not captured. It’s wrong to insult McCain’s legacy, but a spotlight landed on less famous veterans Trump has raised money for—who returned safely and often suffer from neglect.I can tell you that – believe me!Psychologists call it cognitive fluency. Simple language. Brash delivery. Repetition to make sure it sticks. It connected. When you throw in the legendary mid-sentence digressions, we have to admit there was a comical element too. Crowds screamed the answers to his questions at rallies, finishing sentences for him. We all could. What was his plan for Obamacare? Hillary’s surface credentials exceeded the test for presidential timber. Most of us agree on that. Yet this was a season where being qualified counted for something, but connecting counted for everything.We’re going to win – like you won’t believe itThe bizarre split of the voting numbers show three progressively bitter truths. Hillary would have won in most other democracies. Second, swing state votes that were not cast or wasted on third party alternatives made this outcome possible. Third, uncommitted liberals failed Hillary (not vice-versa), by sitting it out on election night as prisoners of their expectations, concerned more about her past than the future they expect, and discounting the idea it was a future she would protect. Instead, their “message” only proves that no amount of protest, after the fact, matches the potential of a wasted vote. Actually, four, a minority with an agenda is more powerful than a majority with no agenda.Bind the wounds of divisionJon Stewart challenges the idea that anyone who voted for Trump must be defined by the worst of his rhetoric. We hate the idea, he says, of creating people as a monolith (Muslims or others). “They are individuals, it would be ignorance.” Yet it is easy to paint everyone who voted for Trump as a monolith. “They are individuals, it would be ignorance.”"

At the time, the media was reporting about Uganda as a place where LGBTQ people were being killed. It seemed to be a miserable place to live. Or even visit as a tourist.But knowing that foreign reporting can be extremely biased or subjective. With local media over exaggerating certain topics in the chase for attention. I always question stories like these, especially if they all of a sudden become a worldwide phenomenon. Often there’s more to it than what the media headlines are telling you, and very few reporters have any deeper knowledge of the subjects they’re reporting on.In 2011 I experienced this first hand as I was making my last film Zero Silence about the Arab spring. I had been filming in the Middle East since 2008, and all of a sudden I found myself on a plane together with other journalists from Sweden. 1 or 2 had experience from working in the Middle East. But the rest was going there for the first time to report on a global news story. Some went straight to the “ghetto” for some headline effective story, and then ended up in jail...But sure, Uganda is in many ways a horrible place to be gay or trans. With family and society discriminating and harassing. But these things are rarely as black and white as the media portray it to be.When I stepped off the plane in Entebbe, Uganda. I met up with Cleopatra Kambugu, Africa’s trans pioneer who I had been following with my camera for a couple of months. At the time the situation in Uganda seemed to be a matter of life and death. But moving in to live with Cleo and her boyfriend suggested something different.Maybe I was naive, but it didn’t feel like there was a threat. Cleo had been transitioning to a woman for a while, she was already on hormones. And at the time, people perceived her as any other woman. But going to places where she had been known as a man, that had to be done with caution.She knew what her limitations was, and had learned to live within them. At times, I’m sure it was depressing. But on a larger scale, I think that Cleo and other marginalized LGBTQ people focus on other things. Rather than dwelling on what she had little control over. Cleo had choosen to focus more on enjoying the life she had been given.She was, and still is a trans activist, much because of that, Cleo knew that as long as she didn’t show that she was trans. She could get some health care support. But most of the Ugandan trans population doesn’t know how that works. There is no support from the government. Which means that instead of fighting HIV, they help spreading the virus by by scaring LGBTQ people not to get health care.With rapidly growing HIV numbers, the LGBTQ population have been blamed for what in reality is a lack in sexual education, especially within the youth. It’s a taboo subject that is growing into a huge problem in Uganda.Although condom use continues to be a commonly practiced strategy to reduce the risk of HIV infection, its use declined substantially in Uganda between 2005 and 2011.Statistics from the 2014 UNAIDS Fast Track report, put condom use among people with multiple sexual partners at less than 30 percent. In the same report, condom use among sex workers was estimated to be between 30 to 50 percent and among men who have sex with men at less than 30 percent.On the first day I got there, we went to a meeting to celebrate the transgender day of remembrance. A memorial for friends and colleagues who have died, many by the HIV virus.First, Cleo held an inspiring speech to the group. To them, she’s like a mother, a role model that has been called Africa’s Caitlyn Jenner. But as darkness fell over Kampala, one after one they lit candles to celebrate the death of many friends fighting for trans rights. As they did, the seriousness came over the group. Laughter turned into sadness. I felt like a spoiled brat, having been able to fly out from Sweden to document this night.As soon as their prayer was over, someone started singing, and what once was a place filled with sadness, changed into joy and celebration. Moments like those are what I live for. I try to capture that in my films, to give other people a chance to experience places they might be too afraid or uncomfortable to put themselves in.It’s strange where the camera takes me. One day I can be on my farm, feeding my peacocks, the next I’m invited into private and deeply emotional space like this. I’m deeply honored to have the job I have as I documentary filmmaker. I just wished more people, Donald Trump maybe, could experience this instead of building walls to shield himself.Nobody who has stood side by side to Egyptian activists on Tahrir Square as a giant cloud of rocks where coming closer and closer. As time freezes, and you wonder if the rocks will kill you or the man or women next to you. No one, who has stood there, with women and kids as jet planes are buzzing over, not knowing if they will bomb the whole square. Nobody who’s experienced that will ever have such an outrageous idea as to register muslims. Did we not learn anything from Hitler? Coming to a place like that, I expected people to be on edge. But instead, Cleo and her boyfriend Nelson insisted that we would go out. First for some clubbing. To regular clubs like any other person. If you come from a western country, the media would have led you to believe that this would be impossible. But coming there, I realized it was rather the opposite. Many clubs where mixed. I went to one LGBTQ fashion party which was held at a regular open bar. Not once did it feel threatened, on the contrary, I've probably never felt safer.But then, a couple of months later, the ""kill-the-gays-bill"" was put into law in a Uganda. Leading to a situation that changed drastically for not only Cleo, but many other LGBTQ people. Many were forced to leave their homes. Cleo was one of them, who after being in hiding for more than a month, left the country in fear. Leaving her loving boyfriend and family behind. Not knowing when she would see them again.*The story of Cleopatra Kambugu is captured in the documentary The Pearl Of Africa. It's a love story beyond catchy headlines. The film is premiering in Amsterdam this week at the IDFA, the world’s most important documentary film festival. "
34,HEALTHY LIVING,How Reversing My Weight Loss Surgery Changed My Life,"Anastasia Garcia, ContributorFashion Photographer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-reversing-my-weight-loss-surgery-made-me-healthier_us_57f71167e4b090dec0e70e16,I first learned about bariatric (weight loss) surgery when I was 19.,2016-11-20,<p>An emotional me waiting to enter the operating room for my removal surgery.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5806b5bf1a00001c145ba548.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I wrote this post in September, months before the election results came in. I kept the post private while I seriously debated if I could share it. However, since the results of the election I’ve realized that keeping it private is not an option. We now have a president-elect that refers to women as “fat slobs.” This type of damaging and misogynistic rhetoric threatens to unravel years of progress in the body positive movement. This type of language reinforces the notion that girls are defined only by their looks and, by association, their weight. It tells our little girls “you are flawed” and “you are not valuable.” This rhetoric pushes to keep women and girls focused on superficial issues, which distract them from realizing their power. I’m sharing my story in hopes that others may realize we are not alone and that our magic supersedes our waistlines. I’ve struggled with my weight my entire life. I was 8 the first time I was called fat, 13 when I first tried dieting, and 19 when I made the decision to get weight loss surgery. Writing this, at 29, I can’t remember a single day I haven’t struggled with body image.I first learned about bariatric (weight loss) surgery when I was 19. It was the summer after my sophomore year of college when my mom mentioned surgery as a new trend in weight management. After some research, I learned about a minimally invasive surgical option called the Lap-Band. The Lap-Band is a silicone band that is wrapped around a patient’s stomach, separating it into two parts. The inside of the band is lined with inflatable pouches that are connected to a port placed underneath skin (in the abdomen). Saline can be injected into the port, filling the liner pouches with liquid, creating a smaller hole for the food to pass through.In my research, I learned that not everyone who seeks weight loss surgery is qualified. A patient must be a certain size and have a certain BMI to get medical approval. I remember my initial consultation, sitting anxiously as I wondered if I would qualify (read: was fat enough) for the procedure. To my delight, despite being on the low end and having no health issues, I did qualify. Doctors across the board agreed it would be a good idea, deeming the surgery a “preventative” measure. After that first conversation, I felt elated. I knew right away I would undergo this procedure and felt desperate to make it happen quickly. After a year of required nutritional and psychological counseling, in the summer of 2008 the day finally came, and I underwent surgery. I can clearly remember the overwhelming sense of relief I felt in the days following surgery. Despite the pain and difficulty eating, I felt that my battle with my body was coming to an end. It was a big step, and I couldn’t wait for it to change my life.So why, eight years later, did I choose to completely remove it?In short, weight loss surgery never helped me lose weight. After eight years living with the Lap-Band, I never grew accustomed to the side effects. When I ate, food would become lodged in my esophagus. During most meals I experienced pain, discomfort and the need to vomit for relief. The side effects weren’t biased and would occur during work meetings, client dinners and on the sets of photo shoots.After eight years of pain, vomiting, and trouble breathing, the choice to remove the band should have been easy. But it wasn’t. The truth was, I feared removing it. I feared it would make me a failure, and that without it I would spiral into uncontrolled weight gain. I worried that my freedom to eat meant I would lose control. I thought maybe the Lap-Band wasn’t helping me lose weight, but it was keeping me from gaining weight. Nothing scared me more than becoming larger than I already was.Everything changed one day on my way to work. With the Lap-Band, meals had to be eaten slowly. On any given morning, I would set aside 45 minutes to eat breakfast. I would take my time, chew slowly, and pause when I began to feel tightness in my stomach. On this particular morning, I was running late for an important meeting, and couldn’t risk it. I quickly ate my scrambled eggs and jumped into a cab. Before reaching the end of my block, I began to feel sick. The familiar pain of tightness at the base of my esophagus began to swell. I wanted the cab driver to pull over so I could relieve myself, but we were in three lanes of New York morning traffic. As if asking him to pull over wasn’t embarrassing enough, the hordes of pedestrians and people in their cars would surely see me puking out the side of the taxi.My face flushed; I began to feel panicked because I could no longer keep the food down. I felt it moving up and before I could stop, I vomited my entire breakfast into my closed mouth. I felt mortified and disgusted. I sat in silence for 10 minutes, cheeks full, carrying the former contents of my stomach inside my closed mouth. Finally we stopped at a red light on a quiet street. I threw the taxi door open releasing the vomit onto the road. I looked around to see if anyone was watching my disgusting display, only to see my driver looking back at me, shocked. Through the rear mirror in a thick Polish accent he asked:“Ma’am, are you okay?”“Yes, I’m fine. I’m pregnant, so sometimes I get morning sickness.”“Oh! I see. No problem, Miss.”I became good at lying. It was easier than having to explain the truth. The truth that, despite suffering these side effects daily, I never got comfortable revealing this much personal information – not with random taxi cab drivers, and especially not with first dates, colleagues, and clients on a daily basis. I never got comfortable excusing myself from lunch meetings to vomit ― or business dinners, or holiday meals with family. I became embarrassed being in social settings when asked, “Do you not like your food? Are you okay? Are you not hungry?” Over time, I began to avoid social events where I would have to eat in front of others.As open of a woman as I am, I simply did not want to reveal this truth to everyone.So, after eight years and one awful cab ride home, I scheduled my removal surgery. I took a leave of absence from my job and returned home to Florida where it began. A week before my removal surgery, I had a series of health screenings and pre-op appointments. While going to see the various specialists, something caught me by surprise. I was repeatedly asked the exact same question by multiple healthcare professionals.“So, we’re removing your Lap-Band, and what procedure are we doing instead?”“We’re not doing any other procedure; just removing my Lap-Band,” I would reply.After the fifth person inquired, their look of shock no longer surprised me. This line of questioning from the medical team implied the inquiry, “But you’re still fat ― what surgery are we going to use to fix that?” I didn’t need further reinforcement about the way others viewed my body but received it anyway.The morning of my removal surgery, I laid waiting on the hospital bed. I was plugged into machines with various fluids and medications being pumped into my body. I looked down at them and began to cry. This reality was so different from my day-to-day. This was not me. Had I hated myself so much that I believed this was the best choice? “This” not being the removal surgery, but the initial surgery and the eight years of suffering? Did I really let my misguided opinions of my body put me in a hospital bed? This was my first moment of heartbreaking clarity.The second came days after surgery, when I began to remove the bandages. My stomach was covered in five separate incisions. Looking at them made me feel anxious and upset. I didn’t remember feeling as horrified after my first surgery. I guess I was so desperate at the time that the means justified the end. But as I removed the bandages and saw my raw flesh held together by staples, I felt terrified and sad. Where along the line did things get so out of hand? Why had I felt that I needed surgery to feel in control?I began to remember some of the (many) hurtful things that have been said to me over the years...“Fat.”“We don’t carry that size.”“I would date you, but you have to lose weight.”“I’m just concerned about your health.”“You’re just big-boned.”“Plus-size.”“You’re unhealthy.”“Husky.”“I don’t usually like big girls, but you’re cute.”“Free Willy.”I began to think about why even people close to me, friends who “loved me,” could be so cruel. I spent weeks after surgery remembering all the hurtful things, all the backhanded compliments. I began to realize that in our country, we evangelize the idea that being “overweight” reflects a person’s lack of restraint. We think it’s a symptom of laziness and a lack of personal responsibility. We define success by numbers on a scale, and make those who are “overweight” feel flawed. We shame them. In fact, body-shaming is one of the few types of humiliation we still deem socially acceptable.The realization occurred that the problem was not my lack of control or even my weight. It was what everyone else thought about my weight and in turn what I was supposed to think about it. But what troubled me the most was how deeply and easily I subscribed to what others thought. I let some other entity, separate from myself, make decisions about my worth and the state of my health (which at 19 years old was pristine). Despite always being active and eating a reasonable diet, I believed that my very essence was flawed. I thought it was centered around self-control and believed that I lacked it. I thought weight loss surgery was the only way to gain that control. But it wasn’t. It was a road block put in place to remove control from my hands. And despite my ill-informed beliefs, control was something I always possessed... it was always mine.Post-surgery, I feel like a completely new person. The tension and tightness that once existed in my stomach is gone. There are really no words to describe the overwhelming sense of relief. I believed once I was thin I would love what I saw in the mirror, because I believed that my worth was defined by my appearance. And while I never had impactful weight loss from the Lap-Band, when I look in the mirror I’m overwhelmed with a sense of love and respect. I love what I see, because I recognize that my body is beautiful. My body is beautiful in any shape, and at any size. I’ve learned to trust myself. And once I made the decision to trust myself... I became free. Free to pursue health and body image on my own terms. And when you write the terms, anything is possible."

They made their way to jobs in the U.S. Canal Zone in Panama, though because of their race and status they had to live outside the zone in Panama proper. “It was like the old segregated South,” Sherrilyn Ifill, one of the descendants of those pioneers, told me Saturday. “It may as well have been Alabama.”With the men working on the canal and the women working as domestics, they made the money and got the papers to come to America.Two young brothers of those founders became ministers in the African Methodist Episcopal Church, traveling from post to post in New York and elsewhere in their new country.One of the brother’s daughters, Sherrilyn, attended Vassar College and NYU Law School and is now the president of the prestigious NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund ― the organization Thurgood Marshall ran when he won the Brown v. Board of Education lawsuit.One of the other brother’s daughters was Gwen Ifill, the trailblazing and widely respected print and television journalist who died last Monday of endometrial cancer at the age of 61 in Washington.A celebration of her life at the historic Metropolitan AME Church in downtown Washington on Saturday was a moving personal and religious ceremony, full of lilting gospel music, strong preaching and a stately rendition of Ifill’s favorite, the “Hallelujah Chorus.”Tears flowed, shouts rang out, and family and friends embraced as if their lives depended on it. It was an intensely personal three hours for the thousand or so of all hues and heritages gathered in a church famous for past congregants such as Frederick Douglass and beloved for its good works. But intentionally or not, the event was something more: It was a revival meeting for America, a celebration of that which is so positive, so nourishing and so indispensable about the country’s growing diversity that it renews our faith in our common destiny.Speaking from the pulpit about her family and her cousin, Sherrilyn explained her family’s patriotic faith ― that, “with all its flaws, they believe in America,” including the opportunities for education it provided. Neither they nor Gwen, in her long career at great newspapers and TV networks, ever “gave up on the project of America.”The fathers and mothers taught the children to always respect the opinions of others, and to realize that “there is no weakness in listening.”Gwen Ifill was an excellent interviewer because she was an even better listener.

Her incandescent smile and calm, equable demeanor hid a fierce impatience with superficiality, cant and people too cunning by half.Her family’s peripatetic lives, moving from place to place for her father’s ministry in small towns in Pennsylvania and elsewhere, gave her a ground-level feel for the country and its glorious, maddening variety.“She was the most American of success stories,” said Sherrilyn. “Her life and work made all of our lives better.”The crowd and the messages read out loud were a testament to her reach and her grace: first lady Michelle Obama and former Attorney General Eric Holder were in the pews; House Speaker Paul Ryan sent condolences; Holder read a letter from President Barack Obama.Holder recalled that Ifill ― though a friend and fellow descendant of Barbadian immigrants whom he called “cuz” ― hit him with tough questions in interviews. He challenged the many journalists in attendance to follow her example in the years to come.“Will you cower?” he asked, beseeching the reporters not to sacrifice the search for the truth to the false god of “access maintenance.” That brought knowing applause from the savvy D.C. crowd and sheepish nods from the famous reporters in the church.The undergirding ― and uplifting ― message to the crowd was one of unity: brought together by one woman, but unified in a faith that, as former President Bill Clinton said, there is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America.Ifill’s life and work is a testament to that faith, and after hearing about both, the congregation rose as one as AME Bishop William P. Deveaux Sr. led them in the hymn “It Is Well With My Soul.”Everyone sang loudly and with a feeling of hope ― for Gwen, for each other, and for America."

She is great. Taylor Swift is great. We are all great people. We are all people. But sometimes we be playing the politics too much and forgetting who we are just to win. F**k winning. F**k looking cool. F**k being cool,” he continued.He then went on to call out Beyoncé’s husband, rapper Jay Z, for supposedly not calling him. The crowd expressed its anger with boos and jeers after he then stormed off the stage. In one video, people are heard shouting, “F**k you, Kanye!”Others expressed their outrage on social media.Concertgoer Christian Krebs of Sacramento was among those who were left slack-jawed by Kanye’s performance, or lack thereof.“I spent $250,” he told the Sacramento Bee. “I might be a fan of his music, but I’m not a fan of his character.”Keith Jougenatos echoed that sentiment.“I’ve been a fan since 2004 and all we get is two songs?” he fumed to the paper. “I’m done being a fan.”By Sunday afternoon, the hashtag “KanyeIsOverParty” was trending on Twitter. A full transcript of Kanye’s rant can be seen at Fader.com.Last month, Kanye went on a similar tirade during a concert in Seattle. There, he chewed out Jay Z for not visiting him after his wife, Kim Kardashian, was robbed in Paris. Ironically, he was upset that Jay Z only called him to ask how he was doing."

The decision comes after Sabra’s manufacturing facility tested positive for the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes, which can cause a serious and potentially deadly infection, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said in a release. (Sabra, headquartered in White Plains, New York, has factories in Virginia, California and New York.)The affected products were made prior to Nov. 8, and have a “best before” date up to and including Jan. 23, 2017. This date can be found on the lid of each package. The recall does not affect Sabra Organic Hummus and Sabra Guacamole, Sabra Salsa or Sabra Greek Yogurt Dips, according to the FDA.The full list of recalled products can be seen on the FDA website.Though none of the products tested positive for contamination, the company said it was issuing the recall “out of an abundance of caution.” Anyone who has a product affected by the recall can contact the company through its website to receive replacement coupons.Sabra issued a similar recall a year and a half ago. In April 2015, 30,000 cases of its classic hummus were recalled nationwide over possible listeria contamination after a store-bought Sabra hummus product tested positive for the bacterium.Listeriosis, the disease that results from listeria infection, can be especially harmful to older adults, pregnant women, newborns and people with weakened immune systems, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Symptoms can include fever, muscle aches, diarrhea or other gastrointestinal systems. “Almost everyone who is diagnosed with listeriosis has ‘invasive’ infection, in which the bacteria spread beyond the gastrointestinal tract,” the CDC says."

And there are some people that have to be prevented from coming into this country,” Priebus continued. “[President-elect Trump’s] position is consistent with bills in the House and the Senate that say the following: If you want to come from a place or an area around the world that harbors and trains terrorists, we have to temporarily suspend that operation until a better vetting system is put in place.”Priebus also said Sunday that there were elements of Islam that he found “problematic.”“Clearly there are some aspects of that faith that are problematic and we know them; we’ve seen it,” he said on ABC’s “This Week.”“It certainly isn’t a blanket for all people of that faith, but Mike Flynn is one of the most highly respected intelligence officers in America. Certainly no one can deny that.”Flynn, whom Trump has tapped to serve as his national security advisor, has made a number of anti-Muslim statements, including one on Twitter this February in which he stated “Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL.”Priebus’ posturing is, indeed, in line with president-elect Donald Trump and his transition team, who have sought ways to limit Muslim immigration to the United States without explicitly forbidding their entrance into the country.Trump said this summer that he hopes to “suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time it’s proven that vetting mechanisms have been put in place.” That position constituted a softening of Trump’s original statement, in which he called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on.”Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who has been advising the president-elect on such matters, has been preparing a proposal to implement a geographically targeted ban. “Trump and the Department of Homeland Security hit the ground running,” Kobach told The Huffington Post.As HuffPost’s Amanda Terkel reported, Kobach previously worked on the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System while serving in President George W. Bush’s administration. That program sought to track male foreigners 16 and over in the U.S. who hailed from a specific set of majority-Muslim countries. That program was deemed a failure and ultimately shut down.This article has been updated to include Priebus’ comments on “This Week.”Huffington Post reporter Eliot Nelson’s book, The Beltway Bible: A Totally Serious A-Z Guide to Our No-Good, Corrupt, Incompetent, Terrible, Depressing and Sometimes Hilarious Government, is out now."

I would NEVER have figured that out on my own.Thank you, my overlords at Facebook , Google,  Fox News and the New York Times. Thank you for warning me about websites that don't tell the truth. Have you looked in the mirror lately?Fake news sites are not the problem. Real news sites that lie to advance their own agendas are the problem.You may recall the Associated Press (AP) announced Hillary won the California primary the night before the election. Was it to sabotage Bernie Sanders' chance to make a strong showing? If so, that's an agenda-driven lie.The New York Times, purveyor of lies that drew the nation into an interminable war in Iraq, and then Afghanistan and Syria, leading to the deaths or tens of thousands of Americans, hundreds of thousands of olive-skinned people and the expenditure of trillions of George Washingtons. That's an agenda-driven lie.Fox News is the new alt-wrong clearinghouse for conspiracy nuts hoping to pull the Trump Cabinet of Dr. Caligari from the Twilight Zone of Insanity into the traditional right-wing realm of the End Times. Fox News seems to have a longstanding problem with the truth. Fox News anchor apologizes for false report of 'likely' Clinton indictment.Thanks for telling us we can believe you but not newsnewsnewsnewsnews.org . Its clear the major news media knows what fake news is, since they have a lot of experience publishing it.There is no truth when 76% of what your President Elect says is a lie and a compliant media doesn't call him out on it.Every article about the Trump campaign contained fake news.Yet the media reported it as truth under the guise of ""Trump said it; we're just reporting that."" But their reporting was based on a lie. Encouraged by Democrats (and not reported to the public but for a criminal hack), the media treated political neophyte Trump as a serious candidate;when he was really just a Purveyor of Fine White Whine.Wolf Blitzer should be cast in a new version of Jean-Paul Sartre's existentialist play ""No Exit"" and be forced to watch reruns of his daily, endless, breathless reports about Hillary's emails, as if they were news. That is hell. Let NBC's Matt Lauer drive the bus carrying minorities to the border. Maybe Donald Trump will be there to grab those two pussies.The Truth About Fake NewsWhat makes me qualified to write about fake news? I write it, and I've been the subject of it. One of my recent articles was declared false by none other than the experts at snopes.com. For a political satirist, being tagged FALSE by Snopes is a badge of honor.FALSE: Supreme Court Confirms 20-Year Prison Sentence For Ex-VP Dick CheneyIt's amazing to me that enough people wondered whether that was true to cause snopes.com to take notice. What isn't amazing to me is that Bush and Cheney were not prosecuted. They could have plea-bargained it down to ""not wearing a seat belt"", I'd have been happy. I'd have even paid their $20 fines. Just so this country goes on record standing up for truth or justice or Pokemon Go, I really don't care. Just so it stands for something. The Smurf way of life. Anything.How can fake news be a problem in a land where most people believe a burning bush spoke the word of God? Science tells you most brooks need to study for 100 years before they can babble. If I was a burning bush, I wouldn't be speaking in tongues about God, I'd be yelling: ""Water! Put this goddamned fire out!"" See, the problem isn't The Onion, Andy Borowitz or the Goodyear Satire Co. The problem is the government. We rely on our government of the people, for the people and by the people and expect them to not lie to the people.We have a government that looks the other way when Russians hack one political party and not the other, and an FBI whose director verbally gang rapes that party's female candidate for the Presidency. The good news is: before long, we will all have dual Russian-American citizenship. When did Vladimir Putin become our BFF?We have a government that uses irony to fill high office. There'll be a climate change denier in charge of the EPA. We could have Mitt Romney as Secretary of Labor. He knows all about American jobs. He's shipped tens of thousands of them to China. And President-Elect Trump has narrowed his finalists for Secretary of Defense to three men. Larry has better foreign policy experience and Curly has the longest fingers but Moe is the quickest to put up his hand to block.The problem is we have a government at war with its citizens and nobody in the mainstream media is calling them out on it. So ""fake"" news sites have to do it for them.What have we wrought? Parallel Universes of Facts.There's a conservative universe that has no climate change, no evolution and the world is 5000 years old. (That's 35,000 dog years.). Believers in these facts read The Crusader or the Washington Times and believe everything they read.And there's a parallel universe where evolution controls the destiny of species in a world that's 4.543 billion years old (the same in dog years), where fossil fuels are warming the Earth to such an extent that we'll have to shuck this mortal orb within 1000 years, and where the FBI investigates and, if there's no prosecutable crime, honors the presumption of innocence and lets it go. Believers in these facts read the Washington Post, the New York Times and tea leaves at Starbucks.It's just like there are dog people and there are cat people.So mainstream media: clean up your act and stop your moralizing. Government: you work for us. Get your thumb off the scale of justice. And citizen journalists will do our best to keep you honest-ish.We're smart enough to choose our own news without your lying help.IMAGE:Social Media Opens Doors For Meeting New People (public domain) via Wikimedia Commons MORE SATIRE BY GOODYEAR SATIRE CO.

Her defenders, including U.S. President Barack Obama, contended that no harm to the U.S. had resulted from her actions and that the FBI had exonerated Clinton when FBI Director James Comey announced on July 5, 2016, that they were ending their probe of Clinton's email practices and not recommending her prosecution. Since the standard of culpability regarding the mishandling of classified information is so broad and does not require intent, Clinton's critics were quick to argue that the Obama Administration had covered up her misdeeds. Adding fuel to these claims was the fact that Bill Clinton had spoken to Attorney General Loretta Lynch, in what was supposed to be a secret meeting, on a tarmac in Phoenix on June 27.During the campaign, Republican nominee Donald Trump continued to charge that Clinton's misdeeds had been covered up-usually to chants from his supporters of ""lock her up."" James Comey's letter to Congress on October 28, just 11 days before the election, that they were reopening the investigation because of the discovery of 650,000 emails from an unrelated investigation, and the subsequent announcement on November 6, that the FBI's review of those email had not ""altered their previous conclusion,"" was criticized by Clinton's supporters as an unprecedented interference by the FBI in an election and was blamed for Clinton's subsequent loss.The issue of a pardon didn't specifically come up during the election, although it was always hanging in the background. At the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Dinner in New York on October 20, Donald Trump joked that Hillary Clinton had accidently bumped into him and said pardon me, to which Trump claimed he replied. ""I'll think about it."" It was widely speculated, however, that regardless of the outcome, President Obama would pardon Clinton to protect her from Congressional investigations or Justice Department prosecution. American presidents have broad powers under Article 2 Section 2 of the Constitution to issue pardons. The Supreme Court has ruled that these powers are far ranging and include commutation of sentences and restoration of fines and forfeitures. Around 20,000 presidential pardons were issued in the 20th century. Franklin Delano Roosevelt is the all-time leader, with 3,687 pardons over a 12-year period. By comparison George H. W. Bush pardoned 75 individuals, Bill Clinton issued 456 pardons, including 140 on his last day in office, which included one for fugitive financier Mark Rich. George W. Bush issued 176 pardons. To date Barack Obama has issued less than a hundred pardons, although more are presumably coming before he leaves office.Pardoning Hillary Clinton poses both political and legal issues for either president, both current and incoming. Further investigations of Hillary Clinton by a Republican Congress, and what will soon be a Republican Justice Department, will become little more than a proxy for refighting the 2016 election. Such actions would be divisive and only serve to continue the bitter divisions and rhetoric that characterized the election. On the other hand, the fact that other people who have mishandled classified information, in most cases involving a fraction of the instances of Hillary Clinton's mishandling, have been severely punished, only adds to the charges that the Clinton's play by a separate set of rules and are treated as being above the law.From a legal standpoint, the president has broad authority to pardon Hillary Clinton even though she has not been formally charged with any crime. Gerald Ford famously pardoned Richard Nixon after he resigned although no formal charges had yet been brought against him and Congress had not yet voted to impeach him. Moreover, there is precedent for not only pardoning Hillary Clinton, but also all of those in her retinue who could be similarly charged. George H.W. Bush pardoned 6 people who had been implicated in the Iran-Contra case.Secretary of State Hillary Clinton meeting with Qatar Emir Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, a Clinton Foundation donor, September 9, 2010The real problem is the Clinton Foundation. The Foundation is under investigation by the FBI. Congressional inquiries on the function of the foundation, and whether it engaged in so called ""pay-to-play"" transactions in which donors to the foundation received preferential access to Hillary Clinton's state Department, are pending. Moreover, its critics charge, the fact that the Foundation allegedly spent less than six percent of its budget on charitable giving, while spending lavishly on travel and entertainment, suggests that the Foundation is little more than a Clinton piggy bank. Its defenders on the other hand, have argued that the Foundation's ""unconventional approach"" and direct programs understate its actual charitible giving. The Wikileaks disclosure that the Foundation may have paid for all or a portion of Chelsea Clinton's three-million-dollar wedding, however, adds fuel to the charge that the Clinton Foundation is a sham. Indeed, critics have charged that the Foundation could constitute a criminal conspiracy under U.S. laws.The issue of Hillary Clinton's possible culpability can't be settled by a presidential pardon unless there is also a resolution of the future status of the Clinton Foundation. Presidents can issue pardons for past misdeed, proven or alleged, but they cannot issue a ""Get Out of Jail Free Card"" for future misdeeds. Given that the operations of the Clinton Foundation have been so controversial, it's hard to see how the Foundation can go on under Clinton stewardship and control. A blanket deal where the President, whomever that is, issues a broad pardon not only to the Clintons but all their associates in return for shutting down the Clinton Foundation would probably be acceptable to the Clinton's critics, even if that pardon means that Hillary Clinton avoids further prosecution. The funds in the foundation would be forfeited to the government as part of an overall pardon deal. Whether the Clinton's would agree to such an arrangement is unknown. But that is probably the only way to resolve this issue definitively.Barring a deal the Clinton's will just fade away into obscurity, sort of, and continue to fight a protracted rear-guard action against the inevitable investigations that will come from Capitol Hill and the Trump Justice Department. The Clinton's are fighters and they will defend the Foundation and its ill-gotten wealth to the bitter end. In the meantime, the Clintons can still make money preaching to the liberal choir, although Bill Clinton can probably forget those million-dollar speaking fees for his musings about the state of the world. With Hillary Clinton out of office and no prospects of ever having another one (notwithstanding rumors that Hillary may run for mayor of New York), the Clinton Foundation can forget about receiving any more fat foreign donations. The problem with qui pro quos is that you need a quid to deliver a pro. None is available now, at least not till Chelsea Clinton runs for Congress. Sorry America, the Clintons are not finished with you yet. Maybe the next generation of Clintons will be better than the last-they certainly can't be any worse."

45,POLITICS,Consumer Watchdog Runs Against The Clock To Save Itself From Donald Trump,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cfpb-appeal_us_582f7a42e4b058ce7aab2340,The incoming administration is already brainstorming how to kill off the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.,2016-11-19,"Richard Cordray, who leads the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, could soon be fired by Donald Trump if an importnat ruling is allowed to stand.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582f88ac1a00002400cc8bf9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A week ahead of the deadline, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Friday appealed a court ruling that could leave the independent watchdog vulnerable to the whims of President-elect Donald Trump.The financial agency had until next Friday to contest an October decision that essentially left its director, Richard Cordray, at the mercy of the president. As written, the law that created the bureau largely insulates its director from the White House.But Trump’s transition team has already threatened do “dismantle” the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act ― enacted in the wake of the Wall Street financial crisis to protect consumers from abusive financial practices.The CFPB, championed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), also is in the crosshairs of Senate Republicans, who are seizing on Trump’s victory to drain the agency of funding and curtail its authority. Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) told The Huffington Post this week he wouldn’t mind seeing the CFPB completely eliminated.Warren, for her part, is sounding the alarm about GOP plans to defang the agency.In the appeal filed Friday, the CFPB asked the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in Washington to set aside its earlier ruling that found the bureau’s single-director structure unconstitutional. That decision was rendered by a three-judge panel that partly split 2-to-1.Lawyers for the agency called that ruling “dramatic and unprecedented,” and urged the D.C. Circuit to vacate it because it misinterpreted Supreme Court precedent on the power of Congress to set up independent agencies. The lawyers said the case “may be the most important separation-of-powers case in a generation.”If a majority of the active judges on the D.C. Circuit agrees to rehear the case ― Chief Judge Merrick Garland has recused himself during the pendency of his Supreme Court nomination ― the October ruling would be null and the CFPB and consumer advocates would score an early win.A chorus of civil rights, financial reform and legal advocacy organizations praised the CFPB’s decision to appeal ― and Cordray for his leadership since taking office.“Director Cordray has led the Bureau with a steady hand and worked tirelessly with his staff to return billions of dollars back to hardworking people across the country harmed by abusive financial practices,” Mike Calhoun of the Center for Responsible Lending said in a statement.Perhaps the highest-profile enforcement action by the CFPB in recent memory was its record-setting $100 million fine against Wells Fargo for creating hundreds of thousands of scam accounts for unsuspecting customers. The bank had to pony up an additional $85 million in related sanctions.“Today’s action should serve notice to the entire industry that financial incentive programs, if not monitored carefully, carry serious risks that can have serious legal consequences,” Cordray said in a statement at the time.Trump’s transition team is reportedly brainstorming Cordray’s replacement.Deepak Gupta, a consumer rights lawyer who formerly worked at the CFPB, told Reuters last week that the bureau’s strong work has exposed it to wrath from conservatives.“It’s a very fragile thing,” Gupta said. “It was birthed in controversy and is under constant attack. It may not survive the way we know it through this administration.”"

In a letter signed by representatives from Reconstructionist and Reform Jewish traditions, as well as the evangelical, Catholic, Baptist, Lutheran, Presbyterian and other Christian traditions, the leaders said they wanted to see Trump live up to his promise to be a president for all Americans. “We, the religious institutions of this great nation, stand shoulder to shoulder with each other in support of our Muslim brothers and sisters,” the leaders said in the letter. “No one should fear for their own safety in this country because of how they dress, how they pray or how recently they arrived.""In the days since Trump’s election, many American Muslims have watched with trepidation as the president-elect tapped members for his new administration who have professed negative and dangerous attitudes about Islam ― from potential attorney general Sen.

These incidents are hitting not only colleges and universities, but high schools, middle schools and even a handful of elementary schools.The Huffington Post has recorded dozens of reported incidents of racist vandalism and bullying in U.S. schools since the election ― and they began almost immediately.On Wednesday, Nov. 9, Muslim students at New York University found “Trump!” scrawled in graffiti outside their prayer room at NYU’s Tandon School of Engineering in Downtown Brooklyn.“We awoke on November 9th to a chilling wakeup call,” the school’s Muslim Students Association page wrote on Facebook. “And as we open our eyes and start to move and organize in the face of these new realities, we ask for your support.”The school was hit again roughly a week later. On Thursday, residents of NYU’s Gramercy Green dorm hall awoke to find sticky notes covering their door with images of swastikas and messages like, “White Pride,” and “Made America White Again.”Gramercy resident hall director Will McGrath sent out an email to the residential community on Thursday expressing his distress. In the letter, which The Huffington Post attained, McGrath wrote:“These acts are vile, offensive, and unacceptable, to say nothing of cowardly. We view these matters with the utmost seriousness, and will not tolerate such intimidating, bigoted behavior here in Gramercy or anywhere else at New York University.”Reported incidents of swastika graffiti have affected all levels of educational institutions. Middle schools in Florida and Maryland reported swastika graffiti found in boys’ bathrooms. A kindergartener at the Imagine School in Palm Coast, Florida came home with a swastika drawn on his hand and told his grandmother that an older student had forcibly drawn it on him during their after school bus ride.“This incident is not consistent with our expectations of respect, tolerance, and civility toward all students,” the school’s principal James Menerd said in a statement to local news. “We take this seriously.”At Paul D. Schreiber High School in Port Washington, New York, students encountered the anti-Semitic symbol in a boys bathroom Thursday morning. The Port Washington Union Free School District confirmed to local press on Friday that it is investigating the incident.“This type of behavior is completely unacceptable, does not represent who we are as a school district or a community, and will not be tolerated,” district superintendent Kathleen A. Mooney said in a statement.Racist incidents and anti-Semitic graffiti have been reported most at colleges and universities around the country, including in traditionally liberal enclaves like Portland, Oregon and Washington, DC.At American University in Washington, a classroom whiteboard was reportedly marked with a swastika and the phrase “Go Trump” just days after the election. Students at Reed College in Portland also found swastika symbols and racist messages like “The white man is back in power” drawn on school bathrooms. The New School in New York City, the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, the University of Vermont, and the University of Mississippi are just a handful of other schools that have reported swastika symbols and other acts of vandalism since the election.Schools have also been hit by overtly anti-Black and anti-immigrant vandalism and bullying in the days since the election. And beyond schools, there have been countless acts of hate reported at houses of worship, on public transit and in public places around the country.The Southern Poverty Law Center recorded 437 reports of hateful intimidation and harassment between Wednesday, Nov. 9 and the morning of Nov. 14. Sadly, many more have been reported in the days since.Reported acts of hate in U.S. schools are frightening but by no means representative of how most young Americans have engaged in this year’s election. Fifty-five percent of millennial voters cast their ballot for Hillary Clinton, with a sizable percentage opting for third-party candidates. Just 37 percent voted for Donald Trump, the candidate many felt peddled racism, anti-Semitism and bigotry throughout his campaign.Students across the country have also participated in school walk outs, protesting Trump’s win and calling for an end to bigotry.Samuel Kebede, a senior at Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring, Maryland, told CNN on Tuesday that he blamed Trump’s campaign for stoking racism and opening wounds “that have not healed yet.”“That is why I protest,” Kebede said, “to let him know that even though he has become our future president, the bigotry and hatred will not be tolerated.” Have you been a victim of an act of harassment or discrimination?

Mitt Romney (R) emerged after an hour and 23 minutes inside the clubhouse at Trump’s New Jersey golf resort ― a meeting reportedly to discuss his potential appointment as secretary of state, the most prestigious Cabinet post in an administration.Romney gave a brief statement to the waiting media but took no questions as he walked over to the white Buick SUV that he had arrived in, climbed inside, and rode off.“We had a far-reaching conversation with regards to the various theaters in the world where there are interests of the United States of real significance. We discussed those areas, and exchanged our views on those topics ― a very thorough and in-depth discussion in the time we had,” Romney said. “And I appreciate the chance to speak with the president-elect and I look forward to the coming administration and the things that it’s going to be doing.”Among the questions Romney did not answer: Would he take a job in the Trump administration if it were offered? Did he still believe Trump is a con man? Did he apologize at all for his harsh criticism of Trump in the months before the election?For his part, Trump said only that the meeting had gone well. “It went great,” he shouted, cupping his hands to his mouth and waving before walking back into the clubhouse.Romney was among Trump’s harshest Republican critics toward the end of the primary campaign. He gave a speech on March 3 in Salt Lake City specifically to criticize Trump’s qualifications and persuade GOP voters to consolidate behind one of his remaining rivals.“Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University. He’s playing the members of the American public for suckers. He gets a free ride to the White House, and all we get is a lousy hat,” Romney said in the speech. “He has neither the temperament nor the judgement to be president.”Trump had long criticized Romney for losing his 2012 presidential run against Barack Obama. He stepped up those attacks in his subsequent campaign appearances, calling Romney a “choke artist” and “irrelevant” hours after the Salt Lake City speech.“He was begging for my endorsement,” Trump told rally goers in Maine. “I could’ve said, ‘Mitt, drop to your knees,’ and he would’ve dropped to his knees. He was begging. True. True. He was begging me.”"

Trump!”The man was arrested, but he continued making racist comments about Adem in the back of the police car. “When I heard that Trump word, I knew this was something different,” Adem said, according to an article on the incident in the local Michigan press.“I understand there’s a few people that have been brainwashed with hate speech,” he said. “And I’m not labeling everyone like this guy, but there are some out there.”In an interview with “60 Minutes” after the election, Trump was asked about the surge in hate crimes. “I am so saddened to hear that,” he told CBS journalist Lesley Stahl. “And I say, ‘Stop it.’ If it ― if it helps, I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: ‘Stop it.’”The admonition was applauded, though some said it felt a bit like like Trump sounded as if he were chastising unruly children rather than condemning serious acts of violence. Either way, the attacks have not stopped. Now, nearly two weeks after the election, The Southern Poverty Law Center, the American Federation of Teachers and The Huffington Post are joining together to create a petition calling on Trump to make stopping the violence one of his highest priorities.“We ask that you keep your promise by loudly, forcefully, unequivocally and consistently denouncing these acts and the ideology that drives them,” the petition states.“We ask you to use your position, your considerable platform and even your tweets to send a clear message that hate has no place in our public discourse, in our public policy or in our society.”When it comes to Trump, whatever one may think of him, at least two things are clear: He wants to go down in history as a great, or perhaps the greatest, president ever, and he cares very deeply what people think about him and how he is performing. In some ways, Trump may be more likely to be influenced by mass petitions and shifts in public opinion than presidents before him, who were grounded more firmly in their politics by partisan leanings or ideology. For the president-elect, though, there is only Trump, and greatness. If he can be persuaded that the regular acts of violence carried out by his supporters in his name ― quite literally in his name, as in cases like Adem’s attacker ― then he may decide that tamping them down is something he needs to do. If so, lives could be saved.To: President-elect Donald Trump On Nov. 8, you were elected president of the United States. As many have reiterated, regardless of which candidate any of us supported, you now have an obligation to represent ALL Americans. In your victory speech, you urged Americans to come together as one united people to take on the challenges before us.Throughout American history, we have found opportunities to overcome our differences and work together for the common good; it is one of the defining characteristics of our nation’s greatness.In the months leading up to your election, your campaign rhetoric found an audience with those who would use our differences to divide us. Throughout the campaign, you and your supporters directed hateful language at people based on what we look like, where our families come from, who we love, how we worship, our abilities, our gender, and other factors that make up our identity and expression in the world.In the days since your election, we have seen people—seemingly emboldened by your victory—committing harassment, vandalism, property destruction and even assault based on those differences. Many of these acts have been carried out in your name. Though you may not condone this behavior, your silence gives tacit permission to those who perform these acts.We are especially troubled by incidents taking place in schools and on college campuses—places where we do everything we can to ensure our children are safe and nurtured, and have the opportunity to grow and learn free of intimidation and hatred. But now we are hearing reports of children chanting “build the wall” at classmates, Muslim students and educators harassed for their clothing, male students intimidating their female classmates and swastikas painted on classroom doors.Millions of your supporters would never participate in these actions, but your campaign rhetoric has created an environment that enables and encourages those who want to harm others. While you spoke against bullying, intimidation and hate crimes in your “60 Minutes” interview, the appointment of “alt-right” hero Steve Bannon as your chief strategist—which has been cheered by the Ku Klux Klan, the American Renaissance and other white supremacist groups—sends the exact opposite message.The presidency is about many things. Chiefly, it is about setting an example through your leadership. You have said that you will be the president for all Americans, Mr. Trump. We ask that you keep your promise by loudly, forcefully, unequivocally and consistently denouncing these acts and the ideology that drives them. We ask you to use your position, your considerable platform and even your tweets to send a clear message that hate has no place in our public discourse, in our public policy or in our society."

Police said at least 155,000 people had packed into a central Seoul square early on Saturday evening for a candle-lit rally. Organizers said the number was 500,000.Park has pledged to cooperate in an investigation into the scandal. Prosecutors are expected to bring indictments against Choi Soon-sil, Park’s friend at the center of the crisis, and two former presidential aides tomorrow.Not all Koreans are calling for the president to resign, however. A short drive away from the main protest, a group of conservative protesters gathered outside Seoul station in defense of the president.“Sixteen million people elected this president to office. It does not make sense to simply ask for her withdrawal,” said Geum Sang-chul, a 78-year-old pensioner and member of the Korean Veterans Association. Geum had joined a group of counter-protesters that police estimated at about 11,000-strong, while organizers said the number was higher.“We can not give into the pro-North Korea supporters,” said Geum, using a derogatory term that Korean conservatives have for the more progressive wing of Korean politics.Park’s approval ratings have been at a record-low 5 percent for the last three weeks because of the scandal over her friend.Many of her remaining supporters, some of whom refer to themselves as “the five percent”, are loyal to Park’s father, Park Chung-hee, a military strongman who ruled South Korea for 18 years until he was assassinated by his spy chief in 1979.Park Geun-hye’s popularity and election as president stemmed in part from the symbolic connection to her father, who is still revered by older generations.“If they really care about the country, they should consider the country’s image,” said Lee Sang-soon, a 66-year-old pensioner. “I am troubled by how the country is portrayed abroad by these protests.”But Park remains highly unpopular across the country. Tens of thousands of people also gathered for dozens of demonstrations in regional cities on Saturday night, Yonhap news reported.High school students also joined the crowds in Seoul on Saturday, free to protest after finishing important national exams this week.(Reporting by Yun Hwan Chae and James Pearson; Editing by Tom Hogue)"

Without U.S. approval the agreement as currently negotiated cannot come to fruition.China’s Xi is selling an alternate vision for regional trade by promoting the Beijing-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which as it stands excludes the Americas.Chinese state media has warned Trump against isolationism and interventionism, calling instead for the United States to actively work with China to maintain the international status quo.“The billionaire-turned-politician needs to prove that derailing the global economy has not been one of the reasons why he ran for U.S. president,” Xinhua said.(Reporting by Engen Tham; Editing by Kim Coghill)"

The meeting came despite the president-elect’s assurances that he was handing off his business to his children in a “blind trust” to avoid potential conflicts of interest while serving in the nation’s highest office. Trump held the talks with business partners Sagar Chordia, Atul Chordia and Kalpesh Mehta on Tuesday, the Indian newspaper The Economic Times first reported. Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric Trump, who attended the meeting, are supposed to be heading the trust, managing their father’s assets and business portfolio. They also sit on the executive committee of the presidential transition team. Two days later, the president-elect met with Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in New York City, his first visit from a foreign leader. Ivanka Trump, executive vice president of development and acquisitions for the Trump Organization, was also in attendance. She is supposed to be running the Trump Organization separate from her father’s administration to avoid any potential conflicts of interest or their appearance. The Trump family appears to be struggling mightily to avoid these conflicts.“It looks to us that he’s clearly not able to maintain a blind trust and still keep the company under his ownership and, frankly, control,” said Jordan Libowitz, communications director for the ethics watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “We really think that the best thing he can do is sell the company outside of the family and place the money from the sale into an actual blind trust.”The Trump Organization is currently involved in five different projects in India, at least two of which are with the Chordias’ Panchshil Realty. Mehta is Trump’s personal representative to India through the company Tribeca Developers and works with other companies. Luxury condos built by Panchshil already bear Trump’s name in the Indian cities of Mumbai and Pune. Meanwhile, the Lodha Group is building a different Trump-branded condo in Mumbai. In the New Delhi suburb of Gurgaon, Trump is partnering with Ireo, another Indian developer, to build an office complex and M3M Group to build another residential condo tower. Trump does not directly own any of the luxury condo or office buildings planned or open in India. Instead, he licenses his name to the projects and receives payment for their use of the Trump brand. The total value to developers of all five projects is $1.5 billion. That could rise as Panchshil is looking into building a second Trump building in Pune.The meeting between Trump, his children and business partners included the discussion of Indian government policy and their business interests, according to the Economic Times report. Mehta, The Trump Organization’s representative in India, told the business newspaper that Donald Trump Jr. was pleased with the pace of growth in India and was hopeful about expansion in the future.Mehta told the paper that he did not get to talk to the president-elect about the Indian government’s sudden policy implementation of currency demonetization this month, but “his kids knew about it and they termed it as an incredibly bold move.”The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Further evidence that it could be impossible for the president-elect to disconnect himself from his foreign businesses comes from a key diplomatic appointment that Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte made days before Trump’s election victory. Duterte announced that Jose E.B. Antonio would be the country’s envoy to Washington, D.C., for trade and investment. Antonio, chairman of Century Properties Group, is Trump’s business partner in the Philippines. His business is currently building the 57-story Trump Tower at Century City in the capital Manila.For countries and foreign leaders more used to a corrupt government environment, there will be numerous opportunities to curry favor with the incoming president through his businesses. Trump’s business empire is already courting them for profit. The Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., hosted an informative session for foreign diplomats this past week explaining how these dignitaries could rent rooms during a Trump presidency, according to The Washington Post. This would, in effect, involve foreign governments putting money directly into the president’s pocket while diplomats visited Washington, D.C., to conduct official business.One anonymous diplomat from an Asian country explained to the Post, “Why wouldn’t I stay at his hotel blocks from the White House, so I can tell the new president, ‘I love your new hotel!’ Isn’t it rude to come to his city and say, ‘I am staying at your competitor?’”"

(It is not a blind trust.) At the same time, the three adult children are on Trump’s transition team, giving him advice and, apparently, meeting with dignitaries from countries where they could do business in the near future.“They shouldn’t be on the transition team because they’re going to be running the business,” said Richard Painter, who was White House ethics czar under George W. Bush. “I don’t know why they’re on the transition team. It’s a clear conflict of interest.” Federal conflict-of-interest laws do not apply to the president, but that does not mean that Trump’s business holdings do not create the appearance of conflicts if not actual conflicts. They are, in fact, unprecedented.No president has ever held a fortune that spans the globe. He has licensed his name to buildings in far-flung countries, including Azerbaijan, Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea and Turkey. Some are allies, some are ruled by autocratic dictatorships and some are at odds with American interests. Further, he owes hundreds of millions of dollars each to the government-owned Bank of China and the privately owned Deutsche Bank. The Trump Organization has plans to continue to expand the company around the globe during its namesake’s presidential administration.Not only do these foreign holdings, debts and future deals present imminent conflicts of interest for American foreign policy, but they also create an immediate constitutional concern. The U.S. Constitution’s emoluments clause states that no government official shall receive favorable payment from a foreign government, foreign government-owned company or foreign official without the consent of Congress. It is, in essence, an anti-bribery clause preventing foreign corruption.“Any of those types of arrangements, including bank loans from the Bank of China, would need to be unwound or you could have an accusation that it violates the emoluments clause,” Painter said.This isn’t the only Chinese government-owned bank in business with Trump. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China’s United States headquarters are in Trump Tower in Manhattan. This government-owned bank pays rent directly to Trump through the Trump Organization.The emoluments clause could also come into play when Trump’s business sells condos at its properties or partners with foreign investors in the United States or other countries. A condo sale to a foreign dignitary could be seen as an emolument, especially if it were above the market rate. Any partnership with a royal family member in the Middle East or elsewhere could potentially violate the emoluments clause.Both of these situations, though, could be shielded from the public. Condo buyers in some cases can hide their purchases behind a limited liability company (LLC), and Trump has refused to disclose his investment partners in any of his businesses. The partnership issue could be alleviated if Trump disclosed his tax returns; he is the first president elected in nearly 60 years to have not released his tax returns.Trump’s conflicts of interest are not solely limited to his overseas holdings.Sitting about one mile from the White House in the heart of Washington is the Trump International Hotel. It is Trump’s most imminent conflict of interest.The Trump Organization, through a connected LLC, operates the hotel on a 60-year lease from the General Services Administration, a government contracting agency. That lease specifically states that “no … elected official of the Government of the United States … shall be admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom.” Federal anti-corruption laws further prohibit government employees from holding government contracts.When Trump comes into office, he will appoint a new head of the GSA, who will run an agency that will negotiate the lease with Trump’s children annually. This creates a huge imbalance of power for the agency and its career civil servants, raising obvious questions about whether the government can get the best deal for the public.Trump will also get to appoint new members to the National Labor Relations Board, which has two vacancies. This independent agency enforces labor law and investigates unfair labor practices or the illegal suppression of collective bargaining. On Nov. 3, the NLRB ruled in favor of workers who voted to form a union at the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas. After workers voted to unionize, Trump refused to acknowledge them or to meet with them. The board ordered Trump to start bargaining toward a contract. The Trump hotel is now appealing the NLRB ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals. With the ability to reshape the NLRB, Trump could remake the board in a way that favors his business interests.An entirely different brand of conflict of interest cropped up after the whole Trump family appeared on CBS’ “60 Minutes” on Sunday. Ivanka Trump appeared wearing a $10,800 bracelet from her personal jewelry brand. After the show, an email went out from her company hawking the bauble, an apparent attempt to use the presidency and the fame it affords to sell consumer goods. Her company apologized and blamed it on “a well-intentioned marketing employee.”These conflicts also extend to one of Trump’s closest aides, his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Kushner, the 35-year-old husband of Ivanka Trump, serves on the executive committee of his father-in-law’s presidential transition. His brother, Josh Kushner, happens to run a multibillion-dollar health care start-up called Oscar that relies on Obamacare for its existence. In addition, Oscar investor Peter Thiel also sits on Trump’s presidential transition executive committee. This could create a personal conflict of interest when discussions of repealing and replacing Obamacare occur.Even though they do not have control of either chamber of Congress, Democrats will seek to impose some level of accountability on the president-elect and his business empire. They hope some Republicans are concerned as well.“You can’t have conflicts of interest that are that significant, present those to the public and have a straight face about it,” Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.) said. Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, has already called for hearings on Trump’s “blind trust.” In a letter to Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the Oversight Committee, Cummings wrote, “Mr. Trump’s unprecedented secrecy and his extensive business dealings in foreign countries raise serious questions about how he intends to avoid conflicts of interest as president.”Rep. Katherine Clark (D-Mass.) introduced legislation that would extend the federal conflict-of-interest law to cover both the president and vice president. This would mean that Trump would have to place his holdings into an actual blind trust, not a trust he claims his children will run.In a statement, Clark said, “Every recent president in modern history has taken steps to ensure his financial interests do not conflict with the needs of the American people. The American people need to be able to trust that the President’s decisions are based on the best interests of families at home, and not the President’s financial interests.” Sarbanes says to expect Democrats to continue to demand that these conflicts of interest be resolved.“I think Trump’s going to give us endless examples or instances of things that on their face are offensive to people’s sense of what’s proper,” he said. “He’s already doing it.”"

Her company apologized and blamed it on “a well-intentioned marketing employee.”These conflicts also extend to one of Trump’s closest aides, his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Kushner, the 35-year-old husband of Ivanka Trump, serves on the executive committee of his father-in-law’s presidential transition. His brother, Josh Kushner, happens to run a multibillion-dollar health care start-up called Oscar that relies on Obamacare for its existence. In addition, Oscar investor Peter Thiel also sits on Trump’s presidential transition executive committee. This could create a personal conflict of interest when discussions of repealing and replacing Obamacare occur.Even though they do not have control of either chamber of Congress, Democrats will seek to impose some level of accountability on the president-elect and his business empire. They hope some Republicans are concerned as well.“You can’t have conflicts of interest that are that significant, present those to the public and have a straight face about it,” Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.) said. Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, has already called for hearings on Trump’s “blind trust.” In a letter to Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the Oversight Committee, Cummings wrote, “Mr. Trump’s unprecedented secrecy and his extensive business dealings in foreign countries raise serious questions about how he intends to avoid conflicts of interest as president.”Rep. Katherine Clark (D-Mass.) introduced legislation that would extend the federal conflict-of-interest law to cover both the president and vice president. This would mean that Trump would have to place his holdings into an actual blind trust, not a trust he claims his children will run.In a statement, Clark said, “Every recent president in modern history has taken steps to ensure his financial interests do not conflict with the needs of the American people. The American people need to be able to trust that the President’s decisions are based on the best interests of families at home, and not the President’s financial interests.” Sarbanes says to expect Democrats to continue to demand that these conflicts of interest be resolved.“I think Trump’s going to give us endless examples or instances of things that on their face are offensive to people’s sense of what’s proper,” he said. “He’s already doing it.”"

In fact, the 60-year lease agreement between the GSA and the Trump Organization plainly states that “no … elected official of the Government of the United States … shall be admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom.”It appears that neither the Trump Organization nor the GSA has planned for this situation. Neither responded to The Huffington Post’s requests for comment.Clear conflicts of interest already abound at the president-elect’s D.C. hotel. On Nov. 14, the Trump Organization refiled a lawsuit against the nation’s capital over its 2015 tax bill, arguing that it should be lowered. The company had previously filed suit over both its 2015 and 2016 tax bills in June, but that suit was thrown out of court in October because the tax assessment appeals for each year had to be filed separately.City officials do not seem concerned that the lawsuit is now coming from the soon-to-be-president’s company. “We’ll handle this tax case like any other tax case,” said Rob Moruse, communications director for Washington D.C.’s attorney general, Karl Racine. “His new position does not change the legal equation.”Next year, though, Trump will be in the position of appointing a new GSA director. The agency is required to enter into annual negotiations with the Trump Organization over the terms of its lease. The lease terms could include everything from the property assessment to tax issues like the historic preservation tax break the company has applied for.At that point, Trump says he’ll set up as a “blind trust” and leave his three oldest children in charge of the company. The problem is, this setup is in no way a blind trust under any possible definition; Trump knows exactly what he owns and he knows who has invested in it. And while his children may be managing the business, he is still a beneficiary ― and they are also members of his presidential transition team.Ethics and government contracting experts believe this setup creates an immediate and irreconcilable conflict of interest. “It’s not only unprecedented and improper, but it’s also horrible from an optics standpoint, in terms of conflicts of interest for the president of the United States to have a massive contract with an agency that reports directly to him,” said Steve Schooner, a procurement law professor at George Washington University Law School.Schooner, a former government contracting official at the Department of Justice and the Office of Management and Budget, said it appears that neither the GSA nor the Trump Organization has a solution to this problem. He thinks that there is almost no way for the GSA to accommodate this arrangement and should just plan to cancel the lease on or before Trump’s inauguration.Government contracts normally contain a clause specifying that the government retains the right to terminate the contract at its convenience; Trump’s is unique in that it does not. Still, the government has the right to terminate the lease for default despite the fact that it’s not stated explicitly in the contract.Trump could always sue for breach of contract if this happens. Yet while the government would likely have to pay monetary damages to Trump, it would allow the agency to get out of a massive potential conflict of interest ― and certainly the glaring appearance of a conflict.“In the end, it’s just a frigging lease,” Schooner said. “If GSA wants to terminate it tomorrow, the only thing Trump can do is sue and get money damages. That’s a price worth paying.”Another way around the conflict would be for Trump to sell or gift his company to his children, said Richard Painter, a former top ethics official for President George W. Bush’s administration. But Trump hasn’t indicated that he has any interest in doing this, and may have to pay a hefty gift tax. Even if he did, the children’s role on the transition team ― which Painter described as “shocking” ― would still create an obvious appearance of a conflict of interest.Trump isn’t likely to give up his new hotel in D.C. without a fight. He visited the hotel repeatedly during his presidential campaign, even hosting an absurd and controversial press conference there where he lied about his role in disseminating falsehoods about President Barack Obama’s birthplace.The fears about conflicts of interest over this lease are well-founded. Aside from a tax lawsuit, the Trump Organization has already changed elements of its lease contract with GSA several times since it was first signed in 2012. The company had to change its financial backer after its original investor fell through. After the original architect ― a major supporter of historical preservation in Washington D.C. ― was removed, the Trump Organization subbed in a new architect. This brought on fights with the agency over design changes that officials said no longer preserved or showcased the building’s historical features, BuzzFeed reported earlier this year. The Trump Organization could seek to renegotiate its contract any number of ways while its primary beneficiary sits just up the street in the White House. Then there are the enforcement questions: If the Trump Organization, for example, does not submit its annual financial documents on time, or if its financial documents need to be audited, GSA employees would face a direct confrontation with the president’s children, who will be running a corporation with his name on it. “There’s an imbalance of power,” Schooner said. “In a 60-year, complicated contract, we’re going to ask a civil servant at GSA to negotiate annually with the president’s children.

Quite a befitting term for the past 12 months which were highly inflamed by political events around the world, and another one of the many attempts at explaining the year, which range from the fragmentation of the left to the return of fascist nationalism, from the end of globalization to the appalling triumph of white supremacy, from the emancipation of unbridled hatred to the forcible implementation of neoliberal economic projects. ""Post-truth"" sounds indeed like the expression that best defines the sense of disbelief with which we’ve witnessed the course of the somewhat surreal events of the year that has not yet ended. But there is an element that has been central to many political debates in 2016 which might help us see through this world of post-truth. This element is gender.Those who never really leftDonald Trump's victory by the hands of the electoral colleges frustrated the possibility that the US would have a woman as president for the first time just a few months after the first woman president of Brazil was deposed from her second term, for which she had been elected by the popular vote. And despite the innumerable differences between one context and another, the discursive treatment offered to both in the media and in public debates was equally misogynistic.The language stemming from the American elections and Brazilian impeachment processes reveals just how ingrained sexism still is in society. Or rather, how much it constitutes what we call society.A Harvard University research confirmed that Clinton received more negative press than the other candidates, and much of that negativity was filled with misogyny. Trump himself called her a nasty woman, a term which was quickly resignified by feminists the world over. Such high levels of misogyny could also be verified, in Brazil, in anti-Rousseff speeches, especially through memes and media coverage about her that distilled the purest hatred or contempt for the female figure. This apparent return of acceptability with regards to misogynistic language was not exclusively seen in politics, though. A Cambridge University Press study published around the Olympics reveals similar attitudes towards athletes. According to the report, the language about women in the sporting context is disproportionately concentrated in appearance, dress and personal lives, placing more emphasis on aesthetics (and gossip) than on athletics.It is not like feminists didn’t know that, mind you. In sports, politics and elsewhere, the message seems to be virtually the same, all the time: women are well-accepted, or not, in different spaces, depending on a weird combination between the space and how femininity scripts fit into it. In sport, women are very well accepted as muses, but not so much as athletes. In politics, it is OK for women to be complements – but as we’ve seen, not so much agents.The language produced around Dilma Rousseff's impeachment and Hillary Clintons’ defeat illustrates something that feminists have been saying for years: a hell of a lot of people still don’t want any changes in gender roles. And with so much information available, some suspicions about who does and who doesn’t want change can be confirmed. The end is nighNoam Chomsky and Naomi Klein, in their statements about Trump’s election, pointed out that the end of the world may really be quite close, seeing as Trump seems to believe that global warming is a fiction. There is consensus among the scientific community that sustainability is not a jargon but a necessity, and that if we do not slow down our emission of pollutants the effects will be irreversible and apocalyptic. Even corporate giants are already urging Trump to maintain the Paris climate agreement.Global warming should not be in narrative disputes, because facts are facts. Alas we will have to wait and see what happens, but if the president of the largest superpower of the post-truth world operates in fantasy and his personal beliefs are worth more than proper knowledge, we are doomed. It's all so childish.And if the imminent end of the world by perpetual climate change is not scary enough, here’s another big risk of living in a world where Trump has so much power: those who share many of his fantasies are free to release their own weird fantasies into the world. If Trump – the chicano thrower, pussy grabber, climate change denier narcissist – is president, imagine what his fan club will feel entitled to do? You don´t need to: since the elections, more hate crimes have been committed than post 9/11, neo-Nazi graffiti is spreading and KKK groups have held parades in honor of the orange guy´s victory. What was once alarming is no longer: it is all happening. We know full well that emancipating symbolic violence also emancipates material violence. And that these two types of violence are equally real. The symbolic objectification and annihilation of women are as real as their material consequences. We know that. It is as childish and stubborn not to accept this as it is not to accept that climate change is real. It's the facts. There should be no dispute.Sexist vocabulary and the use of symbolic violence are old acquaintances of ours. Feminists and other activists have been saying, for years, that the people who chase, abuse and try to silence us exist beyond online trolling. It feels almost unbelievable that even after so many of our warnings, educational efforts, debates and initiatives, it is those who offend us for the sake of offending us, those who hurt us because they can, those who do not seem to have a trace of respect for human dignity who are best represented at the highest echelons of power.It is possible to objectively analyze the ways with which Trump has revealed his misogyny, just as it is possible to trace material violence back to the words that reveal this misogyny. This post-truth conservative tsunami is not just a symbolic setback. The struggle has always been between those whose real life is threatened and those whose ideal life is threatened. The values and ideals that Trump represents are old acquaintances of ours too. Hello patriarchy, my old enemy. In your fantasies we want to dominate men, but in our reality it is you who insist in wanting us dominated. It is so obvious. It has always been. Can everyone see it now? Backlash We can’t say we did not see this backlash coming, though. The build-up to the counterattack positing that feminist values are the source of all problems that afflict women was there to be seen. We knew of this preemptive strike against our achievements, we knew that something trying to interrupt advances for women even before they were reached was taking place. We knew that the exponential growth in feminist discourse over the past years was to be met with a vengeance. The backlash is coming fully into fruition with this reestablishment of alpha-male power.Hegemonic masculinity, “first-ladyism” and white supremacyThe concept of hegemonic masculinity is part of a theory of gender order proposed by R.W. Connell, and it can be defined as any current configuration of practices that legitimize men’s dominant position and justify the subordination of women and other marginalized men. It is observable that, in Brazil and in the US, it is pundits who embody hegemonic masculinity traits as they are described by Connell those who are – once again – firmly seated in Thrones. Obviously, men like that never really were without power. But, discursively and materially, women have – once again – been removed from the Game. For Connell, femininity is always organized as an adaptation to the power of men – thus no accepted femininity will ever be allowed to occupy the same positions of power that men can. The building of accepted femininities has been scrutinized time and again, most famously (and way before Connell) in Betty Friedan's classic The Feminine Mystique. We saw it happen before our very eyes in 2016 Brazil too: during what must have been one of the most politically charged months in the recent memory of my country, a brown top in magazine clothing ran a story on first lady Marcela Temer extolling her qualities as a beautiful, homely and demure girl. After two years of much misogyny towards Dilma Rousseff, as soon as she is to be impeached a new narrative of accepted femininity emerges, but one that happens to be as old as civilization itself. Women in are accepted into politics, of course. It’s just that we prefer them as domestic queens and decorative objects that make male politicians look good, stupid. This “first-ladyism” brought back the feminine mystique, illustrating Connell's theory and helping signal the backlash while at it. It is 2016 and the discourse of power has put women back into the place we´d barely left. In the context of the US elections it was Donald Trump's daughter much more than his third wife who embodied this role, though, and in an even more conniving way with this idea of post-truth. Throughout her father’s campaign, Ivanka Trump positioned herself as a working mother, and thus captivated a slice of the population who saw in her ""female empowerment"" speech a sort of free pass to cast a vote for daddy machoest. Jessica Valenti sees this as a result of the fact that mainstream understandings of feminism are now less about politics and more about the nebulous idea of ""empowerment"", and perhaps this helps explain the many white women who have chosen to vote for Trump – which is revolting, but not surprising, for this is how privileges works. If feminism is solely about personal empowerment, one is likely not to see much difference between Trump and Clinton, for the bodily autonomy of all women is probably not an issue that occupies one’s thoughts. This particular result magnificently illustrates the urgent need for the practical application of another concept: intersectional feminism, the famous term coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw, which indicates that women experience oppression in varied configurations and with varying degrees of intensity, because cultural patterns of oppression are not only intertwined, but united and influenced by each other. Black and latina women voted overwhelmingly for Clinton, which puts a beat-up perspective well into perspective: it turns out to be very true that white women barely show any sorority towards our non-white sisters. The shame. Now what?Gender became quite the crucial aspect for 2016’s political analyses as misogyny became increasingly more explicitly evident. The discourses arising from the American elections and the impeachment process in Brazil provide abundant records of how attached to patriarchal values we still are. It will be interesting to watch how the media will portray other female figures in politics from here on out. Angela Merkel, whose position as the almost accidental leader of a post-Brexit Atlantic Alliance, will put her in even more evidence – this has already started, and there was immense interest about (and much speculation around) her welcome wishes to a newly elected Trump. Merkel famously stated that cooperation between the US and Germany would foster as long as his administration is based on well-known Eastern values like democracy, freedom, respect for the Law and for the dignity of human beings regardless of their origin, color, religion, gender or sexuality. But here come Marine Le Pen and Frauke Petry, both sitting on the extreme right with its old patriarchal and white supremacists values. I wonder how differently the stories about them will be written. As per Clinton, although she is a contested figure (even within feminism), it is pretty obvious that, as it was during her campaign, her post-defeat speech highlighted feminist concerns. In it, she thanked the young women who had faith in her saying that nothing had ever made her prouder than represent them. In a world of post-truths and rampant misogyny, many feminist truths remain firmly in place. And as Clinton reminded girls in her final message: ""…never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world."" Women, this might be a setback. But the truth is, we are not going anywhere. ***A version of this article was originally published in Portuguese in Carta Capital"

John F. Kennedy was the first American president briefed on this plan, back in 1961. Afterwards, a shaken Kennedy told his secretary of state, Dean Rusk, “And we call ourselves the human race.”President Nixon was similarly appalled. “No matter what we do,” he told his National Security Council, “they [the Soviets] lose their cities … what a decision.” Ninety million Soviets would die in an American nuclear strike, Nixon was told. And 90 million Americans would die in a Soviet retaliation. And there was no way to change that outcome.Nixon tried. He ordered the Pentagon to develop flexible nuclear responses in an effort to allow the United States the ability to “limit” nuclear conflict. President Carter did the same. In the end, however, the “game theory” rationalizations of thermonuclear warfare left the nation’s leader faced with the reality of a Hobson’s choice, where the only solution offered was global destruction.Ronald Reagan flirted with the notion of “winnable” nuclear war, before recognizing the reality that there was no way to put the nuclear genie back in the bottle once the first weapons were used. NATO was simply incapable of stopping a concerted Soviet drive on the Rhine; every tabletop exercise conducted by the generals responsible for the defense of Europe ended with a NATO nuclear weapon being employed to halt the Soviet Army ― and general nuclear war followed.President Reagan’s response was to rebuild an American conventional military depleted by neglect in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, and to enter into serious nuclear disarmament negotiations with the Soviets, culminating in the elimination of two entire categories of nuclear weapons (short- and intermediate-range nuclear missiles) and meaningful reductions in strategic nuclear weapons. And for a moment, during discussions in Reykjavik, Iceland, Ronald Reagan and his Soviet counterpart, Mikhail Gorbachev, flirted with the total elimination of nuclear weapons, out of a mutual recognition by both leaders that nuclear war was unwinnable.The collapse of the Soviet Union led to the emergence of the United States as the world’s sole remaining superpower. America did not prove to be a gracious victor in the Cold War, exploiting the weakness of post-Soviet Russia by expanding NATO into the former Soviet satellites of eastern Europe (including the three former Soviet Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia) and transforming NATO from a defensive alliance to one that conducted offensive operations inside Europe (in Kosovo and Yugoslavia) and out (in Afghanistan and Libya.) The United States also withdrew from the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty, a cornerstone of U.S.-Soviet arms control, leading to the subsequent deployment of American anti-missile capability onto European soil, and a halt to meaningful nuclear arms reduction talks between Russia and the United States (the so-called “New START” treaty negotiated by the Obama administration with Russia is little more than a front for nuclear modernization, with little or no reduction in actual nuclear war-fighting capability on either side).Moreover, the American nuclear war plan had, void of a Soviet nuclear counter and with little or no respect for the remaining Russian nuclear capability, once again embraced the notion of “limited” or “containable” nuclear conflict, making the once unthinkable an active component of American strategic consideration, including preemptive use of nuclear weapons in a non-nuclear scenario.The geopolitical situation President-elect Trump will inherit from President Obama is fraught with friction with Russia that, more so today than at any time since the end of the Cold War, has the potential of leading to military conflict. American and Russian forces operate face-to-face in the Baltics. The deteriorating situation in the Ukraine has led to a series of tense confrontations between the U.S. and Russia in the Black Sea region.In Syria, there is active discussion within the Obama administration to engage in specific military acts ― the enforcement of a no-fly zone, the deliberate targeting of Syrian military forces ― that would inevitably lead to a shooting war with Russia. And Vice President Biden has publicly endorsed the kind of offensive cyber-attack against Russia (ostensibly in retaliation against unproven allegations of Russian involvement in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee e-mails) that, in and of itself, would constitute an act of war. Donald Trump was openly mocked during the presidential campaign for his lack of precise knowledge regarding the American triad of nuclear capability ― land-based missiles, manned bombers and submarine-launched missiles. In the current environment, however, ignorance may be bliss. Successive American presidential administrations have shown themselves trapped by the allure of nuclear weapons. The triad, born of historical contingencies more than strategic need, is a relic of the Cold War that serves no meaningful purpose today other than to expose the United States, and by extension the rest of the world, to the imminence of nuclear destruction. Viable nuclear deterrence is not dependent on the retention of the triad. And yet the Obama administration has embarked on a trillion-dollar nuclear modernization of the triad, even as it gives lip service to the theory of nuclear disarmament.President-elect Trump has indicated that he is open to improving relations between Russia and the United States. History has presented him with an opportunity to have a Reagan-like moment, where he could walk the United States away from the precipice of nuclear conflict by entering into meaningful disarmament negotiations with Russia, inclusive of putting the triad on the table (especially land-based missiles, which serve no viable purpose), and using the savings derived from such to rebuild America’s depleted conventional military capability.The first reduces the potential for devastating nuclear war; the other creates a deterrent to potential miscalculations by any nation doubting American resolve to protect its interests and those of its allies.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/583300371a00002500cc9003.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sometime soon, President-elect Trump will be briefed on the American plan for nuclear war, including the role he plays in ordering a launch. John F. Kennedy was the first American president briefed on this plan, back in 1961. Afterwards, a shaken Kennedy told his secretary of state, Dean Rusk, “And we call ourselves the human race.”President Nixon was similarly appalled. “No matter what we do,” he told his National Security Council, “they [the Soviets] lose their cities … what a decision.” Ninety million Soviets would die in an American nuclear strike, Nixon was told. And 90 million Americans would die in a Soviet retaliation. And there was no way to change that outcome.Nixon tried. He ordered the Pentagon to develop flexible nuclear responses in an effort to allow the United States the ability to “limit” nuclear conflict. President Carter did the same. In the end, however, the “game theory” rationalizations of thermonuclear warfare left the nation’s leader faced with the reality of a Hobson’s choice, where the only solution offered was global destruction.Ronald Reagan flirted with the notion of “winnable” nuclear war, before recognizing the reality that there was no way to put the nuclear genie back in the bottle once the first weapons were used. NATO was simply incapable of stopping a concerted Soviet drive on the Rhine; every tabletop exercise conducted by the generals responsible for the defense of Europe ended with a NATO nuclear weapon being employed to halt the Soviet Army ― and general nuclear war followed.President Reagan’s response was to rebuild an American conventional military depleted by neglect in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, and to enter into serious nuclear disarmament negotiations with the Soviets, culminating in the elimination of two entire categories of nuclear weapons (short- and intermediate-range nuclear missiles) and meaningful reductions in strategic nuclear weapons. And for a moment, during discussions in Reykjavik, Iceland, Ronald Reagan and his Soviet counterpart, Mikhail Gorbachev, flirted with the total elimination of nuclear weapons, out of a mutual recognition by both leaders that nuclear war was unwinnable.The collapse of the Soviet Union led to the emergence of the United States as the world’s sole remaining superpower. America did not prove to be a gracious victor in the Cold War, exploiting the weakness of post-Soviet Russia by expanding NATO into the former Soviet satellites of eastern Europe (including the three former Soviet Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia) and transforming NATO from a defensive alliance to one that conducted offensive operations inside Europe (in Kosovo and Yugoslavia) and out (in Afghanistan and Libya.) The United States also withdrew from the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty, a cornerstone of U.S.-Soviet arms control, leading to the subsequent deployment of American anti-missile capability onto European soil, and a halt to meaningful nuclear arms reduction talks between Russia and the United States (the so-called “New START” treaty negotiated by the Obama administration with Russia is little more than a front for nuclear modernization, with little or no reduction in actual nuclear war-fighting capability on either side).Moreover, the American nuclear war plan had, void of a Soviet nuclear counter and with little or no respect for the remaining Russian nuclear capability, once again embraced the notion of “limited” or “containable” nuclear conflict, making the once unthinkable an active component of American strategic consideration, including preemptive use of nuclear weapons in a non-nuclear scenario.The geopolitical situation President-elect Trump will inherit from President Obama is fraught with friction with Russia that, more so today than at any time since the end of the Cold War, has the potential of leading to military conflict. American and Russian forces operate face-to-face in the Baltics. The deteriorating situation in the Ukraine has led to a series of tense confrontations between the U.S. and Russia in the Black Sea region.In Syria, there is active discussion within the Obama administration to engage in specific military acts ― the enforcement of a no-fly zone, the deliberate targeting of Syrian military forces ― that would inevitably lead to a shooting war with Russia. And Vice President Biden has publicly endorsed the kind of offensive cyber-attack against Russia (ostensibly in retaliation against unproven allegations of Russian involvement in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee e-mails) that, in and of itself, would constitute an act of war. Donald Trump was openly mocked during the presidential campaign for his lack of precise knowledge regarding the American triad of nuclear capability ― land-based missiles, manned bombers and submarine-launched missiles. In the current environment, however, ignorance may be bliss. Successive American presidential administrations have shown themselves trapped by the allure of nuclear weapons. The triad, born of historical contingencies more than strategic need, is a relic of the Cold War that serves no meaningful purpose today other than to expose the United States, and by extension the rest of the world, to the imminence of nuclear destruction. Viable nuclear deterrence is not dependent on the retention of the triad. And yet the Obama administration has embarked on a trillion-dollar nuclear modernization of the triad, even as it gives lip service to the theory of nuclear disarmament.President-elect Trump has indicated that he is open to improving relations between Russia and the United States. History has presented him with an opportunity to have a Reagan-like moment, where he could walk the United States away from the precipice of nuclear conflict by entering into meaningful disarmament negotiations with Russia, inclusive of putting the triad on the table (especially land-based missiles, which serve no viable purpose), and using the savings derived from such to rebuild America’s depleted conventional military capability.The first reduces the potential for devastating nuclear war; the other creates a deterrent to potential miscalculations by any nation doubting American resolve to protect its interests and those of its allies. Both would serve to stabilize and secure America’s position in a post-Obama world."

The irony beats me.As a Pakistani American, here is what I have to say to my concerned friends in Pakistan. Please don’t worry about us Muslims in America. There are numerous politicians, public figures and religious leaders who are standing in solidarity and support of our rights. Senator Bernie Sanders tweeted earlier that he will become Trump’s worst nightmare if the president-elect thinks about discriminating against Muslims. Many public figures have expressed similar sentiment. Jewish and Christian leaders visited Mosques this past Friday to express their solidarity with Muslim Americans.

Many of my colleagues assured me of their support if things ever changed for me as a Muslim in America. And I have received numerous emails from non-Muslims asking for ideas on how to show their acceptance for the Muslim Community. So dear Pakistani friends, please spare us your concern and work on reaching out to your own forgotten minority groups instead. Embrace them instead. They need you far more than we do. As I have written elsewhere, Mr. Trump only dreams of what Pakistan already enforces and implements with full force against its own minority faith groups. You don’t like Trump’s proposal of special IDs for Muslim Americans? How about you call to end the special discriminatory IDs for Ahmadi Muslims in Pakistan ― IDs that have left them disenfranchised. You don’t like him looking at us Muslims with suspicion and fear?

Earlier, Ginella had become Canada’s first hijab-wearing television news reporter in January 2015. Born in Panama, Ginella came to Canada with her mother when she was 1 year old. She grew up in Toronto and while still very young, converted to Islam from Catholicism.“I always wanted to work in broadcasting or media in some capacity, and my real desire was to be in front of the camera,” Ginella said in an interview. “But in the back of my mind, I worried about whether I could make it very far in hijab.”Ginella gives credit for her professional success to her parents, especially to her mother. “My parents always made me believe I could be whatever I wanted. Even when I had my own doubts about making it as a hijabi on TV, my mom always told me that just because it hadn’t been done before, didn’t mean it wasn’t possible. I think they believed I could achieve my goals even before I did.”Canada has been at the forefront of countries that have embraced pluralism, workplace diversity and employment equity as pragmatic solutions to problems of prejudice, discrimination, and economic inequality. Since decades, diversity has been the cornerstone of Canada’s policy imperative on matters such as national identity, social coherence and economic freedom.The resulting international reputation has contributed to projecting a humane image of the Canadian society, based on the fundamental socio-political construct that promotes utmost respect for civil liberties, dignity of labor, freedom of expression, and enormous opportunities to explore and nurture an individual’s talents and potential."
67,HEALTHY LIVING,A Griever's Guide To Thanksgiving,"Sarah Lyman Kravits, ContributorWriter on grief, cancer, and crisis at www.lifewithoutjudgment...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-grievers-guide-to-thanksgiving_us_582fcb8ce4b0eaa5f14d4509,There are as many right ways to grieve as there are grieving people.,2016-11-19,<p>One of many cherished family Thanksgiving dinners</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582fd0b51800002d0030ef73.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Thanksgiving, a holiday that many find tough to negotiate after someone they love has died, is once again around the corner. This is my third Thanksgiving without my brother alive on this earth. I cannot say, so far, that grieving has become easier. What I can say is that I’ve gotten more adept at coping, more able to think through my options for how to navigate the days. This becomes especially important around holidays or at whatever time a particular family has traditionally gathered to spend time together.There is no one right way for a grieving person to approach Thanksgiving or any other holiday. There aren’t even 500 right ways. There are as many right ways as there are grieving people. Each situation is as unique as a fingerprint, with its once-in-a-lifetime combination of circumstances of the death, makeup of the family, personal traditions, nature of the relationships involved, number of years out from the loss, and much more.Complicated, yes. But not impossible to address. With some thought and effort, you can find ways to get what you need over this holiday weekend. How might you arrive at your particular collection of choices for Thanksgiving of 2016? I offer the following gifts –- not from me to you, but for you to present to yourself.Give yourself time, before and during the holiday, to think through what you need. What works for you this year may not look like what you’ve wanted any other year. Take some quiet time and entertain different options, even ones that seem completely out of character with the holiday. Talk with family members about your ideas and invite them to share theirs. For some, sticking to traditional locations, people, and foods may provide comfort; for others, this can be astoundingly painful. Do you want to be somewhere different from your customary holiday location? Eat completely uncharacteristic foods? Be with only your immediate family instead of a crowd? Order in takeout and gather your kids to eat in bed with you and watch a movie? Some may want to enhance the meal or weekend with special ceremonies that memorialize the deceased loved one, whereas others may want to keep the topic under wraps for all but the most private moments. No decision is perfect, but somewhere there is a choice that serves you at this moment.Give yourself permission to be honest with family and friends about how you feel. People who love you often have ideas about what you should do in different situations, and Thanksgiving is no exception. Friends and family may also offer opinions about your current choices and state of mind. Even when suggestions come from a place of love and caring, they may not be what you need right now. You have the right to express your needs honestly to friends and family. Explain as best you can that if your needs differ from what they offer or prefer, this reflects no judgment of them or their ideas. Help them understand that at this trying time, you simply must listen to yourself, and honor your needs, in order to continue to function.Give yourself compassion and understanding if you fall apart, or if you don’t. No matter how strong our resolve and how lofty our intentions, we cannot ultimately know how we will react to a holiday after a difficult loss. Whether you are newly bereaved or years down the road from a loss, a day like Thanksgiving can bring feelings to the forefront. Some become overwhelmed with emotion; conversely, others may find themselves calm in a way that can provoke judgment. Whether your emotions and behavior square with your expectations – and the expectations of others – or not, your willingness to meet those emotions with compassion will allow you to feel what you need to feel, and move through the feelings, without adding the painful burden of justifying them to yourself or others.Give yourself freedom to switch gears without advance notice. Even if you take time to think through your choices, even if you’ve worked with family members and friends to come up with a plan, you may get in the middle of your Thanksgiving experience and realize that everything feels awful. If this happens, and you begin to think you are a failure, or weak, or that you are ruining everyone’s day, try to set those judgments aside. Try to accept the truth of your emotions and offer yourself compassion. You might want to leave the place where all have gathered and go on a long walk or drive on your own. You might need to go to bed for a while. You may have an impulse to do something, eat something, or experience something that lies completely outside of the holiday plan. In the moment when new needs become clear and strong, see if you can honor them in a way that doesn’t turn the day on its head for everyone else.Collect these gifts into a cornucopia of self-care. Put them on your metaphorical holiday table. Share them with those around you. I wish you strength, love, and the courage to shape the holiday in a way that reflects your needs. May this Thanksgiving give you as much peace as is possible in this moment in time.A previous version of this post was originally published at Life Without Judgment by Sarah Lyman Kravits at www.lifewithoutjudgment.com.Subscribe to Life Without Judgment to receive writings from Sarah Lyman Kravits in your inbox.This post is part of Common Grief, a Healthy Living editorial initiative.

Will he?,2016-11-19,"As president, Donald Trump would have the authority to end aid that has kept the poorest Obamacare enrollees from paying high out-of-pocket costs.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582f79b71700002500e7b47b.jpeg?cache=iO4rmx9CCT&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President-elect Donald Trump could blow a giant hole in Obamacare on his first day in office without even waiting for the Republican-led Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The question is: Does he want to?As president, Trump will have the authority to immediately cut off a form of financial assistance provided to the lowest-income enrollees in health plans sold on the Obamacare health insurance exchanges. House Republicans sued President Barack Obama’s administration, alleging it is illegally providing these subsidies without congressional approval. A federal court agreed with the GOP earlier this year in a decision the Obama administration appealed.At issue are what’s known as “cost-sharing reductions,” which are subsidies the federal government pays health insurance companies to shrink, sometimes dramatically, out-of-pocket costs like deductibles and copayments for health insurance exchange enrollees at the lowest end of the income scale. These are separate from the tax credits low- and middle-income households can receive to reduce their monthly premium costs.Trump could simply accept the House Republican argument and order federal agencies to halt these cost-sharing payments to health insurers, or he could instruct the Justice Department to drop its appeal and accept the court ruling that the payments are illegal. And he could do that right away, leaving enrollees and health insurance companies with virtually no recourse.This maneuver, which influential conservatives already are calling on Trump to make, would enable the new Republican president to strike a major blow against the Affordable Care Act, a law Republicans have pledged to undo since Obama signed it in 2010. Republicans in Congress already are planning on a vote to gut the law, perhaps as soon as January, but executive action by Trump would achieve a partial victory against Obamacare instantaneously.“The law will enable a President Trump either to cut the cost-sharing payments off or to continue them if he’d like to. He’s got the discretion to keep them in place or to terminate them,” said Nicholas Bagley, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School who has written extensively about the case, known as House vs. Burwell.These subsidies are available to people earning between the federal poverty level and 250 percent of that amount, or a range of $11,880 to $29,700 a year for a single person. During this year’s health insurance sign-up period, about 57 percent of enrollees, or approximately 7 million people, received this assistance. For the poorest beneficiaries ― those with incomes under $17,820 ― this means having no deductible instead of having to pay thousands upfront before benefits kick in.Trump’s transition team didn’t respond to an email requesting comment. In an email to The Huffington Post, AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), said only, “We are in contact with the Trump transition team as we consider the House’s options.”But dealing this damage to Obamacare would come at a cost, and perhaps one higher than Trump and congressional Republicans are willing to pay, even as they prepare to scrap the Affordable Care Act.Eliminating these cost-sharing subsidies would wreak havoc on the health insurance market, costing companies an estimated $5 billion a year, and that may give Trump and House Republicans pause. Under the Affordable Care Act, health insurance companies are required to reduce cost-sharing for eligible low-income people ― even if the federal government never makes the companies financially whole.“Insurers are still required by law to lower deductibles and copays for low-income enrollees. But insurers would no longer get payments from the federal government to offset the higher costs,” said Larry Levitt, senior vice president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. “It’s safe to say that chaos would ensue.”But health insurance companies are legally allowed to stop providing coverage through the exchanges if the cost-sharing payments end, which would result in their customers losing their insurance plans.“I think they run for the exits,” Levitt said.The damage wouldn’t be limited to only those low-income enrollees. Health insurance companies would be faced with a choice of losing money in an already fragile market or abandoning it. That would extend the effects of cutting off those payments beyond the beneficiaries of these subsidies to other Obamacare enrollees, whose insurance plans would suddenly cease to exist. Consumers whose insurers exit the market would then need to scramble to find new coverage ― if they could. Depending on the scale of the disruption, there may not be insurers still willing to offer policies on the exchanges, because they all would be subject to the financial losses caused by the lost subsidy payments.Whatever congressional Republicans and the Trump administration may devise as a health reform platform to succeed Obamacare ― if they ever actually do ― would rely on private health insurance companies. Disruption to today’s insurance market by eliminating the cost-sharing payments could cause financial harm to those companies and make them wary of participating in any future health care reform. And that’s not to mention any public outcry that may occur if millions of consumers suddenly find themselves uninsured through no fault of their own.Beyond taking executive action or ending the federal government’s appeal of the court’s ruling in favor of House Republicans, Trump has other options at his disposal, said Bagley, who agrees with the GOP that the Obama administration is breaking the law by making the payments to insurers. To avoid the near-term consequences of ending the cost-sharing payments, Trump could ask House Republicans to drop the lawsuit while they write new health care legislation or even to appropriate the dollars needed, which would answer their legal complaint that Obama is spending unappropriated money.Beyond whatever Trump may want to achieve on health care, however, there’s another very big reason why he may not want to go along with the House Republican effort to end the cost-sharing payments, Bagley said: protecting the authority of the executive branch.Trump also could still contest the lawsuit, even if he agrees the payments aren’t legal, by continuing Obama’s argument that Congress doesn’t have legal standing to sue over them.“It’s not clear why the Trump administration would make a political priority of enabling the House of Representatives to bring lawsuits against the executive branch,” Bagley said. “The executive branch institutionally is committed to a view that Congress exists to pass statutes; Congress’ role is not to litigate over the meaning of statutes, that that’s an impermissible role for Congress to be in. And across administrations, that view has been stable,” he said.At a minimum, this approach would buy Trump and Congress time to develop their health care agenda and avoid the shock to the market that cutting off the cost-sharing payments would create, Bagley said. That’s true whether Trump decides against taking unilateral action or if he picks up Obama’s fight against the House Republicans’ lawsuit and loses the appeal.“The right remedy may not be stopping them on day one. The right remedy may instead be to delay the day of reckoning to enable the political process to work,” Bagley said."
71,THE WORLDPOST,Weekend Roundup: Will Donald Trump End the New Cold War?,"Nathan Gardels, ContributorEditor-in-chief, The WorldPost",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/weekend-roundup-144_us_582e51f9e4b099512f82147e,"By decreasing tensions with China and Russia, the U.S. could prevent the two powers from aligning against the West.",2016-11-19,President-elect Donald Trump’s non-ideological approach could ease tensions with Russia and China.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582e5352180000ca0330ec40.jpeg?cache=SsblyB9cc2&ops=crop_7_0_1993_1103%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"The irony of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s “America First” policy is that it could end the budding new Cold War that has been developing between the West and Russia and China. His non-ideological, deal-making approach, which doesn’t challenge how the Russians and Chinese govern themselves, promises to lessen tensions that have been getting dangerously out of control. That in turn would weaken the tie that binds those two nations ever closer together in growing hostility against the West.Writing from Moscow, Fyodor Lukyanov sees the end of an era arriving with Trump. “The main difference from the previous administration,” says Lukyanov, “is that the ideological promotion of democracy and a certain model of development, which provided the conceptual and axiological justification for America’s global presence, is being rolled back. Russia,” he continues, “welcomes the return of pragmatism to international relations and the retreat of liberal ideology.”Also writing from Moscow, Vladimir Frolov concurs: “A liberal, normative world order underpinned by U.S. leadership, could be replaced with the ‘art of the geopolitical deal’ between the great powers.” Yet, he also feels “a palpable sense of apprehension within the Kremlin.” Anastasya Manuilova reports from Moscow that Russians are divided over Trump, with many doubting he will keep his pledge to mend ties with Russia. “How [can] Trump start a new relationship with Russia if now he has become the president of [a] country where half of the population vot[ed] for Clinton with her much more hostile attitude towards us?” Anna, a 25-year-old facilities manager from Moscow, told her. “He can’t just ignore all these people, especially if they already started protesting against him.”Former NATO commander James Stavridis puts Russia and Israel in the column of “winners” in a new Trump administration, with trade and the traditional security alliances as “losers.” Harvard’s Simon Saradzhyan and William Tobey caution against expectations of any big change in the U.S.-Russia relationship. They point out the many obstacles from worries over Russian ambitions in the Middle East to constraints on U.S. ballistic missile defense systems demanded by Moscow as a condition for reviving nuclear security cooperation.Though in the short term conflict with China over trade is likely, Chinese-American relations could improve over the longer term as well. “The Chinese prefer a relationship with a United States that doesn’t try to remake the world,” Eric X. Li wrote from Shanghai this week in The New York Times. “The Chinese know how to compete and can deal with competitors. What the Chinese have always resented and resisted is an America that imposes its values and standards on everybody else. Mr. Trump’s America is likely to break from this pattern. He has shown no desire to tell other countries how to do things.” Such pragmatic accommodation in a vacuum, however, comes at an obvious price. As the philosopher Charles Taylor fears, absent a commensurate will from the U.S. to build and sustain a rules-based order that fosters global cooperation, the world will likely devolve into a series of spheres of influence reminiscent of the age of empire. In that fraught arrangement, Taylor told WorldPost advisory board member Dileep Padgaonkar, “Each side gives the other a ‘free hand’ in their ‘own’ sphere. Trump’s version of ‘America First’ seems to imply not needing to placate allies. This in turn will add lustre to an internal politics of discrimination and exclusion. It may easily go along with scrapping international treaties, like the Paris accords on climate change.” Writing from Stockholm, Goran Rosenberg agrees with Pope Francis that the vilification of others Trump has regularly practiced is itself a form of terrorism. “Every human being is capable of turning into a terrorist simply by just abusing language,” he quotes the pope saying in a recent interview in a Swedish publication. “You see,” the pope continues, “I am not speaking here about fighting a battle as in a war. I am speaking of a deceitful and hidden form of terrorism that uses words as bombs that explode, causing devastation in peoples’ lives. It is a sort of criminality and the root of it is original sin. It is a way of creating space for yourself by destroying others.” Rosenberg fears that Trump’s example encourages the darkest forces in Europe that are gaining ground every day. “Trump’s victorious election campaign,” he writes, “has poisoned the political climate of liberal democracies. We have been shown that defamation, hatred and lying can be a road to power.” Writing from India, Sandip Roy makes the same point from the other side of the planet, likening Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Trump. “It’s not about Donald Trump,” he writes, “it’s about those he emboldens. It’s about those who bully in his name. And this is an issue we understand firsthand in India. A Narendra Modi in office chooses his words carefully, gives lofty high-minded speeches, talks about vikaas and Constitution. But those who are emboldened in his name are the ones who tell critics to ‘go to Pakistan.’”The appointment by Donald Trump of Steve Bannon as a key strategist only confirms Dean Obeidallah’s worst fear that Islamophobic bigotry has a place in the White House and that not enough media outlets are concerned about this part of the man’s troubling reality. Indeed, in a piece with her New York-based brother Paul Vale, Katherine Linzy of Louisville, Ky. says the anti-Muslim sentiments in places like her “solid red” state are exacerbated by some far-right voices in media. “Rural Kentuckians may go their entire lives without meeting a Muslim, but they’ve all been told radical Islam is coming to wipe them out,” she explains. “With media fear mongering as their only reference, prejudice is unsurprising, but it’s directed at nebulous groups not individuals; the same people who worry about radical Islam would be genuinely warm and welcoming if I brought a Muslim friend round for dinner.”Michael Dobson acknowledges the gauntlet thrown down by President-elect Trump, who once said he will “cancel” the Paris climate accord. Calling for resistance, Dobson writes that this is, “a moment of moral reckoning for the American people, one as profound as that of the Vietnam War or the conquest of Europe by fascism.” Carl Pope, former head of the Sierra Club, says cities globally can take up much of the battle on climate change through building out climate-friendly infrastructure. But that, he says, will take “financial creativity” to execute and fund. A BuzzFeed News analysis of election coverage released this week came to an astonishing conclusion: “Top fake election news stories generated more total engagement on Facebook than top election stories from 19 major news outlets combined.” Sebastian Murdock reports on the baby steps Twitter and Google have taken to cull out fake information. Tucker Davey details how cybersecurity can get a boost from machine learning.

77,POLITICS,California Prosecutor Faces One-Year Suspension For Falsifying Confession,Matt Ferner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/prosecutor-falsifies-confession-suspended_us_582e459be4b058ce7aaa4fa7,"It was just a joke, the deputy district attorney tries to claim.",2016-11-18,A deputy district attorney gets punished and a defendant's child molestation charges get dropped.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56f558971e0000b30070551f.jpeg?cache=sVNtvlgn5R&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A county prosecutor in California who falsified a defendant’s confession and then said it was just a “joke” he was playing on a public defender now faces a year’s suspension of his law license.The California State Bar announced the action Thursday against Kern County Deputy District Attorney Robert Alan Murray.“Murray’s behavior is wholly inappropriate and unbecoming of an experienced prosecutor, who is expected to adhere to the highest standards of ethical conduct and to act as a gatekeeper to the fair administration of justice,” State Bar Court Judge Richard A. Honn wrote. During a 2013 child molestation case against Efrain Velasco-Palacios, Murray added the following two lines to a transcript of Velasco-Palacios’ statement to law enforcement to make it sound like he confessed, according to court records:[Officer Martinez]: You’re so guilty you child molester. Murray then gave the transcript, with his additions, to Velasco-Palacios’ attorney, Ernest Hinman, a public defender. Hinman then questioned his client about the confession, but Velasco-Palacios denied making it. Nine days later, Hinman asked Murray about the statement, and, according to court records, Murray admitted that he had falsified the confession but claimed that it was all a “joke” on the public defender. Kern County Superior Court did not see the misconduct as humorous. Instead the court found it to be “outrageous” and “conscience-shocking” and that it violated Velasco-Palacios’ constitutional rights. All charges were dropped against Velasco-Palacios. The Superior Court and the state Court of Appeal found that Murray intentionally altered the statement to influence plea negotiations. The State Bar Review Department agreed and rejected Murray’s explanation.In a Nov. 10 opinion, the State Bar Court Review Department recommended that Murray’s discipline be increased to one year, up from a judge’s earlier recommendation of 30 days. The suspension will go into effect once approved by the California Supreme Court. Murray remains employed as deputy district attorney in Kern County.The Kern County district attorney’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Ken White, a criminal defense attorney in Los Angeles and a leading voice on legal issues on the law-oriented blog Popehat, told The Huffington Post he was ""happy to see the State Bar imposing consequences for prosecutorial misconduct at all. It’s far too uncommon. It’s rare for courts to call it out and rarer for the State Bar to take action even when courts do. That contributes to the criminal justice system’s serious cultural problem with prosecutorial misconduct. Treating it as no big deal encourages it. It’s hard to explain to clients why the very prosecutors' offices so eager to put them in jail for breaking the law can do so with impunity themselves.""Prosecutors are the most powerful government agents in the U.S. criminal justice system. They have complete and unrivaled access to evidence that can determine a person’s guilt or innocence. But when they are caught breaking the rules, they rarely face discipline. Multiple Supreme Court rulings over the years have sought to chip away at the unilateral power of prosecutors, requiring them to provide any and all evidence to the defense that might be favorable to the defendant. But this puts defense attorneys on the back foot as they’re forced to blindly trust that prosecutors will turn over all their evidence ― which doesn’t always happen.Prosecutors are also largely shielded from any liability that might result from their actions thanks to a Supreme Court ruling granting them “absolute immunity.” In California, there often have been no consequences for prosecutors who have been caught cheating the system. According to a 2010 study from criminal justice reform group the Northern California Innocence Project, there were more than 700 California cases of prosecutorial misconduct from 1997 to 2009 ― and only six prosecutors in those cases were ever disciplined.Of course, most prosecutors behave ethically. But even one bad actor in a prosecutor’s office can have a significant effect on countless defendants and cases. And based on the data that are available, it’s clear that there are more than a few bad apples.“There are disturbing indications that a non-trivial number of prosecutors — and sometimes entire prosecutorial offices — engage in misconduct that seriously undermines the fairness of criminal trials,” Alex Kozinski, a judge on the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, wrote last year in a landmark paper critiquing the criminal justice system nationwide. “The misconduct ranges from misleading the jury, to outright lying in court and tacitly acquiescing or actively participating in the presentation of false evidence by police.” But identifying the misconduct is only part of the equation. Meaningful discipline must then follow as a deterrent, and California is working toward just that. Prosecutors who knowingly withhold or falsify evidence can now be charged with a felony and go to prison under a California law signed just last month.And to further crack down on cheating prosecutors, in October, the California State Bar Board of Trustees approved new ethics rules regarding prosecutors’ duty to turn over evidence. The rules must still be approved by the state Supreme Court in order to take effect. "

Zoo officials questioned the finding by pointing out the barrier passed muster with federal authorities about a month before the boy’s fall. “In its 38-year history, the barrier system at Gorilla World has always been found compliant during USDA inspections,” a statement from the zoo said. A member of an animal response team fatally shot a Western lowland gorilla named Harambe on May 28 after determining that the ape posed an imminent threat to the child. The animal’s death unleashed a public fury that was directed both at the child’s mother and at the zoo for its decision to use lethal force. Inspectors from the U.S. Department of Agriculture said the barrier around the Gorilla World pen didn’t meet standards, according to a report first covered by The Associated Press. The report, however, didn’t specify what was wrong with the fence, and The Cincinnati Enquirer said the requirements are vague. “It was in compliance until May 28th and then it was found to be not in compliance as it did not restrict public access from the nonhuman primate,” a Department of Agriculture spokeswoman told NBC News.The boy, who was not seriously injured, slipped underneath the barrier and fell about 15 feet into the gorilla exhibit. Harambe, a 17-year-old male gorilla, grabbed and dragged the boy despite zookeeper attempts to summon him away from the child. The federal report credited the zoo with following proper emergency procedures upon discovering the boy had fallen in. The gorilla exhibit reopened weeks later with new surveillance cameras and a redesigned fence. "

That show, which The New York Times praised for its “sharp, observational comedy,” saw Rimalower using his obsession with Broadway diva Patti LuPone as the foil to a deeper narrative about his fractured relationship with his father. In “Bad With Money,” which debuted at the Duplex two years later, Rimalower dramatized his struggles with another personal (and, in some respects, more imposing) demon: finances. He wasn’t just talking about a few bounced checks or missed rent payments, either, as the show chronicled his brief stint as a sex worker as well as his brush with credit card fraud. (Watch a clip from that show above.) Of “Patti Issues,” Rimalower told The Huffington Post in 2012 that he “wanted to write a show about my experiences with Patti because she’s been so important to me, and I love to talk about that and think about that. But I realized that while I could go on and on about Patti in a way that would only be interesting to people who care, that’s not the project I ultimately wanted to write here.”Meanwhile, “Bad With Money” gave him the chance to tackle a subject that felt even more universal, particularly among other gay men. “I think gay men have the worst of both worlds when it comes to money. We’re raised, as men, to be earners, to achieve and to amass wealth,” he said in 2014. “But as gay men, we also want to attract men, so we aspire to a lot of what women are taught, too. We want to be beautiful and we want to be glamorous ― and that costs money.” Directed by Aaron Mark, “Patti Issues” and “Bad With Money” will play New York’s Duplex on Nov. 19 and Dec. 19.

There may already be signs of what comes next.In June, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), whom Trump selected this week for the post of attorney general, reacted effusively to the Supreme Court’s non-ruling in the case. But he warned that the court fight would continue.“What is clear,” he said in a statement at the time, “is that this Administration will stop at nothing to forge ahead with its lawless plans ― which arguably have already caused substantial damage to the integrity of our immigration system.”If confirmed as attorney general, Sessions could effectively direct his Department of Justice to settle with the states and bring the case to a close. He could also withdraw the legal memorandum that provided the basis for the executive actions, which could moot the case and lead to its dismissal.“It seems likely that in any event Trump will rescind the memo very soon after taking office,” Stephen Legomsky, a Washington University law professor who was former chief counsel at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, told The Huffington Post.Whatever course the Trump administration takes, all signs point to an unceremonious conclusion for one of Obama’s key moves to shield certain undocumented immigrants from deportation.The closure of the case would also likely short-circuit a series of lawsuits filed in recent months by Dreamers in New York, Illinois and California. Those suits have sought to limit the original Texas ruling, which blocked Obama’s plan nationwide.“It’s heartbreaking for the millions of immigrants who’ve made their lives here, who’ve raised families here,” Obama said in June after the Supreme Court deadlocked in the case.You can read Friday’s full motion below."

Rep. Jason Spencer (R-Woodbine), who authored the bill, wanted to change the law to include women wearing veils — like the niqab or burqa.“After further consideration, I have decided to not pursue HB 3 in the upcoming 2017 legislative session due to the visceral reaction it has created,” Spencer said in a statement. “While this bill does not contain language that specifically targets any group, I am mindful of the perception that it has created.”Spencer introduced the bill following a spike in hate crimes across the country — especially against Muslim women ― since the presidential victory of Donald Trump, who has promised to ban Muslim immigration. It sparked concern from Georgia’s Muslim community.Members of Georgia’s Council for American-Islamic Relations said support from interfaith partners helped stop the bill. “First of all, we want to thank Rep. Spencer for doing the right thing by withdrawing the bill,”Edward Ahmed Mitchell, Georgia CAIR executive director, told The Huffington Post. “We thank our coalition partners, Muslim and non-Muslim alike, who stood up for religious freedom. It was reassuring to see the Georgia community uniting so quickly to say that this is not acceptable.”Representatives from these interfaith organizations attempted to contact Spencer before he withdrew the bill, Mitchell said, but did not hear back. “We still hope to meet with him, thank him, and build bridges,” Mitchell said.The Huffington Post is documenting the rising wave of anti-Muslim bigotry and violence in America. Take a stand against hate.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story said the law would target hijabs.

83,POLITICS,Donald Trump Is Terrible News For Our Food System,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/president-trump-food-policy_us_582e1964e4b099512f81c205,"Advocates for healthier, sustainably produced food are feeling pessimistic about a Trump administration.",2016-11-18,President-elect Donald Trump has made his affinity for fast food well known. Food advocates fear what that could mean for food policy under his administration.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58409a7e1a00000b03ccac9c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CHICAGO — Just over a week since the election, a group of more than 100 food advocates, entrepreneurs and farmers who gathered in the University of Chicago Booth School of Business’ Gleacher Center to discuss food policy seemed reluctant to discuss President-elect Donald Trump.As a parade of experts spent Wednesday morning discussing farming practices, hunger and food waste at the inaugural Chicago Food Tank summit, the election was generally only alluded to, typically accompanied with a chorus of groans and loud sighs.That was until Juliette Majot took to the podium.“It is amazing to me that I’ve heard very little about the election we just experienced today,” Majot, executive director of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy environmental nonprofit, said.Majot expressed her frustration that issues like farming and food systems were hardly mentioned during the presidential campaign, and that climate change denier Myron Ebell has been chosen by Trump to lead the transition at the Environmental Protection Agency.“We cannot normalize what is going on,” Majot continued. “We absolutely must place agriculture and food into the context of society and into the context of our political structure.”There are plenty of legitimate reasons that advocates for healthier and more sustainably produced food are concerned about a Trump administration.While Trump’s campaign did not respond to a HuffPost survey on food issues that was distributed to all the major party candidates earlier this year, and he has released few public indications of his positions on food policies, the minimal evidence thus far points to a White House far less concerned with the sustainability of food.This week, one member of Trump’s agriculture advisory committee, U.S. Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-Ala.), told CBS News that he “would be very surprised if we don’t see some major changes on the school lunch program” under Trump, showing that improvements to the program made under the Obama administration may be threatened.Food safety advancements also appear to be at risk. In a fact sheet posted to Trump’s campaign website in September, the campaign called for “eliminating” “the FDA food police,” which the paper blamed for over-inspecting food facilities. The sheet was later removed from the website and replaced with a new one that did not mention the FDA.Beyond Trump’s selection of Ebell to lead the transition of the EPA, the president-elect has also repeatedly threatened to altogether eliminate the agency, which works to ensure that farming and ranching operations don’t negatively impact human health or the environment.In a more recent development, Trump’s selection of agribusiness lobbyist Michael Torrey, who is reportedly heading the administration’s transition of the Department of Agriculture, has also raised eyebrows.According to Open Secrets, Torrey’s firm’s biggest recent clients have included the soda-touting American Beverage Association, the Crop Insurance and Reinsurance Bureau, the Snack Food Association and pizza giant Little Caesar’s — all groups whose interests would appear to run counter to those of the “good food” movement.In addition, a “talking points” document reportedly created for Trump’s ag advisory committee obtained this week by Politico vowed to “defend American agriculture against its critics, particularly those who have never grown or produced anything beyond a backyard tomato plant” and return to conventional, as opposed to organic, farming methods.Danielle Nierenberg, Food Tank cofounder and president, admitted that the election of the fast food-loving Trump is “a different fight than many of us [in the food movement] anticipated.” But she is not dwelling on it.“The country elected [Trump] and we have to work with him. A lot of us are not happy about it, but now we need to move forward,” Nierenberg said.She did point to signs of hope in the appointment of two members of Trump’s ag advisory committee: former California secretary of food and agriculture A.G. Kawamura, who Nierenberg called a “big proponent” of urban farming, and U.S. Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas), current chairman of the House Agriculture Committee and a “really good guy” she is optimistic will be open to hearing from food advocates.Nierenberg is hopeful that individuals like them will be open to concerns about sustainability and ethics in our food system over the next four years.“We have to find people on that side of the debate who will really listen to us and are open to different viewpoints and possibilities,” Nierenberg added. “But we have to make those inroads. We just don’t have a choice now.”―-Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food and water.

84,THE WORLDPOST,Saudi Arabian Artist Fights To Make Her Country Treat Women Like Adults,Sara Elkamel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/saudi-arabia-artist-male-guardianship_us_582b2a5be4b060adb5704ad5,"The country's male guardianship laws stop women from traveling, marrying or leaving prison without a man's permission.",2016-11-18,"The Australia-based Saudi artist Ms Saffaa created this image with a woman wearing traditional male headwear, with text that reads ""I am my own guardian.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582b2d08180000f5035043eb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Women in Saudi Arabia are ramping up an online campaign against their country’s guardianship laws ― a repressive system that bars women from traveling abroad, marrying or leaving prison without permission from a male guardian. Saudi women have difficulty pursuing various tasks without their guardians’ permission, including renting apartments, studying abroad or filing legal claims. A damning Human Rights Watch report released in July described the system as “the most significant impediment to women’s rights in the country.”A woman’s father or husband is typically her guardian, but a brother or a son can also take the role.Close to 15,000 people have now signed an online petition started in September calling for an end to the guardianship laws. Saudi women’s rights activists have also launched the hashtag #IAmMyOwnGuardian, which people are using to discuss and condemn the laws.Saudi Arabia had agreed to end male guardianship in 2013, following a review by the United Nations Human Rights Council. But while it has recently implemented various reforms, including giving women voting rights, allowing them to run for municipal offices and pushing them into the labor market, the Saudi government has failed to deliver on its promises to abolish the guardianship system itself.An image that has come to symbolize this campaign features a woman wearing the shemagh ― the headdress traditionally worn by Saudi men ― with a banner reading “I Am My Own Guardian” across the bottom half of her face.The creator of the image is Ms Saffaa, a Sydney-based Saudi artist, researcher and cultural activist. (She chooses not to use her full name to protect her identity.) Ms Saffaa’s previous projects, exhibited predominantly in Australia, have tackled gender politics and celebrated female activism in Saudi Arabia. Her works featuring women wearing the shemagh, like the one now part of the #IAmMyOwnGuardian campaign, originally debuted at the Sydney College of Arts in 2012.Ms Saffaa spoke to The WorldPost about her artwork, the campaign and her hopes for Saudi Arabia.The image you created for the campaign is very striking. Can you tell us a little bit about the composition and the design? I used the shemagh, or the male headdress, as a cultural icon and as a symbol of empowerment. When I was younger, I used to wear a thawb [a robe-like garment worn by men] and a shemagh around the house just for fun. There’s a little bit of innocent play in cross-dressing ― there’s nothing subversive about it when you do it when you’re younger. But once you start growing up and the division between what’s feminine and what’s masculine becomes really clear, and society tells you what to wear and what not to wear, confronting all that becomes subversive. A lot of people have been responding to my images by telling me how problematic they think the shemagh is. Because they think that if the shemagh is a symbol of power ― and the shemagh belongs to a man ― then doesn’t that mean that my power belongs to a man? And I say: in this country, it does belong to a man. So I’m just taking the power back and putting it on my head.I’m quite excited that the work has created a lot of conversation about gender issues and the fluidity of gender. People don’t understand me when I say gender is quite fluid ― it’s not what you wear ― it’s who you are.You recently told an interviewer “my art is my way of showing that I exist.” Can you elaborate on that? My whole life has been a political statement. Just by leaving Saudi, and getting a scholarship to study art ― a scholarship I had to fight for. And when I was living in Australia without a guardian, and I was repeatedly asked [by Saudi authorities] to prove that I had a guardian present, that was a political statement on its own. My artwork is a way of asserting that I exist within a world that just wants to silence me or wants to basically erase my identity.I have to fight for existence, I have to fight for my voice, I have to fight for just living. I can’t exist without fighting. My whole life has been one big fight.Do you feel that your work, and the artwork being produced by other female Saudi artists, is taking back ownership of the representation of Saudi women?That’s exactly why I make the art I make. If I don’t represent myself, if I don’t assert that I am here, people are going to always take it upon themselves to represent me. If I’m not making art about who I am, people will make art about me. I call people who make art about cultures that they don’t belong to and that the don’t have ties to, cultural opportunists. And Saudi women have always been the flavor of the month, every month, since 9/11 actually.There’s been work coming from Saudi artists, particularly women, like Sarah Abu Abdallah or Manal Al Dowayen, about topics like women and driving or travel permits. Do you feel like artists are playing a role in trying to expand the rights of Saudi women? Honestly, I have looked at a lot of work coming out of Saudi that is, in a way, feminist, but I find that a lot of female artists, with the exception of a couple, tip-toe around the issues, they don’t tackle them head-on.I feel like the art is a little shy. It does tackle some feminist issues like travel permits and driving, but these are not central to the main issue. The main issue is guardianship laws. Because if [lawmakers] allow us to drive tomorrow, a lot of women are not going to drive because they have assholes for male guardians. So you have to tackle the big issue which is the male guardianship laws. I think this is part of the reason why this movement has been so successful ― arguably more successful than the driving campaign. Because male guardianship laws make up the quintessential symbol of oppression. That’s the real issue. Of course driving and freedom of travel is essential to women’s freedom, but it comes as a second step. You’re currently working on a mural in Melbourne connected to the campaign. Can you tell us more about it?It’s a 9-by-4.5-meter wall. I wasn’t too sure what to do with the wall, and then the movement happened, and everyone was sharing my work and sharing my stuff, the vision started coming to me. I’m collaborating with other artists, but I’m also collaborating with some women from the movement. I asked some women to write statements in Arabic, in their own handwriting, so I can screen-print them and stick them on the wall. I am actually taking a lot of the feedback and criticism about my use of the male headdress and I’m trying to work around it. I’m going to use some Arabic poetry as well, there’s going to be a lot of imagery, a lot of portraits.It’s interesting how you’re using different mediums to express similar ideas for this one campaign. I feel like it’s an ethical responsibility. I don’t only want to share only my own voice or my take on it, because that would be very selfish. We artists can be self-centered ― but I really wanted to include other voice of these brave women tweeting from inside of Saudi. I honestly don’t know if I would have done all this if I were based in Saudi.I wanted to give back to these women who instigated the movement. I wanted to celebrate their bravery and shine some light on how dangerous what they’re doing is, and how awesome and brilliant and inspiring it is to do what they’re doing. It’s easy for me to sit here thousands and thousands of miles away from Saudi and criticize the system, but it’s the work of these women that needs to be celebrated. What are your hopes for the campaign? I really, really want male guardianship laws to be abolished. As law and as cultural practices. I wish Saudi men and women would realize that these are not Islamic laws: these are man-made laws. Saudi women’s rights activist Manal Al Sharif said something really interesting at Forum 2000 in Prague: “We’ve been taught that god assigned us a guardian, and it takes courage to question that.” This interview has been edited for clarity.

Mark Takano (D-Calif.), whose parents and grandparents were imprisoned after Japan’s 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, called on the president-elect to denounce Carl Higbie, a former spokesman for a pro-Trump political action committee who cited the shameful chapter in history in his case for a Muslim registry.“I am horrified that people connected to the incoming Administration are using my family’s experience as a precedent for what President-elect Trump could do,” Takano said in a press release. He said mass internments were “one of the darkest chapters in American history.” Comments like Higbie’s, he added, “confirm many Americans’ worst fears about the Trump Administration.”“They reflect an alarming resurgence of racism and xenophobia in our political discourse,” Takano said.Takano was among lawmakers who decried remarks this week by leading Trump supporters advocating a Muslim registry. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, reportedly under consideration to be Trump’s attorney general, told Reuters this week that he is proposing to create a registry of immigrants from Muslim countries for Trump’s review. Higbe pressed the case for a registry, calling the mass internment of Japanese-Americans a “precedent.”“We’ve done it with Iran back awhile ago. We did it during World War II with the Japanese,” Higbie told Fox News’ Megyn Kelly on Wednesday. “I’m just saying there is precedent for it.”Higbie told The New York Times on Thursday he “fundamentally” disagreed with internment camps, but he stood by his remarks, saying there is “historic, factual precedent to do things not politically popular and sometimes not right, in the interest of national security.”Rep. Doris Matsui (D-Calif.), who was born in the Arizona desert in an internment camp in 1944, called Higbie’s suggestion “outrageous, unacceptable, and reckless.”In a statement on Twitter, Matsui invoked the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, signed by then-President Ronald Reagan, in which the government issued a formal apology to Japanese-Americans and deemed the World War II internment camps unjustified and the result of “race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership.”“We cannot go backwards,” Matsui said. “The United States of America must remain a safe haven for people of all faiths and origins, and a model for tolerance, justice, and liberty.”Other lawmakers speaking out against Higbie include Sens. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), and several members of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, including Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.). Chu shared an assortment of old identification cards based on religion and race.The lawmakers implored Trump not repeat the shameful mistakes of the past. If he does, with a registry for Muslim-Americans or immigrants, the lawmakers said they will fight back.“No one should go through what my family ... suffered regardless of their race or religion or any other way they would choose to try and divide us,” said Rep. Mike Honda (D-Calif.), who lived three years in internment camps as a child.“Now today, I tell Mr. Trump that to re-enact a policy fueled by prejudice is uncivilized, un-American and unworthy of a president sworn to uphold our Constitution.”"

During the election campaign, Obama and many of these leaders did not mince words about their distaste for Trump. The president-elect’s plans for U.S.-European cooperation ― including the U.S. role in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Russia’s activity in Ukraine and the campaign against the so-called Islamic State ― remain totally uncertain.Not to mention that many Europeans are particularly wary of Trump as they watch extreme-right leaders across their own continent lavish praise on him.In a meeting Friday with the leaders of Great Britan, France, Italy and Spain, Obama urged his counterparts to work with Trump on the “basis of the core values that define the United States and Europe as open democracies,” according to the White House.That’s a 180-degree shift from Obama’s overwhelmingly negative portrayal of the GOP nominee until only a few weeks ago, when he slammed Trump’s behavior as “dark, pessimistic fear-mongering.”Nonetheless, Obama has also used his world tour to offer Trump advice.“My hope is that the president-elect coming in takes a similarly constructive approach of finding areas where we cooperate with Russia, where our values and interests align, but that the president-elect is also willing to stand up to Russia where they are deviating from our values and international norms,” Obama said Thursday, taking a subtle stab at Trump’s calls for a rapprochement with Russia. He also warned that leading a country “demands seriousness.”“If you’re not serious about the job, then you probably won’t be there very long,” he said.Leaders across Europe responded to Trump’s shocking election victory with muted respect, even though many have criticized him in the past. Merkel said Thursday that she plans to approach his presidency “with an open mind.” But just last week she issued a veiled criticism, saying that their relationship would only be productive if Trump upheld “the dignity of man, independent of origin.”Trump touted the idea of banning Muslims from the U.S. throughout his campaign; now, his transition team has floated the idea of forcing Muslims to register. Obama and Merkel developed an especially close relationship in the last eight years, despite a few hiccups ― in particular, the revelation that the National Security Agency had been tapping Merkel’s phone.They wistfully said farewell on Thursday during a joint news conference. Obama referred to Merkel as an “outstanding partner” and thanked her for her “deep friendship.” He even said he would vote for her if he could.“It is hard to say goodbye,” Merkel said."

Special Rapporteur Francois Crépeau are among the most critical to date by the international agency of Australia’s controversial detention policies. They come amid a global debate on how to manage huge numbers of asylum seekers displaced by conflict.“These children show signs of [post-traumatic stress disorder], anxiety, depression and have symptoms such as insomnia, nightmares and bedwetting. This is not acceptable,” said Crépeau.Crépeau, one of just a handful of international observers to go to the detention center on the tiny South Pacific island of Nauru, said children were bearing the brunt of Australia’s harsh offshore detention policy.Under Australian law, asylum seekers intercepted trying to reach the country by boat are sent for processing at camps on Nauru and on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea. Almost 1,200 people are being held indefinitely in the camps.Australia reintroduced offshore detention in 2013 after a spate of maritime arrivals and drownings at sea. Roundly criticized, its harsh immigration policy has bipartisan support and is an important issue among Australian voters.Australia’s Department of Immigration said in a statement it “does not accept some of the preliminary observations” made by Crépeau and that its policy complied with “international obligations and human rights principles.”Crépeau also rejected Australia’s claim that Nauru and PNG were responsible for the offshore processing centers.The criticism of Australia’s policy of indefinite detention of would-be asylum seekers came days after the United States agreed to take a “substantial” number of those held on Manus Island and Nauru.That followed Australia agreeing to join a U.S plan to resettle Central American refugees being held in Costa Rica.The deals raise the prospect that those seeking asylum in Australia could be settled in the United States, while those in Costa Rica could be settled in Australia.The U.S.-Australia deal may yet be scuppered because it will require approval from U.S. President-elect Trump.Crépeau also criticized Australia’s policy of mandatory detention for those who arrive in Australia without necessary visas, which he said violated international law.“Many of them are on a regular diet of happy pills in the morning and sleeping tablets in the evening,” he said."

Attorneys for the state filed a motion Thursday to stay the order while they appeal the decision in a lawsuit brought by several advocacy groups.“The herculean effort required by the court order would be on the magnitude of a large-scale military operation,” Anna Heaton, spokeswoman for Gov. Rick Snyder (R), wrote in a statement emailed to The Huffington Post. “The resources to accomplish this would only be available through the activation of the National Guard or the hiring of several logistics companies.” The state’s motion says it would cost at least $10.5 million monthly to deliver the estimated 400,000 cases of water each week, and warns that using Flint relief money for water delivery could defund other efforts like nutritional assistance programs for kids. Lawson’s order “increases the scope of the State’s emergency response to an unnecessary and insurmountable degree,” according to the state’s filing.“It’s sad that the State of Michigan continues to disenfranchise the community of Flint,” Pastor Allen Overton with the Concerned Pastors for Social Action said in a statement. The group is one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit.“What happened to Governor Snyder’s pledge that he would work to fix Flint’s drinking water crisis? This action today inflicts more harm on a city that’s already hurting,” Overton added.The state argues that 90 percent of houses and most apartments have water filters installed, bottled water is available at pickup locations throughout the city and responders already have a system to deliver water to residents who can’t pick it up on their own. The state does not have to deliver water to households if they verify that they have working water filters installed, Lawson wrote. The problem is that providing filters hasn’t guaranteed that they are installed or used correctly, he said. Lawson also noted testimony from residents who hadn’t been able to receive water despite state efforts.“[The plaintiffs’] evidence raises serious questions as to the efficacy of the emergency response,” he wrote. “Indeed, the endeavor of hunting for water has become a dominant activity in some Flint residents’ daily lives.” The brief cited the drawback of adding millions of plastic bottles to Flint’s trash and recycling, which Heaton called a “potential public health risk.”  They also said logistical issues would be a major hurdle: It might be impossible to find a warehouse big enough to store the necessary water and they’d have to obtain more than 100 new trucks, the motion states.In 2014, after Flint left Detroit’s water system and started drawing water from the Flint River, residents began complaining about their tap water’s smell, taste and appearance, and claimed it was causing health issues. Michigan’s Department of Environmental Quality initially denied that there were any issues with the water.The city, under the state’s direction, had failed to treat the water with chemicals that prevent corrosion, allowing lead that lines pipes to leach into the water. Any amount of lead exposure is a health risk, particularly for young children, and can stunt their brain development.State and federal regulators eventually confirmed that water samples at Flint homes had dangerous levels of lead and acknowledged a pediatrician’s findings that the number of children in the city with elevated lead levels in their blood had increased dramatically. The city switched back to the Detroit water system, which draws from Lake Huron, last fall. In the aftermath, Snyder and Obama both declared emergencies in Flint at the beginning of this year, and the state began recovery efforts. The state offered free water filters to residents and has begun replacing lead service lines. In June, the Environmental Protection Agency announced that properly filtered water in the city was safe to drink.Both Snyder and the the federal government have been widely condemned for their handling of the water crisis, with some critics calling the denial of an essential service to the city’s predominantly black residents, many who are poor, a case of environmental racism.  The Natural Resources Defense Council, one of the plaintiffs in the current lawsuit, criticized Michigan for again denying help to residents.“Seeking to delay the federal court order that the State immediately fix Flint’s water crisis is an obvious insult to the people of Flint, whose tap water has been contaminated with lead for more than two years,” NRDC Midwest Director Henry Henderson said in a statement.

90,POLITICS,Donald Trump's Top Adviser Has A Potential $2.7 Billion Obamacare Conflict Of Interest,Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-advisor-potential-obamacare-conflict-interest_us_582efabde4b030997bbeda96,The fate of Josh Kushner's healthcare startup Oscar could be swayed by an Obamacare overhaul.,2016-11-18,"Republican President-elect Donald Trump and his daughter Ivanka Trump embrace on Nov. 9, as he stands next to wife, Melania Trump, while Jared Kushner and Tiffany Trump look on.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582f045c1700002500e7b2ed.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There’s nothing odd about the founders of a health insurance company writing policy proposals after an election where the winner campaigned relentlessly on ending Obamacare.And Wednesday morning, Mario Schlosser and Josh Kushner, the founders of Oscar, a health care startup that sells insurance on the state exchanges Obamacare created, did just that. They say they want more competition in the insurance industry, and they think allowing individuals to buy health care plans with pre-tax dollars would make that happen. Oscar’s founders also expressed openness to ideas Republicans have floated in the past.What’s interesting in this case is that Kushner is the brother of Jared Kushner, who is married to Ivanka Trump, the eldest daughter of President-elect Donald Trump. Jared Kushner is also serving on the executive committee of the presidential transition, and could potentially take a senior job in the White House. Venture capitalist and Facebook board member Peter Thiel, who also sits on the executive committee of the presidential transition, is also an investor in Oscar. A spokeswoman for Josh Kushner and Oscar declined to comment beyond his blog post. Spokespeople for Thiel and the Trump transition did not return requests for comment.Anti-nepotism laws bar Kushner from taking a paid job in the White House, though he is exploring getting around that rule by taking an unpaid role advising his father-in-law, The New York Times reports. On the campaign trail, Trump railed against Obamacare and promised to replace it with something better ― though he never said what his alternative was exactly. He told The Wall Street Journal last week that he may try the virtually impossible task of keeping popular parts of the law, like allowing children to stay on their parents’ plans into their 20s and barring insurance companies from denying coverage due to pre-existing conditions, while still reducing costs. But in all likelihood, any changes a Trump administration and a Republican-controlled Congress make would be far more favorable to insurance companies. That would create the potential for a conflict of interest ― or in the very least, the appearance of one ― if Oscar were a run-of-the-mill health insurance company. But the potential is amplified due to the fact that Oscar was started for the express purpose of making money on the state exchanges for individual insurance. Oscar sells insurance through its website and app directly to individuals who aren’t covered by employer insurance or a government program. Individuals who aren’t covered are required to buy insurance or pay a penalty under what is called the individual mandate. The federal government partially subsidizes the plans that Oscar sells. Precisely how big that subsidy depends on the type of plan and how much money the person buying it makes. Federal conflict of interest rules say executive branch employees can’t make decisions that affect their family’s finances. That means that even if Jared Kushner accepted a job in the White House, which he has not yet, his brother Josh’s business falls outside the scope of the conflict of interest laws for federal employees. However, “there might be some question of whether it is appropriate to weigh in on decisions that have an enormous impact on [his] brother’s assets,”  said Richard Painter, a University of Minnesota law professor who was the chief ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush. Painter, who endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, said he would put Oscar “fairly low down the alleged conflicts of interest in the incoming Trump administration.” But the conflict is emblematic, he said, of “how the private sector responded to Obamacare.” If Obamacare is repealed, a Trump administration is “going to be hurting a lot of people who invested in the system the way it is now... People they know and people they don’t know who depend on government being predictable.”Oscar “may be a conflict that helps to temper their decision-making,” Painter said.Whether the Trump administration’s decisions could put Oscar on a stable financial path is unclear. The company lost $45 million in just the past three months, and a total of more than $230 million in the past 21 months.Like other insurance companies, Oscar’s founders thought that the new individual marketplaces that Obamacare created would be a large and profitable. While some insurers have profitably sold insurance on the exchanges, Oscar has been unable to. Oscar has spent heavily on cute ads ― it’s hard not to see them if you ride the New York City subway ― but most people opt for established brands like Blue Cross and Blue Shield or Cigna.Oscar is also different from the massive insurance companies in that it doesn’t have a diversified revenue stream like corporate plans or government health care programs. That means that while companies like Aetna can choose to either absorb losses in the individual plan market or simply pull out and focus its business elsewhere (Aetna choose the latter in August). Oscar has to date raised a reported $400 million in venture capital because Oscar is losing money on Obamacare, and Obamacare is Oscar’s entire business.Indeed, the core bet of Oscar ― that a startup with a slick app could outsmart the entire insurance industry ― is belied by who has managed to be successful selling plans on the exchanges: companies with a track record of selling plans to individual buyers. That’s experience you don’t get coding apps.But only Oscar has an intimate connection to a top adviser to President-elect Trump. "

Ever year, she takes photos of some of the animals to be used in a calendar, and this year’s theme was children’s books and fairy tales.“This year the theme of the photosession [was] children books and fairy tales, because they teach us that we can reach a happy ending even through hard times and that each of us can be a hero,” Totaro wrote on BoredPanda.It’s difficult to choose a favorite photo, Totaro told The Huffington Post, but she said that one of the most moving experiences was working with Opicina, the rabbit in the Secret Garden-themed photo.“It was the most magical moment of the photoshoot,” Totaro said, explaining that the photos capture the first moments the rabbit had ever spent outside — in a carefully fenced area, of course.“It was the first time she felt grass underneath her feet, and she moved in a delicate way,” Totaro said. “When she stood up I took the picture that later we decided to use in the calendar, but all the pictures taken are precious to me, because they tell her first steps in a brand, bright new life.”The images aren’t just incredibly adorable — they also carry an important message about the animals that often spend their lives in lab. Totaro noted she is not a professional photographer, but that these photo shoots combine two of her greatest passions — photography and animal rights.“Many people have no idea that animals previously used in labs can start a new, pain-free life and make gorgeous life companions, or that rats are a lot of fun and among the most clever animals, or that guinea pigs ‘sing’ all together when they hear someone handle food,” she said. “These animals were considered objects for the first part of their lives … what the volunteers do is [make] them feel and be wonderful sentient live beings again, and with my pictures I try to celebrate their new precious lives and to raise awareness about how gorgeous they are.”Those interested in purchasing a calendar — the proceeds from which go to La Collina dei Conigli’s animal care — can email lacollinadeiconiglionlus@gmail.com.

92,POLITICS,Long-Shot Push To Force Senate To Confirm Merrick Garland Fails In Federal Court,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/merrick-garland-senate-lawsuit_us_582e49fce4b099512f820e7c,The lawsuit was dead on arrival. But it made a good point.,2016-11-18,Even Merrick Garland would've agreed that this case stood no chance.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― No sir, you cannot sue the Senate over its unprecedented obstruction of the president’s Supreme Court nominee.That’s what a federal judge ruled Thursday in dismissing the case of a New Mexico citizen who sued Sens. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) over their refusal to hold a floor vote for Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama’s choice to sit on the high court.Garland has been twiddling his thumbs for eight months waiting for Senate action. In July, he broke the record as the nominee who has waited the longest in history for confirmation.The plaintiff, a lawyer from Santa Fe, New Mexico, alleged that the two Republican senators ― who hold leadership positions and have direct control over whether Garland gets a confirmation vote ― had robbed him of his constitutional right to Senate representation.This is where the argument gets interesting. It turns out New Mexico’s two senators, Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich ― both Democrats ― have met with Garland, and heartily support his nomination to fill the seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia.But both McConnell and Grassley haven’t lifted a finger to move the Garland confirmation, which the lawyer who brought the case, Steven Michel, said violated his Seventeenth Amendment right “to elect his senators by depriving his home-state senators of a voice in the Senate.”No dice. U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras in Washington ruled that Michel had no legal right to sue the top Senate Republicans because the injury he claimed was too generalized and would require the judicial branch to resolve a problem best left to the political process.Quoting from earlier precedent, Contreras said it “would be unwise to permit the federal courts to become a higher legislature where a congressman who has failed to persuade his colleagues can always renew the battle.”The judge added that allowing this kind of case to move forward would open the door to “suits from all citizens who feel that their representatives have been treated unfairly by the legislative process.”This kind of case, in other words, is not allowed by the Constitution’s limits on judicial authority to hear cases. (The Supreme Court last month declined a similar long-shot bid to get the Senate to act on Garland.)Reached for comment about the ruling, Michel, who practices environmental law in New Mexico and represented himself in this case, told The Huffington Post he hadn’t yet decided whether to appeal ― in part because there’s so little time left in the Senate’s current session.But he said he’d have a better shot if Contreras hadn’t thrown out the case on procedural grounds.“If this case were decided on the merits, I think there is a strong case that the Constitution does not allow the Senate to just ignore a Supreme Court nominee,” Michel said in an email.The legal reality is much harsher: The Constitution says nothing about an affirmative Senate duty to act on any nominee from the president. It leaves it up to them to fight it out."
