If last years winter coat didn’t cut it or has seen better days, it might be time to replace it. If you’re looking to make a more conscious choice when it comes to your winter coat you might want to avoid jackets filled with down feathers. The filling is commonly used in coats and comforters, but has come under scrutiny for the harm it can cause to geese. The good news is, along with vegan leather and faux fur, there are a lot of down-alternatives available that that are better for your conscience and your wallet.That’s why we’ve scoured the internet for cruelty-free coats that are not only warm, but animal friendly. Most of these coats are made using synthetic down or down alternative fillings, and some even use recycled materials for a more sustainable jacket. We’ve even found a coat made of recycled down, for folks who are concerned with reusing and recyclingSee below for 12 of our favorite cruelty-free coat picks:"
3,WEIRD NEWS,Aging Punk Rockers Have A Message For The Kids: 'F**k Youth!',David Moye,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/superbean-f-youth_us_5a5676efe4b03bc4d03d9f96,Smells like senior citizen spirit.,2018-01-10,"Superbean, a Los Angeles punk band, performs it's new song, 'F**k Youth.'",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a5678112000003c0057d74b.png?cache=EwACVDYlrZ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Punk rock has been around for more than four decades, which means the original creators are old enough for social security (or at least AARP cards).Yet the genre still maintains its youthful appeal as anyone who has been snarled at by a teen wearing a Ramones T-shirt can attest.That’s why old school punks can relate to a new song by a bunch of cranky old musicians called, appropriately enough, “Fuck Youth.”The Los Angeles-based punk group Superbean performs the song that doesn’t mince words:“Kids today think they’re so greatThey think they really got it madeGOT IT MADE!When I was their age it was so much coolerWhen I got older I found out the truthFUCK YOUTH!”And, yes, the video for the song features an old guy yelling, “You kids get off my lawn!”Steve Moramarco, the group’s 51-year-old guitarist, insists he’s “not anti-youth,” but “Fuck Youth” is the type of song every generation sings.“In the old days punk rock was about the kids, the ‘wild youth’ in the streets,” he told HuffPost. “Today all the punks are old and it’s the kids that are the problem.”The song seems to be striking a chord with people who’ve been moshing since back in the day.The video was posted on Facebook earlier this week and already has more than 110,000 views, and Moramarco said he’s receiving positive remarks from as far away as Brazil and Switzerland.Despite the song’s angry old man point of view, Moramarco does sympathize with the surly teens he sees snarling at him in their safety-pinned Sex Pistols shirts.“I see kids today wearing the same t-shirts of punk bands I wore when I was growing up,” he said. “They know their bands suck and ours rule.”In true punk fashion, Moramarco doesn’t know what the future holds for the band or the song, but admits that the objectives of being an aging punk are different than when he was 21.“Being punk at 51 is staying out of the pit and drinking La Croix,” he said."
4,POLITICS,Insurer To Cover Dying Activist's Breathing Machine After Twitter Campaign,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ady-barkan-healtnet-breathing-machine_us_5a566911e4b0a300f90559f8,Ady Barkan used his new following to get help -- and draw attention to the flaws in our health care system.,2018-01-10,"Ady Barkan, center, participates in a protest earlier this month for a ""clean"" Dream Act outside the Los Angeles office of Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a566a051d000027005c3555.jpeg?cache=ZLO9OMQhRg&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The California-based insurance company HealthNet agreed to cover a breathing assistance machine for Ady Barkan, a 34-year-old progressive activist afflicted with ALS, after his complaints about the company went viral on Twitter.The company had initially refused to cover the costs of the machine on the grounds that it was “experimental,” according to Barkan.“I’m looking forward to hopefully sleeping better at night and breathing better at night. But I think it’s outrageous that I needed to complain publicly,” Barkan told HuffPost.HealthNet did not immediately respond to a HuffPost request for comment on Barkan’s version of events.Barkan’s successful efforts to pressure the company also epitomize his commitment to using his personal struggles to draw attention to larger policy problems ― in this case, flaws in private health insurance. He expressed hope that his ordeal would shed light on the difficulties facing other Americans without the benefit of his platform.“I’m confident [HealthNet] would not have moved so quickly if I did not have a big Twitter following,” he said. “I know millions of people are denied necessary care every year even though they are entitled to it. That’s a pretty unjust way to run a health care system.”Barkan, a leader of the grassroots activism group Center for Popular Democracy, was diagnosed in October 2016 with ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease ― a terminal illness with no known cure that slowly paralyzes its victims.Barkan’s doctor recently recommended he get a Trilogy breathing assistance machine to relieve ALS-driven difficulties he has developed while lying flat on his bed.But HealthNet, Barkan’s insurer, refused to cover the device, Barkan wrote in a Tuesday tweet that was retweeted over 11,000 times as of Wednesday afternoon.If HealthNet had refused to cover the machine, it would have put Barkan on the hook for out-of-pocket costs potentially in the thousands of dollars to obtain one.In subsequent tweets, Barkan argued that his difficulty obtaining coverage for the machine spoke to problems with the United States’ private, for-profit insurance system.“Instead of focusing on providing quality care, our system prioritizes shifting costs and maximizing profits,” he wrote.A day later, HealthNet contacted Barkan to inform him that they would cover the device, he said.Barkan, who lives in Santa Barbara, California, gained national attention for his prominent role in December protests against the Republican tax cut bill. In repeated visits to Capitol Hill, some of which earned him arrests for acts of civil disobedience, he framed the bill as a verdict on his own life. He cited the potentially deadly harm that cuts to Medicare it was likely to set in motion would cause him ― and millions of other Americans.A chance encounter with Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) during a plane ride back to California made him a viral sensation. Along with other activists, he later met with Sen. Susan Collins (R-Me.).Barkan’s use of his own moving story to personalize the effects of the legislation earned him a national following.He now has over 45,000 Twitter followers, providing him a platform to yet again leverage his personal dilemma to raise awareness of a glaring social ill ― and secure help for himself in the process.Barkan’s experience, he said, “reinforces the need to protect Medicare and Medicaid, which do not make these kinds of profit-driven decisions and which provide health care to enormous numbers of people.”In the coming months, Barkan plans to hit the road to protect those programs ― and get the country on the path to single payer health care, or “Medicare for all.”He believes that the best way to accomplish that is a “progressive tidal-wave, tsunami election in November” that ensures a Democratic takeover of Congress.In conjunction with Center for Popular Democracy Action as well as other groups ― including the Working Families Party, Women’s March and MoveOn.org ― Barkan is due to campaign for Democrats in key races.“I’m going to be telling this story all around the country and try to mobilize volunteers and voters to resist the upcoming cuts to the safety net that [House Speaker] Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and [President] Donald Trump are planning,” Barkan said.In the near term, Barkan has been lending his voice to the campaign for passage of a so-called “clean” Dream Act, which would make permanent ― without any concessions to Republicans ― the legal protection available to undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.He joined Dreamers in a protest outside California Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s Los Angeles office last week to press the issue. And he plans to join them again for protests on Thursday and Friday at the local offices of several Republican House members from Southern California and the state’s Central Valley."
5,POLITICS,"Trump Decries MS-13, Yet Plans To Send Thousands Back Into Their Grip In El Salvador",Sarah Ruiz-Grossman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-ms-13-tps-el-salvador_us_5a53ef51e4b01e1a4b18b575,"The Trump administration is ending temporary protected status for about 200,000 Salvadorans living in the U.S.",2018-01-09,The MS-13 gang poses a significant risk to residents of El Salvador.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a53f2872000003c0057d114.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Trump administration, which has repeatedly warned of the threat of gang violence and specifically of the MS-13 gang, just announced the end of immigration protections for thousands of Salvadorans living in the U.S, which will force many to return to a country where MS-13 is a serious problem. The Department of Homeland Security announced on Monday that the Trump administration will end temporary protected status (TPS) for about 200,000 Salvadorans living in the U.S. Immigrants from El Salvador had been granted the protections in 2001, after earthquakes devastated the country. Now those individuals ― who have been living in the U.S. legally for the past 17 years or more, and many of whom have children who are U.S. citizens ― will have to leave by September 2019 or face deportation, if they don’t find another way to gain legal status. Those forced to return will go back to a country with one of the highest homicide rates in the world and a serious gang violence problem. One of the biggest gangs is MS-13, or Mara Salvatrucha ― a gang started in Los Angeles in the 1980s that then spread to other cities in the U.S. and Central America, namely El Salvador.President Donald Trump regularly calls out the threat of MS-13 on Twitter and in speeches, often while calling for stricter immigration enforcement.Yet the administration is now forcing thousands to potentially have to return to El Salvador, where violence by the gang poses a significant risk to residents.“The Trump administration is on the one hand decrying the danger of gang violence, and on the other sending families who have lived in this country for years back into the arms of those very dangerous gangs,” Eleanor Acer, senior director at Human Rights First, told HuffPost on Monday.“People’s lives are on the line,” Acer added. “And the administration clearly knows about the grave dangers in El Salvador.”DHS officials told reporters in a call on Monday that in making the decision to end TPS, the agency had considered El Salvador’s recovery since the 2001 earthquakes. Since that was the reason for the initial designation, it had not considered gang violence as a factor.The U.S. government has called MS-13, which has about 30,000 members in the U.S, El Salvador and other countries, “one of the most dangerous and rapidly expanding criminal gangs in the world today.” Attorney General Jeff Sessions even announced a new designation for the gang last year, to enable a stronger law enforcement response to the group in the U.S. “Ironically while administration officials have repeatedly and very publicly asserted concerns about the dangers of gang violence, they’re certainly not hesitating to put many families who have lived in the U.S. for years, and their U.S. citizen children, at risk,” Acer said.Salvadorans living in the U.S. under TPS ― who have, on average, lived in the country for over two decades and have around 190,000 U.S.-born children ― will now join the ranks of about 50,000 Haitians and 2,500 Nicaraguans, who lost TPS protections last year. These families will have to decide whether to return to their countries with their children ― countries some of their kids have never known ― or leave them behind. “We’re talking about deporting your neighbor, who has lived here legally, has bought a house, is employed or started a business,” Human Rights Watch senior researcher Clara Long told HuffPost. “Think about how many people who have made lives and contributed to this country are now going to be living in situations of severe vulnerability.”Combined with the almost 700,000 young immigrants who saw their Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals protections ended last year as well, that makes nearly 1 million immigrants who will soon be at risk of deportation."

In a statement released by Nichols’ attorney, the former elite gymnast alleged that Nassar sexually abused her “numerous times,” starting when she was 15 years old. “Recently, three of my friends and former National Team members who medaled at the 2012 Olympics have bravely stepped forward to proclaim they were sexually assaulted by USA Gymnastics Team physician Dr. Larry Nassar,” Nichols said in the statement, obtained by Time magazine. “Today I join them.”Nichols said she was the first victim to alert USA Gymnastics of Nassar’s abuse in 2015, which subsequently led to his arrest in 2016. She wrote that she was discussing Nassar’s treatment with a teammate during practice one day when a coach overheard.“I had never told my coach about these treatments,” Nichols said. “After hearing our conversation she asked me more questions about it and said it doesn’t seem right ... so she did the right thing and reported this abuse to the USA Gymnastics staff.” Nassar has been accused of serial sexual abuse by over 125 young women, including elite gymnasts Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas and McKayla Maroney. All of the victims claim that Nassar abused them during routine medical exams; some say they were as young as 12 at the time of the alleged abuse. The disgraced physician pleaded guilty to 10 counts of first-degree sexual misconduct in November and is awaiting sentencing. The 54-year-old was sentenced to 60 years in prison in December for possessing child pornography. Nichols began competing as a top-tier gymnast when she was 13 and made the U.S. Women’s National team at 14. She retired in 2016 after failing to make the 2016 Olympic team due to injury. The 20-year-old revealed that she is one of the dozens of unidentified plaintiffs currently suing USA Gymnastics, the U.S. Olympic Committee and Michigan State University. “Up until now, I was identified as Athlete A by USA gymnastics, the U.S. Olympic Committee and Michigan State University,” she said. “I want everyone to know that he did not do this to Athlete A, he did it to Maggie Nichols.” The alleged abuse began in 2015 when Nichols joined the national team and began having back problems. When I was 15 I started to have back problems while at a National Team Camp at the Karolyi Ranch. My back was really hurting me, I couldn’t even really bend down, and I remember he took me into the training room, closed the door and closed the blinds. At the time I thought this was kind of weird but figured it must be okay. I thought he probably didn’t want to distract the other girls and I trusted him.Nichols also said that during the time the alleged sexual abuse took place, Nassar contacted her on Facebook and complimented on her looks. “I was only 15 and I just thought he was trying to be nice to me,” she said. “Now I believe this was part of the grooming process I recently learned about.”She plans to submit her statement to an Ingham County, Michigan, court during sentencing for Nassar on Jan. 16, ESPN reports. Victims will be allowed to read impact statements on that date. Nichols said that neither USA Gymnastics nor the U.S. Olympic Committee provided a “safe environment” for her and her teammates. She also said that Michigan State University “ignored complaints against Larry Nassar ... going back 20 years.” If the school had acted on these complaints, Nichols wrote, she “would never have been abused by him.” “We were subjected to Dr. Nassar at every National Team Camp, which occurred monthly at the Karolyi Ranch [in Huntsville, Texas]. His job was to care for our health and treat our injuries,” Nichols said. “Instead, he violated our innocence.”Nassar’s attorneys, Matthew Newburg and Shannon Smith, declined to comment to HuffPost.MSU spokesperson Jason Cody told HuffPost that the university denies allegations that it covered up Nassar’s behavior in any way. “Any suggestion that the university covered up Nassar’s horrific conduct is simply false. Nassar preyed on his victims, changing their lives in terrible ways,” Cody said. “As [MSU] President Simon has said, MSU is truly sorry for the abuse all victims suffered, the pain it caused, and the pain it still causes.”A spokeswoman for USA Gymnastics also denied allegations that the organization covered up Nassar’s behavior in a lengthy statement to HuffPost. “Contrary to reported accusations, USA Gymnastics never attempted to hide Nassar’s misconduct,” the statement read, in part. It also laid out a timeline of the FBI’s investigation into Nassar.“The suggestion by plaintiff’s counsel John Manly, who indicates that he is representing Maggie, that USA Gymnastics tried to silence athletes or keep the investigation secret to avoid headlines before the Rio Olympics and to protect Los Angeles’ Olympic bid is entirely baseless. USA Gymnastics kept the matter confidential because of the FBI’s directive not to interfere with the investigation.”The spokeswoman added that “USA Gymnastics is committed every day to ensuring our athletes are safe and further developing a culture of empowerment.”“The new CEO Kerry Perry is eager to meet and talk with Maggie and others who can help guide and lead these efforts,” the statement read. “USA Gymnastics has and will continue to take specific and concrete steps to prevent future abuse by vigorously enforcing the USA Gymnastics Safe Sport Policy. We are focused on further developing a culture that has safe sport as a top priority throughout the organization.”This post has been updated to include statements from MSU and USA Gymnastics."
7,WOMEN,Legendary French Actress Catherine Deneuve Decries #MeToo Movement As 'Puritanism',Marina Fang,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/catherine-deneuve-me-too-france_us_5a54f270e4b0efe47ebd57dc,"In an open letter, Deneuve and other prominent French women called the wave of sexual harassment allegations against prominent men ""a witch hunt.""",2018-01-09,French acting legend Catherine Deneuve joined a group of influential French women who argue that the #MeToo movement has gone too far.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a54f3061d00003d005c30d9.jpeg?cache=TRu87V9bgJ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"French movie icon Catherine Deneuve thinks the #MeToo movement to hold sexual harassers accountable has gone too far, joining a group of other influential French women arguing that it amounts to “puritanism” and “a wave of purification” that has created “a climate of a totalitarian society.”The actress was among 100 women ― including journalists, filmmakers, writers and intellectuals ― who signed the letter, published Tuesday in France’s leading newspaper Le Monde. The missive decried the recent wave of sexual misconduct allegations against powerful men as “a witch hunt” and a hindrance to “sexual freedom.”They claimed that “the Weinstein affair,” referring to the bombshell stories of Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein’s serial sexual harassment and assault of actresses and employees, has led to unfair punishments in some cases and stems from “a hatred of men and of sexuality.”“Men have been sanctioned in their professions, forced to resign, etc., when their only wrongdoing was touching someone’s knee, trying to steal a kiss, talking about ‘intimate’ things during a professional dinner, or sending messages with a sexual connotation to a woman who wasn’t attracted to them,” they wrote.The women went on to suggest that #MeToo has led to “a fever to send the ‘pigs’ to the slaughterhouse” — referring to the French version of the social media hashtag, #BalanceTonPorc, which roughly translates to “call out your pig.”The letter has sparked backlash in France, as the country grapples with its own debate over sexual harassment and assault. On Wednesday, a group of 30 feminist activists published their own letter in response, criticizing the women for “trivializing sexual violence” and “trying to close the lid that we have started to lift.”“The ‘pigs’ and their allies have reason to worry,” they wrote. “Their old world is disappearing.”Italian actress and director Asia Argento, one of Weinstein’s accusers, on Tuesday called the letter “deplorable” and accused Deneuve and the other signatories of “interiorized misogyny.”  In October, Deneuve similarly called the movement “excessive,” saying it was not “the right way to change things.”“After ‘calling out your pig,’ what are we going to have, ‘Call out your whore?’” she said.Last year, Deneuve also defended director Roman Polanski, who in 1977 was charged with raping a 13-year-old girl at a party in Los Angeles.

He has fiercely protested the EU’s demand that Hungary take in about 1,300 refugees in an effort to distribute asylum claims throughout the continent. He’s spent millions of dollars on border fences, and called migration “a poison.” But his comments Monday were especially blatant in their appeal to religious and nationalist sentiments.“We do not consider these people to be Muslim refugees. We regard them as Muslim invaders,” Orban told Germany’s Bild newspaper. “For example, to arrive from Syria in Hungary, you have to cross four countries, all of which are not as rich as Germany, but stable. So they are not running for their lives there already.”“We believe that a large number of Muslims inevitably leads to parallel societies, because Christian and Muslim society will never unite,” he said later in the interview. “Multiculturalism is just an illusion.”Orban’s renewed attacks on migration should be seen in the context of Hungary’s upcoming elections, set to take place in March.Although Orban and his Fidesz party are expected to win at the polls, the prime minister is resorting to his customary method of appealing to the far right and stoking fears over immigration. Orban has for years exploited anti-Islam and anti-refugee sentiments in the country to stir up support from his political base and fend off challenges from parties with even more extreme nationalist views. Hungary has higher levels of anti-refugee beliefs and more negative views of minority groups than the average EU member state, according to a 2016 Pew survey.Although Muslims make up only 0.4 percent of Hungary’s population, Orban has repeatedly characterized them as a threat to the country’s Christian identity. He has paired this with populist appeals to carry out what he calls the will of the people and take on the European Union’s ruling elite, particularly when it comes to immigration.In the past month, the prime minister has ramped up his rhetoric. He recently repeated his claim that EU migration policy has failed, and argued that right-wing wins in other recent elections, such as in Austria, prove his anti-immigration policies will spread throughout the union.“I believe 2018 will be the year of the restoration of the will of the people in Europe,” Orban said earlier this month.Orban’s renewed calls for ethnic homogeneity serve as a reminder that European leaders in 2018 will have to grapple with how to handle increasingly belligerent governments, like Hungary and Poland, that seek to centralize power and resist the EU’s humanitarian polices.The EU is already taking legal action against Hungary for its refusal to take in refugees and its targeting of academic institutions ― the latter a result of Hungary passing a law that the EU alleges is an attempt to close down a liberal-leaning university founded by billionaire George Soros.This year will likely see an attempt from France and Germany to revamp and modernize the EU, which has seen deep fractures emerge amid Brexit and the refugee crisis. As the German and French governments pursue a plan to increase economic integration and political cooperation in the bloc, it’s likely that Orban will cast himself as a primary antagonist to officials in Brussels in order to further his support at home."

11,WORLD NEWS,These Are The Athletes North Korea Is Sending To The Winter Olympics,Nick Robins-Early,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-korea-olympics-figure-skaters_us_5a54ddebe4b0efe47ebd2a8e,All eyes will be on the two young North Korean figure skaters.,2018-01-09,Kim and Ryom at the Asian Winter Games in February 2017.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a5532131c00003b0068f81f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Most athletes’ road to the Olympics isn’t subject to a diplomatic chess game over an international nuclear crisis. But North Korean figure skaters Ryom Tae Ok and Kim Ju Sik will compete in the 2018 games despite a year of escalating tensions.Kim, 25, and Ryom, 18, are currently North Korea’s only athletes to qualify for this year’s Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea. In a rare thaw in relations between the two countries, North Korea agreed Tuesday to send athletes and high-level emissaries to the games, after conducting its first formal diplomatic talks with Seoul in more than two years.North Korea’s participation in the Olympics is a relief for South Korean officials, who worried Pyongyang could pose a threat to the games if it wasn’t involved. Leaders were concerned the northern country would potentially conduct missile or nuclear tests during the events.It’s also the result of years of training and competition for Ryom and Kim, who will both attend the games for the first time in their careers.The two North Korean athletes compete in pairs figure skating, where they have skated to a cover version of the Beatles’ song “A Day in the Life” and Quebecois singer Ginette Reno’s “Je Ne Suis Qu’une Chanson.” The Quebecois connection comes from the two months Ryom and Kim spent in the summer of 2017 training in Montreal with world-class coach Bruno Marcotte.Marcotte, who also coaches a team from South Korea, first spoke with Ryom and Kim early last year at the Asian Winter Games in Japan, congratulating them on their performance and improvement. At the World Figure Skating Championship in Helsinki, Finland, a month later, the pair approached Marcotte to officially ask to train with him.In June, Ryom and Kim arrived in Montreal along with their North Korean coach and a member of the North Korean Skating Federation, who also acted as a translator. Marcotte coached them for two months in Sainte-Julie, a small town outside Montreal, while his sister Julie designed their choreography.“They were such nice people and brought a positive energy every day. Their thirst to learn is so big,” Marcotte told HuffPost. “They just want to improve, and every criticism I gave them, they took it with open arms. For a coach, they were dream students.”In addition to coaching the skaters, Marcotte spent time with them off the ice, running skating-related errands in Montreal and watching Canada Day celebrations. Meagan Duhamel, a world-champion skater married to Marcotte, also brought Ryom and Kim to yoga classes and sometimes trained alongside them.Very little is publicly known about Kim and Ryom’s background or their lives in North Korea. Marcotte never got into discussing North Korea’s totalitarian politics with the pair, and a language barrier prevented him from learning too much about their personal lives.“I didn’t know what to expect to tell you the truth, but the boy and the girl have such a great friendship and partnership,” Marcotte said. “They were very affectionate, which I didn’t expect. They weren’t frigid at all, they weren’t afraid to show their expression and how they really feel.” Ryom and Kim have little hope of winning a medal at the Olympics. The pair placed 15th overall last year in the World Figure Skating Championship. But their presence at the games is a positive development after a year of escalating tensions, as Pyongyang has rapidly expanded its nuclear and missile capabilities.While President Donald Trump has traded insults with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and threatened military action over the year, South Korea’s president, Moon Jae In, has attempted diplomatic outreach to the north.During the lead-up to the Olympics, Moon successfully lobbied Washington to postpone the U.S. and South Korea’s annual joint military drills that routinely outrage North Korea. The International Olympic Committee and South Korea also courted North Korea to commit to the games, extending registration deadlines and offering to pay for accommodations.Whether the diplomatic overtures helped or not, Ryom and Kim will now be present in PyeongChang to represent their country. It’s a marked difference from when South Korea last hosted the Olympics in 1988. That year, North Korea issued a boycott and killed 115 people when it blew up a South Korean passenger plane in the lead-up to the games."

South Korea asked its neighbor to halt acts that stoke tension on the peninsula in return for guaranteed peace in the region, the South’s unification ministry said. The North also reportedly finished restoring a military hotline with South Korea, Seoul said, after communications were cut in 2016.South Korea has long sought to improve relations between the two countries, and seized on a New Year’s Day proclamation made by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who said he intended to work with the South to send a delegation of athletes to the Olympics in Pyeongchang.Representatives from Seoul also said they hope the North Korean delegation will walk with the South under a joint flag during gate opening and closing ceremonies, according to Yonhap News.The North’s participation in next month’s games will be its first winter showing in eight years. The country has sent athletes to every Summer Olympics since 1972, aside from two boycotts in 1984 and 1988. The New York Times notes the only athletes to qualify so far are a pairs figure skating team, but said the International Olympic Committee has been supportive of the North’s participation and volunteered to cover North Korean athletes’ expenses.South Korea has also proposed military talks to help prevent accidental conflicts, and the country has proposed a reunion for families separated during the Korean War that would take place next month around the Lunar New Year."
13,MEDIA,Why Did The Trump Administration Let Michael Wolff In?,"Steven Rosenbaum  , ContributorTechnologist / Business Leader / Author",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-did-the-trump-administration-let-michael-wolff_us_5a54f97fe4b0ee59d41c0e48,"When John Kerry was running for president in 2004, his campaign team was a dedicated group of hard-working political operatives",2018-01-09,<p>Watch the film for free - here: http://bit.ly/InsideTheBubble</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a54fda21d000015005c3105.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Well, there’s a simple fact - people want to talk, they just need to be coaxed.Let’s look at the ultimate insider film about a political campaign - DA Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus’s “The War Room.” Who is the star of The War Room? Is it Bill Clinton? Hardly, he’s only in the film for a few minutes. The stars are James Carville, George Stephanopoulos, and Paul Begala- three campaign insiders who would have remained virtually anonymous if Clinton hadn’t won, and Pennebaker’s camera hadn’t been there to document the inner workings of the campaign.Why let a documentary filmmaker see the inner workings of the campaign? It’s a risk that staffers are willing to take, because they believe they’re going to win, and they want their place in history recorded for all to see.How do I know this? Because I did the same thing.When John Kerry was running for president in 2004, his campaign team was a dedicated group of hard-working political operatives. Jim Loftus was the press handler, David Morehouse, Kerry’s traveling chief of staff, Marvin Nicholson Kerry’s ever-vigilant body man.We set out to record the activities inside the Bubble, the traveling hermetically sealed unit that wraps the candidate in a sealed moving cocoon of safety. No one gets in, or out of the Bubble. But we did, and we did so because Loftus, Morehouse, and Nicholson wanted to have their efforts memorialized. They didn’t want to be forgotten by history.Did we have ‘permission’ to be with the campaign? Um, sort of. Much like Wolff we got waved in, and given the secret thumbs up by Kerry’s closest handlers. It’s worth noting that Stephanie Cutter, who was running press from the Washington DC campaign headquarters would come out on the road from time to time. And without fail, we were sent packing. What Cutter knew was that having a camera inside the campaign was not a good strategic decision. If they won, then the story of how the staffers worked would be far less important than how they were going to govern. And if they lost? Well, that most certainly didn’t want to be recorded for posterity. She was right of course, and we had to sidle our way back to our campaign insiders - and get the secret blessing to get back on the bus and get inside the nightly slug fest that was life on the campaign. What we captured was telling. Was their handling of the New York Times sloppy or lazy? Michael Wolff, who served as our voice of political experience in the film - pulled no punches. “It’s their JOB to manage the press, not to complain about coverage” he said after seeing the film. And what about the pony? Jim Loftus wanted a pony in Marvin’s room to celebrate his birthday? But he said with anger and frustration - “No pony. Not even a Goat in lingerie. We got a blow-up sheep. Lazy, shitty staff work.”And - even then - more than ten years ago, Wolff went out of his way to blast Stephanie Cutter. “She’s a nightmare, unable to work with the press or manage journalists - which was her JOB,” said Wolff back when he was covering the Kerry campaign. So, how did he get into the Trump inner circle? It’s simple. He convinced Steve Bannon that he was going to win, and after he won, he convinced Bannon that his work as a brilliant political strategist risked being left on the dustbin of history unless a journalist was allowed to come in, record quotes and dates and facts and events, and then lionize Bannon in a book that would forever record his activities for history to remember. But, like the scorpion and the frog - Wolff was able to convince the frog (Bannon) to climb on the lily pad. And then, as the frog was stung and dying - Bannon asked plaintively… “But, Why?” To which the Scorpion/Journalist replied - “It’s my nature.”Journalists, wether print or documentary filmmakers - are going to record what they see. And then, they’re going to tell the story. If Kerry had won the playful backroom banter and the blow-up sheep would have been proof that these collegial, driven staffers had the right stuff to win. But when the lost, those same scenes play like an indictment. No matter that Kerry was distant, aloof, and somewhat unable to connect with voters. He’s in the background of “Inside The Bubble” so his staff takes the heat.And Wolff’s ability to charm, engage, and insinuate himself inside closed worlds shouldn’t have come as a secret. His book about his internet Startup “Burn Rate” made him no friends in the digital world. And his book about Rupert Murdock, “The Man Who Owns The News” hardly made hime a Fox favorite. Had Bannon checked, he could have found clips of Wolff commenting with his acerbic tone throughout “Inside The Bubble” and that alone might have caused some trepidation.But political folks believe they’re going to win. They believe history will want to see the inside story of political victory. And only after Wolff was inside, and the facts presented themselves, and Bannon was fired, and the Trump campaign stopped noticing that he was sitting on the couch in the West Wing, was he able to witness and record what we now all know is the truth.A dysfunctional, fractious, battleground of a White House, with Donald Trump facing criticism that those closest to him think he’s lost the mental acuity required to do the job. Wolff will go down as a witness to history, and Fire and Fury will take its place as an essential piece of documentary journalism. Now the question is - what do we do about it?"

Researchers told National Geographic they were able to parse certain words, including “fathom,” “south” and “Hilo,” which suggested a place name.By comparing the words on the recovered paper with texts that would have been available at the time Blackbeard’s ship sank, researchers linked the papers to A Voyage to the South Sea, and Round the World, Perform’d in the Years 1708, 1709, 1710 and 1711, a 1712 first-edition book by Edward Cooke of the Royal Navy.The book described Cooke’s adventures on an expedition by two ships, Duke and Dutchess, which sailed from England in 1708.Such “voyage narratives” were all the rage back in the 17th and 18th centuries, according to researchers. Cooke and another author, expedition leader Captain Woodes Rogers, told the story of sailor Alexander Selkirk, who had been marooned for four years on an island before his rescue. Selkirk became the model for Daniel Dafoe’s The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe.Perhaps Blackbeard was responsible for introducing a taste for literature among his men. Blackbeard, né Edward Teach, was one of the most infamous pirates of the time with a reputation for violence.He plied the waters off the West Indies and America’s eastern seaboard, once blockading Charleston while looting ships. He finally released hostages he had taken in exchange for a chest of medicine.But Blackbeard may have been more genteel than his infamous tales make him seem. The Daily Mail reported in 2015 that Blackbeard was a war veteran, and a loving family man who used his fortune to help out his siblings.Queen Anne’s Revenge sank after it ran aground on the North Carolina coast in 1718. Blackbeard was killed six months later in a confrontation with a crew sent by the Virginia governor and led by a Royal Navy lieutenant."

Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap wants the judge to force the panel to preserve all of its records, including those related to the end of the commission. He also wants to be included in any discussion about what the panel does with information and data it has collected and to block it from distributing any findings until he has had a chance to review and comment on them.“Mendacity and bad faith have characterized this commission from its inception. Now, the White House has shut it down rather than comply with a court order forcing it to release documents to one of its own members,” said Austin Evers, the executive director of American Oversight, the watchdog group representing Dunlap in his suit. “The law doesn’t allow government officials to evade accountability so easily.”Trump dissolved the commission, formally called the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, on Jan. 3, saying it was tied up in needless litigation and that the Department of Homeland Security would take up its work instead. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said last week that the panel would transfer its “preliminary findings” to DHS.However, It’s unclear what exactly those findings are. In the little under eight months it existed, the panel collected voter data and heard public presentations at a September meeting alleging the possibility of widespread voter fraud, which several studies and investigations have shown is not prevalent. Dunlap and other Democrats on the panel repeatedly said they had no idea what the panel was working on, let alone when it would meet, and say they were rebuffed when they asked for more information.It also is unclear what the panel will do with the voter information it had collected from about 20 states as of October. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), the panel’s vice chairman, indicated it would be turned over to DHS and run against immigration databases to try to identify people illegally on the rolls. But in a letter to Dunlap’s attorneys on Friday, Justice Department lawyers said the data wouldn’t be transferred or used.Dunlap sued the commission in November and a federal judge sided with him in December, telling the panel it had to turn over certain records. But on Friday, Justice Department lawyers indicated they would ask the judge to reconsider that order, given that Trump dissolved the commission. They say now that Dunlap is not officially a commissioner, he is entitled to as much information as the general public. On Tuesday, Dunlap’s lawyers asked the judge to force the commission to turn over those documents “without further delay.”After Trump dissolved the commission and DOJ lawyers said they would ask the judge to consider reversing the order, Dunlap pledged to fight even harder for the commission’s communications.  “It is unthinkable, unconscionable, and un-American that the administration would engage in actions that demonstrate such a flagrant disregard for a court ruling and the rule of law,” he said. “I think my access ― and the access to the information by the rest of the now-former members of the commission ― is more critical than ever.” "

It was his first miss in 14 career attempts of 36 yards or shorter.Blankenship finished 14- and 13-play drives with 41 and 27-yard field goals for a 6-0 Georgia lead with 7:33 left in the second quarter. The Bulldogs made it a 13-0 game at halftime when wide receiver Mecole Hardman took a direct snap and scored on a 1-yard run with seven seconds remaining.Saban told his quarterbacks at halftime that he was going make the switch from Jalen Hurts to Tagovailoa and see how that impacted the offense.“I just thought we needed to throw the ball in the game, and I thought he could do it better,” Saban said of the true freshman out of Hawaii.Tagovailoa had seen only mop-up duty through the course of the regular season until being thrown into the spotlight in the national title game.“I found out when we were in the locker room,” Tagovailoa said. “Coach brought the quarterbacks together and made the statement that, ’Tua, you’re going to start the second half and we’re going to rotate the quarterbacks ... see how things go. And we went from there.”The move to Tagovailoa paid dividends on his second possession. He led a seven-play, 56-yard drive that ended with a 6-yard touchdown pass to Henry Ruggs with 8:52 left in the third quarter.Georgia responded exactly two minutes later with a stunning score. Freshman Jake Fromm heaved a bomb down the right sideline for Hardman, who made the catch, eluded a tackle and tight-roped 80 yards to the end zone for a 20-7 advantage.Pappanastos brought Alabama within 20-13 with 43 and 30-yard field goals, giving Tagovailoa the chance to play the hero’s role.Tagovailoa started the second half and completed 14 of 24 passes for 166 yards and three touchdowns with an interception. Fromm was 16 of 32 for 232 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions.It was the sixth national championship for Saban, tying him with Bear Bryant for the most in the bowl era. This one denied the Bulldogs their first national title since 1980.“It’s not just about winning a championship,” Saban said. “Every team wants to be successful and as a coach, you want to see them reach their full potential. But as a college coach, and the thing that I like about college coaching, you have an opportunity to affect people.“The message to the team tonight after this game? ’I hope that you take something from this game, and the resiliency that you showed in this game, and it helps you be more successful in life. So, it’s not just about winning a championship.”Georgia coach Kirby Smart, a former assistant under Saban, said he expected the Crimson Tide to make a switch at quarterback coming out of halftime.“We’d seen him on tape,” Smart said. “We told everyone at halftime that there was no question that they were going to him. Because they were struggling and they needed some momentum.“He provided them some juice, and got them some momentum. He’s a good player.”Hurts was engaged on the sideline throughout the second half, talking with coaches and encouraging Tagovailoa.“He was going to step in and do his thing,” Hurts said when asked what his thoughts were when Saban told him of the quarterback change at halftime. “We have a lot of guys in the QB room that play really well. He stepped in and did his thing ... did his thing for the team. He’s built for stuff like this, he has that impact. I’m so happy for him and so happy for this team."

19,MEDIA,Bid To Save Gawker.com Falls Short,Hayley Miller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gawker-kickstarter-fails_us_5a54cf6ee4b01e1a4b19beea,"A Kickstarter campaign led by former staffers raised less than $90,000 of its $500,000 goal.",2018-01-09,"Hulk Hogan, whose legal name is Terry Bollea, sued Gawker Media after Gawker.com published a sex tape clip.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a55120b1c00003b0068f793.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A Kickstarter campaign to resurrect Gawker.com, the celebrity and media gossip site driven into bankruptcy by wrestler Hulk Hogan’s sex-tape lawsuit, expired on Tuesday, well short of its fundraising goal.Members of The Gawker Foundation, a nonprofit created by former staffers, launched the campaign last month with the hopes of raising $500,000 to buy shuttered Gawker.com and relaunch the site.But the coalition fell far short of the ambitious goal, with nearly 1,500 backers raising less than $90,000 as the campaign expired Tuesday.Gawker.com, along with all Gawker Media brands, was put up for auction in June 2016 after Hogan won a $140 million invasion-of-privacy verdict against the company, sending it into bankruptcy. That August, Univision bought Gawker Media’s properties for $135 million, and Gawker.com was shut down.Despite the fundraising failure, campaign organizers were “floored by the outpouring of support,” said James Del, a former vice president of programming at Gawker Media and a Gawker Foundation organizer.“It was an ambitious goal, but nearly 1,500 people were willing to pay money for a site that hasn’t published in over a year,” Del wrote in an email to HuffPost on Tuesday. “That’s impressive, and though we won’t be able to compete at auction, we hope one of the other benevolent parties interested in the site is able to win. There’s clearly demand.”Another former Gawker staffer, who spoke to HuffPost on the condition of anonymity, said the campaign’s failure was disappointing, but not surprising.“Look: If the alumni all rallied behind it openly and loudly, I think the goal would’ve been hit,” the person wrote in an email.The Gawker Foundation had outlined two goals for the fundraising campaign: preserve the site’s archives, and relaunch Gawker.com “under the stewardship of former editors, new writers, and an entirely membership-funded model.”Plans are “underway” to preserve Gawker.com’s archives, according to Del, which hold articles that predate news sites like BuzzFeed, Vox, Mic and HuffPost.“There are years and years of stories in there that chronicle some of the earliest years of media blogging in New York and beyond, and as we’ve seen over the past year, we have no idea how many posts in that archive will become newsworthy in the future,” Del said.Gawker.com supporters decried the site’s demise in 2016 after a Florida jury found Gawker violated Hogan’s privacy by publishing a sex tape clip. Hogan’s lawsuit was filed in 2012 after Gawker refused to take down the tape, and ended with Hogan winning a $140 million judgement.Forbes revealed that Hogan’s lawsuit was funded secretly by tech billionaire Peter Thiel, who held a grudge against Gawker after the site “outed” him in a 2007 article. Media pundits warned that Gawker’s bankruptcy marked a threat to the free press and a violation of free speech.“Hulk Hogan conceded that Gawker’s story about him was true, yet he still won a vast judgment and, not incidentally, drove the Web site out of business,” Jeffrey Toobin wrote for The New Yorker. “The prospect of liability, perhaps existential in nature, for true stories presents a chilling risk for those who rely on the First Amendment.”Interest in reviving the site took hold amid the recent #MeToo movement, given Gawker’s history of unearthing celebrity sexual harassment and assault allegations. The Kickstarter campaign said “Gawker was willing to chase stories that other outlets considered too risky or salacious,” including early accusations against Kevin Spacey, Louis C.K., Harvey Weinstein and President Donald Trump.“All the things Gawker reported years ago on all the people who are just being taken down now ― those stories came long before any movement, long before the massive stories that publishers are now using as part of their ad campaigns,” the anonymous former staffer said.In November, The Washington Post published a video that featured media columnist Margaret Sullivan discussing the vital role Gawker played in exposing sexual misconduct allegations against high-profile figures.″Gawker was early on getting the complaints about Weinstein and the fact that this was an open secret,” Sullivan said. “They took an open secret and actually published it.”She continued: “I think their absence is definitely noticed. I mean for one thing, the fact that they were brought down the way they were has sent a chill through the media system.”"
20,TECH,Former Google Engineer Suing Company Over Perceived Discrimination Against White Men,Antonia Blumberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/james-damore-google-lawsuit_us_5a53c4f4e4b0efe47ebb9cc9,The writer of a controversial Google memo is accusing the company of silencing conservative viewpoints.,2018-01-09,Google's workforce is disproportionately white and male.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a53c5421d000027005c2dc5.jpeg?cache=qLfd6UnRIp&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"An engineer fired from Google last summer over a controversial memo is suing the company for discrimination.James Damore, 28, filed a class-action lawsuit against Google in the Santa Clara Superior Court in northern California on Monday. He is joined in the suit by David Gudeman, another former Google engineer. Together they are accusing the tech giant of discriminating against employees who are white, male and/or who hold conservative beliefs. Damore is the author of a 3,000-word memo in which he argued that the gender gap “in tech and leadership” is due to biological differences between men and women.Now, he claims the company’s efforts to increase diversity and eradicate misogyny have had the consequence of leaving men and conservative individuals feeling silenced.In a press conference on Monday, Damore and Gudeman’s attorney Harmeet Dhillon said the lawsuit isn’t just about preserving the rights of conservative white men.Instead, she argued, it aims to protect “three subclasses of individuals” ― men, Caucasian people, and those who hold conservative viewpoints ― from unfair business practices. Those subclasses could include women and members of racial minorities who identify with one or more of those three groups, she said.Dhillon said her law firm has spoken with “dozens” of current and former Google employees who describe a company culture where white men and conservatives are frequently shamed, belittled and threatened with blacklisting. She claimed Google has cultivated a “Lord of the Flies mentality,” where “someone can be singled out and group shamed” for expressing views or identities that are deemed unpopular by management.Debate surrounding discrimination in the male-dominated tech world has raged for months, with women at many of the major Silicon Valley companies coming forward with stories of bias and sexual harassment. Google is currently facing another lawsuit accusing the company of paying female employees less than their male counterparts.The tech giant has denied the claim that its diversity programs are in any way illegal. In a statement to HuffPost, a Google spokesperson said, “We look forward to defending against Mr. Damore’s lawsuit in court.”Google fired Damore in August after the engineer circulated his memo, addressing what he deemed to be an “ideological echo chamber” at the company. He claimed that women’s “neuroticism” and men’s “higher drive for status” are among the factors that contribute to gender disparities in tech. Damore also accused Google’s senior leadership of silencing conservative views.CEO Sundar Pichai said in a note to employees distributed in August that portions of Damore’s memo “violate our Code of Conduct and cross the line by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace.”Pichai said Damore raised some important questions about Google’s diversity programs, but crossed a line when he suggested, as he paraphrased, that his female colleagues may “have traits that make them less biologically suited” to competitive positions in engineering. During a press tour after his firing, Damore said being conservative at Google was comparable to “being gay in the 1950s.” He claimed that employees with conservative beliefs “have to stay in the closet” for fear of retaliation.Asked during Monday’s press conference why he didn’t report the alleged discrimination to human resources prior to circulating the memo, Damore blamed the company’s culture.“We were sort of brainwashed to believe this was just the natural course of things,” he said.But Damore said he would “welcome” the chance to go back to work for Google ― whose workforce is still disproportionately white and male ― and continue fighting for the rights of men, Caucasian people and conservatives.He said: “I think this would help make Google a truly diverse place.”"

The justices’ decision on Monday left in place a lower court ruling that declared the plaintiffs in the case did not have the legal standing to challenge the 2016 law, because they couldn’t show they had been harmed by legislation that hadn’t yet gone into effect when they sued.The Protecting Freedom of Conscience from Government Discrimination Act, or H.B. 1523, gives Mississippi businesses and government employees with strong religious objections the right to refuse to serve lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender customers. The law ― which was passed by a Republican-controlled legislature and signed by a Republican governor ― serves to protect conservative Christian beliefs about marriage, sex and gender. It went into effect in October amidst the ongoing legal battle.Beth Littrell, a lawyer with the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund representing the plaintiffs, said that the beliefs undergirding H.B. 1523 “leave the state’s most vulnerable in harm’s way.”The people challenging H.B. 1523 included same-sex couples, civil rights advocates and progressive Christians, Reuters reports. One of those plaintiffs was the inclusive Joshua Generation Metropolitan Community Church in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, led by Pastor Brandiilyne Mangum-Dear.On Monday, Mangum-Dear wrote on Facebook that the Supreme Court’s decision left her with a sense of righteous anger. “Today, as a Pastor, as a queer citizen of Mississippi I say to you I’m sorry! This bill is harmful and hateful without any invocation!” she wrote. “This bill sends a very clear message and that message in itself is harmful... and I’m sorry that our state and our court system doesn’t recognize that! I pray that no further harm comes to our community, but I fear that inevitably it will!”The Supreme Court’s decision not to review the law at this point “is not an endorsement” of H.B. 1523, Littrell pointed out. It also doesn’t negate Obergefell v. Hodges, the court’s landmark 2015 ruling in support of same-sex marriage.Studies have shown that many Americans don’t support the faith-based refusal of services. The Public Religion Research Institute found last year that 61 percent of Americans oppose allowing small-business owners to refuse to provide products or services to gay or lesbian people on the grounds of their religious beliefs. Among the various religious groups surveyed, PRRI said there was not a single one in which a majority favored religiously based service refusals. As for the Mississippi law, it’s likely to be challenged again by future plaintiffs who will be able to show they’ve been harmed.The fight isn’t over yet, Littrell told HuffPost.“We will keep fighting in Mississippi until we overturn this harmful law, and in any state where antigay legislators pass laws to roll back LGBT civil rights,” she said in a statement. “Unfortunately, the Supreme Court’s decision today leaves LGBT people in Mississippi in the crosshairs of hate and humiliation, delaying justice and equality.”"

23,GREEN,Dogs Are Dying After Being Left Out In The Cold. Here's How To Keep Them Safe.,Nina Golgowski,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dogs-are-dying-from-the-cold_us_5a538039e4b003133eca6ec7,"Hint: If it’s too cold for you, it’s probably too cold for your dog.",2018-01-09,Animal advocates across the country are reminding dog owners to bring their pets inside when temperatures drop.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a53ca721c00003b0068f40f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Animal advocates across the country are reminding dog owners to bring their pets inside after a number of animals were found left outside in freezing temperatures, and some died as a result.In one of the latest incidents, a woman in Hartford, Connecticut, was charged with animal cruelty last week after a dog at her home was reportedly found frozen solid inside of a dog house. Several dogs have similarly been found frozen to death in Ohio, Indianapolis and outside of Chicago as temperatures in some parts of the country continue to dip into negative degrees.For those wanting to keep their pets safe, or to learn how to respond to an animal in need, here are a few questions and answers to help you get started.How cold is too cold?As a rule of thumb, if it’s too cold for you, it’s probably too cold for your dog, according to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.That said, the useful chart below uses information from Tufts University to help assess safe outdoor temperatures for dogs, based on their size, breed, coat and acclimation to cold weather.The chart warns that potentially unsafe conditions for animals generally occur beginning around 40 degrees. Most temperatures below that, particularly 25 or below, are considered dangerous, and 20 degrees or lower are life-threatening.For such extreme temperatures, the Humane Society of the United States recommends bundling up short-haired dogs with sweaters when taking short walks. Booties are also advised for protecting their feet from rock salt and other chemicals used to melt snow and ice.Does breed or size matter when it comes to withstanding the cold?Yes.Smaller breeds like chihuahuas are more vulnerable to cold weather, which is potentially hazardous to them at temperatures between 30 and 40 degrees. Around 25 degrees is dangerous and anything 20 degrees or below is potentially life-threatening, according to Tufts University’s findings.For larger dogs, like German Shepherds, Rottweilers and Huskies, owners should be cautious during temperatures between 35 and 20 degrees. The risk of death or injury increases around 15 degrees and becomes extreme when the temperature is 10 degrees or lower.In Pennsylvania last week, a man and woman were charged with animal cruelty after allegedly leaving a Husky chained up outside in 13-degree weather without access to shelter, water or food, an act that violates state law, as Harrisburg station WHP CBS 21, reported. (Read more about local laws below.)What about keeping pets in insulating dog houses, like “igloo” houses?Igloo-shaped dog houses are designed to provide insulated outdoor shelters for animals, though it’s recommended ― and in many places required by law ― that dogs occupying them still be let inside if temperatures dip below freezing.If using such structures, the Humane Society of Huron Valley in Ann Arbor, Michigan, recommends the houses be elevated off the ground and face south or east, to prevent them from facing prevailing winds.When temperatures drop below freezing, people should also place adequate bedding inside to help trap heat. In Michigan, such bedding is legally required, as the local Humane Society ― which recommends straw instead of blankets and wood shavings ― states on its website.That’s not to say that such houses are warm and cozy in the winter, as one veterinarian recently demonstrated.In a video uploaded to YouTube on Sunday, veterinarian Dr. Ernie Ward attempted to spend several hours inside of an igloo-shaped dog house in Chicago as temperatures dipped from 12 to 8 degrees outside.Ward, who was bundled up in warm clothing to mimic a dog’s fur coat, endured four hours inside the igloo, where temperatures only heated up to 15 and 20 degrees.“If this can help prevent the suffering of one animal, if this can save the life of one animal, then it’s worthwhile for me to do this little experiment,” he said. “If you’re considering leaving your dog or cat outside, they’ll suffer.”Cars are also not safe for pets during the winter ― just as they’re not in the summertime ― as the vehicles can act as refrigerators, trapping the cold inside with the pet, the ASPCA warns.In New York City on Saturday, police rescued a chihuahua named Mary from a locked car as temperatures outside dropped to 10 degrees, according to the New York Post. Authorities charged the dog’s owner ― who reportedly didn’t believe there was cause for alarm ― with illegal confinement of an animal in a vehicle, and the dog was placed with Animal Care and Control.What can you do if you see an animal in distress?The HSUS encourages people to “speak out” about possible animal abuse by contacting a local animal control agency or by dialing 911.“If you make a report of alleged animal cruelty, the responding agency is required to investigate,” the Humane Society’s website states. “If your area lacks the proper animal welfare agency, and your local authorities are not equipped to deal with animal cruelty cases, you can also email or call The HSUS and ask to speak with one of our experts about the suspected abuse.”Advocates for animals say that even if concerned citizens are unsure of whether an animal is being abused, they should contact them.“We want to know so we can at least go out and educate the owners,” Megan Brown, an investigator with the Toledo Area Humane Society, told the Toledo Blade.The HSUS’s contact info can be found on its website, along with tools to locate nearby animal care and control agencies.What laws are there to protect animals and hold abusers accountable?According to the HSUS’s website, animal neglect is considered a misdemeanor crime in all 50 states and Washington, D.C.Massachusetts and Oklahoma both carry felony penalties for animal neglect. Felony charges can also be applied in animal neglect cases that result in death in California, Connecticut, Florida and Washington, D.C.In Georgia, felony animal cruelty charges can be applied where malice is proved.In Pennsylvania, where aggravated animal cruelty is a third-degree felony, animal cruelty protections signed into law last year also prohibit animals from being tethered outside for more than 30 minutes when temperatures are either above 90 degrees or below 32 degrees, according to a press release by the state’s governor.People must also provide sanitary shelter to animals that allows them to maintain normal body temperature and keep them dry all year long. There are also restrictions on the length of the tether and duration of time spent on it, regardless of the outside temperature.There are similar laws in a number of other areas, including Indiana, New York, New Jersey, Maine and Wisconsin."
24,ENTERTAINMENT,Kevin's Addiction Will Surely Signal New Revelations About Jack On 'This Is Us',Leigh Blickley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/milo-ventimiglia-this-is-us-jack-kevin_us_5a4d05d6e4b06d1621bc75f9,Milo Ventimiglia shares insight into the characters' personal struggles and Jack's impending death.,2018-01-09,"Parker Bates as Young Kevin and Milo Ventimiglia as Jack in ""The Fifth Wheel."" ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a4d4f2a1c00003b0068e720.jpeg?cache=oH6v71KbJt&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After a few weeks off the air, “This Is Us” Season 2 returns Tuesday with a doozy of an episode.Last time we saw the show’s Big Three characters, Randall (Sterling K. Brown) was saying goodbye to his foster daughter Deja, Kate was dealing with a heartbreaking miscarriage, and Kevin (Justin Hartley) was struggling to deal with addiction. He eventually was arrested for a DUI while his niece was in the car.This week’s episode, “The Fifth Wheel,” focuses on the aftermath of Kevin’s arrest and his siblings’ attempts to support him in rehab. Kevin, who resembles his father Jack (Milo Ventimiglia) at times, has struggled this season, relying on pills and alcohol to make it through his days after exacerbating a debilitating knee injury. As the family sits down for an emotional therapy session with Kevin’s psychologist (Kate Burton), it becomes apparent that childhood experiences may have played a part in his substance abuse.Kevin realizes he had a harder time earning solitary moments with his parents, while his brother and sister received plenty of one-on-one attention. The seemingly independent, brave and confident character was left internally screaming for help. “We’re a family of addicts,” he tells Kate, Randall and his mom, Rebecca (Mandy Moore). “Our father was an addict, his father was an addict, I’m an addict.”Ventimiglia told HuffPost that everyone who deals with substance abuse disorder has a different journey, and that it was interesting for him to uncover why Kevin has struggled ― and how that addiction reflects on Ventimiglia’s character.“It breaks my heart for Jack that his son is experiencing a struggle that he had. Jack’s addiction may not be Kevin’s addiction, but at the same time there’s an understanding that drug and alcohol addiction is hereditary. It’s passed on,” Ventimiglia said over the phone last month while promoting a partnership with Kelley Blue Book. “But it’s more understanding the backdrop of what they experienced as father and son and less about the commonality of the disease.” Ventimiglia said he and Hartley spoke to each other about how to portray their characters’ individual situations. They long known that both Jack and Kevin live with inner pain, and that they both attempt to ease the fears and disappointments of their family members without addressing their own hang-ups.“Jack is a simple man, although complex internally. He doesn’t let his family feel his pain, he doesn’t let his family see his struggle,” Ventimiglia said. “The terrifying prospect is the ticking clock going against him.” Jack is not a part of the present-day storyline on the show, and is only seen in flashbacks. Viewers learn early on that Jack died when Kevin, Randall and Kate were teenagers, but the exact circumstances surrounding his death are still foggy.“We all know that Jack’s dying soon, so I think as an audience that’s a hard pill to swallow,” Ventimiglia said. “To know that this man who has such influence over his family ― over his wife and his kids ― is at a certain point going to cease to be and those experiences are going to be the only things they’re going to have to look back on to move forward in their lives. So I’ve come to terms. I’ve come to terms with Jack and I’m prepared for his death.”But Ventimiglia said he knows fans probably aren’t quite as prepared for Jack to die. The mystery surrounding his demise has haunted the audience since Season 1, and the actor said it will surely continue to do so. “[Showrunner] Dan Fogelman and I talk about it quite a bit,” he said. “I don’t think anyone is going to be really prepared for it. It’s going to crush people.” Ventimiglia knows how Jack dies (and he’s not spilling any beans), but he refuses to let it affect his performance.“We never know when we’re going to die, so, I think knowing that, you have to approach life the way you approach life,” he said. “Hopefully, if you’re a good person and you put good out, you’re going to do that regardless of whether you get another day or another few years. He’s still the same man with the same direction and the same heart — he just meets his end before we want him to.” Despite Jack’s personal struggles with his own father, depression and alcoholism, he remained a constant for his wife and kids, which is why Ventimiglia said he relishes playing him. “I think Jack is a fun-loving dad who gives his family everything.

25,POLITICS,Democratic Socialist Drops Out Of Chicago Congressional Primary,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/carlos-ramirez-rosa-drops-out-of-race_us_5a550943e4b003133ecd0426,"If elected, Chicago Alderman Carlos Ramirez-Rosa would have been the first openly gay Latino member of Congress.",2018-01-09,"Chicago Alderman Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, 28, has made no secret of his ambitions for higher office since winning a City Council seat in 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a550a931c0000220068f77e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Chicago Alderman Carlos Ramirez-Rosa dropped out of the Democratic primary to succeed Rep. Luis Gutíerrez (D-Ill.) on Tuesday and endorsed Cook County Commissioner Jesús “Chuy” Garcia, the odds-on front-runner in the race.“After spending the last week discussing with family, friends, supporters, and leaders in the progressive movement, I have come to the conclusion that this is the best course of action not just for me, but for the vitally important movement we continue to build every day,” Ramirez-Rosa said in a statement announcing his decision.Calling Garcia a “good friend and progressive champion,” the alderman invited his supporters to endorse Garcia as well.“I hope you will join me in ensuring we have strong progressive leadership in this district at such a vital time in this country, when so many of our critical concerns are at stake,” Ramirez-Rosa said.Ramirez-Rosa’s announcement follows polling indicating that he would have faced a blowout in a matchup against Garcia. A Public Policy Polling survey released on Dec. 19 showed Garcia with 54 percent support compared with 7 percent for Ramirez-Rosa, and even less for other challengers.“He didn’t want to waste people’s time,” said Lucie Macías, a supporter of Ramirez-Rosa and a fellow member of the Chicago chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. “He wanted to respect people who had put in effort into this campaign, so it made sense to make the announcement now.”The immediate impact of Ramirez-Rosa’s decision is to virtually ensure Garcia’s victory in the March 20 race.But it is also likely to disappoint the progressive activists and democratic socialists who had rallied behind Ramirez-Rosa’s bid.If elected, Ramirez-Rosa, 28, would have been the first openly gay Latino member of Congress. He also would have been the only person who was both a sitting member of Congress and a dues-paying member of the DSA, which has grown several-fold in size since President Donald Trump’s election.DSA has made significant inroads into government in the past 14 months, with several members being elected to state and local posts. But just as Ramirez-Rosa’s success in getting on the ballot reflected DSA’s rising prominence, his failure to mount a robust challenge to Garcia reflects the limits of the organization’s political reach.When Gutíerrez, 64, announced his retirement as congressman for Illinois’ 4th Congressional District in late November, he immediately endorsed Garcia. Gutíerrez’s blessing conveniently took Garcia out of the running for another bid against Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, whose 2015 re-election Gutíerrez backed. (Garcia’s progressive challenge against Emanuel forced the first mayoral runoff in Chicago history.)In addition, the timing of Gutíerrez’s announcement left less than a week for candidates to collect the number of signatures necessary to get on the ballot.But with the help of a crew of fellow DSA members, Ramirez-Rosa collected the requisite signatures and then some.Ramirez-Rosa has emerged as one of the most charismatic figures in the resurgent Democratic Socialists of America. With his impassioned speaking style, hip fashion sense and diverse background, he has a knack for making the sometimes arcane precepts of the far left accessible to ordinary people ― especially his fellow millennials.“Every day, Donald Trump and the Republicans intensify their attacks against our working families, against our immigrant families, against anyone that doesn’t look like a rich, white billionaire just like him,” Ramirez-Rosa told HuffPost in a December interview about his decision to run. “We need a bold, progressive response in Washington, D.C., that’s tied to grassroots movements that says not just ‘We’re gonna resist Donald Trump,’ but ‘We’re gonna vigorously resist Donald Trump by uplifting the bold progressive policies that are gonna help our working families.’”Early in his career, Ramirez-Rosa worked in Gutíerrez’s Washington office.“I quickly saw how he and his office were not connected to the grassroots movement led by undocumented people,” Ramirez-Rosa said of his stint there in a July interview with The Nation.Ramirez-Rosa subsequently returned to Chicago to work as a grassroots immigrants rights organizer with the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. Following a successful 2015 bid to represent Chicago’s 50th aldermanic district on the City Council, Ramirez-Rosa became one of the council’s most outspoken critics of Emanuel. He was the only alderman to vote against the creation of a $95 million police academy on Chicago’s west side.But from the get-go, Ramirez-Rosa faced an uphill battle against Garcia. At 61, Garcia has been in city and state politics for over three decades, and his name recognition and support network far outweighed Ramirez-Rosa’s.It was also difficult for Ramirez-Rosa to outflank Garcia from the left. Garcia enjoyed strong progressive credibility for taking on Emanuel in 2015, and was part of the coalition of Chicago politicians who backed the insurgent 1983 mayoral bid of Harold Washington, the Windy City’s first mayor. As an early endorser of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential bid, Garcia also benefited from Sanders’ early blessing in the race. Gutíerrez, by contrast, supported both Emanuel’s re-election and Sanders’ main rival for the Democratic nomination, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. A Garcia win would likely assure the left a more independent fighter in Congress than the seat’s previous occupant.What’s more, Garcia and Ramirez-Rosa both back a long list of progressive priorities, from single-payer “Medicare for all” to a federal $15 minimum wage.One area of apparent disagreement was on the question of the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement to end the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories. In September, Ramirez-Rosa’s refusal to renounce the nonviolent movement cost him a spot as running mate in state Sen. Daniel Biss’ Democratic gubernatorial run. Garcia condemned BDS unequivocally in a December interview with HuffPost, and volunteered it unprompted as an area of policy disagreement between the two candidates.Illinois’ 4th Congressional District is gerrymandered to combine heavily Latino areas of northwestern and southwestern Chicago with nearby suburbs. It is heavily Democratic, and whoever wins the March primary is almost certain to win the general election in November.In addition to Garcia, Chicago Alderman Proco “Joe” Moreno, police Officer Richard Gonzalez and Sol Flores ― founding executive director of La Casa Norte, a nonprofit that addresses homelessness ― are competing in the district primary.Flores, who has received the endorsement of the national group EMILY’s List, served on the transition team for Emanuel’s second mayoral term. Flores’ association with Emanuel, a centrist with a notoriously rocky relationship with the city’s progressive activist community, has prompted suspicion that she is Emanuel’s favored candidate. (Emanuel has not officially endorsed in the race.)Although Chicago DSA has no plans to endorse Garcia at the moment, Flores’ presence on the ticket and perceived ties to Emanuel might be enough to inspire individual DSA members to campaign for Garcia, according to Macías of Chicago DSA.“It’s important that he wins that, especially against a Rahm candidate like Sol,” Macías said. “A lot of people are always afraid of the Rahm candidate, the big Chicago machine,” she added. “It’s still a very important campaign.”This story has been updated throughout."

As president, he was considered by Mormons to be a prophet who received divine revelations.But he also presided over the church during a number of controversial debates surrounding LGBTQ acceptance in the church and women’s roles and leadership ― issues heavily discussed in an obituary for Monson that was published on Jan. 3 in the Times.“Facing vociferous demands to recognize same-sex marriage, and weathering demonstrations at church headquarters by Mormon women pleading for the right to be ordained as priests, Mr. Monson did not bend,” the obit reads. “Teachings holding homosexuality to be immoral, bans on sexual intercourse outside male-female marriages, and an all-male priesthood would remain unaltered.”A Change.org petition is accusing the Times of using Monson’s obituary “as a political statement against him and the Church as a whole.” It claimed that Times obituaries for other leaders, including Fidel Castro, have been “more neutral.” ″[This is] either a direct attack or a complete misunderstanding of religions or religious people. Would they write similar scathing remarks about the Pope?” the petition questioned.Nearly 170,000 people had signed onto the petition as of Tuesday afternoon. The petition includes a disclaimer stating that it wasn’t “sponsored or supported by” the Mormon church. An LDS spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Nevada resident Nathan Cunningham, who started the petition on Sunday, told News4Utah, that he wasn’t necessarily disputing the factual accuracy of the obituary. “However,” he added, “an obituary is hardly the place to criticize a church and its policies.”William McDonald, the Times obituaries editor, stood by the outlet’s reporting on Monson’s death in a Q&A published Monday, saying the obit discussed important issues that arose during the late religious leader’s tenure.“It’s our obligation as journalists, whether in an obituary or elsewhere, to fully air these issues from both sides,” McDonald said.The editor argued that journalists aren’t in the business of writing tributes and that when it comes to reporting on leaders, religious or not, “controversy comes with the territory.”But, he noted, the obituary focused on Monson as a public figure, rather than who he was “to his more ardent admirers.”“In 20/20 hindsight, we might have paid more attention to the high regard with which he was held within the church,” McDonald said. “I think by his very position in the church, all that was implied. But perhaps we should have stated it more plainly.”"

Bannon issued an apology over the weekend for negative comments about Donald Trump Jr. that were published in Michael Wolff’s book about the Trump White House, Fire and Fury.“When you go after somebody’s family, in the manner in which [Wolff] did ― two of the president’s children who are serving this nation, sacrificing in their service ― it is repugnant, it is grotesque,” Gidley said. “And I challenge anybody to go and talk about someone else’s family and see if that person doesn’t come back and come back hard.”When asked specifically how Trump and Kushner were sacrificing, Gidley responded that “they both gave up personal and private lives to come work at the White House and work for the American people. They do that every day. And it’s ridiculous for anyone to try and attack what they do for this nation.”It’s not illegal for a president to employ his children and other relatives, the Justice Department has determined. But the tenure of Ivanka Trump and Kushner hasn’t been without complications.Kushner has gotten himself into hot water several times for omitting key information on security clearance forms. He maintains ties to his family real estate business, which has reaped millions in investments from an Israeli company while the president has given him responsibility for Middle East diplomacy.Ivanka Trump originally denied she’d be affiliated with her father’s administration, but accepted a formal, unpaid position as an assistant in March.

28,BLACK VOICES,2 Nevada Teens Say Cop's Son Has Been Sending Them Racially Charged Threats,David Lohr,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nevada-racial-bullying-lawsuit_us_5a549be3e4b003133ecbe849,The photos are just some of many racial taunts two teenagers have allegedly received from high school classmates.,2018-01-09,A newly filed lawsuit accuses the son of a sheriff's deputy of threatening two black sisters.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a54dcda1c00003b0068f65c.jpeg?ops=crop_36_17_317_426%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Two stepsisters have allegedly endured months of racially charged bullying from classmates at a rural Nevada school. The ongoing torment — including abusive language, some of which appears uncensored below — escalated to death threats when the teens’ parents pressed school officials to act, according to a lawsuit filed last week.The death threats, Reno attorney Terri Keyser-Cooper told HuffPost, came in the form of Snapchat messages that were shared with 14-year-olds Jayla Tolliver and Taylissa Marriot.The messages show a bare-chested white male posing with knives and a shotgun. Lyon County Sheriff Alvin McNeil acknowledged to the Reno Gazette Journal that the boy pictured in the Snapchat messages is the son of one of his deputies. He reportedly called the messages a foolish mistake that did not amount to a credible threat.“The redneck god of all gods ‘we bout to go n****r huntin,’” reads one of them. “Porch monkeys here I come,” reads another.Jayla’s father, Charles Tolliver, and stepmother, Nancy Marriott-Tolliver, told HuffPost the messages are part of an ongoing campaign of hate and discrimination that has included racial slurs, harassment and ridicule since just before the start of the school year. They said the relentless torment has made the girls afraid of certain students at Yerington High School, a predominantly white school in the town of Yerington, located 90 minutes from Reno.Inaction from school officials prompted Marriott-Tolliver and her husband to seek out Keyser-Cooper, who filed suit against the school district and the city in U.S. District Court in Reno on Thursday.“This has broken them,” Marriott-Tolliver told HuffPost. “They’ve sobbed and sobbed. They can’t understand why this is happening. They’ve said, ‘We’re 14 years old, why do people hate us for the color of our skin?’”Another classmate, using Snapchat, allegedly wrote, “If y’all get offended over words such as n****r or porch monkey then you just need to learn to grow the fuck up and quit being such a libtarted piece of shit. That’s all I gotta say to you n****rs.”Someone also allegedly hacked Tolliver’s Snapchat account and sent out a humiliating message to all of her contacts, which read, “I like to fuck boys on quads and I am the biggest and most hated slut in Yerington.”Charles Tolliver said he and his wife have complained to school officials, the Department of Education and local police, all of whom he claims have declined to act.“I know kids can be mean and it happens, but we’ve tried to go in and talk to the principal, vice principal and everyone else and they’ve done nothing,” he said.“I’ve been a civil rights attorney for more 30 years and this is the worst race case I’ve ever seen,” Keyser-Cooper told HuffPost. “It’s awful and very disturbing.”The lawsuit cites multiple incidents of alleged racial bullying, not only against the teenagers, but also their parents.Marriott-Tolliver said she has ample evidence to support the claims, including a video that shows one of her daughter’s tormentors confronting her and her kids outside the school. The girl, a classmate, can allegedly be heard on the video screaming profanities at Marriott-Tolliver’s children.The cruel remarks, according to the lawsuit, were made within earshot of the female antagonist’s stepfather, Trinity Eriksen, who is a Yerington High School employee and football coach. When Marriott-Tolliver asked Eriksen why he permitted his daughter to talk like that, he responded by calling her a “fucking bitch,” the lawsuit alleges. Another man at the scene, Jeff Miller, who helps to coach football and is employed as a Lyon County Sheriff’s deputy, told Marriott-Tolliver, “Get the fuck out of here,” court documents state.Marriot-Tolliver said she was barred from school property after the elder Eriksen told Assistant Principal Monie Byers that it was Marriot-Tolliver, and not his stepdaughter, who had been confrontational.The next morning, Charles Tolliver said he went to see Principal Duane Mattice to determine what was being done to stop students from harassing his daughter and stepdaughter.“Mattice belittled the seriousness of the issues Tolliver was raising” and refused to discuss “race-based bullying of the girls,” the lawsuit alleges. “Tolliver was so angered by Mattice’s refusal to address the racism running rampant in his school, Tolliver called Mattice a bigot, excused himself from the meeting and left the school.”Marriott-Tolliver said she was later given an opportunity to show her video evidence to school officials, who then lifted the trespass order. However, she said it was not long before her husband found himself in the same situation.In early October, Tolliver, his wife and their daughter again went to the school to speak with administrators. After emerging from their vehicle, several students allegedly blocked the sidewalk, and one of them told Tolliver, “You don’t even know the definition of a n****r!”Jayla Tolliver, outraged the comment had been directed toward her father, threw down her backpack and charged at the teens, the suit claims. Charles Tolliver said he yelled at his daughter, and she backed off. The same teen then allegedly continued verbally assaulting him, saying, “N****r means ignorant; your daughter is ignorant.” Tolliver then told the teen, “If you call my daughter a n****r again, there will be consequences.”Instead of addressing the students, Mattice trespassed Charles Tolliver, according to the lawsuit. That same day, school administrators suspended Jayla Tolliver.“They suspended her — not the other kids — because of her throwing her backpack down and charging at the girls,” Marriott-Tolliver said. “Jayla is not a fighter. These teens attacked her father and she just snapped. You poke a bear for too long and it’s going to happen.”With school officials refusing to act and the alleged bullying escalating, Charles Tolliver said the family went to the Yerington Police Department, where they spoke with an officer and gave him written statements. They said they also provided police with screenshots of the Snapchat messages and other evidence.After giving their statements, the family was told the racial slurs and Snapchat messages were free speech and therefore protected by the First Amendment, the lawsuit claims.The next day, a deputy with the Lyon County Sheriff’s Office allegedly served Charles Tolliver with a temporary restraining order based on a complaint made by Trinity Eriksen’s wife, on behalf of her two daughters. The order, the lawsuit states, claims Charles Tolliver’s statement to one of the girls — “If you call my daughter a n****r again, there will be consequences” — was considered a threat.Charles Tolliver said that when he later went to the Yerington Police Department to obtain copies of the reports his family had filed, he was told the chief of police had ordered them shredded.Yerington police did not respond to a request for comment from HuffPost, but Police Chief Darren Wagner has reportedly acknowledged the documents were shredded and that doing so is a violation of state law. He told the Reno Gazette Journal the mistake was made by a newly hired officer.Wagner also reportedly said that his department did not open an investigation into the family’s complaints.“I wouldn’t have investigated if a black child posted a picture saying he was going cracker hunting,” Wagner told the Reno Gazette Journal. “I am sick of everyone saying we did something wrong. We can’t police bad behavior.”Charles Tolliver told HuffPost he believes authorities did not act because the kid in the Snapchat photos is the son of a sheriff’s deputy.“That was a direct threat,” he said. “If I’d done that, I guarantee I’d be in jail.”Contacted by HuffPost on Friday, the Lyon County School District declined to comment on allegations made in the lawsuit. In a later statement, sent via email, the school district said “student/staff safety” is its No. 1 priority and that “all reported matters are thoroughly investigated.”Keyser-Cooper said that since the lawsuit has been filed, the girls have received additional racist texts.“They’re young teenagers who want to live normal lives and they’re devastated,” she said. “This is not a problem where we’re seeking damages for a bad thing that has happened. We’re seeking to stop the conduct. It’s ongoing and I’m now considering filing for a restraining order.”Marriott-Tolliver said Keyser-Cooper is not charging her family legal fees. However, they are responsible for fees associated with court filings, depositions and related expenses. Keyser-Cooper said those costs will total about $10,000, money the family doesn’t have. Last week, they created a GoFundMe to help with costs.“The girls don’t understand all of this and they are upset, but they know they have to stand up for themselves and others, and do what’s right,” said Marriott-Tolliver.Send David Lohr an email or follow him on Facebook and Twitter.

The two were photographed together alongside other celebrities to promote Time’s Up, the action plan and legal defense fund that aims to combat gender and racial discrimination. Many were quick to call out the participation of “Girls” creator Dunham, who defended Murray Miller, a writer on the HBO series, after actress Aurora Perrinea accused him of rape. “Why is Lena Dunham there?” one commenter wrote of the Time’s Up photo. “She’s part of the problem. No thank you to Time’s Up.”Thompson later removed the photo from her Instagram, but not before reportedly responding to the criticism. “Lena was not anywhere present in our group during the countless hours of work for the last two months,” the “Thor: Ragnarok” star wrote. “We hosted an open house for actresses for red carpet messaging and Lena presence was a surprise to us all.” She continued: “This is a time of reckoning. And for many, a re-education. So many women also have real work to do. I’m afraid it’s too nuanced a conversation to have on this platform. But I hear you, and know that your thoughts and words are not lost on me. It’s been discussed.”But after a string of headlines framed the exchange as Thompson “calling out” Dunham, Thompson took to Twitter, emphasizing that the Time’s Up campaign is “for everyone, in all capacities, contributions big and small.” “I sometimes lack finesse in navigating social media,” Thompson wrote in a statement she posted to Twitter. “Hard to discuss issues with nuance there. A response I made to comments on an Instagram became fodder for a piece that I believe was designed to create conflict where there isn’t any. It’s perhaps more complex than that. But I, in no way, want to diminish Lena Dunham and her work, her voice, and her importance. We have spoken and she knows my heart.She continued: “I feel a responsibility to women that have sometimes felt ignored, dismissed, and underrepresented. They are my beacons. I regret that my words were misinterpreted to distract from the most important thing: The Time’s Up campaign is for everyone, in all capacities, contributions big and small. It doesn’t belong to any one. It is for us all. The beauty of this huge collaboration has been a group of countless committed people who have come together for a shared purpose. To create change. And it is such a powerful thing. I stand, humbled, with everyone involved. Linked not ranked.”Dunham later released a statement that shows no bad blood toward Thompson. She explained she was absent from previous Time’s Up planning due to “highly personal reasons.”“I was honored to be invited to the meeting by a close friend and to observe the work that these amazing women have been doing the past few months,” Dunham said in a statement to Indiewire. “For highly personal reasons, I’ve been unable to join previous efforts but being asked to be a part of this celebratory moment was truly beautiful. I’ve worked with Tessa and respect her artistry and admire her consistent candor.”Move it along, no feud to see here. "

The show, hosted by Seth Meyers, was an entirely political affair, with actresses walking the red carpet in black gowns ― a subtle protest meant to express solidarity with the #MeToo movement and the new Time’s Up initiative to fight sexual harassment and inequality. Several stars, including Michelle Williams and Emma Watson, brought feminist activists with them on the red carpet as their dates, too. And nearly every acceptance speech of the night was capped off with some inspiring acknowledgment of abuse, misogyny or the power of women. For many, the night was a beautiful beacon of change in Hollywood. For the more cynical-minded, it was a spectacle of performative “wokeness,” a highly self-aware morality parade. In many ways, it was both of those things. But more importantly, it was a demonstration of the complexity and contradiction that we all must embrace if we’re actually serious about changing the status quo. Last night, women on the red carpet were asked a series of questions about sexual assault and violence against women, while men were largely allowed to talk about their projects and excitement about the night. Last night, 10 men (the majority of them white) won Golden Globes in various categories; not one of them spoke about sexual violence, equality or the Time’s Up initiative. Last night, an alleged rapist of a 16-year-old girl received a standing ovation, an actor once exposed for soliciting nude pictures from an underage girl accepted a Best Actor award, and countless men and women who have worked with alleged sexual assaulters Woody Allen and Roman Polanski (some as recently as last year) had tears in their eyes as Oprah Winfrey made a rallying cry for revolution in the industry. And yet, among the live tweeters gushing over the dignity and power of women on Sunday, there were also those who questioned what good, really, any of this was doing. How could any of the people in this room truly reckon with men like Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey or Allen when so many have worked with and praised these men in the past? How much of the laughter of those wearing black gowns and black suits and Time’s Up pins was nervous laughter? Time’s Up, the legal fund created to aid victims of sexual violence and harassment in all industries, was the huge star of the night, but as ONTD pointed out in a post published Sunday, some of the biggest champions of the initiative are tainted.The talent agency CAA, which co-founded the fund and donated $2 million to it, allegedly continued to arrange private meetings between Weinstein and actresses even after being alerted to his inappropriate behavior at the height of his power. The company also attempted to facilitate a meeting between Ronan Farrow (a former client) and Weinstein, when the executive caught wind of the journalist’s impending New Yorker piece quoting Weinstein accusers.Meanwhile, other celeb donors to the fund include the likes of Emma Stone (a frequent Allen collaborator), Natalie Portman (a Polanski supporter), Blake Lively (who recently declared that Allen is “empowering to women”), and Michelle Williams (who has never publicly addressed her former co-star Casey Affleck’s sexual harassment allegations). Last night ― and this awards season as a whole ― drove forward an important point we must not lose sight of: Every fave is problematic. To acknowledge that isn’t to absolve anyone of their sins, or dismiss their actions, however harmless or heinous. “Complicit” is a very easy word to throw around, but the complexities of complicity are much harder to pin down.For women, the question of complicity is especially fraught ― calling out men who abuse their power has always been a risk for those operating in a system chiefly designed to protect these very men, but it is women who are most often scrutinized for their silence or complacency. And yet, for every Williams or Stone there’s a Matt Damon or George Clooney, men with more clout and more security. Again, to recognize this is not to suggest that Williams and Stone and any other women who have knowingly worked with or supported unseemly men in Hollywood should get a pass just because they’re speaking out now, or just because many of their male counterparts have faced less scrutiny in that respect. It remains to be seen, after all, how they choose to navigate their careers and admit their mistakes moving forward. It is valid, and vital, to acknowledge that many of the celebrities parading in black down the red carpet last night are the very celebrities who are complicit in the culture of sexual assault in Hollywood. But that’s the point, isn’t it? We are all complicit, in some way, and the harder it is to draw the lines between what makes one complicit or not, the more we must reckon with the repercussions of all of our actions, and the structures that allow powerful men to get away with so much for so long.Hollywood and award shows already lend themselves beautifully to cynicism and apathy, because Hollywood is, largely, bullshit. Award shows perhaps more so. Couple the artifice and self-congratulation with the knowledge that so many trumpeting support for change are part of the very reason we need it, and it’s easy to look at the whole thing as a farce, as a spectacle. It’s tempting, yes. But we really can’t afford to be skeptics at a time like this. Whether CAA, Emma Stone or any of the countless men who wore Time’s Up pins did so genuinely or as a way to redeem their brands in light of their past (or future) transgressions is peripheral to what’s actually at stake.Every cringe-inducing joke Meyers made and every preening acceptance speech is necessary because it keeps the conversation (however shallow) at the top of the collective consciousness. And that is, however depressingly, something. "

Stone’s makeup artist, Rachel Goodwin, told Allure that she wanted the star’s makeup to make a statement, but also to match the mood of the night: solidarity. Dozens of actresses and actors wore black to the awards show as a quiet protest against the entertainment industry’s rampant sexual harassment and assault.“The whole sentiment of the night was about everyone coming together in solidarity, coming out against sexual assault, and it was this important message that we knew would be the sentiment of the night,” Goodwin said. “Some people decided to hold back with their makeup, but I asked myself, ‘How can I send a message with beauty that was in solidarity with the effort?’” She found inspiration in the women’s suffrage movement, which gained women the right to vote in the U.S. in the early 1900s, when the 19th Amendment was ratified. In some states, black women weren’t able to vote until the 1960s, due to voter registration restrictions put in place to deny voting rights to people of color. The three main colors used on banners and posters in the U.S. and British suffrage movements were white, purple and green. Purple symbolized loyalty and dignity (and also was known to symbolize royal blood in the British movement); white suggested purity; and green represented hope. “I found these incredible banners, sashes, pins, and jewelry that women of the suffragist movement wore and they all had these three colors — green, purple, white — and those were the suffragist colors,” Goodwin told Allure. “So I decided to make that my beauty message and to create and design a makeup that had a message of empowerment, so that was where the inspiration came from.” Goodwin said Stone’s eyes are green, her lips and cheeks were purple, and there’s white in her eyeshadow. “Those are the only three colors in the makeup,” she said. Clarification: This article has been updated to explain that the 19th Amendment technically gave all American women the right to vote, but voter restrictions and Jim Crow laws prevented many nonwhite women from voting until the 1960s.

Well, and that parrots make the best of friends, but that’s a different story. Harding has been in the midst of a media tour of sorts, while the film biopic starring Margot Robbie as the former Olympic figure skater contends for some major awards love. But for Harding, things didn’t entirely go as planned during an interview via satellite on “Good Morning Britain” Tuesday with pot-stirrer Piers Morgan, whose line of questioning almost made her cut the appearance short. When Morgan drilled Harding about her involvement in the 1994 attack on her figure skating competitor, Nancy Kerrigan, ahead of that year’s Winter Olympics, the conversation became heated. “I respect you for trying to ask these questions. I’m here to talk about the future and what it means,” Harding said. “My movie is going to help so many people, [and let them know] that it is OK to ask for help. So, that’s why I’m here.”Morgan, however, was just getting started and refused to subscribe to the narrative that Harding was the true victim, as the film, which delves heavily into her abusive relationships with her mother and ex-husband Jeff Gillooly, contends. “Maybe it suits you to play the victim,” he said. “But I think the victim in all this wasn’t you. It was Nancy Kerrigan who had her Olympic dream shattered.”“Thank you so much but I think I’m going to have to say have a good night,” a clearly annoyed Harding responded.The skater was banned from the U.S. Figure Skating Association for life and sentenced to three years probation after she plead guilty to conspiring to hinder the prosecution of those who attacked Kerrigan. She’s since denied any involvement in the crime, though she recently told ABC News that she “knew something was up.”After telling Morgan that he wasn’t letting her finish, Harding stuck around for a few more questions about the incident she’d clearly prefer to move on from. “I think that many people are the victims of abuse every single day, and can’t stand up for themselves,” Harding said. “People need to be able to understand that we need to stand united, and that abuse should not be happening anymore.”“You did know what was happening, what they were planning to do, didn’t you?” Morgan pressed. “You didn’t have any knowledge at all, it was pure coincidence?”“No, I did not,” she responded before the interview ended for good. Harding made an appearance at the Golden Globes on Sunday night to support the film, which was nominated for three awards. Allison Janney, who portrayed her abusive mother, won the Golden Globe for best supporting actress in a movie."

Unfortunately, that new world has raised some concerns.Before the “Aladdin” cast — which includes Will Smith as the genie and Marwan Kenzari as a new “hot” Jafar — was even officially announced, there were reports that Disney was “struggling” to find actors to play Aladdin and Jasmine. Online backlash ensued. Ultimately, Egyptian-born actor Mena Massoud and British-Indian actress Naomi Scott were chosen for the parts.Scott’s casting drew further complaints, as some critics took issue with the inclusion of a non-Arab actress as Jasmine. Moreover, when white actor Billy Magnussen joined the cast in a new role, and reports surfaced of white background actors being made up to look darker, concerns of whitewashing spread.During an interview about his new movie “12 Strong,” we asked Iranian-born actor Navid Negahban, who plays the sultan in “Aladdin,” about the concerns. Negahban believes it’s a nonissue.“It’s not whitewashing,” he said. The actor then used a metaphor to explain the importance of diversity.“The thing is that the garden should be filled with flowers of different kinds,” he said. “If not, the garden is going to be very boring. So you’re gonna go and see this beautiful garden with colorful flowers, and I just hope that you enjoy the journey.”“Just go enjoy the journey,” Negahban said, “because you will definitely love the film. It doesn’t matter how old you are, the film has something for you to take away from it.”Negahban’s fellow cast members seem unaffected by the concerns, too. Smith shared a photo with Massoud, Scott and Kenzari back in September, and you ain’t ever seen smiles like these.In addition to discussing “Aladdin,” Negahban told HuffPost about playing General Abdul Rashid Dostum in “12 Strong,” which is based on actual events. The new film, inspired by Doug Stanton’s Horse Soldiers, revolves around the time U.S. Special Forces partnered with Afghanistan’s Northern Alliance to fight the Taliban following Sept. 11, 2001.Negahban also discussed his new role as the Shadow King on FX’s “X-Men” universe show “Legion,” and a classic moment with his “Homeland” character, Abu Nazir.How important was the book Horse Soldiers in preparing you for “12 Strong”?[The book] gave me an understanding of the situation, what took place on the ground and ... the character. Mark Nutsch and Bob Pennington [soldiers involved in the real-life conflict] came to set. They were very helpful. And J.R. Seeger, who was a CIA agent on the ground, he was tremendously helpful because he had a personal relationship with Dostum. He was able to to give me some personal insight.You give a sobering speech in this movie about how allies one day can be enemies the next. What was that moment like?Just imagine, we’ve been working on this project for three months and you become part of the story. The story takes over and the bond that was created at that moment. That speech was very heartfelt and was very true and was very sad.Dostum is kind of hard to read at first, but his character changes throughout the movie, particularly when he talks about having the heart of a warrior.All the guys that I talked to ... they were saying that he was this tough warlord and warrior and soldier, but at the same time, deep down, he is very playful. He is joking around. He is like a kid, a childlike spirit in that everything is possible. “We can do it. OK, let’s go and do it.” And he’s very sensitive. This is what the guys [described], the guys who dealt with him one on one.You’re known for playing some iconic antagonists, such as terrorist Abu Nazir in “Homeland.” How did that experience compare to playing Dostum, an Afghan warlord who sides with the U.S. in the fight against the Taliban?I look just at the character. This character is just a man. You take a man and you put him in the circumstances that he’s in and you use his journey and his background to give color to create this beautiful painting on white canvas. With Dostum, it was very complex because he’s so multilayered in every given circumstance. He would turn and he would switch, so you have to just let go of yourself and let go of control and allow the character to take over. There’s a famous “Homeland” moment when Brody texts Abu Nazir “May 1″ to warn him of a U.S. led attack against him. Do people ever text you “May 1” nowadays?[Laughs] When the show came on, I had a couple of those. It was just announced that you’re playing another villain ― Amahl Farouk, aka the Shadow King, in “Legion” Season 2. What’s it been like taking on that character?Oh my gosh, this is fascinating. It’s an amazing character, and I’m so excited. And actually I kind of fell into it because they already shot about six or seven episodes, and I had to come in and catch up with them … they were so helpful. And, oh my gosh, Dan Stevens and Aubrey Plaza. These two were kind of babysitting me. Aubrey was guiding me [on] what was the journey of the character. A beautiful, sweet group of people to work with. I just love them. They took me in, I don’t know, like an orphan, and they gave me a home.There was a great response to the first clip of you from the Television Critics Association press tour, during which Dan Stevens’ character, David, sees a fortune teller who turns out to be Amahl Farouk.Thank you so much. I can’t wait to see how the people respond to it. I’m a kid inside. I’m a kid with the comic books all my life. I was very excited. The funny thing is, the day that I arrived on the set — I flew in on Sunday and then I went Monday. I was there and they handed me all these nice scripts ... and [actor] Bill Irwin, he walked up to me and he said, “Do you have anybody to run lines with? I do have time if you need help. I’m here to help you.” These guys were the sweetest people, and the way they took me in was unbelievable.So what can we expect from the Sultan?The sultan ― it was kind of like a childhood dream. It was like a kid’s dream come to reality. Just imagine me coming from [Mashhad, Iran, as] a kid who has a dream and is coming up and ends up playing the sultan in a Disney movie. It was an amazing journey. Beautiful people to work with.This is one of the tricky questions ... because I don’t know how much I can talk about without me getting into trouble, but I just have to tell you that the sultan has a depth, and the story goes deeper, maybe deeper than the animation. It’s very heartfelt.“12 Strong” goes nationwide Jan. 19, 2018. “Aladdin” is set to be released in May 2019.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."

She said she wanted to create this kind of character because “it represents the world.”“This is a show that’s always been able to represent the world and talk about it without being so issue-heavy. We can do it through the dynamics of the family,” Gilbert said.There will be one episode in the nine-episode revival that will focus more heavily on the way Mark dresses. “We did a lot of research because we wanted to make sure and do it properly,” Gilbert said. “Roseanne” originally aired from 1988 to 1997 and was praised for its honest portrayal of a white, blue-collar American family.

Stone, who was nominated for her performance as Billie Jean King in “Battle of the Sexes,” filmed Lawrence’s reaction to the switch-up in all its hilarious glory. “Hi, what happened tonight?” Stone asks the “Mother” star in a video posted on her Facebook page.“Well, you had told me that you wanted me to be your date to the after-parties so I, you know, got us some tickets to some after-parties,” Lawrence explained. “I booked a car and I was halfway through glam when you told me that you didn’t want to go.”“You just wanted to come over to my house, so I sent my hair and makeup team home and now this is what I look like,” the actress said.The two then erupt into laughter as Lawrence turns toward the camera to reveal the full look. Earlier in the evening, Stone walked the red carpet with King by her side. Both wore the ceremony’s signature shade — black — as a gesture of solidarity with victims of sexual abuse and harassment. The “La La Land” actress also subtly honored the women’s suffrage movement by using the three main colors used for the movement’s banners and posters in her own makeup."

They are the parents of 192,000 American-born children who will now have to decide between following their parents to a country with one of the highest murder rates in the world, or being permanently separated from their parents. This is what compassion looks like in the current Republican Party.This assault on Salvadoran tepesianos (TPS beneficiaries) is the latest example of the extreme right’s vise-like grip on the levers of power in this country. An extreme right that is not just nationalistic in fervor, but anti-immigrant, anti-inclusive, and most worrisome of all: anti-American.This is not the America we fell in love with as immigrants. This is not the America that was the shining city on a hill from years past. This is a post-apocalyptic America led by a President with no understanding of what makes this country great despite his hollow MAGA campaign slogan. But how many more examples do we — people of color — need to finally realize what this means for us?President Trump — far from being a champion for Haitians, far from being a champion for Salvadorans, for Hondurans, for Nicaraguans, and for all communities of color — continues his direct assault on diversity. He continues his quest to divide this great country into two camps, us and them. This, is the biggest injustice.Dividing us into camps is a dangerous reminder that the best way to establish dominance over groups of people is by stripping them of their role in society to become a pariah. Distinguished poet Roque Dalton called out this power of classification in his short poem Poema de Amor written many years ago for his Salvadoran compatriots. The silver and gold rolls of years past, as evidenced in the opening lines:The ones who built the Panama Canal (and were put on the “silver roll” not the “gold roll”), the ones who repaired the Pacific fleet in the bases of California, the ones who rotted in prisons in Guatemala, Mexico, Honduras, Nicaragua for being thieves, smugglers, swindlers, for being hungry the ever-suspicious ones (‘I bring forth this individual arrested for being a suspicious bystander with the aggravation of being Salvadoran’)… the ones who never know where they are from, the best craftsmen in the world, the ones who mowed down with bullets while crossing the border, the ones who died of malaria, or scorpions or snake bites in banana plantation hell, the ones who will cry drunk for the national anthem under the Pacific cyclone or the northern snow, the hustlers, the beggars, the potheads, Salvadoran sons of bitches, the ones who barely made it back, the ones who had a little more luck, the eternal undocumented, the ‘do-all’, the ‘sell-all’, the ‘eat-all’’, the first to take out the knife, the saddest sad people in the world, my compatriots, my brothers.As Dalton wrote, the do-all, sell-all, eat-all entrepreneurial spirit of the Salvadoran people must now be focused on one thing: organizing and canvassing for candidates that will have the community’s best interests at heart and in mind.We must — as painful as it is for many of us — dust ourselves off and get back up. This is only the beginning of the battle. Yes, this hurt. This hurts for many friends, mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters. People who have created a productive life in a country that initially opened their arms to them only to say ‘you’re no longer wanted’ on the basis of institutionalized racism.This is not the America we know. This is not what makes America great. This is not the America that has changed the world in so many positive ways since the Greatest Generation stormed the beaches of Normandy. This is not the America that sent men to the Moon and brought them back safely to Earth.The beauty of living in a democracy, however, is that in November we can change the course of our nation by shifting the balance of power in Congress, and demanding they pass a permanent solution for these communities who are American in every way but their place of birth.

They are the parents of 192,000 American-born children who will now have to decide between following their parents to a country with one of the highest murder rates in the world, or being permanently separated from their parents. This is what compassion looks like in the current Republican Party.This assault on Salvadoran tepesianos (TPS beneficiaries) is the latest example of the extreme right’s vise-like grip on the levers of power in this country. An extreme right that is not just nationalistic in fervor, but anti-immigrant, anti-inclusive, and most worrisome of all: anti-American.This is not the America we fell in love with as immigrants. This is not the America that was the shining city on a hill from years past. This is a post-apocalyptic America led by a President with no understanding of what makes this country great despite his hollow MAGA campaign slogan. But how many more examples do we — people of color — need to finally realize what this means for us?President Trump — far from being a champion for Haitians, far from being a champion for Salvadorans, for Hondurans, for Nicaraguans, and for all communities of color — continues his direct assault on diversity. He continues his quest to divide this great country into two camps, us and them. This, is the biggest injustice.Dividing us into camps is a dangerous reminder that the best way to establish dominance over groups of people is by stripping them of their role in society to become a pariah. Distinguished poet Roque Dalton called out this power of classification in his short poem Poema de Amor written many years ago for his Salvadoran compatriots. The silver and gold rolls of years past, as evidenced in the opening lines:The ones who built the Panama Canal (and were put on the “silver roll” not the “gold roll”), the ones who repaired the Pacific fleet in the bases of California, the ones who rotted in prisons in Guatemala, Mexico, Honduras, Nicaragua for being thieves, smugglers, swindlers, for being hungry the ever-suspicious ones (‘I bring forth this individual arrested for being a suspicious bystander with the aggravation of being Salvadoran’)… the ones who never know where they are from, the best craftsmen in the world, the ones who mowed down with bullets while crossing the border, the ones who died of malaria, or scorpions or snake bites in banana plantation hell, the ones who will cry drunk for the national anthem under the Pacific cyclone or the northern snow, the hustlers, the beggars, the potheads, Salvadoran sons of bitches, the ones who barely made it back, the ones who had a little more luck, the eternal undocumented, the ‘do-all’, the ‘sell-all’, the ‘eat-all’’, the first to take out the knife, the saddest sad people in the world, my compatriots, my brothers.As Dalton wrote, the do-all, sell-all, eat-all entrepreneurial spirit of the Salvadoran people must now be focused on one thing: organizing and canvassing for candidates that will have the community’s best interests at heart and in mind.We must — as painful as it is for many of us — dust ourselves off and get back up. This is only the beginning of the battle. Yes, this hurt. This hurts for many friends, mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters. People who have created a productive life in a country that initially opened their arms to them only to say ‘you’re no longer wanted’ on the basis of institutionalized racism.This is not the America we know. This is not what makes America great. This is not the America that has changed the world in so many positive ways since the Greatest Generation stormed the beaches of Normandy. This is not the America that sent men to the Moon and brought them back safely to Earth.The beauty of living in a democracy, however, is that in November we can change the course of our nation by shifting the balance of power in Congress, and demanding they pass a permanent solution for these communities who are American in every way but their place of birth. My compatriots, my brothers."

The news was first reported Monday by the Springfield News-Sun. Kucinich, a former congressman from the state and contributor for Fox News, is the seventh Democrat to file for the race to replace term-limited Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R). The 71-year-old still needs to select a running mate and file a petition with 1,000 signatures by early February, the News-Sun reports. Representatives for Kucinich clarified Tuesday that the paperwork was only a “procedural step in a potential run.” “It was not a formal declaration of candidacy,” Kucinich spokesman Andy Juniewicz said. “He has not made an official announcement, nor has he yet filed nominating petitions with the Secretary of State.”Kucinich began his career in Cleveland local politics before serving eight terms in Congress and running for the Democratic nomination in two presidential elections.The gubernatorial race is already crowded with candidates for both parties. Kucinich would be a high-profile candidate, but it’s uncertain what his chances are on the Democratic ticket. As a contributor for Fox News, Kucinich has made comments in defense of President Donald Trump that may isolate him in the congested field.This story has been updated with comment from Dennis Kucinich’s spokesman.

Streisand said she’d heard backstage that she was the only woman to win a Golden Globe in the best director category, receiving the award in 1984 for her film, “Yentl.”“I’m the only woman to get the best director award [at the Golden Globes]. You know that was 1984 ― that was 34 years ago,” the singer said, her voice rising.“Folks, time’s up!” she said, as the audience loudly cheered. “We need more women directors and more women to be nominated for best director. These are so many films out there that are so good directed by women,” Streisand added, as the camera panned out to show many in the room nodding.Only men were in the running for best director at this year’s Golden Globes ceremony, which actress Natalie Portman took note of earlier in the show as she helped announce the winner in that category. Streisand later lamented the “terrible fact” she’d found out at the awards show, and posted about it on Twitter. “Here’s a terrible fact. There has not been a single woman who has won the Golden Globe for Best Director since I was fortunate enough to win it for Yentl in 1984,” the singer tweeted. “That’s 34 years ago! Not right!” She then recognized female directors she thought deserved to be nominated this year: Streisand previously has said sexism was the primary reason she hasn’t reached one of her goals: an Academy Award nomination for directing.The Oscars didn’t “want to see a woman director,” she said in an interview with director Robert Rodriguez at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2017. “I must have been more hurt than I thought,” Streisand said. “Because I didn’t want to direct for years.” “I’m very proud to stand in a room with people who speak out against gender inequality, sexual harassment and the pettiness that has poisoned our politics,” she said before announcing the winner in the Best Picture, Drama, category. “And I’m proud that our industry, faced with uncomfortable truths, has vowed to change the ways we do business.” "

When the Los Angeles Times asked if she’d think about a 2020 bid, Winfrey slyly responded, “OK.”But she also told Bloomberg while backstage at the ceremony that she is not actively pursuing a campaign.When asked if she had plans to run, Winfrey replied that, “I don’t ― I don’t.” CNN also reported Monday that two of Winfrey’s close friends, who requested anonymity, said she is “actively thinking” about a 2020 run. One of the friends said it’s something Winfrey has been mulling over for several months. Both friends said it follows some private urging by her confidants.Winfrey’s longtime partner, Stedman Graham, separately suggested that fans who are urging her to run for office shouldn’t give up hope.“It’s up to the people,” he told the LA Times when asked about her possible run. “She would absolutely do it.”This story has been updated to include CNN’s report."

The two bantered back and forth about Meyers’ mansplaining and how Poehler didn’t need his help to tell a joke. (Leslie Knope doesn’t have TIME FOR YOU, SETH!)Once Poehler finally delivered her joke ― “Said the peach in ‘Call Me by Your Name,’ ‘This scene is the pits!’” ― the actress took a beat and went for a sip of wine, exclaiming that she’s “reclaiming my wine.”The line is an obvious nod to Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), Congresswoman extraordinaire. In July 2017, Waters pushed back during a House Financial Services Committee meeting during Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s testimony. Waters asked Mnuchin about his office’s lack of response to a letter from her pertaining to President Trump’s financial ties to Russia. Mnuchin attempted to evade the question and run out the clock, but Waters shut him the hell down. “Reclaiming my time,” she said, repeatedly, in an effort to reroute the response. It was easily one of the most viral moments of the year.Poehler’s channeling of that ultimate shut-down with has people excited all over again. Twitter users seem to think it’s the catchphrase of 2018.Anyone else in sudden need of a bottle?"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a52b53d1d00003d005c2b00.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Golden Globes red carpet was all black. Everyone from Nick Jonas to Meryl Streep was sporting black at Sunday night’s award show as a symbol of protest against sexual harassment and assault in Hollywood. Claire Foy wore a sleek, all-black suit, and Justin Timberlake looked dapper in a silk-trimmed black suit. Other all-black-clad celebrities included Tracee Ellis Ross, Emma Watson, Hugh Jackman, Jessica Chastain, Octavia Spencer and Kerry Washington. “The question isn’t who are you wearing tonight, it’s why are you wearing black?” E! News co-host Giuliana Rancic said on the red carpet. The powerful act of solidarity comes in the wake of the #MeToo movement in which millions of people around the world shared their stories of sexual harassment and assault. The movement inspired a cultural reckoning that has brought down many alleged predators in power including Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey and Matt Lauer. Actress Michelle Williams wore black and brought activist and #MeToo creator Tarana Burke as her red carpet guest.“This moment is so powerful because we’re staring at a... collaboration between these two worlds that people don’t usually put together and would most likely have us pinned against each other,” Burke told E! co-host Ryan Seacrest. “It’s really powerful to be on the red carpet tonight.”Williams added how powerful this moment is for her as a woman and a mother. “I thought that I would have to raise my daughter to learn how to protect herself in a dangerous world and I think because of the work that Tarana has done and the work that I’m learning how to do we actually have the opportunity to hand our children a different world,” she said. Another accessory commonly spotted on this year’s red carpet were tiny pins that read “Time’s Up.” The small black and white pins are part of the recent initiative of the same name spearheaded by more than 300 actresses to combat sexual violence in Hollywood. Stars including Seth Meyers, Hugh Jackman, James Franco and Bob Odenkirk donned Time’s Up pins on the red carpet. The Time’s Up initiative was announced on New Year’s Day and was inspired by the recent #MeToo movement as well. One way the initiative is hoping to combat sexual misconduct is through a newly created legal defense fund that will help less-privileged women come forward with their stories.“This is not about Hollywood,” actress Debra Messing said on the red carpet. “This is about every woman in every industry, globally.”Scroll down to see more pictures of big stars wearing black.

49,ENTERTAINMENT,What Hollywood Gets Wrong About Drug Addiction,"Claire Rudy Foster, ContributorWriter",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-hollywood-gets-wrong-about-drug-addiction_us_5a53eb98e4b0cd114bdb35c3,"Even in progressive films, realistic representation of people in recovery Is missing.",2018-01-08,<p>Jane Lynch has been sober for more than a decade. Why don’t we see recovery like hers on the big screen?</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a53eca12000003d0057d0ef.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Heroin addicts all look the same in the movies. Have you noticed? They are limpid, nocturnal looking. Their skin is translucent to the point of looking pale green. Their eyes are too large. They look like something is draining the life out of them, sucking their blood and replacing it with something milky and toxic.They remind me of that kid who played the lead in Elephant. I auditioned for Elephant, actually, along with a couple thousand other people. Gus Van Sant sat at a card table in the lobby of an abandoned elementary school in Portland and all of us, a line of people all fluffing and sweating and fiddling with our contact cards, shuffled by him to get our photo taken in front of a plain white backdrop.By the time it was my turn in front of the backdrop, I was dehydrated and starting to shake. It was 2002. I was a freshman in college. I’d recently started drinking again. After months away from alcohol and on antidepressants, my body wasn’t tolerating anything well. It was never sunny in Portland, but it had to be sunny that day.“Ever acted before?”I nodded. Two small roles, high school drama. I didn’t have a headshot, like some of the others. I’d written my height and weight on an index card. I was ready to be discovered. I stood in front of the screen. What was I doing here? Van Sant, thin and wearing a long sleeved black coat, even in the heat, had his back to me. I was not making any kind of impression. I’m positive that my headshot, if it still exists, shows my eyes drifting to one side of the frame, hoping to be noticed by someone who is engaged elsewhere. I left in a sulk, pushing my bike along the sidewalk, and immediately went to get some beer.When people ask me what addiction feels like, I name a movie. They make it easy to describe. There are plenty of kinds of addiction. Pick your poison. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Jesus’ Son. Ciao, Manhattan. Trainspotting. Pulp Fiction. I’ve spent my time inside each of them. My drug and alcohol use careened from the stylized amphetamine torture of Requiem for a Dream to outrageous Pineapple Express nights. I saw my addiction reflected in Magnolia. That scene when Julianne Moore melts down in a pharmacy? That was me.I had sickness all around me. I was very, very sick.My addiction, even on its off days, was always there. It was James Gandolfini, in True Romance, washing his hands in the hotel bathroom, while I bled on the tatty carpet. It was Christopher Walken in King of New York, opening my shirt on the subway and slipping a cold hand over my chest.I watched a lot of those movies when I was using, and it reassured me that at least my story wasn’t a total anomaly. It wasn’t until I got sober — until I’d survived what I sometimes call my Tarantino years — that I realized there are almost no people in recovery in the movies.When there are, they’re stupid. As though they are only whole in the presence of the substances that animated them. Genius belongs to the doomed ones, the alcoholics who are about to relapse. Or it’s the province of artists, who drop platitudes between eight-balls, Basquiat-style. Sober people are boring. They’re self righteous, to the point of being comical. Marisa Tomei, in Crazy Stupid Love, can’t stop talking about her sobriety date. It’s clear from her behavior that putting the drink down was the only thing she’s got to be proud of — and it’s a joke.People who turned out like me are a joke.Alcoholics turn up trying to prove that they’ve changed, like Hal in Picnic. They may take a break from weed or psychedelics and find that life without hallucinogens just isn’t worth it. Or they calmly puff their lives away, like The Dude in The Big Lebowski, who is kind of a kahlua-seeking missile. The person who is sober, in the movie, is never the hero. They are always fragile. Their addiction is a plot point. It shows up in the first act, like the gun on the wall, and we know that their reprieve won’t last. Sex addiction, alcohol, heroin, whatever. When they slip back into their old habits, it’s just part of the story. Inevitable, even.Choke, for example. Or Thanks For Sharing.Ten years after my last drink, I have acted in a few movie-and-TV things. Mostly as an extra, which is fun, because they feed you and you get to hear all the other extras try to one-up each other and guess who’s the most important, who’s really going somewhere. I am going nowhere. That’s OK with me. I’m a tall blonde, which is a good thing to be, because every show needs one. I was on Portlandia, being a tall blonde. I was in a Yacht music video, being a tall blonde.I got to be a tall blonde body double in I Don’t Feel At Home In This World Anymore. I sat on the overstuffed set couch while the crew adjusted the stands and reflectors around me. The light was going to bounce off my face exactly the way it was going to bounce off Lee Eddy’s in the real movie. I sat in her seat, wearing a denim shirt that mimicked the texture of her costume. Our measurements were the same, and the planes of our faces were close enough that the casting director said we looked like cousins.In that moment, I realized what had made me crazy for years in my addiction. I was acting in the wrong movie. I thought I was the tall, elegant lead. Atomic Blonde. The killer. The misunderstood, brilliant writer. I was so serious that it must have been funny to watch — or painful. I was Madeline Kahn in Blazing Saddles, “sick and tired of love.”I brought my angst to every one of the roles I was called on to play, and didn’t understand why they didn’t work out. My relationships crumbled at my touch. Friends told me I was “too much.” I gravitated towards people who belonged in the same movies as me. The results were noir, to say the least.I struggled with the same thing for years in my early recovery. I felt out of place, because I was. I was reading the wrong lines, wearing the wrong wardrobe. Alcohol and drugs had numbed my discomfort and helped me buy into my own story. Without them, I had to accept that I was completely out of touch with who I really was. I may as well have been Steve Buscemi, trying to catch a romantic lead in a Jane Austen flick. With that face? I was in the wrong show.In recovery, I learned that I wasn’t the lead at all. I was reading the wrong lines, stealing someone else’s blocking, and wondering why nobody wanted to give me a Best Actor award. I thought I had gravitas, when really, I was stiff and cold, no fun at all.It turns out I’m not a hero. I’m a walk-on. If you’re reading this, I am a bit player in your life. You’ll probably forget about me as soon as you’re done with this essay. You’ll go back to your spotlight, the center stage of your life. Your earbuds firmly in, selecting your own soundtrack.Today, I’m OK with that. The colors have come back into my life. I see in Technicolor. My sense of proportion has changed, and I see with relief that I’m not as important as I thought I was. I don’t have to play as hard. I’m just an extra: some color in the background. I’m not Drunk Girl #4, though. I’m more like Happy Neighbor. I don’t worry about how my story will arc: I’m focused on the scene I’m in, right now.I spent so many hours stoned, drunk, faded, and wishing I could fade into the screen that showed me a more elegantly constructed life than the one I was living.Back then, I would have thought the life I have today is boring. Where are the gangsters? Where are the drugs? But I’ve been in car chases, and overdoses, and deals that went sour. I know what it feels like when a bad man puts his arm around my shoulder and asks me to name my price. Those movies never have a good ending. I’m ready to try something that at least has some laughs.What movie am I in now? I have no idea. I’ve quit acting, among other things.I think it’s working out."

Nowhere. But for girls and women in the poorest countries, that inequality is amplified,” ONE.org writes on its website. “We won’t end extreme poverty until we break down the barriers holding girls and women back.” For example, there are more than 130 million school-aged girls around the world who aren’t currently in school, according to the advocacy group. This education gap is perpetuating a cycle of poverty for many communities worldwide.Britton wrote on Instagram that she’d dressed in all black to “acknowledge that it is time for all of us, men and women, to empower ourselves with equality.”“My hope is that this movement will now reach the grass roots, the small towns, the villages near and far, where women have been silenced, without resources, in the face of gender disparity,” wrote the “Nashville” actress, who has advocated for girls’ education and Ebola awareness on behalf of ONE.org in the past. Lingua Franca designer Rachelle Hruska told The Cut that the brand was grateful to see one of its products spark an important conversation about poverty and inequality.“That we have any part of this moment in history [shows that] everyone has a voice,” Hruska said. “We are so grateful to be using ours, even if through silent stitching to drive conversations and change. ‘Poverty is sexist’ is more than a slogan: It’s a fact of life for hundreds of millions of girls and women around the world.”"
51,WOMEN,Where Were All Those 'Phenomenal Men' At The Golden Globes Anyway?,Emma Gray,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/phenomenal-men-golden-globes_us_5a53aa6de4b003133ecae9a5,"They wore black, but said little.",2018-01-08,"There were lots of ""Time's Up"" pins at the Golden Globes, but few words from men about the movement.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a53ad701c00003b0068f394.jpeg?cache=rI4y0lHHlr&ops=crop_742_1382_2686_1679%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"One unifying message came through at the 2018 Golden Globes: Time is up ― on industries that protect abusers, and on a world that tries to silence people of all genders who speak up about sexual harassment and assault. Laura Dern pointed to a culture that silences victims and called for “restorative justice.” Frances McDormand spoke about the “tectonic shift in our industry’s power structure.” Natalie Portman made the gutsy choice to call out the “all-male nominees” for Best Director while introducing them, and Barbra Streisand expressed horror that she’s the only woman to have ever won in that category ― in 1984. Meryl Streep, Michelle Williams, Amy Poehler, Dern, Susan Sarandon, Emma Watson and Emma Stone used their star power to elevate their dates for the evening ― activists Ai-jen Poo, Tarana Burke, Saru Jayaraman, Monica Ramirez, Rosa Clemente, Marai Larasi and Billie Jean King. At a time when Hollywood awards shows can feel pointless, boring and frivolous, the Globes emphatically did not. “I want all the girls watching here, now, to know that a new day is on the horizon!” Oprah said, taking the audience to church. ”And when that new day finally dawns, it will be because of a lot of magnificent women, many of whom are right here in this room tonight, and some pretty phenomenal men, fighting hard to make sure that they become the leaders who take us to the time when nobody ever has to say ‘Me too’ again.”But notably absent from this public-facing movement? Those aforementioned “pretty phenomenal men.” Despite a sea of dudes in black suits wearing Time’s Up pins, not one man who was honored at the Globes used his speech to stand in solidarity with women colleagues ― or even mention gender inequality, sexual harassment or abuse. The red carpet was similarly lopsided, as women were overwhelmingly asked about the meaning of their black attire, and men were asked to plug their latest projects. (To his credit, host Seth Meyers tackled Hollywood sexual harassment and abuse head-on during his opening monologue, calling out alleged Hollywood predators like Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey and Woody Allen by name.)Viewers took note of the male silence. “Can we take a moment to honor all of the incredible men at the #GoldenGlobes that used their speech time to boldly stand in solidarity with women tonight,” tweeted Twitter user Brown-Eyed Amazon, with a photo of an empty auditorium. The gender gap shows that some men feel that sexual violence, sexual harassment and gender inequality are issues that do not affect them. “They get the choice,” said Kristen Houser, chief public affairs officer at the National Sexual Violence Resource Center. “They don’t have to [comment.] And that’s perhaps because they haven’t yet figured out that it impacts their well-being, too. How nice to feel like you don’t have to participate.” That male celebrities felt they could sidestep the discussion about industry sexism and abuse was especially glaring, considering that some of the actors who won were honored for roles that specifically addressed sexual violence. Sam Rockwell won for his role as a police officer investigating the rape and murder of a teenage girl in “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” and Alexander Skarsgard took home a Golden Globe for his performance as serial abuser Perry Wright in “Big Little Lies.” Both praised their female co-stars, but neither addressed how men perpetuate a culture of sexual violence.Public male alliance with the cause can be tricky, and some male stars (and their publicists) may have decided it was best left to black attire. When members of any privileged community decide to be vocal on behalf of a group they are not a part of, there’s always a chance of making a widely noticed misstep, or of inviting charges of insincerity. Men who step into the public eye to discuss toxic masculinity and gender inequality also tend to be valorized by the media in a way that can ultimately take away from the work being done by women and gender nonconforming people. (See: the never-ending discussion over actor Matt McGorry’s “woke bae” status.) This makes activism a somewhat risky PR move ― something that a public figure needs to decide is worth potential controversy and critique.“They’re afraid that they don’t get it and that they’re gonna say something that makes them sound stupid or wrong, or be offensive when they don’t mean to,” said Houser. “You’re a celebrity on national television. If you say something stupid, Twitter’s gonna blow up and it’s gonna be captured in perpetuity.” But it’s imperative that men make the decision to do the right thing despite the PR risk. Men are certainly impacted by the continuum of sexism and sexual violence ― both as victims of abuse (Terry Crews and Corey Feldman) and as individuals who have to navigate a world that defines masculinity very narrowly.And men who do not exist in the public eye are simply more likely to take cues from famous, powerful men than they are from women. “Sexism is rampant ― let’s just own it,” said Houser. “If that’s the reality in America, then maybe men are likely to hear it better coming from other men. So step up. We need men ... to spread the realities and truths that women have been telling.”There is also the grim possibility that many men in attendance at the Globes ― even those wearing pins and black suits ― are poor allies in their professional and personal lives. Actress Zoe Kazan tweeted Sunday night that she was “all for solidarity & visible protest but there is definitely at least one man in that room wearing a #TIMESUP pin who is the exact opposite of an ally.” She later said did didn’t intend to call out anyone specifically, but intended her statement “most probably just a fact.” There’s a reason that when Meyers joked at the top of the show that “for the male nominees in the room tonight, this is the first time in three months it won’t be terrifying to hear your name read out loud,” some men in the audience looked patently uncomfortable. Perhaps that discomfort is a good thing. After all, change ― especially when that change involves the acknowledgement and relinquishing of privilege ― is often deeply uncomfortable. But instead of silently standing trying to present themselves as allies, men should turn their discomfort outward, grapple with it openly and take action to right it. “If you’re not part of the solution, it’s really easy to be painted as part of the problem,” said Houser. Time is up, gents. "

Sixteen major climate- and weather-related catastrophes caused a record $306.2 billion in damages and killed at least 362 people in 2017 as the United States suffered its worst wildfire and hurricane seasons in modern history, according to a report released Monday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Hurricanes created the most damage, totaling $265 billion as Hurricanes Harvey, Maria and Irma racked up a respective $125 billion, $90 billion and $50 billion. Wildfires caused $18 billion in losses, tripling previous annual records.The new tally shattered the previous 2005 record of $215 billion, driven mostly by Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma and Rita. Hurricane Harvey, which made landfall over Houston in late August, is second only to Katrina in for record billion-dollar disasters. “2017 was a historic year for billion-dollar weather and climate disasters,” Adam Smith, an climatologist at NOAA, said on a call with reporters.Climate change has made weather events more destructive, with fiercer, more violent storms and prolonged droughts that transformed swaths of the west into tinderboxes, driving up the losses. But part of the problem is that more valuable properties are located on the coasts or near forests. NOAA officials said the analysis did not account for differences between those two factors.“For the purposes especially of this product, we do not try to parse those apart,” Deke Arndt, chief of the monitoring section at NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information, said on a call with reporters. “We’re more interested in quantifying what’s going on. Both the economists and physical scientists will retrospectively look at that, but those sort of happen at the speed of science.”But the cost and death tolls are expected to climb as new data on Puerto Rico’s post-hurricane destruction emerge. The official body count after Hurricanes Maria and Irma ransacked the island territory and destroyed its electrical grid sits at 64, but an analysis by The New York Times pegged the figure at 1,052, and climbing. “We will update the number when that number becomes available, which could be substantially higher,” Jake Crouch, a climate scientist at the National Centers for Environmental Information, said on the call. Even with more accurate data, the report only offers a glimpse at the devastation caused by the disasters.“We do not take into account things like health care-related costs, destruction of natural capital, physical and mental distress,” Crouch said. “It could be stated that these costs are to the best of our ability but they are really a low point to the true total cost.” The findings mirror larger global trends. Natural disasters cost insurance companies a record $135 billion in 2017, according to figures released last week by Munich Re, the world’s largest reinsurer. Counting uninsured losses, that figure climbed to $330 billion. The only costlier year was 2011, when the Tohoku earthquake in Japan contributed to a total of $354 billion. Disasters in the U.S. made up 50 percent of this year’s losses, the German company said, compared to 32 percent on average years. The catastrophes came during a third consecutive year of above-average annual temperatures across the contiguous U.S. and Alaska, the NOAA report found. (Hawaii also saw record temperatures, but was not included in the report). Five states ― Arizona, Georgia, New Mexico, North Carolina and South Carolina ― experienced their warmest year on record. Annual temperatures in another 32 states, including Alaska, ranked among the 10 warmest years on record. "

Kaepernick started kneeling during the pregame national anthem to protest racial injustice and was later joined by a number of other players in the demonstration. He remains unsigned after becoming a free agent in March 2017.NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell says Kaepernick is not being blackballed for his demonstrations, but Kaepernick filed a grievance in October accusing team owners of collusion. President Donald Trump had already stoked the controversy by declaring that protesting players should be fired.Kaepernick has since been honored with Sports Illustrated’s Muhammad Ali Legacy Award for his activism. “I’m glad that Colin Kaepernick and Michael Bennett are making it political,” Ulriksen said. “I’m sure that if King were around today, he’d be disappointed at the slow pace of progress. Two steps forward, 20 steps back. Or 10 yards back, as the metaphor may be.” "
55,POLITICS,Donald Trump Renominates Court Picks Rated 'Not Qualified' To Serve,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-judicial-nominees-not-qualified_us_5a4fc2cae4b01e1a4b14e51d,"He also re-upped judicial nominees hostile to LGBTQ rights, abortion and African-American voting rights.",2018-01-08,Donald Trump doesn't seem to have a problem nominating people to be federal judges who legal experts say aren't qualified for the job.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a4fc3091d000027005c2764.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump on Monday resubmitted 21 judicial nominees to the Senate whose nominations expired in 2017 ― including two rated “not qualified” to be federal judges by the American Bar Association.Charles Goodwin and Holly Teeter are among those in the president’s renominations. The ABA concluded in December that Goodwin, Trump’s nominee to a lifetime seat on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma, is unqualified to fulfill the demands of a federal judge given his “work habits.” The ABA concluded in November that Teeter, Trump’s nominee to a lifetime seat on the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas, is not qualified based on her lack of trial court experience.Judicial nominees rarely earn such an abysmal rating from the ABA, which has reviewed more than 1,700 federal judicial nominees since 1989. None of President Barack Obama’s nominees were rated “not qualified” during his eight years in office. Eight of President George W. Bush’s earned the rating during his two terms. In Trump’s case, four have earned the rating in his first year. Senate Republicans actually confirmed one of them, for some reason. The other one bowed out in embarrassment.Part of Trump’s problem is that he’s flying through judicial nominations without much vetting, and he’s not submitting potential court picks to the ABA before he announces their nominations. Most presidents wait for the ABA rating to come out before announcing a nominee, in part to save face in case one of their nominees gets a bad rating. Obama had a handful of potential court picks who got a “not qualified” rating, but then they were never formally nominated.Progressive advocacy groups are urging Senate GOP leaders to stop being a rubber stamp for Trump’s questionable court picks, despite being in the same party as him.“Nominees who are found to be Not Qualified by the nonpartisan American Bar Association should not move forward,” said Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. “We urge the Senate to assert its constitutionally assigned role in the judicial nomination process. Our courts, and our country, deserve better.”Beyond ABA ratings, Trump has raised red flags with civil rights groups over some of his other renominated judicial picks.Thomas Farr, the president’s pick for a lifetime seat on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, has a long history of defending laws that weaken voting rights for African Americans. He was also a lawyer for GOP Sen. Jesse Helms’ 1990 campaign, which, that year, sent more than 100,000 postcards to black voters in North Carolina with incorrect information about voter qualifications and warned that voter fraud was punishable by up to five years in prison. The Justice Department sued over it and settled. Farr denies he knew about that campaign.Civil rights leaders have said Farr is one of the worst federal court nominees they’ve ever seen.“It is no exaggeration to say that had the White House deliberately sought to identify an attorney in North Carolina with a more hostile record on African-American voting rights and workers’ rights than Thomas Farr, it could hardly have done so,” reads a September letter to senators signed by members of the Congressional Black Caucus.Other controversial nominees include Trump’s circuit court pick Kyle Duncan, who authored legal briefs opposing same-sex marriage, argued in support of Texas’ unconstitutional restrictions on abortion, and unsuccessfully fought to preserve a North Carolina voting law that a federal court struck down as an effort to “target African-Americans with almost surgical precision.”District court nominee Matthew Kacsmaryk has attacked Roe v. Wade and questioned the legality of state bans on “conversion therapy” for LGBTQ kids, while district court nominee Mark Norris led an effort to ban local communities from removing monuments to Confederate leaders and set up a website that used images of refugees alongside pictures of Islamic State terrorists.A White House spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on why Trump resubmitted nominees deemed unqualified for the job.All 21 of Trump’s court picks now await their Senate Judiciary Committee hearings."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a538ac31d000027005c2cf7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ria Mae was once broken up with at a traffic intersection.The singer drew inspiration from the event to write her new song “Red Light,” and it’s only fitting that the song’s video depicts a relationship between two lovers at a personal crossroads. HuffPost got an exclusive look at the video, in which real-life couple Kristen “Kage” Griesbach and Bronwyn Hope star as two women who know it’s time to move on, even as they continue to relive memories of wintery walks and nights on the town. Mae, who identifies as gay, said she believes “the time is right” to explore queer themes in pop music. Her 2016 video for “Gold” similarly portrayed a passionate, if troubled, same-sex relationship. The success of “Gold” ― which one critic hailed as “a rare example of a music video where a lesbian relationship doesn’t exist solely for the titillation of straight men” ― meant that Mae wasn’t concerned about whether she should be honest about her sexuality in “Red Light.”“I want to put out content that I wish I had access to when I was younger,” the singer-songwriter, who hails from Halifax, Nova Scotia, told HuffPost. “As an adult, I can definitely say, ‘Oh, that’s why it feels weird to hold my girlfriend’s hand,’ because I never saw it. And when I did see it, it wasn’t represented in a way that made it OK. It made me feel worse about it [so] it’s important to show that I’m not trying to hide that part of me.”“Red Light” is the second single from 2017’s “My Love,” which is the follow-up EP to Mae’s self-titled 2015 album, her first for Sony Music Canada. Each of the seven songs on the EP sees the Canadian singer-songwriter delving further into pop, hip-hop and dance territory than ever before. One of Mae’s best-known collaborators on “My Love” is Tegan Quin, half of the indie pop duo Tegan and Sara and another outspoken LGBTQ rights advocate. The women team up on “Broken,” a mid-tempo ballad that’s easily one of the EP’s highlights.Mae said collaborating in the studio with Quin was a dream come true, as she names Tegan and Sara among her biggest influences.“For me, they’ve made being gay ― specifically, being a gay woman ― super cool, fashionable and awesome,” said Mae, who opened for Tegan and Sara on their 2017 tour through Europe. “I owe them a lot.”Their song together “became darker and cooler” because of Quin’s presence on it, she said.“I had the song written for a while, and I wasn’t necessarily going to put it on the EP,” Mae said. “But I just had a gut feeling she was going to like it, and she did.” Mae said the start of 2018 has her in a “hyper-creative mode,” and that she has already begun work on a second EP to be released over the summer.Her ultimate goal, she said, is to find new ways “to put out, in the universe, that it’s OK to be yourself.”“Everyone’s mission as an artist should be to be honest, to bring something unique to the table,” she said. “I love being in a position to choose what I say on my albums, and choose what goes in my videos. Even if it only helps three or four people, that’s awesome.”“I feel very lucky to be in this position,” she added, “and I want to keep doing that.”"

So, she might shed it or it might stay there.”Jess Wright, who runs a rabbit rescue clinic in Liskeard, U.K., told CornwallLive.com that it’s common for different patterns to develop on a rabbit’s fur depending on the season or the weather.“Some rabbits can change color completely or some will just get a patch that changes,” Wright said.Hazel said she’s looking forward to seeing whether the cross remains for Easter, or whether the rabbit’s fur will change again, according to CornwallLive.com.“She might grow something else,” she said. “She might have a crop circle on her bottom next week.”"

Tried, And Failed, To Bring The #MeToo Movement To The Red Carpet",Leigh Blickley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/e-red-carpet-golden-globes-men_us_5a5282b8e4b089e14dbbe2df,"At the Golden Globes, actresses faced a barrage of questions about sexual misconduct in Hollywood. Men, on the other hand, got off scot-free.",2018-01-08,"Rosa Clemente, Susan Sarandon, Michelle Williams and Tarana Burke. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a52c74a1d00003d005c2b5e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“Congratulations on your nomination. I loved [insert name of relevant movie/TV show/miniseries]. Oh, and you look beautiful! Tell me about your dress.”That’s pretty much the way red carpet coverage goes, year in and year out, awards show after awards show.Except this year.Indeed, E!, the network with a monopoly on red carpet coverage, attempted to acquiesce to the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements by refocusing its on-carpet interviews. Yes, the hi-res Glambot camera was still in play. But instead of the usual style-related queries, hosts Ryan Seacrest and Giuliana Rancic asked actress after actress questions about gender disparity in Hollywood and the recent sexual misconduct reckoning.The effort was undeniable, but so was the network’s failure: Seacrest and Rancic put women on the spot, and left their male colleagues unchallenged.Gone were the tiring questions and comments common to the carpet: Namely, “Who are you wearing?” Yet the obvious gender imbalance of pre-show fashion parades remained. Actress Michelle Williams spent her interview praising her guest for the evening, #MeToo movement instigator and Girls for Gender Equity senior director Tarana Burke. And Meryl Streep used her time to advocate for the work of National Domestic Workers Alliance director Ai-jen Poo.But actors like Bob Odenkirk and Justin Timberlake managed to avoid serious questions like those hurled at their female counterparts. E! didn’t ask them what they thought of the Harvey Weinstein effect.Of course, E! had the best of intentions.“We’re not asking, ‘Who are you wearing?’ We’re asking, ‘Why are you wearing black?’” longtime host Rancic announced to viewers. “There’ll still be all the fun and exciting moments that you have come to expect from the E! red carpet, but we also want to embrace this movement and allow these celebrities who are coming tonight, who have a big voice, to speak on behalf of millions who don’t.”And speak they did, in ways E! may not have predicted. Take, for example, Debra Messing, who used her few minutes on camera to slam the network’s decision to let go of host Catt Sadler last month. Sadler left her gig as an E! News personality after she found out her male co-host and friend, Jason Kennedy, was making double her paycheck.“We want diversity, we want intersectional gender parity, we want equal pay,” Messing told Rancic at the Globes. “I was so shocked to hear that E! doesn’t believe in paying their female co-hosts the same as their male co-hosts. I miss Catt Sadler and so we stand with her. We want people to start having this conversation that women are just as valuable as men.”However, notably missing from E!’s coverage were similar proclamations from men. Seacrest and Rancic repeatedly asked women about rising awareness of sexual misconduct in their industry, but failed to ask a single male actor the same types of questions. Instead, the men, #TimesUp pins on their black lapels, were issued the standard carpet queries.In one eyebrow-raising instance, Seacrest asked “This is Us” star Sterling K. Brown to recount his wife Ryan Michelle Bathe’s birthing story as she stood beside him. The conversation hung on Brown’s role in the labor and delivery process. Eventually, an unamused Bathe looked at both men and said, “Time’s up! Time’s up!” Sadly, the only man in Seacrest’s company who even briefly mentioned his #TimesUp pin ― or the initiative ― was Armie Hammer, but that was after he spoke about James Franco’s all-male nominees dinner on Saturday night. When asked via email why the hosts didn’t include men in the discussion about Time’s Up, an E! source referenced Hammer’s remarks and told HuffPost: “Conversation about the movement was woven throughout interviews with celebrities and their activist guests. It was a focus of E!’s entire red carpet today.” Perhaps E! felt it best to prioritize the voices of women who have been long silenced, who have been made to endure the bland “Who are you wearing?” inquiry for decades. For over 20 years, the question has been a staple of E!’s awards season coverage, with Joan and Melissa Rivers kicking off their own version of the trend in 1996. “We were the only ones that did [red carpet commentary] in the beginning, and we came up with the phrase, ‘Who are you wearing?,’ and all that stuff,” Joan told E! in 2010. Melissa spoke on the subject with HuffPost last year, explaining that their red carpet show led the now-canceled “Fashion Police” to cement its place in award show culture.“It’s been a part of my mom’s legacy and my mom’s life, and my legacy,” Melissa Rivers said. “And I’m so grateful that I had the opportunity.”“Fashion Police” ended in November as it lost steam after the death of Joan Rivers in 2014. By then, her signature sharp, crass humor had already come under fire, particularly when comments like, “That neckline is plunging faster than Aretha Franklin’s head into a bucket of fried chicken,” and “She’s a chubby lady who’s very, very rich, and she should just calm down ― or lose weight,” poured out of her mouth. Despite Rivers’ wide and devoted fan base, many started to ask, “How far is too far?”Alas, the #TimesUp movement sped up what was already a slow shift away from an awards show entertainment hallmark indelibly shaped by gendered objectification, and, at times, outright bullying.Michelle Williams put it best, telling NBC: “We’ve been so excited about changing the carpet and turning something from just a fashion moment in a parade of dresses to something that means so much to all of us ― as women, as mothers, as sisters, as daughters.” Actresses like Williams, Streep and Messing made the difference. There was a lot of pressure on the Globes ahead of time, as critics wondered whether the all-black carpet would be an empty gesture on its own. But what red carpet viewers ended up witnessing, at least in part, was something of a collective promise from women. They were not shy about the $16 million they’ve raised under the Time’s Up banner so far, and how it will be used to make the world a safer place for future generations.In the era of #TimesUp, did we miss the conventional questions about dresses and jewels? No. Were we more engaged with the conversations between host and talent that took the old questions places? Yes.But would we have liked to see men speak up on the issue, alongside the women committed to advocacy in a revolutionized Hollywood? Hell yes. We would have loved to have heard Tom Hanks’ response to being grilled as thoroughly as his female counterparts. Or Hugh Jackman speak about something other than his movie “The Greatest Showman.” Sadly, as the actual awards ceremony unfolded, barely any of the male winners gave speeches that addressed sexual harassment, gender parity or the uncertain future of their industry, either.There’s no telling how many men ― and women ― are complicit in the entertainment world’s gaping array of problems, and are allowed to hide behind black getups and Time’s Up pins. What we do know is that throughout the past several months, mostly women have been doing the hard work, speaking out against their abusers and supporting one another in an effort to move our culture forward. E! missed its opportunity to call on men to do the same.If just for a moment, a glitzy side of Hollywood was dimmed, and humanity, inspiration and truth shone through. But let us not forget that black is a form of camouflage. There are more evils to fight. If Hollywood is truly invested in bettering and balancing out every industry, let’s make sure this red carpet shakeup isn’t just a passing thing. #AskHerMore and #AskHimMore. "

I mean, it’s an extraordinary moment in time. And the last several days focused on my book I think are proof of this.”Wolff also addressed concerns about the accuracy of his book, with some factual errors having been found. Some Trump and White House officials have also denied having spoken with him, including Trump’s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski on Sunday.Asked by Todd if Wolff regrets any of the errors, he replied: “I think I mixed up a Mike Berman and a Mark Berman. For that, I apologize. But the book speaks for itself. Read the book. See if you don’t feel like you are with me on that couch in the White House. And see if you don’t feel alarmed, as you say.”"

There was also an air quality warning issued by the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage for higher than normal ozone levels, according to The Sydney Morning Herald.Adding to some of the misery felt, a power outage left thousands of people in Sydney without electricity on Sunday evening as temperatures stayed between 91 and 113 degrees Fahrenheit, the local news site reported.A spokeswoman for local electricity provider Ausgrid, speaking to Australia’s Special Broadcasting Service, partially blamed the outage on a surge in power use.The bizarre weather isn’t just in Australia, however.Across the Pacific, Alaska has experienced unusually warm temperatures in recent days, roughly 10 to 20 degrees above average, prompting concerns about ice levels, NPR reported.Last week, temperatures in Anchorage were warmer than in northern Florida, which saw snow.The U.S.′ northeast has also endured unseasonably cold temperatures, with the mercury dipping below zero in many places. At New York City’s John F. Kennedy International Airport, the area saw an all-time low on Saturday of 8 degrees F, meteorologist Bob Oravec of the Weather Prediction Center, told Reuters.Temperatures are expected to rise to above normal temperatures for much of the United States in the middle of January, the National Weather Service said on Sunday.Meanwhile, World Meteorological Organization spokesperson Clare Nullis pointed out on Friday that Europe is also experiencing unusual temperatures.“The French national average on Wednesday was 11.5 degrees Celsius [52.7 degrees Fahrenheit], so that’s about 6 degrees Celsius above the normal, so as I said, lots of extreme weather,” she said during a United Nations session, according to Newsweek."

But, however intriguing, his anecdotes told us nothing new – except how late we were to confront the klieg-lit symptoms of instability radiating from Donald Trump.They were always there ― Trump’s party and the media simply averted their eyes. Over 19 months ago, in these pages, I courted considerable controversy ― and journalistic opprobrium ― by warning that Donald Trump was ”too sick to lead.”Why? By then Trump’s trajectory as America’s would-be president seemed too obvious to ignore. “One can forecast,” I wrote in early June 2016, “the inevitable day-to-day damage to our country – the lashings out, the abuses of power, the mercurial and confidence-destroying lies and changes of mind, the havoc his distorted lens would wreak upon our institutions and our spirit. But most dangerous of all is the collision between a volatile world, a leader unable to perceive external reality, and the often unbearable pressures of the presidency. That Trump’s judgment would crack time and again is certain – the only question is how dangerous the moment.”This was not augury. The behaviors, and the dangers they foreordained, were there for all to see. A lifetime of public statements and actions – and a year of campaigning for president – had painted an indelible portrait of a pathological narcissist whose inner landscape would never change.In light of this history, it seemed insufficient for journalists to merely catalogue Trump’s behaviors as they occurred, isolating them from context. And it struck me as an outright disservice to normalize the abnormal by jamming him into the usual analytic boxes of strategy, political typology, tactical unorthodoxy, or even his intuitive grasp of how to transfix the media while touching the pulse of our discontents. What then? Taking the man whole, I contended, ”[t]here is only one organizing principle which makes sense of his wildly oscillating utterances and behavior – the clinical definition of narcissistic personality disorder.” Using the Mayo Clinic’s formulation, “a mental disorder in which people have an inflated sense of their own importance, a deep need for admiration and a lack of empathy for others,” the narrative began: “This is bad enough in selecting a spouse or a friend. But when applied to a prospective president, the symptoms are disqualifying.” To now reread the behavioral markers I listed is eerie, for they could serve as a précis for Trump’s first year in office:An exaggerated sense of self-importance. An unwarranted belief in your own superiority. A preoccupation with fantasies of your own success, power and brilliance. An unreasoning fury at people you perceive as thwarting your wishes or desires. A tendency to act on impulse…Particularly damning were psychological characteristics which, inevitably, would inflame already volatile situations while impairing Trump’s judgment in the crucible of crisis:A belief that you are above the rules. An array of inconsistent statements and behaviors driven by your needs in the moment. An inability to assess the consequences of your actions in new or complex situations. In sum, an incapacity to separate the world from your own psychodrama.If, as seemed apt, one ascribed these qualities to Trump, it was imperative to address the GOP’s delusional rationalization that Trump would “grow” in office or fulfill his risible promise to become more “presidential.” As I wrote then: “By the consensus of mental health experts, [his] emotional impairment has a last fatal ingredient – there is no cure. For a man like Donald Trump, life offers no lessons, no path forward save to continue as you have until, like Icarus, you fly too close to the sun.”Finally, the argument distilled the “central problem of Trump’s warped psychology – he believes that filling the presidency requires nothing but the wonder of himself.”In short, the guardrails were illusory. It required no great leap of imagination to foresee the potential tragedy a Trump presidency could visit on America: a major party, hungry for power, tethered to an unstable president it lacked the means, or the will, to control.But at the time, many objected that I was violating a cardinal rule of journalistic commentary – opining on the mental health of a presidential candidate. Frequently, they cited the “Goldwater Rule,” an ethical stricture emanating from a malign attack on Barry Goldwater, restraining psychiatrists from commenting on the apparent fitness of public figures. It was enough, they insisted, to record specific behaviors and let the voters judge. And so, as I wrote in that same article, all too many in the media “breathlessly parsed [ Trump’s] every move as if he were something grander, yet more normal, than a mentally disordered demagogue bereft of principles and starved for adulation.”Five months later, the electorate made Donald Trump the world’s most powerful man.I do not reprise my analysis of June 2016 simply to make a point, as president Trump has made it for me. Rather I am urging that we now must place our president’s psychological unfitness, squarely and unambiguously, at the heart of our political discussion ― journalistic constraints or psychiatric guidelines notwithstanding. We have learned who our president is, and the stakes transcend politesse. The presidency has not transformed him; he has transformed the office. However defined, Trump’s sickness is now ours.He erases the line between truth and lies. He rejects the existence of objective fact as a basis for political discourse. He undermines respect for democracy, civil liberties, and a free press. He treats the rule of law with contempt. He discredits any source of information which threatens his alternative reality.He makes no distinction between his office and himself. He uses the presidency to unleash his infinite anger and paranoia. He spreads misogyny and exacerbates racial, ethnic and religious divisions for political gain. He traffics in patent falsehoods and fake conspiracies. He erodes our communal understanding and demeans the very idea of democratic leadership. He governs to serve the warped psychology and infinite self-absorption which is the essence of his presidency.From this fever swamp of dysfunction emerges two existential threats.First, that Russia attacked our presidential election to benefit Trump is beyond doubt. Yet Trump denies it, unleashing a fusillade of lies and slander against our intelligence agencies and anyone else who questions him. Equally destructive, he refuses to acknowledge the certainty that Russia will continue its attack through 2018 and beyond – including, potentially, undermining the credibility of our elections by attacking voting machines.Trump’s unwillingness to defend American democracy against a hostile foreign power betrays the most basic obligation of a president. Indeed, his war against those charged with investigating the connection between his campaign and Russia – and his obsessive efforts to obstruct it – raise the inescapable question of whether America’s president is a knowing pawn of Russia. Second, Trump has unfettered authority to order a nuclear strike. Knowledgeable officials from Senator Bob Corker to James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence, question his psychological fitness to control our nuclear arsenal. We have no institutional defense against instantaneous catastrophe.This puts the question of Trump’s mental fitness in sharp relief. We have seen him as president for a year now, and the evidence is inescapable; psychologically and temperamentally, Trump is unfit to wield the awesome powers we gave him.However belatedly, more of us are prepared to confront that reality. In December, a group of lawmakers ― all but one Democrats ― received a private briefing from a prominent psychologist, Bandy X. Lee, who warned that Trump is “going to unravel, and we are seeing the signs.” As though to confirm this, Trump reacted to “Fire and Fury” by foregoing the graceful silence one would expect from a president in a spasm of bizarre tweets ― announcing that “throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart” and, indeed, that he is a “genius... and a very stable genius at that!”Increasingly, commentators are questioning Trump’s stability; a recent poll shows that 51 percent of Americans believe that Trump is mentally unbalanced. Shedding their professional strictures, numerous mental health professionals have warned against risks of maintaining him in office. The grounds range from concerns about a profound character disorder to questions about his neurological condition. Lee, the editor of a book on the subject, recently wrote the New York Times: We are currently witnessing more than his usual state of instability – in fact, a pattern of decompensation: increasing loss of touch with reality, marked signs of volatility and unpredictable behavior, and an attraction to violence as a means of coping. These characteristics place our country and the world at extreme risk of danger.What more, one must ask, do we need? Nothing. It is long past time for anyone with a public voice and a conscience ― officeholders, commentators, mental health professionals and civic leaders ― to explicitly and unequivocally embrace the need to curb an irretrievably unstable president. The obvious solution is impeachment. But Congress will block such an effort as long as Republicans control it ― which they will through 2018 and, perhaps, beyond. As in 2016, elected Republicans show little sign of having the patriotism or courage to face the dire reality of the man who leads them.In the meanwhile, there are two legislative initiatives that can help call out congressional Republicans and focus public opinion on Trump’s mental state and, thereby, on the need to circumscribe the risks posed by three more years of his presidency.One is Senate bills aimed at preventing Trump from arbitrarily firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The other is suggested legislation requiring that members of the House and Senate consent before a president can launch a unilateral nuclear strike.Neither proposal is perfect; neither, in the short term, will pass. But the case for both is compelling. And pressing them gives voice to an urgent concern ― that our political leaders and institutions must protect us from a president psychologically unable to protect us from himself.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a50d7a81c0000220068ee98.jpeg?cache=BvLMpDsQL3&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Twitter appeared to clear up any confusion over whether it might block the account of President Donald Trump, publishing a blog post on Friday that said removing content from world leaders would “hamper necessary discussion around their words and actions.”“Twitter is here to serve and help advance the global, public conversation,” the company said. “Elected world leaders play a critical role in that conversation because of their outsized impact on our society. Blocking a world leader from Twitter or removing their controversial Tweets would hide important information people should be able to see and debate.”The post did not mention Trump by name. Activists began flashing messages on the side of Twitter’s headquarters in San Francisco this week, demanding the company ban Trump’s account after he compared the size of his “Nuclear Button” to that of North Korean strongman Kim Jong Un. The messages included: “Be a hero: Ban Trump,” “Endangers the World,” and “Trump or @jack must go” — referring to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Critics have called on the company to ban Trump ― or at least to remove some of his tweets, particularly those in which he appears to threaten nuclear action. They typically cite a Twitter rule that states users “may not make specific threats of violence or wish for the serious physical harm, death, or disease of an individual or group of people.” Twitter did take action this week against loyal Trump supporter David Clarke, the bombastic former Milwaukee County sheriff. The company locked Clarke’s account after he posted a series a threatening tweets, including one in reference to the media that said: “Punch them in the nose & MAKE THEM TASTE THEIR OWN BLOOD.”Twitter reportedly ended its freeze on Clarke’s account when the offending tweets were removed."
69,POLITICS,From ‘The Great Manipulator’ To ‘Sloppy Steve’ – The Fall Of Bannon,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/steve-bannon-downfall-trump_us_5a4ff935e4b089e14dbad4bf,Trump’s campaign chief and top White House aide has been left politically homeless.,2018-01-06,"Donald Trump and Steve Bannon in the East Room of the White House on Jan. 22, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a4ffa491c00003b0068edcb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Just a few months ago, Steve Bannon was warning “establishment” Republicans that a “day of reckoning” was at hand.As it turns out, he was right.Bannon, President Donald Trump’s initial top aide and self-described architect of his improbable victory, has fallen faster than might have seemed possible – from “The Great Manipulator” on the cover of Time magazine to the owner of a new, derisive Trump nickname in less than a year.“Sloppy Steve,” Trump called him Friday ― a continuation of the criticism that began on Wednesday when the president declared in a lengthy statement that Bannon had done little for his campaign or his presidency.Bannon did not respond to a query for comment, even as his erstwhile allies abandoned him to declare their loyalty to Trump. In a new book by author Michael Wolff, Bannon is quoted as describing first son Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting with Russians as “treasonous” and calling first daughter Ivanka Trump “dumb as a brick.”The clearest beneficiary of the new schism: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), whose now 51-49 Republican majority was threatened by Bannon’s vow to defeat GOP incumbents and McConnell-backed challengers in the upcoming Senate primaries.“I’d like to associate myself with what the president had to say about Steve Bannon,” McConnell said, referring to Trump’s broadsides against his former “chief strategist.”“It kind of goes to what we’ve been saying all along. Candidates get themselves too close to Steve Bannon, they’re going to have to answer for his toxic views,” said Chris Pack, who is with the McConnell-endorsed Senate Leadership Fund super PAC. “It seems common sense at this point that you would not want to associate yourself with somebody who’s at war with the president of your own party.”Other Republicans, critics of Trump as well as Bannon, wonder whether Bannon’s exile matters at all.“At the end of the day, he is a fraud, and so is the president,” said John Weaver, who ran Ohio Gov. John Kasich’s GOP presidential campaign in 2016.Weaver added that what Bannon does next, or does not do, makes no difference. “Trump and Bannon are backing the same people. They’re backing nutjobs who would lose the general election. Trump was the original Bannon. It’s not like Bannon’s the only alt-right loon who’s talking to the president.”Bannon was the earliest right-wing media impresario to champion Trump. In the summer of 2015, he threw his Breitbart website and radio show behind the New York City reality TV host in a field of GOP senators and governors.That move, though, was more about making Bannon’s anti-immigration ideology a central issue in the Republican primary ― Bannon had previously considered backing then-Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions for the same reason ― than a belief that Trump could actually win.When Trump wound up defeating the last of his Republican rivals in the spring of 2016, Bannon was given much of the credit. He took on an unofficial advisory role in the campaign, and then was given charge of it in late summer at the urging of Robert and Rebekah Mercer. The billionaire father and daughter team had supported Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in the primaries, but came over to Trump after he locked down the nomination. They had for years funded Bannon’s ventures, including Breitbart.Trump’s unexpected victory in November catapulted a man best known for running a white-nationalist-leaning, anti-immigrant website directly into the West Wing. On paper, Bannon was a co-equal with chief of staff Reince Priebus and on a key committee on the National Security Council. But because Bannon had no official job duties, he was free to do whatever he wanted.And what Bannon wanted was to push through as many of his Breitbart-world agenda items as possible, as fast as possible, from withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement to a disastrously implemented travel ban against a handful of majority-Muslim countries.The resulting chaos of those early weeks became the leitmotif of the Trump White House ― an outfit that could not get out of its own way, despite having a largely docile Republican Congress at its beck and call. As spring became summer, Trump’s own family began advocating for a more traditional structure.In August, that structure came in the form of John Kelly, the retired Marine general running the Department of Homeland Security. He took over as chief of staff with the understanding that everyone in the West Wing would henceforth report to him ― a condition that led to Bannon’s easing out by the middle of the month.Bannon claimed he had wanted to leave and that he was actually more powerful outside the White House. Always fond of apocalyptic themes and militaristic language, Bannon told The Weekly Standard: “I’ve got my hands back on my weapons. Someone said, ‘It’s Bannon the Barbarian.’ I am definitely going to crush the opposition.”To prove it, he inserted himself into a Senate primary race in Alabama ― on the side of Roy Moore, who had been twice removed from the state Supreme Court for defying federal court orders. Trump announced his support for Luther Strange, who had been appointed to the post after Sessions became Trump’s attorney general, at the request of McConnell. McConnell and other mainstream Republicans argued that Strange would certainly win the general election, while Moore could quite possibly lose.As it happens, that split with Trump wound up foreshadowing the even deeper, seemingly unbridgeable rift created by Wolff’s book.Bannon relished the fight. “Mitch McConnell and this permanent political class is the most corrupt and incompetent group of individuals in this country,” he said shortly before the September runoff election. When Moore easily won, Bannon promised that it was merely the first in a series of victories that his stable of populist insurgents would win over McConnell’s candidates. “Your day of reckoning is coming,” he said.When a series of women came forward accusing Moore of having sought sexual relations with them when they were teens ― including one who claimed Moore had sexually assaulted her when she was 14 ― Bannon refused to back down, even sending reporters from Breitbart to Alabama to destroy the women’s credibility.Trump, apparently consulting with Bannon, declared that he believed Moore’s denials. “Get out and vote for Roy Moore,” Trump said just days before the election at a rally in Pensacola, Florida, just over the bridge from Mobile, Alabama.When Moore lost to Doug Jones ― the first Democrat to win a Senate election in Alabama since 1992 ― Trump then turned the blame on Bannon. He even cited that race in his 266-word statement on Wednesday in response to Bannon’s quotes in the book.“Steve had everything to do with the loss of a Senate seat in Alabama held for more than thirty years by Republicans,” Trump said. “Steve doesn’t represent my base ― he’s only in it for himself.” Trump’s feud with Bannon has cast his former top aide’s entire future in doubt. The Mercers have reportedly broken with Bannon, while candidates Bannon was hoping to call his own are distancing themselves from him.“Steve Bannon is only one of many high-profile endorsements Dr. Ward has received,” said the campaign of Kelli Ward, who is running for the GOP Senate nomination in Arizona. “Her focus remains on winning this race, which she is in a great position to do, and then helping President Trump advance an America First agenda.”New York Republican Michael Grimm, who left his House seat after his prison sentence for tax fraud and is now seeking to return, also disowned Bannon. “I strongly denounce the comments by Steve Bannon as quoted by Michael Wolff,” Grimm said in a statement.“When you’ve got people like Michael Grimm putting out statements, things aren’t going well,” said Rory Cooper, once an aide to former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.).Cooper and other Republicans argued that Bannon had always been overrated. “He was more of a barnacle on the side of the Trump movement than vice-versa … His political organization, whatever that was, was always an empty suit,” Cooper said. “It also goes to the question of whether you can replicate the Trump situation to lower ballot candidates, and I don’t think you can.”What influence Bannon can retain in the coming months remains an open question. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders suggested from the podium that Breitbart consider firing Bannon.Breitbart did not respond to a query on Bannon’s status, but if he winds up being forced from his role as chairman, it could leave him without a platform at all, just as primary contests begin.“If a tree falls in the woods and nobody’s around to hear it make a noise, does it make a sound?” asked Pack, of the Senate Leadership Fund.But Weaver warned that no conclusions about Bannon’s future can be drawn with Trump as president. “Who knows, he and Omarosa could wind up back at the White House in two months,” he said.Amanda Terkel contributed reporting."

Trump and congressional Republicans have alleged that the FBI’s investigation of Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state was tainted because the campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe received nearly half a million dollars from a political action committee tied to Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a close ally of the Clintons.The FBI documents made public Friday show that McCabe had no oversight of the Clinton email investigation when it began in July 2015. At that time, McCabe was in the FBI’s Washington Field Office and the Clinton inquiry was being run out of FBI headquarters. His wife lost her election in November 2015. McCabe didn’t begin overseeing the Clinton investigation until months later, when he became deputy FBI director in February 2016.The newly disclosed records indicate an effort to do things by the book. An April 2015 memo indicated that McCabe “consulted with individuals within [the Washington Field Office] and FBIHQ to identify limitations on his participation in her campaign and to identify areas where Dr. McCabe’s campaign may present potential conflicts of interest” for [McCabe] in the field office investigations or operations before his wife’s candidacy was publicly announced. Out of an “abundance of caution,” McCabe was excluded from “all public corruption investigations arising out of or otherwise connected to the Commonwealth of Virginia,” according to the documents.The documents were posted Friday on the FBI’s Vault website, which publishes high-profile records released in response to Freedom of Information Act requests. As USA Today noted, the documents support what the FBI has long publicly asserted about McCabe’s role in the Clinton investigation. McCabe served as acting FBI director after Trump fired James Comey, and he contradicted the White House claim that Comey had lost the faith of the FBI’s rank-and-file. McCabe told members of Congress in May that Comey “enjoyed broad support within the FBI, and still does to this day.”Trump interviewed McCabe for the position of FBI director after he fired Comey, but he has lashed out against the deputy director in recent months as he has pushed back on special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into the Trump campaign’s alleged collusion with the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election. Trump continued going after McCabe after reports emerged that the deputy director planned to retire in the coming months once he fully qualifies for pension benefits.

D.C. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly sided with the commissioner, Maine Secretary of State Matt Dunlap, on Dec. 22. She ordered the panel to give Dunlap documents, including a draft of the commission’s controversial request for state voter data and communication relating to the planning of the panel’s Sept. 12 meeting in New Hampshire.But President Donald Trump suddenly dissolved the commission on Wednesday, and Justice Department lawyers said Friday in a letter that they would ask Kollar-Kotelly to reconsider her order because the panel no longer exists.Because the commission is no longer considering issuing final recommendations, the lawyers wrote, Dunlap faces no harm if he is excluded from the communications. The DOJ lawyers said that Dunlap’s right to information was on the same level as that of the general public because he was no longer a commissioner. “As you know, of course, the Commission has been terminated as of January 3, 2018, and your client is, therefore, no longer a Commission member,” they wrote to Dunlap’s lawyers. “The Commission’s activities ceased without it ever issuing any report or recommendation, and therefore there is no prospect of future injury, much less future irreparable injury.”Dunlap said after the commission was disbanded that he was more determined than ever to get the information he believed he was entitled to.“Perhaps the only surprising aspect of the Department of Justice response is their rich blend of arrogance and contempt for the rule of law,” Dunlap said in a statement Saturday. “It is unthinkable, unconscionable, and un-American that the administration would engage in actions that demonstrate such a flagrant disregard for a court ruling and the rule of law.” “I think my access—and the access to the information by the rest of the now-former members of the commission—is more critical than ever,” he added. “The government cannot cloak major undertakings in changes to public policy in total secrecy without any public scrutiny or accountability.”The Justice Department attorneys also indicated in their letter that the voter data collected by the commission “is not being transferred or utilized.” That comment is at odds with the White House, which has said the Department of Homeland Security would take up the panel’s “preliminary findings.”Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), the commission’s vice chair, told Politico that Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, a part of DHS, would run state voter roll information against federal databases of noncitizens in hopes of identifying people who were on the rolls illegally. Experts say that’s not a reliable way to detect fraud.Trump cited the cost of litigation against the panel as one of his reasons for disbanding it, but the lawsuits look increasingly unlikely to end. On Friday, the ACLU of Florida filed an emergency motion in federal court to stop the panel from transferring any data to DHS. The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and the Brennan Center for Justice also have pending lawsuits seeking the records and communications of the commission."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) speaks at New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's swearing-in ceremony on Jan. 1, 2018. He was sporting a $690 coat, according to a conservative site. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a5126172100003e005f768f.jpeg?cache=jf4VT4V6Je&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s been 2018 for less than a week, but that’s apparently long enough to gin up a faux scandal about Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ allegedly lavish spending habits.This time Sanders is in trouble for sporting a winter coat at New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s swearing-in ceremony on New Year’s Day that a gumshoe reporter at the conservative Daily Wire discovered retails for $690.Mainstream news outlets were quick to jump on the item with their own well-perfected sanctimonious outrage.“Socialist Bernie Sanders wears a $700 jacket while complaining about rich people,” a Newsweek headline blared.Sanders’ supposed hypocrisy is a favorite topic of Newsweek, which used a similar formulation in June to call out Sanders for raking in more than $1 million in 2016, largely thanks to book royalties.Back in August 2016, we were meant to be absolutely furious that Sanders and his wife Jane O’Meara Sanders purchased a $600,000 summer home on Lake Champlain in Vermont.The point of all of the handwringing is to claim that a person with modest wealth effectively has no right to denounce the greedy behavior of America’s wealthiest people or indict the economic and political system that generates vast income and wealth inequality.As it turns out, Sanders received the coat as a gift from his stepson Dave, who used to work for the Vermont-based clothing company Burton, according to Sanders’ staff.But even if he hadn’t, this subgenre of journalism gets progressive politics, let alone Sanders’ brand of democratic socialism, all wrong.When Sanders asks “how many yachts do billionaires need?” he does so in the context of attacking a billionaire-funded GOP political program that would cut taxes for the wealthy even as it deprives millions of Americans of health insurance coverage.It is not so much that Sanders is attacking wealth per se, as he is attacking those who prioritize extravagant wealth above ensuring that all people have access to a decent living standard. “This is sort of in the category of the press looking obsessively at what Hillary Clinton wears and buys,” said Christine Riddiough, a member of the national political committee of the Democratic Socialists of America. “What’s important is not having a debate about that but about why so many people are not getting health care is this country.”More to the point, democratic socialism is an ideology that seeks systemic change and rejects the idea that individual consumer choices can correct a system centered on economic exploitation.In a capitalist economy, the small class of people who finance and own industries pay workers less than the value of their labor and take the “surplus value” ― the value left over ― as profit.No amount of progressive purchasing habits ― whether it’s buying a Toyota Prius or fair-trade coffee ― can change that.“There is no ethical consumption under capitalism,” said Micah Uetricht, associate editor of the socialist magazine Jacobin. “Exploitation is baked into the system.” In fact, Uetricht, a dues-paying member of the Democratic Socialists of America, argues that dwelling on individual consumption decisions could serve as a “distraction” from more meaningful forms of political struggle.Riddiough offered a largely similar assessment. She nonetheless included the caveat that if “company X is exploiting child labor, then a concerted consumer boycott might have an impact, but that’s a whole different story.”The society Riddiough, Uetricht and their fellow democratic socialists are fighting for is one in which, as Uetricht puts it, there is broad worker ownership of industries “rather than investment being determined by a small handful of people who are running it for their own enrichment.”To get there, democratic socialists often spend their time helping workers form unions and low-income tenants fight eviction, as well as electing left-wing politicians, including some Democrats, who they believe move the country closer to their vision. Uetricht and many of his colleagues at Jacobin also believe that social democracy ― a free-market capitalist system with a more robust social welfare state akin to the ones that exist in Scandinavia ― is a necessary waystation on the road to a society where worker-owned industries predominate. But democratic socialists emphasize that the ideal world they envision is not some kind of ascetic space bereft of pleasant material objects. Instead, they merely want to democratize access to those nice things.“There is this idea that some people seem to have that socialists believe we should all be walking around wearing burlap sacks,” Uetricht said. “That’s not true.”“Everyone deserves to be wearing a nice coat like Bernie Sanders,” he added with a chuckle.Although Uetricht is living on student loans as he pursues a masters degree in sociology, he revealed that he too enjoys occasional luxuries. He recently splurged on an “incredibly fresh” pair of $70 red, suede Nike sneakers, and a $180 pair of Timberland boots.In that sense, Sanders’ much-lauded $16 New Year’s eve dinner date in Manhattan is as irrelevant to the struggle against global capitalism as his $700 coat.HuffPost asked Uetricht whether there wasn’t still some level of personal extravagance that would undermine Sanders’ message as a crusader against inequality. Perhaps buying a new Lamborghini (which sells for upwards of $200,000)? “Nobody needs a Lamborghini. If Bernie bought a Lamborghini, I might have to reconsider my support for him,” he said.This article has been updated to reflect that Sanders’ staff said he received the coat as a gift. "

Wilson of St. Charles, Missouri, had previously traveled with members of a neo-Nazi group to the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and expressed an interest in “killing black people,” according to court documents unsealed Wednesday.After Wilson was arrested for triggering the train’s brakes in October, FBI agents found weapons, tactical gear and white supremacist documents at his home. Some items were in a hidden compartment behind a refrigerator, according to the court documents.FBI Special Agent Monte Czaplewski said that Wilson, who has a concealed carry permit, boarded the train intending to carry out a terrorist attack and pulled the emergency brake “with intent to harm those aboard” on Oct. 22, according to the affidavit.Czaplewski also said he believed Wilson’s firearms “have been used for or obtained in anticipation of engaging in or planning to engage in criminal offenses against the United States.”There were about 175 people aboard the train from California to Missouri when Wilson triggered the brakes, The Associated Press reported in October.In the early hours of Oct. 22, Wilson entered a restricted area of the California Zephyr train as it passed through rural Nebraska and triggered the train’s emergency brakes.After the train came to an “expedited stop,” Amtrak workers found Wilson “playing with the controls” while sitting in the engineer’s seat of an engine, according to the affidavit. A struggle broke out as train employees tried to subdue Wilson, who reached toward his waistband several times during the confrontation.Deputies later found a loaded handgun in Wilson’s waistband along with a speed loader, a device that allows rapid reloading of a weapon. Wilson also had three additional speed loaders, a box of ammunition, a hammer, a knife and a respirator-style mask in a backpack.Deputies also found that a business card for the National Socialist Movement, a neo-Nazi group, on Wilson.In an interview with the FBI, Wilson’s cousin Andrew Olney said that Wilson had joined an ”‘alt right’ neo-Nazi group” that he found while researching white supremacy forums on the internet, according to the affidavit. Olney, who lived with Wilson for at least four months, also told the FBI that Wilson attended the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville in August with friends from the neo-Nazi group.Olney said “he knew a lot of the guys took guns with them [to the Charlottesville rally], but he did not know for certain if Wilson took anything other than a shield and bulletproof vest,” the affidavit read. Wilson regularly carried a “9 millimeter handgun or a .38 caliber revolver,” according to Olney.After a search warrant was issued in December, St. Louis FBI agents discovered firearms, body armor, “records of communication of threats or detailing instructions pertaining to committing acts of violence against others” and “documents concerning white supremacy.”Items found in a compartment behind a refrigerator included 11 AR-15 rifle ammunition magazines with 190 rounds of ammunition, one drum-style ammunition magazine for a rifle, 100 rounds of 9mm ammunition, white supremacy paperwork and a handmade shield, which Czaplewski believes was taken to the Charlottesville rally.Wilson’s father later gave the FBI 15 of Wilson’s firearms. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives determined that at least one weapon was an automatic rifle and another was converted to a short rifle, “both in possible violation of federal firearm laws.” Wilson was arrested in October on suspicion of felony criminal mischief, trespassing and weapon charges. On Dec. 11, Wilson’s $100,000 bond was posted and he was released. Bobbie Garris, a passenger on the California Zephyr, told Nebraska ABC news affiliate NTV that passengers sat in the dark for over an hour after the train came to an abrupt stop.“We lunged forward in our seats and all the power went out,” Garris told NTV at the time. “We could smell something burning, and I’m going to guess that was the brakes.”Wilson was arrested again Dec. 23, one day after the complaint was filed in a federal court in Nebraska, and is under federal custody, according to the Lincoln Journal Star."

It calls for a border wall, more immigration enforcement agents, punishment for so-called “sanctuary cities,” restrictions on citizens and legal residents sponsoring family members’ visas, and policies to make it easier to detain and deport undocumented immigrants. No dollar amounts were included in the list of demands, but The Wall Street Journal reported earlier Friday that Trump is seeking nearly $18 billion to pay for a border wall. Democrats and immigrant rights activists have said they won’t accept the White House’s demands in a deal to grant legal status to Dreamers, hundreds of thousands of whom are at risk of losing deportation protections because Trump ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or DACA program. The list could be enough to trigger a Democratic revolt on a government funding bill that needs to pass later this month, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), whose office shared the White House’s list with reporters, said in a statement. “President Trump has said he may need a good government shutdown to get his wall,” Durbin said. “With this demand, he seems to be heading in that direction. ... It’s outrageous that the White House would undercut months of bipartisan efforts by again trying to put its entire wish-list of hardline anti-immigrant bills—plus an additional $18 billion in wall funding—on the backs of these young people.”Trump ended DACA in September and said Congress should act to give more permanent protections to recipients of the two-year work permits and deportation relief. DACA recipients will begin to lose permits in greater numbers in March, although activists estimate they’re already losing them at a rate of about 122 per day. In the months since Trump ended the program, the White House has put out long lists of immigration priorities, and Trump has made broad pronouncements in public comments and tweets, largely focused around building a wall, ending the diversity visa lottery and eliminating so-called “chain migration,” immigration restrictionists’ preferred term for family reunification visas.The list of demands was initially created in October, with Stephen Miller, a Trump policy adviser, listed as the author of the document, according to the properties on the PDF file. But senators didn’t get a copy until Friday.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the document.Democrats have said they are willing to give Trump some of what he wants on border security, such as more infrastructure, technology and funds, in exchange for legal status for Dreamers. But they, and Dreamers themselves, have argued any deal must be proportional — not everything Republicans want in exchange for legal status for one subset of the undocumented population. During comprehensive immigration reform efforts in 2013, for example, Democrats agreed to an overhaul of the legal immigration system, border security measures and enforcement as part of a package that would have also granted a path to legal status and eventual citizenship for much of the undocumented immigrant population. Democrats, activists and even some Republicans have warned that piling on more immigration issues has the potential to sink a deal — it happened during past reform efforts and could again now.The document the White House sent to senators on Friday could indicate the administration either thinks it can get Democrats to settle because of their desire to help Dreamers, or that it doesn’t really want a deal at all.The demands include ending the diversity visa lottery and limiting refugee intake, as well as allowing citizens and legal permanent residents to sponsor only minor children and spouses for green cards ― shutting out the ability to bring over adult children or siblings. Trump has disparaged both the diversity visa lottery and “chain migration” as dangerous by citing two terror incidents allegedly perpetrated by people who entered through those programs, although there is no evidence there is a greater risk of terror by immigrants with those visas. The White House also asked for funds to hire 10,000 additional Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and to give local police more authority to assist with deportation efforts. Another priority is to more easily penalize “sanctuary cities,” the loose term for jurisdictions that don’t fully cooperate with immigration enforcement, often because they view it as bad for community policing or because of constitutional concerns. The list also includes changing policies for people seeking asylum and for unaccompanied children apprehended at the border, restricting relief and making it easier to quickly deport them. It would also mandate E-Verify, a system that allows employers to check immigration status of would-be hires, something immigrant advocates and some business interests oppose because there currently is no pathway for many undocumented people in the U.S. to get status and some industries say they can’t find enough willing legal workers. The White House is hosting a bipartisan group for immigration discussions next week, and separate discussions between a group of Senate Republicans and Democrats continue. It’s not yet clear whether Democrats will insist that a Dreamer deal be part of a government funding package — Durbin and other members of the party voted against a short-term bill in December because of the issue and likely would again, but other Democrats might vote with Republicans for fear of being blamed for a shutdown. Immigrant rights activists said Friday that they are confident Democratic leaders are committed to getting a Dreamer bill passed ― and they wouldn’t acquiesce to a deal that grants legal status to young people while hurting the rest of the undocumented population.“I am not a bargaining chip for Stephen Miller’s vendetta against brown and black people,” Greisa Martinez Rosas, a DACA recipient and advocacy director for United We Dream, said in a statement. “Offering up my safety in exchange for the suffering of immigrant families is sick and we won’t stand for it. Trump said he wants to reach a solution but this is a tactic of people who want to blow up progress, not of people who are serious about solving problems.”"

Instead, journalist Michael Wolff insisted on Friday, he was willing to be proved wrong about Trump’s nefarious reputation ― though that didn’t happen.In an interview with NPR’s “All Things Considered,” Wolff said his intention for Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House was to report everything he saw under the Trump administration. “I’m becoming the poster boy for taking down Donald Trump. That was never my intention,” the journalist told NPR’s Kelly McEvers.“I am not a hit man,” Wolff said.“My intention was to go into the White House and report what I saw and what I heard,” he said. “I thought this was going to be an extraordinary story in whatever way it went. I had no way of knowing what way it would go.”Asked by McEvers whether he still stands by his book, despite Trump and the White House disputing it, Wolff said: “When you write a book like this, people regret what they said to me. What they say to any reporter who they relax with and they forget who they’re talking to, I have sympathy for that, and I think the natural response is to say, ‘Oh, my God, I didn’t say it.’ But I will tell you, they said it.”Wolff’s explosive book, which was released early Friday morning, provides a behind-the-scenes look into Trump’s presidential campaign and administration and his reputation within the White House.Wolff told NPR he spent at least three hours with Trump over the course of his campaign and in the White House. The book includes unsavory anecdotes about Trump, including references to the president’s aversion to reading, administration officials’ incessant leaking to the press and an episode of former chief strategist Steve Bannon calling Donald Trump Jr.’s 2016 meeting with Russian operatives “treasonous.”But the two main issues tackled in the book, Wolff said, were that Trump won’t read anything and Trump won’t listen to anyone.“The two fundamental issues [in the book] were that Donald Trump doesn’t read anything,” said Wolff. “Let me accent that ― anything, nothing.”“Not only does he not read, he doesn’t listen,” he added. “It becomes, from day one, the crisis of the presidency: You can’t tell him anything.”Trump tried to stop Fire and Fury from being released by having his attorney send a cease-and-desist letter to Wolff’s publisher on Thursday. That move spurred Wolff to publish the book four days earlier on Friday instead of its intended release date of Jan. 9.In an attempt to discredit Wolff as a journalist, Trump tweeted Friday that the book was filled with “lies, misrepresentations and sources that don’t exist.”“I authorized Zero access to the White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book,” Trump wrote. “I never spoke to him for book.”Wolff defended himself on NBC’s “Today” on Friday: “I absolutely spoke to the president. Whether he realized it was an interview or not, I don’t know, but it certainly was not off the record.”Speaking to NPR, Wolff said he approached this book with an open mind about Trump.“In many ways, from the beginning, this has felt like a train wreck, and, as it happened, the train just kept going on but the wall was still out there,” he said. “Eventually it will hit that wall.”“I was certainly willing to be convinced to think differently, willing to think that this unusual figure had a new way to approach things and, what the heck, maybe it would work,” he added.His finished project, however, proved his initial instincts right.“I feel that that is not the case now,” Wolff said. “I saw and learned that everyone around him feels that’s not the case. The train will hit the wall.”"

This time it’s after the outdoor retailer turned down an invitation to testify before the legislative body about its opposition to the Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle national monuments. On Friday, the committee — which is chaired by Rep. Rob Bishop (R-Utah) — posted an image to Twitter that reads, “Patagonia Is Lying Hiding.” The post from the official government account links to a letter Bishop sent Friday to company CEO Yvon Chouinard in which he accuses the company of “living in a bubble” and shielding itself from competing viewpoints. “In my 15 years of congressional service I have found most people jump at the opportunity to share their views before Congress — at least those who are confident in their positions,” Bishop wrote.A fierce critic of the Trump administration’s monthslong review of protected national monuments, Patagonia has joined a coalition that’s suing to block the sweeping cuts that President Donald Trump made last month to Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments. After Trump signed a pair of proclamations to dismantle the protected Utah sites, the company updated its home page with the words “The President Stole Your Land.”A week later, on Dec. 15, Bishop invited Patagonia to join the committee to discuss its views on monuments and federal land management. Chouinard declined for his company. In a Dec. 19 response he said has “little hope” that Bishop’s invitation was in good faith. “I find it disingenuous that after unethically using taxpayers’ resources to call us liars, you would ask me to testify in front of a committee for a matter already decided by the administration and applauded by the Utah delegation just a week ago,” he wrote. “A macabre celebration of the largest reduction in public lands in American history.”Chouinard accused Bishop’s committee of being “like many committees in this failed Orwellian government” and “shackled to special interests of oil, gas, and mining.” In his letter Friday, Bishop again blasted the company for its “continued effort to mislead the public” about the Utah monument rollbacks, in particular its claim that the move represents the “largest elimination of protected land in American history.”“High-profile corporate citizens who make factually inaccurate and misleading statements and then hide from further scrutiny do a disservice to their customers and the American public,” Bishop wrote. He added that “although it is your right, living in a bubble isn’t healthy, nor is it conducive to a robust discussion on important matters of public policy.”While it’s true that the collective 2 million acres that the Trump administration has stripped from the two Utah monuments remain public and under federal control, withdrawing monument status opens the door for drilling, mining and other development. Bishop hasn’t been alone in the fight against Patagonia.Following the administration’s rollbacks in Utah, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke — who led the controversial monuments review — dismissed the private company as a “special interest” that makes its products in China. He told Fox Business that it “should focus on how to bring manufacturing back into the country instead of lying to the public about losing federal land.”"

Blue areas mark varying levels of low oxygen in the open ocean.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a50074e1c0000220068ede6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The size of oxygen-starved ocean “dead zones,” where plants and animals struggle to survive, has increased fourfold around the world, according to a new scientific analysis.The growth of the zones is yet another consequence of global warming — including increasing ocean temperatures — triggered by greenhouse gases and, closer to the coasts, contamination by agricultural runoff and sewage.“Rising nutrient loads coupled with climate change — each resulting from human activities — are changing ocean biogeochemistry and increasing oxygen consumption,” says the study published in the journal Science. Ultimately, such changes are “unsustainable and may result in ecosystem collapses, which ultimately will cause societal and economic harm.”The analysis of the oxygen-starved zones was conducted by a team of scientists from the Global Oxygen Network (GONE), created in 2016 by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of the United Nations. Researchers determined that open-ocean “oxygen-minimum” zones have expanded since 1950 by an area roughy equivalent to the size of the European Union. The volume of ocean water completely devoid of oxygen has more than quadrupled in that time, the study found. The number of hypoxic, or oxygen depleted, zones along coasts has increased up to 10 times, from less than 50 to 500.Denise Breitburg, a marine ecologist at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center and lead author of the study, called the plunge in ocean oxygen “among the most serious effects of human activities on the Earth’s environment.” Oxygen is “fundamental to life in the oceans,” she said in a statement.“If you can’t breathe, nothing else matters,” Breitburg told The Associated Press. “As seas are losing oxygen, those areas are no longer habitable by many organisms.”But the threat isn’t just to life in the oceans, which account for about half of the oxygen on the planet.“Major extinction events in Earth’s history have been associated with warm climates and oxygen-deficient oceans,” the study warns.Consequences for ocean life can be significant even in areas where oxygen is merely low. Sea life may be stunted and immune responses impaired in such areas, resulting in poor survival rates and a decrease in healthy diversity, scientists warn.The scientists recommend salvaging oxygen-starved areas by tackling climate change and nutrient pollution, focusing on protecting particularly vulnerable sea life with no-catch or no-fishing zones, and increasing and improving surveillance of areas where oxygen is plummeting.Breitburg concedes that addressing global warming can seem daunting, but she says focused local efforts to protect areas can be effective. She points to changes in the Chesapeake Bay, where nitrogen pollution dropped 24 percent from its worst levels after sewage treatment and protections mandated by the Clean Air Act began. Areas of the bay with zero oxygen zones have nearly vanished, according to Breitburg.Even with “ambitious emission reductions,” however, numerical models project “further oxygen declines during the 21st century,” the study warns."

They arrived at 7:30 p.m. and found a vehicle on fire. After the fire was put out, officers found a woman unconscious and suffering from gunshot wounds in the trunk. Police said, by the time D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services arrived, they found “no signs consistent with life.”Neighbors said they heard multiple gunshots in the alley behind the 800 block of Adrian Street, SE, and moments later they saw a raging fire. Kerrice Lewis was reportedly heard screaming as she tried to escape from the trunk.Lewis was orphaned at the age of 11 and raised by her grandparents.Her grandfather, William Sharp, told Fox 5 DC he feels as though his heart has been ripped out. He said “her mother died of a brain aneurysm and her father was tragically murdered up in the D.C. area.” Lewis struggled deeply with the loss of her parents. She recently served time in jail. Her grandfather said she was striving to turn her life around — Lewis worked on construction sites and Sharp said she “was very excited because she had just finished taking some classes and was looking forward to taking some more.” He said she was a “free spirit” and “full of life” and that “she would light up a room, just talking and laughing.”Mercedes Rouhlac, the victim’s best friend and ex girlfriend, told WJLA she “talked to her everyday.” Rouhlac said she “just kept calling her” and wondering why Lewis wasn’t answering her phone.Heartbroken friends of the victim are disappointed by the lack of media coverage. When lesbians are murdered the distinct media bias keeps the general population in the dark. This bias is multiplied where “butch” lesbians are concerned, and compounded if you’re a woman of color. Lesbian relationships are typically downplayed, sexuality is often omitted, and there’s a resulting lack of focus (with both investigations and media) on potential hate crimes — even where the murder is exceptionally horrific (as in this case).Police don’t have a suspect or a motive yet.Julia Diana Robertson is an award-winning author and journalist.

Several other cast members corroborated their experiences, telling the New York Daily News that Vereen routinely made degrading comments about female cast members’ bodies during rehearsals and one time stripped naked with the cast during what he called an acting exercise. Two of the four women alleged that Vereen invited them separately over to his home in September 2015 for “private rehearsals.” During these two incidences, Vereen allegedly coerced the women into getting naked and asked them to join him in the hot tub. According to the two accounts, Vereen pressed his erect penis into the women’s legs and made unwanted sexual advances. “He was acting as my mentor, asking me about my parents, then that same night, he put me on his lap while I was crying, and I felt his erection,” Kaitlyn Terpstra, who was 22 at the time, told the New York Daily News. “He asked me, ‘Feel that?’ It was terrifying. I said, ‘Feel what?’ I wanted to act like I didn’t. I pushed myself off with a laugh,” she continued. “Then later, he asked, ‘Do you think I want to fuck you?’ I said ‘Yes,’ and he got angry. He said, ‘Well, I don’t, and that’s unfortunate.’ He made me feel like I had my mind in the gutter.”The other woman, identified only as “Kim,” told the New York Daily News Vereen asked her to perform oral sex while they were in his hot tub. Kim, who was only 23 at the time, said she acquiesced and recalled feeling “confused.”“I didn’t feel like I had a choice,” she said. Kim said she willingly entered into a relationship with Vereen after that first encounter. Now, however, she believes it was because he manipulated and took advantage of her. Vereen starred in the original Broadway production of “Hair” between 1968 and 1972, alternating between the roles of Claude and Hud. Many of the 2015 cast members (all of whom were volunteers looking to jumpstart their acting careers) said that they were in awe of Vereen’s iconic role and subsequent successful career, which made it easier for him to take advantage of them. In a statement to HuffPost, Vereen did not deny the accusations and apologized for his actions:I would like to apologize directly to the female cast members of the musical Hair for my inappropriate conduct when I directed the production in 2015. While it was my intention to create an environment that replicated the themes of that musical during the rehearsal process, I have since come to understand that it is my conduct, not my intentions, which are relevant here. So I am not going to make any excuses because the only thing that matters here is acknowledging and apologizing for the effects of my conduct on the lives of these women. Going forward, my having come to terms with my past conduct will inform all my future interactions not only with women, but with all individuals. I hope these women will find it in their hearts to accept my sincere apology and forgive me.Murray Chase, executive director of the Venice Theatre, told New York Daily News that the theater is “working to strengthen our sexual harassment policies and procedures, including the reporting of them, to prevent any future occurrences.” "
85,POLITICS,"Trump, GOP Congratulate Selves For Immigration Meeting 4 Months Into DACA Crisis",Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-daca-republicans-meeting_us_5a4ea6a8e4b01e1a4b13e0ce,"A deal needs to be bipartisan, but the meeting wasn't.",2018-01-05,Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen sit next to President Donald Trump at a meeting to discuss immigration.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a4eb3d32100003e005f7265.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a group of Senate Republicans congratulated themselves Thursday for meeting to discuss a problem Trump created four months ago when he put hundreds of thousands of undocumented young people at risk of deportation.“What we did today, which I think was truly a breakthrough, is we saw the president assume leadership on this issue,” Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) told reporters after the meeting, adding that Trump “already has” shown leadership on delivering a message on immigration to the public.Tillis and other attendees insisted the White House gathering signaled progress toward a compromise on young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children and now fear removal because Trump ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. But they came out of the meeting with few details about what Trump wants, beyond what he’s already tweeted. And the meeting came two months after bipartisan negotiations began in the Senate — negotiations Trump has mostly stayed out of.Any deal on DACA will require Democratic support, in part because some of the Republicans involved in Thursday’s meeting have opposed proposals that give legal status to undocumented immigrants. The Republican senators who attended the meeting were John Cornyn (R-Texas), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), James Lankford (R-Okla.) and Tillis — of them, only Graham is still heavily involved in talks with Democrats on Dreamers. No Democrats were invited to Thursday’s meeting.Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who is involved in bipartisan negotiations, didn’t attend Thursday’s meeting at the White House for that very reason. “I have no interest in attending any more Republican-only meetings on DACA,” Flake told reporters. “It’s counterproductive. This has to be a bipartisan bill.”Trump will hold a bipartisan meeting on immigration next week, the White House announced on Thursday. But so far, the administration hasn’t been involved much in bipartisan talks on a DACA deal. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly met with a bipartisan group of senators to discuss the issue before Christmas, promising a “punch list” of specific demands that still hasn’t come.The clock is ticking. When Trump ended DACA, he allowed some recipients to renew their two-year work permits and deportation protections, but not those who were set to lose them after March 5. That means that DACA recipients will begin to lose protections by the hundreds each day in March unless Congress acts.But the March “deadline” often cited by Republicans is a false one ― DACA has already been rescinded, meaning no new applicants can apply, and people who did not renew their permits within a set period are already losing protections. Advocacy groups estimate an average of 122 people have lost DACA protections each day since Trump ended the program.Flake has rejected the notion that Congress has until March to do something. He co-sponsored the Dream Act, a bill that would give young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children the ability to gain legal status. Graham, who attended the meeting on Thursday, is also a sponsor of the Dream Act.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told Flake last month that he would hold a vote on an immigration bill if a deal was reached by the end of January. Not much has changed in the interim. The key requirements for a deal Trump laid out at Thursday’s meeting were all ones he’s mentioned before: a border wall, ending the family reunification visas he calls “chain migration,” eliminating the diversity visa lottery and more enforcement of immigration laws. Republicans still haven’t reached a consensus on what to do about most of Trump’s demands. Some have adopted Trump’s calls for a wall, others say border security should involve other measures, some agree with limiting legal immigration, others do not. But the more immigration measures the GOP tries to pile into a deal — particularly polarizing ones like cutting legal immigration or dramatic increases in enforcement — the harder it will be to get a bipartisan bill passed.Democrats have repeatedly said what they want from the bill: protections for Dreamers — ideally, the Dream Act — in exchange for increased border security measures. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) reiterated to reporters on Thursday that those are their goals, but didn’t explicitly rule out measures the president wants, such as limiting family reunification. Democrats have called for DACA protections to be part of must-pass spending bills, but ultimately, many still voted for a short-term government funding bill in December that left Dreamers out. They could do the same thing when funding comes up again this month. Both Trump and Republican leaders in Congress have said they want immigration dealt with separately. Pence and Republican senators praised Trump in front of journalists for his role in the negotiating process. When reporters were brought into the room, Lankford told Trump, “You gave us a deadline and setting that for March the 1st, and that’s a tremendous gift to be able to get that done.” Lankford has also thanked Trump for the “gift” of ending DACA and urging Congress to pass a bill. Pence said Trump had “opened the door to an agreement on DACA, and today, as part of an ongoing discussion with these Republican leaders but also with Democrats on Capitol Hill, to accomplish that, and I look forward to being a part of it.”Trump said that he believes a bipartisan approach is possible. “I can tell you the Republicans want to see it work out very well,” he said. “If we have support from the Democrats, I think DACA is going to be terrific.”"
86,SPORTS,ESPN Thinks This Could Be The End For Bill Belichick And The Patriots,Ryan Grenoble,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tom-brady-patriots-belichick-on-the-outs_us_5a4f98c7e4b01e1a4b14b22d,A bizarre tale of power struggles and alternative medicine.,2018-01-05,"Bill Belichick talks with Tom Brady at the tail end of a game in Foxborough, Massachusetts, in 2010.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a4fc1072100002c005f74b4.jpeg?cache=dAOPWwORKo&ops=crop_0_124_3500_1998%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"In an ironic twist, Tom Brady’s zealous longevity regimen ― and the acolyte who sells it ― could be what ultimately does him in.That’s if you believe a riveting new account from ESPN, which pulls the curtain back on a New England Patriots organization said to be quietly grappling with infighting and power struggles between its most visible, and most valuable, members.Here’s the short version: Tom Brady is deeply involved with Alex Guerrero, a personal health trainer known for his unconventional (and outright questionable) advice.A New York Times profile in 2015 referred to Guerrero as Brady’s “spiritual guide, counselor, pal, nutrition adviser, trainer, massage therapist and family member.” Boston Magazine has a slightly different take, portraying him as a modern-day snake oil salesman who’d had repeated troubles with regulators until he found the ultimate sucker in Tom Brady, who’s now his business partner.That relationship has eroded the power of head coach Bill Belichick, so much so that earlier this year Patriots owner Robert Kraft ordered Belichick to trade away Jimmy Garapollo, the franchise’s quarterback of the future, in a bid to pacify Brady.It’s also caused a schism in the locker room, with players forced to choose between appeasing Brady by seeking treatment at Guerrero’s “TB12 Sports Therapy Center,” or sticking with team doctors ― a de facto endorsement of Belichick.Now the Patriots are left with a 40-year-old, increasingly temperamental quarterback and no clear plan for succession at the position. Meanwhile, Belichick, who’d groomed Garapollo and thought highly enough of him to have (potentially) soon installed him as the team starter, is more isolated and frustrated than ever.ESPN speculates that could be enough to convince Belichick to seek greener pastures elsewhere, especially as the Patriots’ offensive coordinator and defensive coordinator will likely leave the team during the offseason this year and become head coaches for other teams.The Patriots denied the reports in a statement Friday, dismissing them as “theories that are unsubstantiated, highly exaggerated or flat out inaccurate.”But let’s get back to Guerrero for a minute, the man whose clinic one Patriots staffer told ESPN felt “like a cult.”The trainer and close associate of Brady’s used to refer to himself as “Dr. Guerrero” ― until the Federal Trade Commission came after him in 2004 for a supplement he peddled on a late-night infomercial, claiming it cured 96 percent of a group of 200 terminally ill cancer patients. And could do the same for AIDS, Parkinson’s, Multiple Sclerosis, arthritis and more!The feds shut down his supplement operation, noting there was no evidence they worked, and that his degree ― a masters from a school for traditional Chinese medicine that’s since shuttered ― doesn’t grant him the title of “doctor.”By 2011, Guerrero had nevertheless become a key player behind the scenes at the Patriots, where he came up with numerous other supplements of dubious merit. One, called NeuroSafe, was marketed to football players as a “seatbelt for your brain” that would help protect from “sports-related brain injury.” (The FTC investigated NeuroSafe but decided not to penalize Guerrero so long as he refunded everyone who’d bought the supplement.)Backed up by Brady, Guerrero apparently gained more and more access inside the organization until Belichick cut him out of meetings in 2014, ESPN reports, ultimately banning him from the building entirely by 2016."
87,POLITICS,Democrats Aren't Sure Whether To Make Jeff Sessions' Pot Crackdown An Election Issue,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeff-sessions-marijuana-crackdown-democratic-party-election-politics_us_5a4ecee7e4b089e14db9ae04,Some are more eager to run on marijuana than others.,2018-01-05,"Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said Democrats' election-year message on marijuana would vary by state.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a4ed1522100003e005f7294.jpeg?cache=AfyIbJbdN5&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Leading Democrats blasted Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ Thursday announcement that he would open the door to a federal crackdown on states that have decriminalized forms of marijuana use.Sessions’ action reverses a Department of Justice policy from the Barack Obama administration that effectively shielded those states from federal prosecution.Sessions “needs to focus on issues like transnational criminal organizations” and what the nation needs to do on “investigating and prosecuting human trafficking,” Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), a rumored 2020 presidential candidate, told HuffPost on Thursday.Sessions “needs to leave grandma’s medicinal marijuana alone!” she continued with a chuckle.Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), a centrist, declared that the move “would seem to be the absolute opposite direction of where the country’s headed and one more example of this administration being completely out of step with where both Americans are headed and, for that matter, Democratic and Republican state legislatures.”“This is a big mistake,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) told HuffPost. “In those states where the people in the states have made a determination to decriminalize or legalize marijuana ... the federal government would better spend its resources going after real problems we’ve got.”But criticizing Sessions’ move is one thing. Turning his marijuana crackdown into an election-year political cudgel ― in stump speeches, campaign literature and ads ― is something else entirely. And when asked whether Democrats planned to use the marijuana crackdown against Republicans in the November elections, some of the same Democrats keen to clobber Sessions were noncommittal.“It’s way too early to predict that,” Warner said.Van Hollen, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the Democratic Senate campaign arm, said, “Every Democratic member of the Senate will have to decide what’s best in their states.” Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), who also expressed her displeasure with Sessions’ decision, argued that Democrats ought to run on kitchen-table economic issues rather than marijuana.“There are so many other things to run on, like the tax bill that just passed that does not help working families at all,” she said in an interview.The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee did not respond to multiple email requests for comment on the political salience of Sessions’ move. The DSCC referred HuffPost back to Van Hollen’s remarks.When asked about making marijuana an election issue, Democratic National Committee spokesman Michael Tyler provided a statement indicting Sessions’ “morally bankrupt and economically stupid” decision without commenting on the potential political effect. Part of the challenge for Democrats who might want to turn Sessions’ move into a partisan issue is that so many of their Republican colleagues responded with similar outrage. Lawmakers from states that have legalized the drug, including Sens. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), were especially firm in their criticism. In a scathing floor speech, Gardner, who chairs the National Republican Senate Committee, the GOP Senate’s campaign arm, said he was “prepared to take all steps necessary” to get Sessions to reverse the decision, including holding up Department of Justice nominees.Warner and Hirono both cited Republican condemnations in explaining the difficulty of making marijuana an election-year issue.Still other Democrats were reluctant to even condemn Sessions’ order. Sens. Bob Casey (Pa.), Jack Reed (R.I.) and Tammy Baldwin (Wis.), who faces a tough reelection battle, all said they were still too unfamiliar with Sessions’ action to comment. (Casey later issued a statement expressing “serious concerns about how this action by Attorney General Sessions could impact Pennsylvania’s medical marijuana law.”)Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) also pleaded ignorance when asked about the matter at a Thursday news conference.“I haven’t seen” Sessions’ comments on marijuana, Schumer said.Jeff Hauser, a former political communications chief at the AFL-CIO who runs the progressive Center for Economic and Policy Research’s executive branch accountability project, observed that congressional Republicans, partly at the prodding of the libertarian-leaning Koch brothers, have warmed to criminal justice reform in recent years.But Democrats would be mistaken to think that they are forfeiting opportunities for bipartisan progress by making an unrepentant drug warrior like Sessions a political liability for Republicans, according to Hauser.“If Democrats get elected in part on this platform, that will ultimately make passing a [bipartisan reform] bill more likely because Republicans will want to put the issue in the past,” Hauser said. “The way you get Republicans to repudiate hacks like Jeff Sessions is by causing them to pay a political price.”At the state level, Democrats appear less hesitant to make marijuana a significant part of their electoral strategy.Sessions’ action “will be a net positive for Democrats pretty much everywhere,” said Jared Leopold, communications director of the Democratic Governors Association.“I don’t see this as a winner for Republicans anywhere,” Leopold added. “But it’s especially a problem in a state like Colorado, where marijuana is a major source of revenue for the state government.” At least 15 Democratic gubernatorial candidates and current governors blasted Sessions’ decision, including Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, chairman of the Democratic Governors Association. Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, a former Detroit health director running for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in Michigan, where legalization is likely to be on the ballot in November, vowed in a statement that, if elected, he’d “fight [the crackdown] tooth and nail.” Later in the day, former Michigan Senate Democratic Leader Gretchen Whitmer, the frontrunner in the race for the state’s Democratic gubernatorial nomination, tweeted that Sessions’ “move takes us backward in our fight to level the playing field.”In Nevada and Colorado, two states with legal recreational pot where Republican attorneys general are seeking the GOP gubernatorial nomination, the Democratic Party was eager to jump on Sessions’ announcement.Two Colorado Democrats vying to succeed Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper ― Rep. Jared Polis and former Colorado Treasurer Cary Kennedy ― delivered stinging rebukes of Sessions’ decision. Polis slammed Sessions for “waging war on local marijuana;” Kennedy called it an “attack” on Colorado voters.By contrast, Colorado Attorney General Cynthia Coffman, a Republican who is running against Polis and Kennedy, reaffirmed her commitment to defending the Colorado law but declined to criticize Sessions’ decision. Coffman noted that it would still be up to federal prosecutors’ discretion and consequently admonished residents to “not freak out.”Nevada Democratic Party spokeswoman Hellen Kalla called on state Republicans, including Attorney General Adam Laxalt, to “clearly and firmly commit to standing up against any meddlesome attempt by the Trump administration to infringe upon our state’s right to grow our economy as our voters see fit.”Nevada Democratic gubernatorial candidate Steve Sisolak denounced the move as well, declaring, “We cannot and will not stand for this or any threat by the Trump administration to undo progress in Nevada.”But Laxalt, one of Sisolak’s opponents, merely offered a statement highlighting his past willingness to defend the state’s marijuana law against legal challenges despite his opposition to the ballot measure that legalize it.Rep. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), who is launching a competitive bid to unseat Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), noted on Twitter that Heller voted to confirm Sessions despite knowing about Sessions’ “stance against marijuana legalization.”The polling on marijuana legalization suggests that it could be a potent issue at the ballot box. Nationwide, 64 percent of Americans support legalizing marijuana, an increase from 12 percent in 1969, according to Gallup. Broken down by party affiliation,Gallup found that legalization has the support of 72 percent of Democrats, 67 percent of independents and 51 percent of Republicans. As the data journalism site FiveThirtyEight observed, that makes marijuana legalization one of the least polarizing public policy issues in the country today.Since Democrats struggle to turn out infrequent voters during the midterms, the galvanizing power of protecting state-level marijuana laws could work in their favor. In 2014, the last nationwide midterm election cycle, 69 percent of voters in a pre-election poll said they were more likely to turn out if a marijuana legalization proposal were on the ballot. It is far from clear, however, that marijuana initiatives ultimately provided Democrats a meaningful boost in 2014. The party continued its midterm losing streak that year, prompting the Democratic National Committee to release an autopsy with recommended improvements a few months later.“I don’t see this as a partisan issue,” said Tom Angell, founder of the nonprofit Marijuana Majority. “Either party that wants to latch on to this will find that it will benefit them. The opportunity is there.”But the circumstances this fall are different from 2014 and more likely to benefit Democrats, according to several political strategists from both parties. There are now 29 states that have legalized some form of recreational or medical marijuana, including several, like Colorado, Washington and California, where it is already ingrained in the economy and culture. And with Democrats poised to ride a midterm election wave, Sessions’ marijuana offensive could further tip the scales against the GOP, these strategists say.Assuming federal prosecutors take advantage of the new powers Sessions has granted them, it is likely to be the most politically damaging in GOP-held swing districts with a higher proportion of libertarian or socially liberal voters, such as Washington’s 8th and California’s 45th, according to GOP strategist Liz Mair.“When you are looking at races that are potentially going to come down to a few hundred votes or a thousand votes, shit like that matters,” said Mair, who has advised leading conservatives, including Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R).Sunjeev Bery, a progressive strategist who has worked for MoveOn.org and the ACLU, predicted that “campaigning on that heavy-handed response is going to peel off independent voters, especially in places like Colorado.” What’s more, Bery said, “if the Trump administration goes after marijuana users in a state like California, that will significantly hurt their fundraising in high-net-worth libertarian communities like Silicon Valley.” Hauser of the Center for Economic and Policy Research argued that the marijuana crackdown buttresses an existing Democratic narrative about the Trump administration’s misplaced law enforcement priorities ― whether it involves police brutality or white-collar crime.“It can bring home to people who may or may not have been following other issues closely that Trump is a destabilizing force, and things that people have grown to rely on, including access to marijuana, can be taken away from them,” Hauser said. That message would likewise appeal to conservative-leaning libertarian voters fed up with federally driven encroachments on civil liberties, states’ rights or “free trade, free movement of people-type stuff,” according to Mair.“That just doesn’t play out West. And this fits into that narrative and that problem,” she said.Some progressives are already concerned, though, that Democrats are too timid to capitalize on Sessions’ action.In an NBC News column Thursday, New York City-based activist Sean McElwee appealed to Democrats to, among other things, abandon their historic reluctance to make marijuana reform a theme in campaign advertisements. “To really set their sights on large-scale change, top Democrats need to stop being so squeamish and lead with weed,” McElwee wrote.Castigating Democrats for their lack of backbone is a familiar refrain from the the party’s progressive base.And there is evidence to support their arguments. A widely cited 2013 study co-authored by two researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Michigan found that politicians in both parties assume that their voters are more conservative than they actually are.But Mair said that Sessions’ action would hurt Republicans at the ballot box regardless of how well Democrats campaign on marijuana policy.“Individual candidates are capable of overcoming” damaging national narratives, Mair said. “But your average congressional candidate from either party is not going to be a rockstar.”“Democrats don’t need to message on it,” she added. “The point will be made.”"
