Before being downgraded to a post-tropical cyclone, Ophelia was a Category 3 hurricane on Saturday and Sunday. It went farther east than any other previously recorded Category 3 hurricane in the Atlantic Basin and broke a record set in 1980. “As sea surface temperatures continue to warm, the region of the Atlantic Ocean that can support the genesis and strengthening of tropical storms and hurricanes is expanding eastward,” said Michael Mann, a distinguished professor of atmospheric science and the director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State University.Hurricanes are not only reaching much farther to the east, but they’re forming farther east as well, Mann noted. Hurricane Irma, which devastated parts of the Caribbean and the southeastern United States last month, was the strongest hurricane to ever form as far east in the Atlantic as it did, he said.“In my view, these are not coincidences,” Mann said. “These are precisely the sort of things we expect to happen as we continue to warm the planet. We should not be surprised that they are happening.”Kevin Trenberth, a distinguished senior scientist in the Climate Analysis Section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said it’s not unprecedented for an Atlantic storm to affect Europe ― it happens “every 3 or 4 years or so,” he said ― but added that there is “an unusual aspect to this.”The storm’s eastward reach also coincides with another record, Trenberth said. “[S]torms forming farther to the east and becoming strong is a sign of warmer oceans, and this year has seen the highest upper ocean heat content on record in the tropical Atlantic.”The rainy, windy conditions caused by Ophelia closed all schools in the Republic of Ireland and in Northern Ireland on Monday, as well as some schools in Wales.

Susana Butterworth was pregnant with her first child ― a son she planned to name Walter ― when she learned he had trisomy 18, a genetic disorder that can cause serious medical issues. On March 8 at 36 weeks, she delivered her stillborn baby boy. “It was so devastating to say the least,” Butterworth told HuffPost. “I felt so lonely and isolated. People around me didn’t want to talk about my loss because they didn’t want to see me cry. In reality, that probably would have been the most healing thing for me at that time.”The experience of losing Walter and the isolation she felt in the aftermath inspired Butterworth to break the silence around child loss ― whether it be in the form of stillbirth, miscarriage, infertility, infant death, family separation, loss of an adult child or other experiences. She created the Empty Photo Project, a series in which she photographs parents who’ve faced child loss holding mirrors in front of their bodies. She posts the photos, along with the subject’s personal story, on her website, Instagram and Facebook. “All images are taken at the location that is significant to their story and processed and edited in Photoshop to create the illusion of empty,” Butterworth told HuffPost, adding that she finds people to photograph mostly through social media. The Empty Photo Project has reached a wide audience through social media and features on international news outlets. Butterworth said she’s happy her work can touch so many others. “People have been grateful for this project. It has created a healing outlet of unity in being empty,” she said. “I’ve heard some participants say that it helped them open up about a loss they never had a chance to talk about before.”Butterworth hopes her project helps break down the stigma surrounding child loss. Said the photographer, “I want people to realize that child loss happened to everyone and that is should be a conversation that we are having. Those who have lost children (father and mother) shouldn’t have to feel like a burden or alone at such a fragile time.”"

As a gay man with opinions that are not in line with those of the current government, it was starting to feel like I was allowed less space to be myself with each day, and the recent difficulties only justified my decision to immigrate. During this period, the LGBTQ Pride Week was canceled for two consecutive years, several terrorist attacks took place around the country, and a failed military coup was followed by a purge of about 160,000 people under the state of emergency.When I decided to move to the Netherlands, I believed my identity and opinions would make this country a place where I could be myself. As the world’s first country to legalize same-sex marriage, I had known the Netherlands as a country widely subscribing to liberal values. But my immigration also coincided with a global rise in racism and xenophobia, and as a result, the country has seen an increase in hostility towards large Muslim communities such as Moroccan and Turkish people. Having been an immigrant in this new socio-political landscape, I started experiencing racism for the first time at age 24.Although I am gay, I was part of the privileged in Turkey as a cis Turkish man with higher education from a respectable university. Over the years I have been living in the Netherlands, I have seen these privileges mean nothing as they were stripped off one by one. I saw that sometimes it did not matter if the lifestyle in the Netherlands was more suitable for me. I was made to put on different labels, most of which can be summed up as “another immigrant taking up space/jobs/opportunities that were not meant for him.” In moments like these, when strangers pass judgment, I realize it after the fact, since being on the receiving end of racist remarks is not something I have experienced before. Most of the time, I focus on how much I contribute to the Dutch society, and how that makes the whole encounter even more unfair.This is what I had been thinking for a couple of weeks after the last encounter I had with a customs officer in Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport. Exhausted from flying for almost four hours, I felt relieved to see the passport line moving quickly, which meant I would be home earlier. When I handed my passport and residence permit to the customs officer, I smiled at him with this comforting thought in mind. He took my passport and after noticing my nationality, he asked me if I spoke any Dutch. Considering that one of the largest minorities in the Netherlands is Turkish, I did not think much of the question and told him that taking a Dutch language course was in the works. When he asked how long I had been living in the Netherlands, I realized there was something wrong as these questions are not normally asked in a simple passport check. After handing over my passport, the customs officer put the residence permit on his side of the counter and told me that he was going to keep it, since I did not deserve it. For that small second, I just stared at his deadpan face, completely dumbfounded and at a loss for words. When he gave my residence permit back saying that he was joking, all I could do was walk off while still trying to process what just had happened.The moment after and in the weeks that followed, I kept repeating the same sentence in my mind: “I do not deserve this.” But only later I realized, my reasons for how unfairly I was treated were convoluted in themselves. I told myself that I had a master’s degree from a Dutch university, a well-paying job, and I was paying my taxes. I meet the requirements for a Dutch residence permit and for this reason, being treated that way was incomprehensible. Somehow, living by my perceived ideals of the West made the whole experience more arbitrary as opposed to other immigrants or refugees who do not have (respectable) jobs, or who live by their own traditional values.In the past couple of weeks, following the tragedy the Dreamers are going through made me rethink my experience of racism in the Netherlands. Although the political climate of the USA might seem different on the surface, it is not the only country where nativist and conservative ideas are gaining momentum. Geert Wilders, often dubbed “the Dutch Donald Trump,” and his political party, the Party for Freedom, subscribe to similar anti-immigration politics and have an election manifesto that vows to “De-Islamize the Netherlands.” His party came in second in the 2017 general elections but luckily, several parties elected to the parliament refused to form a coalition with him. In this way, Trump’s administration is a horrifying demonstration of how vulnerable refugees and immigrants might become if Geert Wilders’ of the world are enabled.I was not surprised by the decision of the Trump administration to rescind the DACA program, nor by the recently announced plans to replace it with a program that will require applicants to have continuous employment, a college education, or join the army in order to have residency. What surprised me was how much I related to the Dreamers protesting the decision, saying that they are successful students and business owners and how they identify as Americans. This crystallized the hidden meaning behind my own explanation for the unfair treatment I receive in the Netherlands. I believe that one’s place of birth should not entitle someone to a certain set of privileges and make them more worthy of access to basic human rights. However, I am also starting to realize that my contribution to the society should not be a counter-argument to any form of hatred.In trying to oppose racism and xenophobia, both of which are based on assumptions, one’s resume is not relevant. The everyday version of racism does not allow space for one’s story. It is quick and aggressive. The political side of it, on the other hand, clusters groups of people together, who otherwise would probably have no relation to each other except for a fraction of their identities. This is why my whole story did not matter to the customs officer, he was not interested in hearing why I set foot on this land with the hopes of a better life that was safer for me as a gay man. He only wanted to make his unwelcome expectations known and imply that whatever I did, I would always fall short. This expectation from me, to make something more of my life as opposed to a native Dutch citizen, injects a different meaning to my successes. They stop belonging to me, when every step I take forward in my life becomes a token that is held against harsh standards to measure my worth.My failures are also no longer merely missteps that are part of life, they are now triggers for anxiety. I remember it vividly when even a simple fine for biking through a red light made me search on the immigration office’s website to see if it was cause for deportation. I feel lucky to have a job that allows me to stay here, but I also remember fearing how my life in Amsterdam would have fallen apart if my contract had not been renewed. I struggle with the emotional burden of wanting to feel at home in a new country and being aware that a single mistake could be an end to all that I have built here so far.Soon, I hope to be eligible for a long-term residence permit, and maybe I will even apply for Dutch citizenship in the future. Like many other refugees and immigrants, I will do these things only to prevent the anxiety attacks from happening, to be able to take risks, and to feel like my successes belong only to me. However, I have the suspicion that even being a Dutch citizen or speaking fluent Dutch will not be enough – I will always be the other who needs to try harder."

All of the Redskins players stood during the anthem.The gesture originated with the 49ers in August 2016 when then-backup quarterback Colin Kaepernick sat during the anthem and subsequently switched to kneeling in order to avoid feeding the perception that he was disrespecting military veterans. The protests then spread when players on other teams began to kneel.The 49ers have consistently had one of the largest contingents of players who kneel during the anthem. Last Sunday, Vice President Mike Pence attended a game in Indianapolis between the team and his home-state Indianapolis Colts but then left the game wit his wife after several San Francisco players knelt during anthem. President Donald Trump tweeted that he had told Pence to exit if a protest occurred, costing the public some $90,000 to prove a political point.The Green Bay Packers decided to stand with locked arms during the anthem ahead of their game with the Minnesota Vikings in Minneapolis. A small number of individual players in other games across the league also knelt, according to the Washington Post.NFL owners, who just a few weeks ago seemingly expressed their support for players’ right to protest, have begun to turn on the practice of kneeling during the anthem.Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones vowed to bench players who kneeled. Jones’ edict wasn’t put to a test on Sunday, however, since the Cowboys have a bye week.Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross also said earlier this month that “it’s incumbent on the players” to stand during the anthem.NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell sent a letter to NFL teams last Tuesday in which he said, “Like many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the National Anthem.”Goodell did not threaten players with punishment if they chose not to do so, however.“We need to move past this controversy, and we want to do that together with our players,” he wrote. Team owners are meeting with Goodell later this week in New York to discuss how to accomplish that.The owners are under growing pressure from Trump to quash the protests. Starting in late September, Trump escalated controversy over the demonstrations by repeatedly calling for fans to boycott the NFL until team owners fire players who participate in the protest, which he characterized as disrespectful to the flag and the patriotism it represents. He drew criticism for referring to a hypothetical player who kneels as a “son of a bitch.”The Sunday after Trump’s harshest remarks, many NFL owners vocally condemned him and in some cases stood with their players during the largest-ever series of protests. Players’ decision to kneel or lock arms on fields across the country on Sunday, Sep. 24, and at games later in the week, were as much about defying Trump as protesting racism.The NFL’s brand has taken a major hit among Trump voters in recent weeks. In a dramatic shift from just a month ago, a majority of Trump voters now view the league “somewhat or very unfavorably,” according to a Morning Consult poll released last week.At the same time, the higher profile of the recent wave of protests has raised public awareness that players are demonstrating against police violence. As of earlier this month, 57 percent of Americans believed that was what motivated the players, compared with 47 percent on Sept. 17, according to a HuffPost/YouGov poll."

But he said such an action targeting the rogue nation, while on the table, would constitute a last resort. President Donald Trump “has also made clear to me that he wants this solved diplomatically. He’s not seeking to go to war,” Tillerson said.He dismissed Trump’s recent tweet that his top diplomat was “wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man” (North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un). Trump also tweeted: “Save your energy Rex, we’ll do what has to be done!”Those tweets were widely seen as undercutting Tillerson, who had said the U.S. was seeking a dialogue with North Korea about its missile and nuclear tests.Trump “has made it clear to me to continue my diplomatic efforts,” Tillerson said. “As I have told others, those diplomatic efforts will continue until the first bomb drops.”In an interview with “Fox News Sunday,” White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster argued that Trump’s tweets denigrating Kim are helping to convey his seriousness, rather than undermining attempts at diplomacy. “I think what the real danger is in terms of communicating with Kim Jong Un is that if he doesn’t understand how serious we are about his behavior and the behavior of the regime,” McMaster said. “The president has been very clear on that, and I think that is beneficial to the safety and security of not only the United States but our great allies in South Korea and Japan and the world.” "
9,ENTERTAINMENT,'SNL' Finally Took On Harvey Weinstein -- But Is It Too Late?,Carla Herreria,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/snl-harvey-weinstein_us_59dea4b1e4b0fdad73b1e739,The show burned him and addressed sexual abuse in Hollywood after failing to do so last week.,2017-10-15,"“You assaulted dozens of women -- that’s not a mistake, that’s a full season of ‘Law and Order,’” Michael Che said of Weinstein on Weekend Update.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59e2f27e2d0000265e30a543.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“Saturday Night Live” finally dealt with the one subject everyone else in the entertainment industry is talking about: Harvey Weinstein.The show attacked the disgraced film producer twice, in a sketch and during Weekend Update, tackling both the searing accusations against the Hollywood mogul and the larger problem of women and sexual harassment in the business.In the sketch, the women of “SNL” discussed harassment in Hollywood in the style of an industry roundtable, with Kate McKinnon playing Debette Goldry, an old-school actress who lived through a darker time in movie making. The panel, including Leslie Jones and Cecily Strong, described the industry as it is in the real world: A place where sex abuse is rampant and typically swept under the rug.“Have I ever been sexually harassed? Good Friday, where do you want me to start,” McKinnon said. “Women being harassed is Hollywood, alright?”Later, McKinnon’s character described her own meeting at Weinstein’s hotel room: He was “naked, hanging upside down from a monkey bar, trying to trick me into thinking his genitals were his face. The resemblance was uncanny.”The real burn came from Colin Jost and Michael Che at the Weekend Update desk.After reporting that Weinstein was headed to a rehab center, Jost fired back: “He doesn’t need sex rehab. He needs a specialized facility where there are no women, no contact with the outside world, metal bars and it’s a prison.”Che followed up with a few colorful insults, calling Weinstein “chewed bubble gum rolled in cat hair” and a “well-dressed skin tag.”Che also clarified what “mistake” means, responding to Weinstein saying to reporters, “We all make mistakes.”“You assaulted dozens of women ― that’s not a mistake, that’s a full season of ‘Law and Order,’” Che said. “Your name’s a verb now dude, as in, ‘If this guy tries to Weinstein me, I’m going to cut off his little Harvey.’”This is the first time “SNL” addressed the Weinstein scandal since news of the allegations broke on Oct. 5The show didn’t touch on Weinstein during last week’s episode, even though the bombshell reports were released two days ahead of the show’s airing. Instead, the show opened with Jason Aldean’s surprise performance honoring the Las Vegas shooting victims and focused on host Gal Gadot.Many people criticized the omission, including MSNBC host Joe Scarborough who suggested that they ditched Weinstein jokes in order to protect the disgraced producer.Variety later reported that “SNL” staff had written two Weinstein sketches for that episode, but producers cut them from the show because they did not perform well during a dress rehearsal. “SNL” producer Lorne Michaels also told the Daily Mail that the show had passed on the news because “it’s a New York thing” ― i.e., Weinstein wasn’t that well known nationally.Although “SNL” addressed Weinstein this week, some felt it was not soon ― or tough ― enough.

They feed on one another in a very destructive way. I don’t work that way, I don’t deal that way, and I’m just not going to dignify the question. I call the president ‘Mr. President.’”Tillerson described his relationship with Trump as “open, frank and candid.”It’s also involved some public damage control, following NBC’s report depicting Tillerson as furious and “on the verge of resigning.” The secretary of state held an unscheduled news conference to tell reporters that he didn’t plan to resign and that he believed Trump was, in fact, “smart.” But during that appearance, he didn’t explicitly deny that he’d earlier disparaged the president’s intelligence.Trump, in response, denied the veracity of the story while publicly challenging Tillerson to an IQ test. The White House later said Trump was joking. During his appearance on CNN, Tillerson also discussed Trump’s decision to decertify the Iran nuclear agreement. He said that while it’s in the national security interests of the U.S. to remain in the deal, the administration wants to “address the flaws in the agreement,” possibly by means of a secondary accord.Tillerson shot down another suggestion of disharmony with Trump, dismissing Sen. Bob Corker’s (R-Tenn.) comments that the president had “publicly castrate[d]” Tillerson on foreign policy.“I checked,” Tillerson said. “I’m fully intact.”UN Ambassador Nikki Haley tried to downplay any White House tensions, saying on Sunday that the president had full confidence in Tillerson.“You know, I’m not going to get into the drama of the he-said-he-said situation. What I will tell you is what I have witnessed is the president and Secretary Tillerson work very well together. I’ve been in the room with them many times,” she said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “They continue to work strongly together. ... And so everything that I have witnessed, all was fine. And if there’s a problem, that’s really a question for Secretary Tillerson. That’s not anything for the rest of us to answer.”"

Zervos decided to sue Trump in January months after the then-presidential candidate denied the allegation and dismissed all of his accusers as liars.In her bid to establish that Trump “defamed” her, Zervos’s subpoena aims to prove how Trump deliberately tried to discredit her and the other accusers. The subpoena, which is liable to renew public attention on the numerous allegations against Trump, sets the stage for another legal and political headache for the president.Zervos’ subpoena requires him to turn over all documents “concerning any accusations that were made during Donald J. Trump’s election campaign for president, that he subjected any woman to unwanted sexual touching and/or sexually inappropriate behavior.” The order would cover documents about Zervos, as well as other women who accused Trump of groping, including, but not limited to, Jessica Leeds, Mindy McGillivray, Rachel Crooks, Natasha Stoynoff, Temple Taggart, Kristin Anderson, Cathy Heller, Jill Harth, and Jessica Drake.Zervos’ legal team, which includes nationally renowned women’s rights attorney Gloria Allred, issued the subpoena in March, but it only entered the court record in September.Trump’s attorneys tried to get the suit dismissed in March on the grounds that the president is immune from being sued while in office. They also tried to dismiss the subpoena in July, arguing that it “seeks wholly irrelevant information intended solely to harass the president.”During Trump’s campaign, he vowed to sue the women who accused him of assault and harassment, but he has not followed through on the promise.The subpoena comes to light at a moment of heightened public sensitivity to the impunity given to many powerful men allowing them to sexually harass and assault women. Famed Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein was fired by the company he founded and expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences after the New York Times reported earlier this month that Weinstein had settled numerous accusations of sexual harassment out of court. The report prompted a flood of additional allegations against Weinstein, including claims that he physically assaulted women and forced them to perform sex acts.The allegations against Weinstein bear an eerie resemblance to the accounts of many Trump accusers.At least 16 women have publicly accused Trump of forcibly attempting to kiss, grope and have sex with them. Many of those women came forward in October 2016 following the leaked 2005 video of Trump bragging to “Access Hollywood” host Billy Bush that he freely touches women without their consent, infamously stating that he can “grab them by the pussy.”Zervos said that in 2007 Trump summoned her to meet about professional matters on several occasions and then kissed, groped and humped her against her will."

Although the city has not yet elected its new mayor, both of the candidates to emerge from the first round of voting on Saturday are women.The top two contenders, City Councilwoman LaToya Cantrell and former Municipal Court Judge Desiree Charbonnet, will now face each other in a runoff election on Nov. 18. (New Orleans uses a top-two “jungle primary” system in which nonpartisan elections proceed to a runoff if no candidate gets over 50 percent on the first ballot.)Cantrell received 39 percent of the vote to Charbonnet’s 30 percent. In the field of 18 candidates, former Civil District Court Judge Michael Bagneris came in a distant third place with 19 percent.Cantrell, a community organizer who thwarted an effort to raze her Broadmoor neighborhood after Hurricane Katrina, is regarded as the more progressive of the two candidates.Cantrell’s support for a $15 minimum wage and criminal justice reform earned her the backing of local left-leaning organizations like Step Up Louisiana and national groups like the Working Families Party. As a city councilwoman, Cantrell spearheaded the successful 2015 effort to ban smoking in New Orleans’ bars, restaurants and casinos.Progressive groups backing Cantrell see in her bid an opportunity to add to a string of recent victories in local races. Candidates endorsed by the Working Families Party and its allies have won mayoral elections in recent months in Jackson, Mississippi, and Birmingham, Alabama, as well as a seat on the city council of South Fulton, Georgia.“LaToya Cantrell ran a campaign focused on making New Orleans a city that truly works for all its communities, not just a wealthy few,” Joe Dinkin, a spokesman for the Working Families Party, said in a statement. “Across the country, voters are rewarding candidates who are running on that kind of transformative progressive message.”If elected, Cantrell, 45, would also be the city’s first non-native mayor, according to Tulane University political scientist Rosalind Blanco Cook. Cantrell grew up in Los Angeles, California, and moved to New Orleans to attend college at Xavier University of Louisiana.Charbonnet, by contrast, comes from a political family with deep roots in the area and has been in city politics since the late 1990s.Both candidates are running on reducing violent crime and ensuring greater access to affordable housing.New Orleans has one of the highest murder rates of any big city in the country. A city police officer was shot dead while on patrol Friday morning.New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu (D) is leaving office after two terms due to city term limits. He did not endorse a mayoral candidate in the first round of voting."

18,POLITICS,Service Workers To Rally Against Trump Immigration Policies,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/service-workers-to-rally-against-trump-over-immigration-policies_us_59e21c56e4b03a7be580f6f6,"The hospitality union Unite Here plans demonstrations in 40 cities: ""We need protections for the workers who drive this industry.""",2017-10-14,The hospitality workers union Unite Here has planned protests in 40 cities for Oct. 19.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59e21e8a1500002000da1716.jpeg?cache=JrlTKCwmzT&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The hospitality workers union Unite Here was tangling with Donald Trump long before he ever became president. While the business mogul made his run for the Republican nomination last year, the group waged ― and eventually won ― a scrappy battle to unionize the housekeepers and restaurant workers at his hotel on the Las Vegas strip. Now that Trump occupies the White House, the union’s president, D. Taylor, says the best place to fight his presidency and his policies is still in the workplace.“Most of these jobs are not good jobs,” Taylor said of the sort of hotel and food service jobs that Trump, as a businessman, was best known for. “The only way those jobs change is if people have good union contracts, decent wages, good healthcare and retirement benefits. As much as we’d all love for manufacturing jobs to come back, we think we need to turn these [hospitality] jobs into good jobs.”Unite Here has added 12,000 new members this year, many of them at hotels and casinos in the South, bringing the union’s ranks close to 300,000. According to Taylor, the past year has been the union’s fastest-growing in a long time, “at a time when we’re told you can’t grow.” (Union membership in the private sector has now fallen to below seven percent in the U.S.) As a show of force, the union plans to hold demonstrations in 40 different cities on Oct. 19, ratcheting up labor fights with companies like Disney, Marriott and Google, while protesting the Trump administration’s hardline immigration policies. The point, Taylor said, is to show that “we need advancement in our working standards, and we need protections for the workers who drive this industry.”For many members, those immigration policies are personal. As a union of service workers, Unite Here’s membership skews toward immigrants. In Florida, the union represents 500 Haitian workers at Disney World who could potentially lose their temporary protected status that shields them from deportation. Trump’s Department of Homeland Security is weighing whether or not to end the Haitian TPS program, which allows some 59,000 people to stay in the U.S. rather than return home to a country that was battered by natural disasters.Although Unite Here and Disney don’t always get along, the two have been playing on the same team when it comes to lobbying to preserve the protected status program. Taylor said pressure from businesses could be the deciding factor for the administration.“If the employers step up, we have a chance,” Taylor said. “If not, I don’t see why Trump wouldn’t screw not just Haitian workers but Salvadoran workers and whoever else.”In New York, food service workers from Madison Square Garden plan on marching to Trump Tower to call on the president to preserve TPS as well as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which grants temporary work permits to undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. Trump has announced an end to DACA, which was started by former President Barack Obama, and called upon Congress to come up with a fix. He’s threatened to use DACA recipients as a bargaining chip in negotiations over border security.“Our union has a lot of immigrants from all corners of the globe,” said Gerard Cerda, who’s been a beer vendor at Madison Square Garden for 24 years. “Many of them are lower-paid employees. We have to support their efforts to better their lives.”Unite Here has been negotiating clauses in their collective bargaining agreements to protect immigrant workers, an effort the union says has become more urgent under Trump. The strategy includes getting employers to agree not to allow immigration officers onto a job site unless they have a warrant, and also promise not to do “self-audits” of employees’ immigration paperwork unless the government forces them to. The union also wants employers to agree to contribute money to assistance funds for undocumented workers who lose their jobs.Taylor said such contract wins are one way unions can push back on Trump’s immigration policies at the bargaining table.“We need to be moving forward, not just playing defense,” Taylor said. “We want to win strong contracts, and we want to win protections for these workers.”"
19,POLITICS,A Secretive NYC Backchannel May Be The Best Hope For Avoiding War With North Korea,Jessica Schulberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-korea-new-york-channel_us_59de4babe4b0eb18af05877d,"The North Korean diplomats in New York “don’t engage in propaganda, they don’t bang on the table, they don’t engage in threats,” a veteran diplomat said.",2017-10-14,The Manhattan office building that hosts North Korea's Mission to the United Nations.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59de51712d00009717309c79.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In Midtown Manhattan, in a building that also hosts a dermatologist, a sports medicine doctor and a package tour operator, two North Korean diplomats run a backchannel line of communication to U.S. officials in Washington. The office, known as the “New York channel,” is technically part of the North Korean mission to the United Nations; in the 1990s, during the height of its use, it functioned almost as a de facto embassy. Today, as President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un trade personal insults and threats of war, it’s more like a mailbox that each side occasionally uses to pass along messages.  But as the bluster between Trump and Kim escalates, there are signs that officials in both countries see a need to talk to avert a nuclear standoff. And although the New York channel is relatively quiet for now, it could become central to avoiding a military confrontation between the U.S. and North Korea — as soon as both sides are ready to use it effectively.These days, the two North Koreans charged with operating the New York channel are Pak Song Il, the ambassador for American affairs at the North Korean mission to the U.N., and his deputy, Kwon Jong Gun. They usually work in tandem, in part to prevent defection. They meet regularly with so-called “Track II” diplomats — private individuals from the U.S. side who engage in unofficial talks with North Korean government officials — and occasionally with U.S. government officials. They sometimes help arrange limited media tours to North Korea, although they did not respond to multiple interview requests from HuffPost. There’s a Hallmark store on the ground floor of the building, which also hosts diplomats and officials from Barbados, Bangladesh, Nepal, Croatia, Angola, Peru, Madagascar, Syria and Spain’s Basque region. “Everybody knows they’re here,” said KJ Singh, the manager of the Hallmark, said of the North Korean U.N. mission. Whenever Kim says something controversial, reporters from Korean or Japanese news outlets gather outside, Singh said.Pak, who held another position at the U.N. before returning to serve in his current role, is a familiar face to U.S. officials and Track II diplomats. He was previously a researcher at the Institute for Disarmament and Peace, an organization linked to North Korea’s Foreign Ministry that participates in international summits with American academics and government officials. The North Korean diplomats in New York don’t imitate the bombastic rhetoric of their boss back home, according to several Track II diplomats who have met with them. “They don’t engage in propaganda, they don’t bang on the table, they don’t engage in threats,” said Robert Carlin, who was the chief of the Northeast Asia Division in the State Department’s intelligence bureau from 1989 to 2002. “Their job is to figure out how to engage the United States.”“Even when the message is not a good one, my experience with this current team is that it’s done in a measured fashion. They make their points and then they move on,” said Evans Revere, the former head of Korean affairs at the State Department, who still meets with the North Koreans in New York as a private citizen.The history of the New York channel shows its potential for diplomatic breakthroughs. For decades after the armistice that ended the Korean War, North Korean and American diplomats met on an “episodic and ad hoc” basis, Carlin said.But in June 1993, as the new administration of then-President Bill Clinton got its foreign policy off the ground, American and North Korean diplomats met in New York. The meeting produced a major victory: The two countries agreed that North Korea would suspend its decision to pull out of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in exchange for a promise from Washington to refrain from military intervention against the regime in Pyongyang. Seeing the success of the New York meeting, a senior State Department diplomat who specialized in Korean affairs suggested opening a new channel between the two countries. “No one had any objections,” Carlin said. The New York channel was born, and the two countries finalized a nuclear nonproliferation deal, known as the Agreed Framework, the following year. In the absence of diplomatic relations, the New York channel gave diplomats a way to meet without U.S. officials traveling 14 hours to Beijing. When Carlin wanted to have an informal conversation with North Korean officials, he would call the then-ambassador at the U.N. mission responsible for American affairs and invent a reason to be in New York. “I would go up there sometimes, not officially, and say to the U.N. ambassador, ‘Oh, I’m going to see a relative’ — which I wasn’t — but ‘I’m going up to see a relative. Oh, hey, how about if we have coffee?’” Carlin recalled. “And he would know what that meant.” By 1999, Revere, who was at the State Department at the time, decided it was time to pursue better personal relations with North Korea. So when two diplomats from North Korea’s U.N. mission traveled to Washington for meetings at the State Department, Revere invited them to his house in Herndon, Virginia, for a home-cooked dinner. (Revere declined to name the officials, who predated Pak and Kwon.)“I sort of gave myself permission,” said Revere, whose office was in charge of issuing waivers that allowed North Korean diplomats to travel to Washington. (The State Department restricts the domestic travel of officials from sanctioned countries like North Korea.) “I don’t think you could get away with it today.” Revere’s wife, who is Korean, prepared Korean food and played Korean pop music for their guests, who stayed until late into the evening, Revere recalled. The North Koreans teased Revere’s wife about her musical taste, which was apparently outdated, Revere recalled. The State Department did not respond to HuffPost’s detailed list of questions, including whether State Department officials could, in fact, get away with inviting North Korean diplomats over for dinner.U.S.-North Korean relations faced a setback when President George W. Bush came into office and declared North Korea part of the “axis of evil.” The Agreed Framework collapsed in 2003.The New York channel “pretty much dried up” under the Bush administration, Carlin said. State Department officials could no longer travel to New York on their own to meet with North Korean officials. Diplomats “had to have a [National Security Council] minder to make sure that we didn’t do something terrible, like real diplomacy,” Carlin said.Throughout the Obama administration era of strategic patience — a vaguely defined policy of waiting for the North Korean regime to change its calculus before committing to negotiations — the New York channel remained quiet, and was used mostly to talk about Americans imprisoned in North Korea. Pyongyang suspended communication with Washington last July after the U.S. sanctioned Kim for human rights abuses — but the North Korean ambassador with the U.S. portfolio at the time remained in New York and continued meeting with Track II diplomats, Carlin said. When Trump came into office in January, North Korean officials in New York signaled they were open to a fresh start with the new administration. They asked U.S. Track II diplomats how U.S. policy towards the Korean Peninsula would change under Trump. The unofficial American envoys weren’t always sure how to respond. “Everyone is still trying to figure out Mr. Trump, including us, so I’m not sure we shed a lot of light in that area,” Ralph Cossa, a former assistant to the commander of the military’s Pacific Command, told HuffPost.North Korea held off on conducting missile tests from the time Trump was elected through his first several weeks in office, and looked for signs that the new American president was interested in reducing tensions. North Korean officials told Cossa that they hoped the annual large-scale joint military exercises between South Korea and the U.S. would be “toned down” this year. “I tried to explain to them that these exercises are planned years in advance — so this wasn’t the Trump administration sending you a signal by holding an annual exercise that’s held every year,” Cossa said. But when the exercises went on as planned in March, North Korea took it as a slight.Since February, Pyongyang has conducted 15 missile tests, including a test of an intercontinental ballistic missile that could reach parts of the United States. And after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson signaled a preference for a diplomatic solution, Trump undercut his top diplomat by tweeting vague threats of war and arguing that negotiating with North Korea is a waste of time. These days, the New York channel is mostly limited to meetings with Track II diplomats. Joseph Yun, the U.S. envoy for North Korea policy, is the only current American official who meets with North Koreans from the country’s U.N. mission, The Associated Press reported in in August. Negotiations between Yun and Pak led to the release of Otto Warmbier, an American college student who died shortly after North Korea allowed him to return home. But there is no indication that those talks have progressed to serious discussions about North Korea’s nuclear program. The absence of nuclear negotiations appears to have only encouraged a leap forward in North Korea’s nuclear capabilities, putting the country in a better position to shape the terms of any future deal. “The North Koreans, they know how many more tests they feel they need to hold in order to feel convinced — and believe that we’re convinced — that they’re capable of hitting the United States with a nuclear warhead,” Cossa said. “Once they get through that, I think they’ll probably turn around and say, ‘Ok, now let’s talk,’ and essentially, then they’ll try to get us to pay them to stop misbehaving.” If that time comes, the New York channel could play a key role. The North Korean diplomats there are well-suited to the task, Revere said.“They’re attempting to sell a product that no one’s buying,” he said. “But they do the best job.”Nick Robins-Early contributed reporting.

The shooter, Stephen Paddock, killed 58 people and injured more than 500 others.Doctors had to remove Frost’s right eye and part of her skull to remove bullet fragments, according to The Baltimore Sun. “She’ll have pieces of the bullet in her brain forever,” Frost’s mother, Mary Moreland, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.After waking up Friday, Frost seemed to be in good spirits and took her first steps since the shooting.“She opens her left eye just a [little] and looks all around the room at us, taps her feet whenever music is playing, continues to squeeze our hands, and even gives Austin a thumbs up when asked,” a family spokesperson said in a statement given to Washington, D.C., station WJLA. “She sometimes taps to music and also took her first steps today with the assistance of the nurses ― three steps to the chair and three steps back to the bed.”Frost was also able to sit in a chair and has a new teddy bear that she “hugs and pats on the back,” the spokesperson told the station.A GoFundMe campaign for Frost has already raised more than $500,000 for her long road to recovery.“We’ve heard people ask, ‘Well, why does she need all that money?’” Frost’s cousin, Randi Moreland, said at a fundraising event.

(It’s not a nuclear attack button, as some may think.)Concrete information about the button is slim. According to Business Insider, “The call button is meant to be used to summon an aide whenever a president needs something.” But the uses can get quite cheeky. Some reports say it was used to alert President Johnson when his wife was on the way. Earlier this year, it was revealed that Donald Trump uses his red button to order Coke on demand. But Barack Obama reportedly had a healthier aim when the gadget was his. The president told billionaire Richard Branson that he used the button for tea, according to Branson’s new autobiography “Finding My Virginity.” The duo shared lunch one day in the Oval Office, after which Obama clued Branson in.“As we stood up to leave I noticed the red buttons on his desk. Obama saw me looking at them,” Branson wrote. “He said, ‘They used to be there for emergencies, but now I use them for ordering tea for my guests.’”Obama’s love for tea is well documented. Those close to the former president have said he eschews coffee ― or at least did while he was in office ― and it’s been reported that he has a penchant for Honest Tea, especially the Black Forest Berry flavor. Obama told Vox in 2015 that he reads his morning briefings with tea.Once, outside a Starbucks in 2014, a reporter asked him how the coffee was. “It’s tea!” Obama responded, according to the Boston Globe."

Ever. I love everything about the experience. I am fully committed as an active participant and will soak up every drop of energy a performer is ready to give. But the thing about live shows is you never quite know what will happen. When you think about, so many things have to come together perfectly for a show to have a major effect on someone. The sound, the lights, timing, communication, audience reaction... You get the point.BUT SOMETIMES A SHOW IS SO OUTSTANDING THAT YOU CAN BARELY REMEMBER THE LIGHTING AND CAN ONLY DESCRIBE IT IN ALL CAPS BECAUSE YOU ARE STILL RIDING HIGH OFF ITS ENERGY.Here’s what I knew about Andrew W.K. before attending his show in Brooklyn on Friday the 13th: He had long hair and always wore a white t-shirt and white pants on stage. He had a song about partying hard.Here’s what I didn’t know: He, and his music, are unbelievably infectious. He has the power to transform the energy and mood of every person in the room. And he puts on one of the greatest live shows I have ever seen.Andrew W.K. does indeed sing about partying. A lot. When I wasn’t jumping and crashing into the happiest strangers I have ever been around, I tried to pick up on what he was saying. His songs were about being in love, letting go of tension (and partying), having a fun night (partying together), getting along (so let’s party) and working all day (partying all night). In between songs, he spoke about staying positive, about being in this together, and encouraged everyone to keep going. While some may scoff at lyrics and guitar riffs that don’t read as incredibly deep or poetic, I am now firmly convinced that Andrew W.K. could heal the damn world. My face still hurts from smiling so much. For somewhere around two hours, I let go of every ounce of stress that was piled up in my head and body. Work, deadlines, annoying people, the Trump administration, the news, and anything that I had experienced or thought about that week. And I wasn’t alone.Never have I attended a show where every single person in the room was actually happy. And I mean every one. From security guards to the back of the room, I was hard pressed to find someone not smiling, yelling with glee, jumping, or dancing. When my girl and I decided to snake our way to the front of the stage, not one person was annoyed or complained as we pushed through. At one point we were surrounded by a high percentage of men who were smiling and singing a song called “She Is Beautiful” and not one person used the crowd to act inappropriately.”I never knew girls existed like you. But now that I do. I’d really like to get to know you.” - lyrics from “She Is Beautiful”When we made it to the front, we were part of the nicest mosh pit I have ever participated in. For those unfamiliar, a mosh pit is an open space - usually in front of the stage - where high energy and lots of body contact happens. It’s bodies smashing into bodies, and it’s physical and rough. I have seen serious fights break out in mosh pits. I have walked away with someone else’s blood on my shirt. I have had my shoes ripped off my feet. Over the years, it’s become an area that I haven’t felt safe ― this space of “controlled violence” can very quickly feel like a large group of very aggressive men whose next move is unpredictable.As someone who loves to be close to the performers and in the thick of the energy, it sometimes frustrates me that I can’t enjoy a show because a group of men are too powerful and intimidating to be around. I am not saying women don’t join mosh pits; I certainly have. What I am saying is mosh pits typically turn into a heavily male-dominated space that can feel like they’re about to lose control on one another, and maybe light a car on fire.I have attended shows where men are not just aggressive, but have groped me or acted inappropriately. They have used the space to their advantage - if I am squished in the middle of hundreds of people, who will know if someone’s hand ends up on my breasts? Perhaps one of the things I loved most about the Andrew W.K. experience was that it was the first show I have attended where the mosh pit felt more like a room of radiating happy people. Yes, we were crashing into one another. We were sweating and pushing and jumping. We were smiling and laughing and all in this crazy moment together. It was hands down the happiest room in all of Brooklyn last night.In a time where anxiety and stress feel at a constant 8.5 out of 10, it was transformative to just let it all go for a few hours. To be in a safe space where I could use my body to connect with music, without hesitation or threat, was the greatest gift Andrew W.K. brings to the table. The man radiated good vibes and positive energy, and frankly may be spirit animal. In an interview for Meet the Regulars (trust me, you should own this book), he says,I like the idea that everything is positive. So even the bad stuff, and sad stuff, and painful stuff, it’s all part of this colorful adventure. And there’s different flavors and shades of colors within in it. But if we have that overriding sense that it’s a positive experience, we can appreciate all of it.HELL YES, ANDREW. HELL. YES. I may need to send him a personal thank you basket for reminding me that life IS positive. Yes, there have been more moments than not that feel like everything is burning and maybe humanity is hopeless. But dammit does his show remind you that we can let it go, even just for a few hours, and connect with strangers and smile and be HAPPY. The man’s motto is spreading cheer by partying. And you can party in a way that is fun and not hurtful to others. It is something I understand completely and agree with, with every fiber of my body.Do yourself a favor and go see Andrew W.K. live. The performance is a shot of endorphins, love, energy, positivity, and cheer that will leave you drenched in so much sweat (a lot of it not your own), that you could likely pee your pants and no one will know. Oh, and you will feel like YOU ARE GLOWING WITH THE JOY OF A MILLION SUNS."

Stevens, who was Playboy’s Miss June 1997, described the encounter on her private social media pages Thursday night after seeing an interview with Stone published earlier in the day by The Hollywood Reporter. In it, Stone appeared to sympathize with Weinstein, who’s been accused of sexually harassing or assaulting dozens of women, by saying, “It’s not easy what he’s going through.”Stone has since clarified his statement, saying now he is “appalled” by the accusations against the fired co-founder of The Weinstein Co. and was withdrawing from a television project involving the company, according to Variety.“When I heard about Harvey, the first person I thought of was Oliver Stone, and it figures,” Stevens wrote in a private Facebook post seen by HuffPost. It includeed a link to The Hollywood Reporter’s interview with Stone.Stevens told HuffPost the encounter with Stone took place in the 1990s.“Oliver saw me where I was standing near the door and he just reached out and groped me, grabbed my boob like it was a toy or a hand you’d shake,” Stevens said. Then, she added, he “grinned a shit-eating grin and kept walking.”Stone’s agent did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment by the time of publication.Stone has since spoken out against Weinstein, backtracking from his comments Thursday in The Hollywood Reporter in which he defended Weinstein.In that interview, Stone said:I’m a believer that you wait until this thing gets to trial ....But Friday, Stone walked back that remark, telling Variety that he had been traveling and was unaware that even more women have accused Weinstein of harassment and assault since last week.“After looking at what has been reported in many publications over the last couple of days, I’m appalled and commend the courage of the women who’ve stepped forward to report sexual abuse or rape,” he said.“I’ll therefore recuse myself from the ‘Guantanamo’ series as long as The Weinstein Company is involved.”On Thursday, Stevens aired her feelings about Stone on her private Facebook page and Twitter.“I still remember the cocky grin on his face like he got away with something,” Stevens wrote on Facebook, referring to Stone. “These douche bags are not above the law, and they should be held to the same standard as every other man.”When asked about her post, Stevens told HuffPost: “A polite handshake would have sufficed. He didn’t have to grab my boob.”During his decades-long career, Stone has won three Academy Awards and five Golden Globe awards. Recent notable films include “Snowden” and “Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps.” Stevens isn’t the only one accusing Stone of inappropriate behavior. In a series of tweets, actress Patricia Arquette described a “weird” experience she once had with the director.Stone had invited Arquette to a screening of “Natural Born Killers,” after he had already sent her long-stemmed roses, she said. “Something felt weird,” Arquette tweeted, so she brought her boyfriend with her to the screening.At the event, she said Stone stopped her from exiting the bathroom and asked why she brought her boyfriend. She told Stone: “Why is it a problem I brought him? It shouldn’t be a problem. Think about THAT Oliver” ― then never heard from him about the movie again.In Stevens’ encounter, she says Stone was acting like an “entitled pig.” And if others had noticed, she said, they didn’t say anything.“He was too powerful, but it affected me,” Stevens said.“His actions sent the message of how small and trivial I was and that the only reason someone powerful would be interested in me is for my body parts and not my brains, and certainly not my talent.”Stevens said she was moved to share her story after The New York Times and The New Yorker published investigative reports that included accounts of women accusing Weinstein of raping, sexually assaulting and harassing them over a period of decades. Weinstein’s accusers include Ashley Judd, Rose McGowan, Asia Argento, Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow, Rosanna Arquette, Heather Graham and Cara Delevingne.Stevens wrote on Facebook Tuesday that she has had “issues in this business more times than I can count. I never took a stand because sadly, I thought I didn’t matter.” She later told HuffPost it was important to see celebrities stand up against a powerful executive.“I really loved acting. I still do it, but I don’t get to read for big movies like the stars Harvey victimized,” Stevens said.“It was empowering to know that they went through it, too. I thought somehow they were better than me, and that’s why I got groped, but so did they.”Stevens said she has a goddaughter who wants to be an actress, but wants the industry’s attitude toward women to change so she can pursue a career without being harassed or assaulted.“That is what we aim for,” Stevens said. “I think there is strength in numbers. The more people who stand up, the better.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated Stone had won a dozen Academy Awards and nearly two dozen Golden Globe awards. In fact, Stone himself has won three Academy Awards and five Golden Globe awards."

Orphaned, unweaned kittens are frequently killed in shelters without sufficient resources to care for them. This kitten is safe and in the care of the no-kill Best Friends Animal Society in Mission Hills, California.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59e229e82d0000265e30a4a3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"California has banned pet stores from selling cats, dogs and rabbits unless they work with shelters or rescue groups to supply the animals. Gov. Jerry Brown signed Assembly Bill 485 into law Friday, The Orange County Register reported. It takes effect in January 2019, and pet store owners who violate it will face a $500 fine.The Democratic governor’s signature was celebrated by animal welfare groups, including Social Compassion in Legislation, the bill’s sponsor.“We are overjoyed with the Governor’s signature and broad support from the entire animal-loving community for this groundbreaking legislation,” the group’s founder and CEO, Judie Mancuso, said in a statement. “In banning the sale of mill-bred animals, California took a bold step forward. The deplorable conditions that animals suffer in these high-volume breeding facilities are not a secret and now they have a champion in California.”In a statement sent to HuffPost, Matt Bershadker, president and CEO of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, praised the law for breaking “the puppy mill supply chain that pushes puppies into California pet stores and has allowed unscrupulous breeders to profit from abusive practices.”Pet industry representatives criticized the bill as being bad for business. It “strips consumers of many pet store protections, risks hundreds of jobs, and reduces pet choice,” Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council President Mike Bober said in a joint statement with the American Kennel Club, a registry of purebred dog breeds in the U.S.In the statement, Sheila Goffe, the AKC’s vice president of government relations, criticized the legislation as blocking “all of California’s pet lovers from having access to professional, licensed, and ethical commercial breeders.”The law will not prevent breeders from selling animals directly to customers, meaning that people who want to buy an animal from a breeder still can, but they won’t be able to do it through a retail pet store.More than 230 cities, towns and counties across the U.S. have similar laws, but California’s is the first statewide law.The law has two primary goals. One is to cut down on financial support of large-scale breeding facilities, some of which keep animals in deplorable conditions. Those so-called “puppy mills” (though they also exist for other species) often supply pet stores. The Humane Society of the United States notes that responsible breeders who care about their animals want to make sure they go to good homes, meaning they typically won’t sell them through a store that wouldn’t allow them to meet potential owners.Secondly, the law aims to promote the adoption of homeless pets. The ASPCA estimates that 1.5 million companion animals were euthanized in shelters across the country last year. Assemblyman Patrick O’Donnell (D-Long Beach) said in a statement that in California alone, taxpayers spend more than $250 million each year “to house and euthanize animals” in shelters."

It was, coincidentally, the very “same” eclipse I had seen in Iran eighteen years earlier. It’s called a saros: a repeating pattern of eclipses that happens every eighteen years, eleven days and eight hours, when the “same” eclipse appears one third of the way around the world.Typically, celestial wonders remind us that human beings and our politics and activities are insignificant in the grand scheme of things, but this eclipse had the opposite effect on me. Given the locations from which I viewed the respective events, I focused instead on how frustratingly little US-Iran relations had changed during the saros period – the continued lack of diplomatic relations and rampant mistrust between the countries. In a way, the saros pattern of eclipses reflected for me the obstinate way in which humans are unable to break from their own familiar historical and political patterns.When I visited Iran eighteen years ago, my younger self was confident that relations would improve quickly. As a sixteen-year-old aspiring astronomer, I was encouraged by the throngs of young women studying science that we met at universities in this supposedly conservative society. I was amazed by the chants of “we love America” that followed us everywhere (a far cry from the famous 1979 version), and I was heartened by the constant outpouring of kindness we received from everyone we met. With such a modern, youthful and warm population – most of whom were born after the 1979 revolution – I assumed that relations could only improve.The Iranian population hasn’t changed, with the vast majority still eager for rapprochement with the West. However, the familiar political patterns and cycles of distrust between the U.S. and Iran continue to maintain the status quo.It’s said that patterns of history will repeat themselves if we fail to learn from the past, so it’s worth a brief reminder of the historical flash-points between the U.S. and Iran: the U.S. overthrowing the democratically-elected Mohammad Mossadegh to re-install the authoritarian Shah Reza Pahlavi to power in 1953; Iranians rebelling against the Shah in the 1979 Islamic Revolution; the ensuing hostage crisis and breakdown of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Iran; U.S. support for Iraq during the Iran-Iraq War, in which Iraq used chemical weapons against Iran; Iran’s ‘tanker war’ in the Persian Gulf against Iraq and nations supporting Iraq during the war. These and other historical events fomented deep mistrust on both sides.And yet, like a tragic comedy about a separated couple where one, but never both parties want to reconcile, Iran and the U.S. constantly seem perfectly out of sync. When President Rafsanjani, a pragmatist, led Iran in the 1990s, his attempts to repair a modicum of relations with the U.S. were rebuffed by President Clinton who responded with crushing sanctions on the country. A course change in President Clinton’s approach later in his presidency was quickly reversed by a new U.S. leader, President George W. Bush. He too rejected overtures from Iran in the aftermath of 9/11, and instead famously lumped the country into his so-called “Axis of Evil.” And while U.S. policy could have changed early in Obama’s presidency had the circumstances in Iran been right, hardliner President Ahmadinejad was in power at the time, and his hostile rhetoric against the U.S. and Israel made rapprochement untenable. It was only towards the end of Obama’s presidency, with a weakened Iran due to sanctions, and a moderate at the helm, President Rouhani, that the mere possibility of communication opened.Like an eclipse, everything had aligned just right in both countries to make an opening possible, and thankfully leadership seized the opportunity. The P5+1 hammered out a remarkable achievement with agreement on the nuclear issue; but, in a way, the deal was also remarkable for being the first time in nearly 40 years that the U.S. and Iran had broken through the patterns of history and taken their first step towards a possible path to regaining a modicum of trust. In a sense, that was the spirit of the deal.Today, by breaking that most ephemeral spark of trust, President Trump, not Iran, has broken the spirit of the deal. While President Trump argues otherwise – that Iran has done so by failing to moderate its behaviors beyond the nuclear realm - that, of course, was never the goal, nor the spirit of the JCPOA. By refusing to recertify a deal that took not only years to be negotiated, but required such a rare historical moment to even bring U.S. and Iranian sides to the table ― President Trump demonstrates that he is unable to break through historical patterns or learn from past mistakes. That he is willing, even eager, to bring us back to square one, or the political equivalent of celestial apogee of U.S.-Iran relations.I still believe relations between the two countries will ultimately improve, thanks in part to the generation of young Iranians who will take over from the aging hardliners; and, I still hope that another alignment of U.S. leadership might ultimately allow for a path forward with Iran. But today’s step backwards makes that future unfortunately distant. Many have noted that today’s actions will also have far-reaching ramifications beyond U.S.-Iran relations. I won’t elaborate on those today except to note this: I hope to see a third total solar eclipse in my lifetime, and my goal is to see the “same” one that I have seen twice before. The next time I see that eclipse will be in 2035 when it crosses over Pyongyang, North Korea. Let’s hope the world by then has broken through the frustrating human “saros” of political intransigence."

She's not particularly happy in her life but stuff happens to her and she goes on the most incredible journey over the course of the season,"" Barnett shared.Wood told the audience that Walsh's character is his new favorite character arc because, ""it is the character you immediately identify as being, kind of, the normal character that extraordinary things happen to, and there are some beautiful parallels that Max [Landis] has written into the context of these scripts that play out and they're there for you to see, things that happen in episode 1, season 1, that happens in episode 1, season 2, that are parallel.""It's safe to say that Barnett and Wood are very excited for the fans to watch how the new season plays out.""That's what I love about this show. It's humanity. It's a crazy sci-fi, genre bending show with real human heart at the center of it. I think that keeps people wanting to watch it and it's certainly helps us connect to it when we're doing it,"" Barnett concluded.You can watch Samuel Barnett and Elijah Wood in the season 2 premiere of ""Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency,"" Saturday, October 14th at 9pm on BBC America.

She's not particularly happy in her life but stuff happens to her and she goes on the most incredible journey over the course of the season,"" Barnett shared.Wood told the audience that Walsh's character is his new favorite character arc because, ""it is the character you immediately identify as being, kind of, the normal character that extraordinary things happen to, and there are some beautiful parallels that Max [Landis] has written into the context of these scripts that play out and they're there for you to see, things that happen in episode 1, season 1, that happens in episode 1, season 2, that are parallel.""It's safe to say that Barnett and Wood are very excited for the fans to watch how the new season plays out.""That's what I love about this show. It's humanity. It's a crazy sci-fi, genre bending show with real human heart at the center of it. I think that keeps people wanting to watch it and it's certainly helps us connect to it when we're doing it,"" Barnett concluded.You can watch Samuel Barnett and Elijah Wood in the season 2 premiere of ""Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency,"" Saturday, October 14th at 9pm on BBC America.

Greg Gianforte (R-Mont.) was sentenced in June for body-slamming a reporter asking a question, he assured the public he understood the “critical role” journalists play in society.But just 7 minutes into discussing that role with actual journalists last week, he bailed.Gianforte had agreed to a have a 30-minute conversation with the Committee to Protect Journalists on Oct. 5 to discuss ways to empower the press.CPJ called on Gianforte to attend the meeting after a May incident in which the millionaire Republican body-slammed Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs, who was asking him a question. The following day, Montana voters elected him to the U.S. House. He later pleaded guilty to the assault and was sentenced to community service and a small fine.On Wednesday, a Montana judge finally released the mugshot of Gianforte, who had fought the court unsuccessfully to avoid being fingerprinted or photographed.During the short time with Gianforte, members of CPJ suggested the congressman join bipartisan groups such as the Congressional Caucus for Freedom of the Press. “Greg didn’t come here to join clubs,” the congressman’s chief-of-staff, Charles Robison, told the journalists, according to CPJ Advocacy Director Courtney Radsch.An aide for Gianforte soon after told the congressman he needed to go back to Capitol Hill to vote, and Gianforte left.His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.Jacobs said Gianforte failed to live up to his past statement.“I had expected that he was sincere in his expressions of support for a free press,” Jacobs told CPJ. “Instead, he is continuing to behave like the worst stereotype of a Washington politician.”Gianforte can rest assured that he doesn’t need to be in a room full of journalists for them to keep writing about him.

Kaling, who portrays an OB-GYN, said that she found out her show got the green lit within the same hour that her mom, who was also an OB-GYN, died. She described the event as “such a strange thing.”Now that the show is ending, Kaling feels her pregnancy marks a bittersweet conclusion, but also a beginning. “It felt like the show kind of helped me and trained me to kind of grow up and become a mom,” she said. “It is really meaningful to me.”The actress also confirmed she’s expecting a girl, a few months after Oprah Winfrey spilled the news about her pregnancy at a press event. Kaling and Winfrey worked on Ava DuVernay’s upcoming film “A Wrinkle In Time” together, and while shooting, Kaling shared her big news with Winfrey. The actress seems totally OK with Winfrey telling people, though. “If anyone was going to announce big news about your private life, Oprah Winfrey is the person,” Kaling told DeGeneres. “You can’t complain that much about it.”Kaling joked that she’s looking forward to telling her daughter that Winfrey, whom she described as “kind of a religious figure,” was the person who informed the world about her.“If there’s one person I have to tell my daughter about that revealed her existence to the world, Oprah is pretty good,” she said.

Former Googler Bill Maris says humans can make it to 500 years old; hedge fund manager Joon Yun thinks 1,000 years is more on the money. Some, such as biotech founder Martine Rothblatt, have even called death “optional.” Silicon Valley entrepreneurs are not the first to be obsessed with longevity — the rich and powerful of many societies have fixated on immortality. But the advances made in medicine and technology over the past century may have positioned today’s tech elite to make significant progress toward extending the human lifespan.There’s just one problem: More life doesn’t necessarily mean a better life. At a certain point, parts of the body stop working properly, making it difficult to enjoy the time you’ve got. Medical conditions like Alzheimer’s, cancer, diabetes, heart disease and arthritis can make the final years of one’s life an exercise in suffering. Living for 1,000 years isn’t much of a boon if only the first 80 — or even the first 900 — are physically pleasant.Luckily, there are also scientists working to extend the amount of time during which a person is healthy. Some interventions seem more realistic or pragmatic than others, but it’s becoming clear that getting sick with age is anything but inevitable. These approaches might even change the way we think about the very concept of getting old.“Our goal is not to extend longevity at the cost of being unhealthy for 75 years — our goal really is to take and extend the amount of time we’re healthy and compress the time we’re in morbidity,” says Derek Huffman, a professor of molecular pharmacology and medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.What’s health, anyway?Scientists refer to the number of years a person is healthy as the health span, but measuring that is tricky. A person is considered healthy if the body is generally functioning as it should, with no signs of disease. It’s not a coincidence that age is the biggest risk factor for chronic conditions like Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and heart disease — as we age and our cells break down, chemical reactions that clear away waste happen slower or less frequently, and there are fewer stem cells around to replace malfunctioning tissues.Researchers have spent decades trying to make animals such as monkeys, mice, and roundworms live longer. Along the way they’ve figured out some techniques that keep them healthy longer, too. Starting in the 1930s, experiments on mice have shown that drastically reducing the calories in their diet not only extends their lifespan, but their health span, too (the findings have been repeated a number of times, most recently in monkeys).“Pathologies associated with disease seem to be postponed in caloric-restricted mice, and some pathologies never appear,” says Gordon Lithgow, a professor at the Buck Institute for Research On Aging specializing in the mechanisms of aging. That’s where scientists got the idea that extended life and extended health may work hand-in-hand, Lithgow says.From the caloric restriction studies, scientists have started to identify a few major biological pathways — chains of chemical reactions within the body — that likely play a key role in aging. Some, such as one that makes a hormone called insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), correspond to growth; studies have indicated that reducing its activity in older but healthy animals delays the signs of aging. Others, such as an immune signaling protein called Interleukin 1, are tied to inflammation, the immune system’s destructive reaction to something it perceives as a threat; dialing down the pathways that signal inflammation in the body seems to keep animals from aging.Of course, humans aren’t mice or monkeys. But researchers can still learn a lot from these animal models. Some types of signals haven’t changed much as humans have evolved, and “it’s a good bet they will be operating in people,” says James Kirkland, a professor of aging research at the Mayo Clinic.Genetic analyses into long-lived humans called super-agers can give researchers a clue on where to start looking. There aren’t many who live past age 100 — the 2010 census revealed just over 53,000 centenarians in the entire United States — but those who do tend to stay healthy for much longer than the rest of the population, and tend to die of acute conditions like pneumonia as opposed to lingering ailments like cancer or heart disease.But actually testing anti-aging therapies in humans is much more difficult than checking in on super-agers. Clinical trials that evaluate the human health span would require decades, and billions of dollars. So researchers have been looking for biomarkers of aging, biological indicators to show them if a particular intervention is working as they hoped. Though there is no clear protein or genetic mutation that scientists can detect to show aging, they can measure things like abdominal circumference, blood pressure, telomere length, body mass index, and frailty index to get a sense for how much a person has physiologically aged.Though the scientific community has more or less agreed on the types of pathways that play a key role in aging and related diseases, it is far from reaching a consensus on how best to alter them.InterventionsYears of experimenting on animals has shown that caloric restriction is a non-invasive and effective way to slow the biological signs of aging. But, save for a few small and dedicated communities of human calorie-restrictors, it’s hard to convince people to override their biological desire to eat enough food to feel full. There’s good evidence that exercise can slow aging, too, but exercise alone usually isn’t sufficient to make a significant impact.Pharmacological interventions can more easily fit into people’s lifestyles. And, luckily, there are a few promising candidates — Kirkland estimates that there are 50 drugs or interventions that affect the appropriate pathways, with peer-reviewed studies on about a dozen of them. One, called metformin, has been on the market for years as an inexpensive treatment for type 2 diabetes. Numerous experiments, including some in mice, show that the drug is a promising anti-aging option. A 2014 study found that diabetics taking metformin outlived not only other diabetics not taking the drug, but also unmedicated non-diabetics. Researchers are now testing metformin in the first-ever FDA-approved clinical trial for a drug to combat aging.Another trial of a drug called rapamycin, originally developed to suppress the immune system after an organ transplant, has shown spectacular results in mice and in dogs. But it has more side effects, such as (rather ironically) an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, many of the drugs found to work in mice have a lot of variation across individuals — and even appear to affect male and female rodents differently — which makes them less appealing options for human trials.Parabiosis, a decades-old experiment in which scientists connect the circulatory systems of young and old rodents, has gotten more attention in the past few years thanks to billionaire Peter Thiel, who told Inc magazine that he is interested in injections of young blood to extend the human health span. But although a controversial clinical trial recently concluded that young blood can have anti-aging effects, most researchers, including Huffman, see parabiosis as an experimental tool to figure out new anti-aging targets for a future drug — not as a viable treatment in and of itself.Looking into the far future, genetic engineering using tools like CRISPR may be an option to increase health span. But the prospect is so distant — and so ethically fraught — that researchers can’t seriously consider it. “It’s premature to talk about CRISPR, because no one has done it yet in lab animal. I think it’s irresponsible to talk about doing that in people,” says Matt Kaeberlein, a pathology professor at the University of Washington.Others think it’s best to start having those difficult conversations early. “It’s a really good question for an ethics class. If we could do [genetic engineering] today and it would affect the next generation, would you do it?” Lithgow says. “Until we understand the trade-offs, we can’t engineer the next generation.”Still, some in the field are skeptical that these interventions will work as well as hoped. Luigi Fontana, a professor of geriatrics and nutritional science at Washington University in St. Louis, is compelled by the evidence for caloric restriction and the effects of exercise. But genetic engineering is unrealistic, he says, and metformin is “bullshit.” “This is willful thinking of people selling dreams,” he adds.Even within the field of aging research, a consensus seems difficult to achieve. “When you’re having conversations in the field, everyone has bias, saying they think this pathway or factor is most important,” Huffman says. “It’s a problem for the field right now.” But fundamentally, these researchers all have the same goal: to make humans live healthier for longer. Their mission may just be lacking a champion — and a cohesive rallying cry.A shift in medicine as we know itAs researchers work to develop and test ways to slow aging, they will first look to create treatments intended for people in their 50s and 60s, when chronic diseases often start to set in. Studies evaluating those treatments, some of which are already planned (most notably the trial for metformin), should only take a few months or years, measuring secondary indicators like BMI and frailty instead of death itself to ensure their efficacy. Eventually, there might be drugs for people to start taking when they’re even younger.But giving pharmaceuticals to healthy people is a hard sell. Without extensive long-term clinical trials, it’s impossible to anticipate how the decades-long use of an anti-aging drug will affect other aspects of long-term health. There will almost inevitably be some side effects, and the public will have to wade through discussions of whether or not it’s worth it. “Anyone who tells you there’s no risk [to an intervention] is lying to you,” says Kaeberlein. There are people who question whether the clinical trials needed to prove the safety and efficacy of such therapies are even ethical, Kaeberlein adds.These issues hint at a deeper ideological hurdle stopping anti-aging treatments from becoming commonplace. For now, our medical system is designed to address medical conditions as they arise. Putting interventions to treat aging on the market would mean a fundamental shift in our medical system, towards preventative medicine. “We’ve been trained in biomedicine to focus on sickness rather than health, so that paradigm shift will take time,” Kaeberlein says. And to move from success in the lab to having an actual impact on human wellbeing, he adds, you need to have public opinion on your side.Social acceptance of aging interventions could pave the way for the medical shift. The field of anti-aging research suffers from what Kaeberlein calls a “reputation problem.” For decades, products running the gamut from skin creams to herbal supplements have claimed to have “anti-aging” properties, with virtually no science to back them up. “People associate our field with snake oil. That only adds to that perception that it’s not rigorous,” Kaeberlein says. What’s more, people in general are reluctant to talk about getting old and dying.For now, researchers are still trying to get the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) onboard. As it stands now, the FDA only approves treatments for a specific medical condition — Prozac, for example, was first approved to treat depression, Lipitor to treat cardiovascular disease. Now researchers in the field of aging are trying to convince the agency to make a separate designation for preventative medicine. From the FDA’s perspective, the field of medicine built around combating aging is still in its infancy. “A question not yet answered is how many aging-related but otherwise independent diseases (coronary artery disease, dementia, sarcopenia, etc.) would need to be improved for us to consider the therapeutic effect an ‘anti-aging’ effect, rather than an effect on specific diseases. It is worth noting again that a drug that improved ANY of these conditions would be very valuable,” an FDA spokesperson said via email. It’s also still a challenge to figure out how to measure whether or not these interventions are effective. “The FDA is looking forward seeing this area of science evolve,” the spokesperson added.“If the field of aging is going to move forward in having drugs to treat aging in humans, we’re going to have to have an FDA-approved pipeline to do so,” Huffman says. Having that framework in place will drive innovation, researchers claim—more research money can be allocated towards prevention, and pharmaceutical companies will work to develop new drugs that could potentially be used by the entire adult population. Though Kirkland doesn’t believe there will be a special designation for anti-aging interventions anytime soon, he does say that the FDA has been supportive and encouraging in their field. A clear FDA pathway, plus more frank public discourse, could give the field a reputation to match the rigorous science already underway.Other issues will arise. Though people who stay healthy for longer would likely benefit the economy and would reduce burdens on the healthcare system, there may be a disparity between socioeconomic classes as the wealthy shell out for life extension (this is already the case, but the disparity may become more pronounced). And as humans live longer, brand new diseases could emerge. This isn’t a hypothetical problem: over the past century, during which rates of heart disease and strokes have dropped, Alzheimer’s has become more and more commonplace. “It’s highly unlikely that anyone during the Stone Age saw Alzheimer’s,” Lithgow says. But as people began to live longer, there was more time for particular physical problems to unfurl and accumulate. Our genomes likely have more surprises waiting for us.But that’s no reason to stop, scientists argue. “Even if there are downsides, I don’t see that as an argument to not do [the research],” Kaeberlein says.And it seems increasingly likely that some intervention or another will emerge to keep people healthy for longer. “20 years ago, I would have said [finding a way to extend the health span] had a .5 percent chance of working. It’s up to a 25 percent chance now, and every year it’s going up,” Kirkland says.Just when such a treatment will be ready for broad use will depend on how quickly these shifts happen. But researchers are putting the pieces in place from scientific, regulatory, and social standpoints.The real question, of course, is whether individuals are ready to live significantly longer, dying in worlds radically different from those into which they were born. Given humans’ perpetual desire to live forever, it seems unlikely that many would throw away such an opportunity. What we would actually do with it — and whether it would make us happy — is another matter entirely.This article originally appeared on Popular Science."

When actress Ashley Judd came forward in the New York Times last week along with several former Weinstein staffers, the cone of silence surrounding the movie mogul broke. An explosive report by Ronan Farrow at The New Yorker followed days later with multiple allegations of rape and an audio recording of Weinstein admitting to sexual assault. Actresses including Asia Argento, Rosanna Arquette, Angelina Jolie, Rose McGowan, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Mira Sorvino joined the chorus of accusers speaking out publicly.Weinstein’s fall from grace has been swift in the aftermath: he was fired from the company he founded and left by his wife, and is now under police investigation in London and New York.But absent amidst the fury engulfing Weinstein is condemnation of his brother, Bob, who is also a co-founder of The Weinstein Company.According to Harvey Weinstein’s former attorney, David Boies, the board of The Weinstein Company knew of at least three or four settlements with victims back when Harvey’s contract was up for renewal in 2015. Two company officials told the Times that there were eight settlements with victims over the years. And many within the company and across the entertainment industry have admitted that Weinstein’s behavior was an open secret. Kathy DeClesis, a former assistant to Bob Weinstein in the early 1990s, told the Times, “It wasn’t a secret to the inner circle.”DeClesis was Bob’s assistant NEARLY 30 YEARS AGO. So if Harvey Weinstein is despicable and worthy of condemnation, what about Bob? What about the board of The Weinstein Company? What about all the other folks who were complicit in Harvey’s alleged crimes?Harvey Weinstein did not act alone."

The film executive has been accused of sexual harassment and assault by dozens of women and counting. But those attending “the greatest gathering of conservative pro-family Americans in the nation” ― in the words of the Family Research Council, which organized the event ― saw little similarity between the allegations made about Weinstein those leveled against another former celebrity entertainer: Donald Trump. They maintained that it is the president’s record and accomplishments in office that ought to be judged first and foremost.“When it comes to this president, I’m more concerned about his policies and what he stands for than I am his history or his record,” said Jules Ostrander, who is from North Dakota. “I’m not impressed with his divorces. I’m not pleased with the things he’s been accused on that hot microphone. None of that is pleasing to me. But I’m more concerned about where a man stands and what his vision is for America. So I guess in a sense, I’m willing to give him a pass.”Nearly one month prior to last year’s presidential election, 14 women came forward and shared their allegations of sexual harassment and assault against the then-Republican presidential nominee. The allegations spanned more than three decades, and came in the wake of a 2005 video recording from the set of the show “Access Hollywood” in which Trump bragged he could grab women “by the pussy” because he was a star. Trump denied the allegations at the time, maintaining he was the victim a “concerted, coordinated, and vicious” political and media conspiracy.“These claims are all fabricated, they’re pure fiction and they’re outright lies,” he said.A year later, some top Republicans who supported and helped elect Trump are showing no hesitation in going after Weinstein for his alleged transgressions.White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, for example, criticized 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton this week for not immediately denouncing the film executive, who is also a major Democratic Party donor.Conway addressed the Weinstein story again at the Values Voter Summit on Friday, lamenting his alleged involvement “in some pretty ugly stuff.” In contrast, Conway said, Trump actually helped create a welcoming atmosphere for women in the White House. “I, at least, am in a place where women are respected,” she said during an interview on stage.Rita Kam-Kimura, who flew from Hawaii to attend her sixth Values Voter Summit this year, called Hollywood artists “a bunch of hypocrites” on the matter of women’s rights and sexual assault.“Where’s Madonna, [Lady] Gaga and the rest of them?” Kam-Kimura asked. “They’re all making fun of Donald Trump and what a sexist he is, a sexist pig. All the time they knew this was going on, and they did nothing, they said nothing. They should learn to shut up. They get paid to act, and that’s it.”Asked about Trump’s accusers, and whether the president’s case differed from that of Weinstein, Kam-Kimura said she did not believe the allegations against the president were “credible.”“A lot of those cases fell apart,” she said, referring specifically to Alicia Machado, the former Miss Universe beauty contestant whom Trump weight-shamed. “When you went back to that period of time when they did a press conference. She was smiling, he was supportive. Yes, she put on weight, but there was no disrespect there. And she did not look like she was upset. So it’s just funny that 20 years later, that all of a sudden she’s incredulous about it.”Heather Doherty, a Values Voter Summit attendee from Pennsylvania, said she was not one to judge Weinstein, because everyone has some kind of problems in life.“People could come and accuse me of stuff too. I’m not perfect,” Doherty said. “What really bothers me the most about anybody being accused of stuff, is how it destroys a person. True or untrue. The whole thing with [Supreme Court Justice] Clarence Thomas. What happened to him is the exact same thing. Was [Anita Hill] credible? She went to destroy him and somehow he didn’t get destroyed. Destroying a person, I don’t like that.”Daniel Norwell of North Carolina, however, argued the allegations about Trump differed in nature from those being leveled against Weinstein.“There’s a lot of difference between somebody just saying something and somebody doing something,” he said. “With Donald Trump, a lot of things have been said, but I don’t see the factual basis behind a lot of that. I know he said some things, but as far as physically ― actually being convicted in court, I haven’t seen that.”Trump was accused of groping women, lifting up women’s skirts and kissing women without their consent."

The title of Parton’s new children’s album, “I Believe In You,” is another nod to the classic children’s story about a little blue train doing her best to make it over a hill. “I like it because it builds confidence in children,” Parton told HuffPost of her affection for the story. ”‘The Little Engine That Could’ book, that’s what it’s really all about ― to not be shy and don’t be afraid to try.”That’s just one of the messages on the album as well, Parton’s first for children in her more than 50-year-long career. All proceeds for the album go to benefit Imagination Library, which is approaching 100 million books donated and has made Parton a hero in the world of children’s literacy. It’s just a piece of Parton’s reputation for giving back to the community: she recently raised $9 million for victims of wildfires in her native Tennessee and on Friday announced a $1 million donation to Vanderbilt’s Monroe Carell Jr. Children’s Hospital where here niece, for whom she wrote the song “Chemo Hero,” was treated for leukemia.I spoke to Parton (who thinks of her teacherly children’s album persona as “Miss Dolly”) by phone about how she wrote her new songs (it involved climbing around in tree houses); her Imagination Library; and how she got her special rapport with children. HuffPost: Why did you decide to do a children’s album at this point in your career?Dolly Parton: Well actually I’ve been wanting to do one for years. I’ve had children’s songs by the stacks for years. I write songs for Imagination Library with all the books that we put out and then I write personal songs for my little nieces and nephews and friends, so it just seemed to be a good time. When I heard that we were just about to give away 100 million books ― we’ll cross that line in the next few weeks ― and with the success of the two “Coat of Many Colors” movies, we really gained some new children fans from there. So it just hit me that that’s what I should do next musically.What’s different about writing and performing for children?Oh, well it’s completely different when you’re talking about children because you’re doing more of a teaching thing. I feel like I’m a child when I’m working on these songs. And I try to feel out what I think the kids need to hear or would like to hear.I have places for children ― for my nieces and nephews and friends ― all over my properties. Anywhere that I have land and houses. I’ve got stuff for kids. And I usually go up to one of the playhouses or tree houses or up to the playgrounds. And so I just have fun getting into playhouses and putting myself in their little minds. Just putting myself in their little world.How do kids respond to you?Oh they love me! I’m like Mother Goose to them. I’m like a cartoon character. I’m over-exaggerated with my look and my voice is over-exaggerated and high-pitched like a kid and I’m joyful with kids and they feel that, too. They feel that I love ’em.How do you have such a good rapport with kids?I grew up in a family of twelve, and there’s eight children younger than me. Me and my sisters were all like little second mothers to the kids growing under us, so I relate to children and they often ask me questions. You’d be surprised what a lot of my little nieces and nephews come to me and say, “Don’t tell mom, don’t tell mom” but they want to ask me something or tell me something and they don’t want me to tell their parents and I don’t! I just help them with whatever the problem is. And I know what to say because I’m a grownup and it’s usually their little things you can help them with easier than some grownup complicated problem. But it’s important to them. I know you have a lot of kids in your life with your siblings. Do you have any tips or tricks for dealing with kids?Well, yeah. I’m the perfect grandma, I’m the perfect aunt, I’m the perfect babysitter, because I don’t have children. So I bring them over to visit me by choice. They don’t get dumped on me. And when I do keep them, if they get out of line, all I have to do is imply that I’ll take them home or call their mom to come get them. Or sometimes if they’re really rowdy I’ll just say, “Now do you want me to call mom? You’re not happy now? You’re not happy here? Cause I can call mom.” I sweetly threaten them.It’s kind of like a teacher. I kind of always look at myself like Miss Dolly. And in these songs that I wrote I want the kids to kind of think of me like that. This is me teaching them things, telling them things, and the rules in all these songs that we did. So there’s songs about every little feeling and everything all the children deal with and go through, and plus they’re fun to sing. What themes or messages did you want to impart to kids through the songs?I wrote a song on the album called “Makin’ Fun Ain’t Funny” and it addresses bullying, and of course there’s one called “Responsibility” and I teach them how to spell the word and also teach them responsibility. There’s one called “Imagination” about just using your mind and how you can go anywhere in your imagination even if you’re stuck in your room with time out. But two songs are very personally important to me. One is called “Chemo Hero,” because one of my little neices, Hannah Denison, had leukemia when she was 4 years old and had several years of chemo and had a really hard time. She’s fine now and she’s my little chemo hero, but I wrote that for sick children like her. And then “Brave Little Soldier” I wrote for her at that time and it really address other issues in addition to sick children. It’s about being brave, and everybody goes through hard times. So those two songs are personally very important to me.This little CD has got a lot of great messages for all the things that children go through. Like “I Am A Rainbow” ― it has all their colors and moods in it and I address that it’s OK to have all those colors, you just have to know what to do with them and how to temper it and how to control it. Hopefully they’ll enjoy it.Imagination Library is such an amazing cause. Are there any moments or stories over the last 20 years that you’re particularly proud of?Many stories. I’ve had so many kids, like kids that are graduating from high school now or kids going to college now, they come and tell me how much the books meant to them. I’ve had a few of them say how sad they were ― they didn’t even want to turn 6 years old because they were not gonna get their books anymore. Just cute little things like that. Why is it so important for children to have books?Well, I think it’s important for them to have books so they can learn to read. When I first had the whole idea for Imagination Library 22 years ago, it got started because my dad couldn’t read and write. And he was always just kind of crippled by that. He thought it was too late to learn after he was grown, but he was so smart and I’ve often wondered what all he might have done had he been educated. Daddy got to live long enough to see Imagination Library taking off and doing well especially in Tennessee, and he loved it when the kids called me the book lady. But it’s important that kids know how to read because then you can learn about anything if you can read. If you don’t have the money to get education, there’s a book on everything you want to learn.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59e0fbc32d0000265e30a331.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Dolly Parton’s favorite children’s book is “The Little Engine That Could,” which is why it’s the first book given to every child who signs up for her charity, Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library. The title of Parton’s new children’s album, “I Believe In You,” is another nod to the classic children’s story about a little blue train doing her best to make it over a hill. “I like it because it builds confidence in children,” Parton told HuffPost of her affection for the story. ”‘The Little Engine That Could’ book, that’s what it’s really all about ― to not be shy and don’t be afraid to try.”That’s just one of the messages on the album as well, Parton’s first for children in her more than 50-year-long career. All proceeds for the album go to benefit Imagination Library, which is approaching 100 million books donated and has made Parton a hero in the world of children’s literacy. It’s just a piece of Parton’s reputation for giving back to the community: she recently raised $9 million for victims of wildfires in her native Tennessee and on Friday announced a $1 million donation to Vanderbilt’s Monroe Carell Jr. Children’s Hospital where here niece, for whom she wrote the song “Chemo Hero,” was treated for leukemia.I spoke to Parton (who thinks of her teacherly children’s album persona as “Miss Dolly”) by phone about how she wrote her new songs (it involved climbing around in tree houses); her Imagination Library; and how she got her special rapport with children. HuffPost: Why did you decide to do a children’s album at this point in your career?Dolly Parton: Well actually I’ve been wanting to do one for years. I’ve had children’s songs by the stacks for years. I write songs for Imagination Library with all the books that we put out and then I write personal songs for my little nieces and nephews and friends, so it just seemed to be a good time. When I heard that we were just about to give away 100 million books ― we’ll cross that line in the next few weeks ― and with the success of the two “Coat of Many Colors” movies, we really gained some new children fans from there. So it just hit me that that’s what I should do next musically.What’s different about writing and performing for children?Oh, well it’s completely different when you’re talking about children because you’re doing more of a teaching thing. I feel like I’m a child when I’m working on these songs. And I try to feel out what I think the kids need to hear or would like to hear.I have places for children ― for my nieces and nephews and friends ― all over my properties. Anywhere that I have land and houses. I’ve got stuff for kids. And I usually go up to one of the playhouses or tree houses or up to the playgrounds. And so I just have fun getting into playhouses and putting myself in their little minds. Just putting myself in their little world.How do kids respond to you?Oh they love me! I’m like Mother Goose to them. I’m like a cartoon character. I’m over-exaggerated with my look and my voice is over-exaggerated and high-pitched like a kid and I’m joyful with kids and they feel that, too. They feel that I love ’em.How do you have such a good rapport with kids?I grew up in a family of twelve, and there’s eight children younger than me. Me and my sisters were all like little second mothers to the kids growing under us, so I relate to children and they often ask me questions. You’d be surprised what a lot of my little nieces and nephews come to me and say, “Don’t tell mom, don’t tell mom” but they want to ask me something or tell me something and they don’t want me to tell their parents and I don’t! I just help them with whatever the problem is. And I know what to say because I’m a grownup and it’s usually their little things you can help them with easier than some grownup complicated problem. But it’s important to them. I know you have a lot of kids in your life with your siblings. Do you have any tips or tricks for dealing with kids?Well, yeah. I’m the perfect grandma, I’m the perfect aunt, I’m the perfect babysitter, because I don’t have children. So I bring them over to visit me by choice. They don’t get dumped on me. And when I do keep them, if they get out of line, all I have to do is imply that I’ll take them home or call their mom to come get them. Or sometimes if they’re really rowdy I’ll just say, “Now do you want me to call mom? You’re not happy now? You’re not happy here?

Time and time again, they tried to pass Trumpcare, which would have gutted not just the Affordable Care Act, but Medicaid as well. Every time, grassroots activists around the country responded with massive resistance. That resistance has been able to stop several iterations of Trumpcare.Having failed to pass a terrible health care repeal bill through legislative means, Trump is now taking a different tack. Yesterday, he announced that he would be taking several steps to undermine and sabotage the ACA. He will be cutting off the Affordable Care Act’s cost sharing payments, which will destabilize the insurance markets and lead to higher premiums for millions of Americans.The CBO reports that cutting off payments would increase premiums 25 percent by 2020 and cause 1 million Americans to become uninsured. But that’s not enough for Donald Trump. He has also issued an executive order that allows insurance companies to sell “garbage plans” that don’t cover pre-existing conditions or basic health care needs.This is a recipe for disaster in the ACA marketplaces. Trump’s elimination of the cost sharing payments will drive up premiums and could force many consumers to buy the new “garbage plans,” the only ones they can afford. But if they get sick or have an accident, those plans will fail them.Imagine going to the hospital with an injury such as a broken arm, only to learn that your insurance plan will not cover treatment. That’s the fate that awaits millions of Americans if Trump is allowed to get away with his sabotage. People aged 55-64 are particularly at risk, since 84 percent of them have a pre-existing condition.Congress has the ability to stop Trump’s sabotage by passing legislation that would ensure that the cost sharing payments are funded, stabilizing the marketplaces and bringing down premiums. The American people need to rise up, just as they did against Trumpcare, and demand that our elected officials do just that.Several Republican members of Congress, such as Rep. Tom Reed (R-NY), have already realized that if Trump is successful in destroying the ACA’s health care marketplaces, voters will know exactly who to blame. Those members have come out against Trump’s sabotage. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) and Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) are in the process of negotiating a bipartisan bill. But for a bill to pass, Republicans around the country need to hear just how angry the American people are.Call both of your senators and your representative today at 202-224-3121. Demand that they immediately pass legislation to stop Trump’s health care sabotage. Then, call back the next day and the day after that. Hammer home the message that any member of Congress who is complicit in Trump’s destruction of health care will face the consequences come election time. We the people stopped Trumpcare, and we the people can stop the sabotage."

Hers is a name left out of our high school textbooks, but a name that still lingers like a whisper in our history. She is one of the most riveting activists, not only in Latino history, but also in our nation’s history. Co-founder of the first farm workers union, all the while raising 11 children, Dolores relentlessly fought and continues to fight for social and labor justice for all.Watching the story of her life in the intimate film “Dolores” sparked the question: how has leadership in the Latino movement shifted? The film showed how Dolores’s ferocity inspired people to mobilize and fight for equality. Throughout the film, high-profile activists and leaders such as Angela Davis and Gloria Steinem raved about Dolores and what she meant to the movement.With technology ― particularly, social media ― a surge of young Latino activists are more connected than ever before, making it easier for us spread action and awareness. What did not come with this surge was a face to the movement. Faces like Dolores Huerta and Cesar Chavez.It’s not hard to recognize powerhouses within the black community such as Representative Maxine Waters, commentator Angela Rye, former NFL player Colin Kaepernick, Shaun King and Van Jones to name a few. And let us not forget the cream of the crop: the Obamas.Which begs the question: does our community of 57 million Latinos need to have highly-publicized figures in order to make progress?Although there aren’t many Latinos who are popular within mainstream media it does not mean we don’t have leadership within our community.That leadership is in Jorge Ramos, one of the most trusted journalists of all time, broadcasting our stories for decades into the homes of millions across the United States and around the world.It’s in San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz Soto for standing up to the president and demanding relief for our people (American citizens might I add) who were affected by Hurricane Maria, all the while wading through sewage and searching for survivors.It’s in the 800,000 Dreamers tirelessly fighting for their right to not only to stay in this country that they call their home, but also to be respected as human beings.It’s in Undocumedia, a platform that uses digital and social media to highlight the stories of undocumented immigrants and raised money to cover over a hundred DACA renewal applications.It’s in Carmen Perez, the national co-chair of the Women’s March, which was one of the largest marches in American history and drew in over five million people across the globe.It’s in the Latino who bravely pushes through their career in a new city to carve a space for other Latinos to follow and feel more comfortable than they did themselves.It’s in the first-generation college student who is pulling all-nighters to study, trying to become the first in their family to graduate with a degree.That leader is within you and me.A movement relies on more than one person. Even Dolores Huerta had the entire pueblo rallying behind her. All we need to do is look within ourselves to lead our movement."

Corker is a sitting senator, a Republican, and the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, one of the most influential committees in Washington. In the same interview, Sen. Corker said, “I know for a fact that every single day at the White House it’s a situation of trying to contain him.”In August, Corker told reporters in Tennessee that Trump “has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability, nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful.” And over the weekend, in response to a barrage of Trump insults on Twitter, Corker responded that it was a “shame the “White House has become an adult day care center.”I must confess the emotions I felt when I watched Sen. Corker tell reporters, “I think Secretary Tillerson, Secretary Mattis, and Chief of Staff Kelly are those people who help separate our country from chaos” — I was afraid for my own children, and all children in the U.S., including those whose parents voted for Donald Trump.All of our children are in great jeopardy now, because of Donald Trump’s serious intellectual incapacities, dangerous emotional immaturity, and an amorality which suggests a complete moral emptiness and a lack of any ability to make moral judgements.Now this intellectual, emotional, and moral failure as a human being has his finger on the nuclear button. And that is the greatest threat to America and to the world today. Will other senators stand up for their country and our national security, as Sen. Corker has? How many Bob Corkers are there — how many Republicans will continue to make their Faustian bargain with a president who will promote the economic interests of their wealthy donors?And will America’s religious leaders stand up and speak for the nation against the threats that a President Trump now poses? Or will they make their own Faustian bargains with the president who gives them access and influence into a state newly committed to their “religious right” political agendas — devoid of any concerns for the poor, racial justice, refugees and immigrants, the environment or, indeed, the Christian call to peace-making and conflict resolution.President Trump reportedly told national security officials in July that he wanted to increase the U.S. nuclear arsenal tenfold — and this week, has threatened NBC News for reporting the story, suggesting they should lose their “licenses” to report the news. So the well-documented story on the nuclear threat Trump poses has now turned into another presidential threat, this time to the First Amendment. Here, as with this nation’s nuclear policies, Donald Trump seems not to understand. Complaining about press coverage is a long-standing presidential habit, but no American president has ever so blatantly attacked the press and so directly challenged the First Amendment to the Constitution.After hearing that the stockpile of U.S. nuclear weapons has been steadily reduced by international treaties and mutual nuclear obligations — something most Americans, let alone national political leaders from both parties, already knew — Trump was upset, and said he wanted to increase our stockpile to 1960s levels, as well as increasing troop levels and other military equipment.The NBC story describes a meeting in which top civilian and military national security leaders of the United States set out to, in the words of one official, “…slow down a little and explain the whole world” to the president of the United States. This meeting “included a number of tense exchanges.” (Reportedly, it was after this meeting that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson referred to Trump as a “moron.”)This is a president who during the campaign suggested that more countries ought to have nuclear weapons. Yet he has made a large number of bizarre and contradictory statements on nuclear weapons since launching his campaign. Joe Scarborough reported last summer that while in a foreign policy briefing, Trump asked three times why the U.S. can’t use nuclear weapons, since we have them. He then made a similar argument in an interview with Chris Matthews on Hardball.It is time for Christian concern to step in here. The first thing we should do is thank Sen. Corker for his courage and conscience in standing up to Trump’s dangerous statements and professed intentions. Here’s how you can do that: Tell the senator — by calling, writing to, or tweeting at him — that you are a Christian who shares his “concern” for the country.The second thing you can do is contact your own senators — call the Capitol Switchboard at (202) 224-3121 and ask to be connected — and say you agree with Sen. Corker that if this presidential behavior continues, the U.S. Senate — Democrats and Republicans — must act to “contain” the president and limit his ability to press the nuclear button. A nuclear decision-making process and procedure that was built for speed should now be changed to account for rationality and wisdom, in the face of a president who has demonstrated neither capacity.For decades, Sojourners helped to lead broad national campaigns to stop and reverse the nuclear arms race. Christians and other people of faith were the animating core of the U.S. anti-nuclear movement. Sojourners helped initiate and lead the nuclear weapons “freeze” campaign, convened services around the country and in the nation’s capital, and organized massive protests including civil disobedience in Washington and nationwide. Our “Peace Pentecost” civil disobedience action in the U.S. Capitol in 1983, focused on first-strike nuclear weapons, lead to 242 arrests, the largest civil disobedience since the Vietnam War. We joined and co-sponsored actions at the Nevada nuclear test site and at nuclear weapons facilities across the country. And we produced fact sheets, theological reflections, and study guides — from “A Matter of Faith” to “Waging Peace” — to help educate U.S. churches about nuclear weapons and bring biblical and theological substance to the debates.A few weeks ago, Sojourners friend and columnist Wes Granberg-Michaelson wrote: “What’s at stake here is the possibility of a nuclear conflagration which seems more threatening than at any other time since the Cuban Missile Crisis. Instead of quiet, earnest diplomacy exploring every option to prevent this, we’ve heard cataclysmic threats and taunts from President Trump… past U.S. presidents have recognized that peace isn’t advanced by escalating taunts and insults.”Given the imminent danger and the demonstrated intellectual, emotional, and moral incapacities of President Trump, Sojourners is committed to help bring the present danger of nuclear weapons back into the center of our national conversation. We have claimed, along with many other Christian leaders, that our response to the unique peril of nuclear weapons is a matter or faith, not just politics. It still is; and it is time to respond again. This is an obligation of those who would follow Jesus, the one who instructs us to be peacemakers whom he calls the children of God.As Father Richard McSorley of Georgetown University wrote years ago, “It’s a sin to build a nuclear weapon.” We once put that on a poster. Perhaps it’s time to put the poster back up.Jim Wallis is president of Sojourners. His book, America’s Original Sin: Racism, White Privilege, and the Bridge to a New America, is available now. "

The Indiana mom and photographer staged a fun Wonder Woman-themed photo shoot with her 11-month-old daughter, Liliana. “Like all moms I love photographing special moments of my babies, but I guess since I’m a professional photographer I take things to the next level and am always trying to think creatively and outside the box,” Pingoy told HuffPost. “So I thought up this shoot wanting to pay homage to the most recent movie and have fun with my baby girl. With help from seamstress Johanna Medrano, Pingoy transformed Liliana into Wonder Woman and photographed her outside near their home in a quick 30 minute shoot. “We just had fun,” said the mom. Liliana was only 10 months old at the time of the shoot and could only stand with support, so one of Pingoy’s friends held her up (and was later Photoshopped out of the pictures). “Though it seemed like Liliana was mimicking scenes from the movie, those moments were not posed and just happened organically,” said the photographer. “Then I just found the best shots of Liliana to pair up side by side next to Gal Gadot’s shots.”Pingoy said the experience was extra special because Liliana is her first daughter and her “Wonder Baby,” born after two miscarriages. “It just tickled me to see my baby girl as Wonder Woman because I also dressed up as her as a little girl,” she explained. “I’ve always had a love for Wonder Woman and growing up with two brothers of my own, there were never many girl superheroes to choose from. When I dressed up and pretended to be Wonder Woman I remember feeling an inner strength come over me and I was ready to conquer and fight all the bad guys.” Pingoy told HuffPost she believes Wonder Woman is a beautiful example of bravery and sacrificial love in the way she risks her life to save others and does what’s right no matter the cost. “I want my daughter to know that she is special and has a great purpose, that she can help change the world by her goodness and her love, that she can dream up any dream and accomplish it, and that she’s beautiful and strong and called to be the good in this world that is so desperately needed,” said Pingoy. “As Diana says in the movie, ‘Only love can save this world.’”Pingoy also has three sons, 7-year-old Gabriel, 6-year-old Jonah and 4-year-old Benjamin, and she plans to dress them up as Justice League characters alongside their sister. The photographer posted her pictures of Liliana as Wonder Woman on her Facebook page, where they quickly reached the attention of several parenting sites. Pingoy said she’s been overwhelmed by the response. “It’s been a whirlwind this week, and we’ve been super excited and proud of our little one,” said the mom. “We want the world to know most of all how precious this baby is for us. She is special to our whole family. Her brothers adore her, and her dad is wrapped around her little finger.”Following the unexpected attention, Pingoy has a new dream ― to have Liliana meet “Wonder Woman"" star Gal Gadot. “I want to thank her for being a good role model and how she is inspiring many girls out there,” said Pingoy. “And also the way she is a dedicated wife and mother in real life is also inspiring for other moms like me out there.”Whether or not she gets to meet Gadot, Pingoy hopes her photos bring a smile to people’s faces and brighten up their days. Said the mom, “Our baby is a blessing who brings so much joy to our hearts and I’m so grateful that we get to share that joy with the world.”"

When I dressed up and pretended to be Wonder Woman I remember feeling an inner strength come over me and I was ready to conquer and fight all the bad guys.” Pingoy told HuffPost she believes Wonder Woman is a beautiful example of bravery and sacrificial love in the way she risks her life to save others and does what’s right no matter the cost. “I want my daughter to know that she is special and has a great purpose, that she can help change the world by her goodness and her love, that she can dream up any dream and accomplish it, and that she’s beautiful and strong and called to be the good in this world that is so desperately needed,” said Pingoy. “As Diana says in the movie, ‘Only love can save this world.’”Pingoy also has three sons, 7-year-old Gabriel, 6-year-old Jonah and 4-year-old Benjamin, and she plans to dress them up as Justice League characters alongside their sister. The photographer posted her pictures of Liliana as Wonder Woman on her Facebook page, where they quickly reached the attention of several parenting sites. Pingoy said she’s been overwhelmed by the response. “It’s been a whirlwind this week, and we’ve been super excited and proud of our little one,” said the mom. “We want the world to know most of all how precious this baby is for us. She is special to our whole family. Her brothers adore her, and her dad is wrapped around her little finger.”Following the unexpected attention, Pingoy has a new dream ― to have Liliana meet “Wonder Woman"" star Gal Gadot. “I want to thank her for being a good role model and how she is inspiring many girls out there,” said Pingoy. “And also the way she is a dedicated wife and mother in real life is also inspiring for other moms like me out there.”Whether or not she gets to meet Gadot, Pingoy hopes her photos bring a smile to people’s faces and brighten up their days. Said the mom, “Our baby is a blessing who brings so much joy to our hearts and I’m so grateful that we get to share that joy with the world.”"

45,POLITICS,How Republicans Could Hike Taxes On The Poor,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/eitc-tax-reform_us_59dfcfafe4b0a52aca16a28d,"A key tax credit for working people is being singled out for ""fraud.""",2017-10-13,Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas) announces a tax reform proposal with Republican House and Senate leaders on Sept. 27.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59dfd19b2d0000971730a11c.jpeg?ops=crop_0_168_5193_3106%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump says his tax reform plan will help working people, but Republicans are mulling a clampdown on the only part of the tax code that specifically benefits low-income workers. The earned income tax credit provides a big wage bonus for parents who earn modest incomes, and about 28 million households benefited from the credit in 2015. It was created in 1975 and has been expanded half a dozen times. But Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which oversees taxes, said some households that have received the credit should not have. And his committee wants to make sure they won’t in the future. “We’re looking at provisions that reduce or eliminate the fraud in that system, which is unfortunately far too prevalent,” Brady told HuffPost on Wednesday. Brady cited the high rate of improper payments on the EITC, which can result if people either deliberately or mistakenly misreported their income. Of the $68 billion claimed in 2015, the IRS has said $15.6 billion of those payments, or about 23 percent, were improper.But the weird thing about singling out improper EITC payments is that they represent a relatively small part of government’s failure to enforce the tax code. The difference between what people owed the IRS and what the agency managed to collect averaged $458 billion a year from 2008 through 2010, or about an 18 percent gap, according to the most recent data available. The single biggest contribution to this “tax gap” was people underreporting business income on their individual returns ― which added up to $125 billion in lost tax revenue each year.While Republicans want to crack down on the number of people who can claim the earned income tax credit, their tax plan would sharply reduce the tax rate for such “pass-through” business income ― so-called because it passes from a business to an owner’s or partner’s individual return. Reducing the rate would benefit the estimated 38 million households that report pass-through income, and experts say the lower rate would lead to many more pass-through filers, even though the IRS has so much trouble collecting on it already. HuffPost asked Brady if that was fair. “We want fraud out of the tax system, period,” he said, adding that the EITC and the child tax credit contribute the “largest fraud amounts.”An additional problem is that, since the proposed pass-through rate would be lower than the highest marginal rate for regular income, the difference would give high earners a strong incentive to falsely reclassify their wages as business profits. Republicans haven’t said how they’d address this problem, but Brady said they would try to “hold the pass-through rates true to true businesses in that area.”What makes business-tax avoidance kosher while improper cash refunds to low-income parents a “fraud” basically comes down to ideology. Republicans are very much against the idea of any “welfare” program giving money to people who don’t qualify for it. They consider the EITC to be welfare because it is both a tax break and a cash assistance program that lifts millions of Americans out of poverty every year. (Though a key difference between the EITC and any other welfare program is that people without any work income are categorically ineligible for the EITC.) “It’s intended to be a program that supplements parental work effort,” Robert Rector, a policy expert with the conservative Heritage Foundation, said in an interview. “If you have extensive fraud and erroneous payments, that basic idea of rewarding and complementing parental work breaks down.”A significant portion of the erroneous payments, however, is not intentional. Claiming the credit can be a bit complicated, since the size of the payout rises with income but begins phasing out at different thresholds depending on the number of children in a household. If a married couple with three kids earn less than $23,000, they can get a tax credit payment of $6,318, with the size of the credit falling to zero as the couple’s income approaches $54,000. Past studies cited by the Congressional Research Service have suggested most of the errors result from honest mistakes, such as separated parents both claiming the same dependents. Another source of EITC errors is paid tax preparers, who help file a majority of EITC claims. People might also be making honest mistakes when they incorrectly report their business income, but members of Congress generally don’t consider avoiding business taxes and receiving an overpayment for earned wages equal.“There is a strong intuition on the part of a lot of people ― not just Republican members of Congress ― that a person’s receiving a dollar too much from the government is somehow more objectionable than another person’s underpaying his tax by a dollar,” Larry Zelenak, a tax professor at Duke University Law School, said in an email. “Of course, either way the government is out one dollar to which it was entitled, so the intuition flies in the face of the notion that a dollar is a dollar.” The Republican tax framework released last month didn’t mention the earned income tax credit, but a budget resolution that passed the House last week includes language requiring the IRS to verify the income of all EITC filers. The budget is a key part of the tax process, since passing it allows the Senate to approve accompanying legislation with only 51 yes votes. The Heritage Foundation has estimated that verifying income and other antifraud provisions could save the government $6.6 billion. But it would also be a huge task ― essentially subjecting any low-income family that applies for it to an audit.The loss of a tax benefit is often considered a tax increase. That’s why House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and White House economic advisory Gary Cohn have conceded that some middle class Americans could face a tax increase under their plan due to the loss of personal exemptions and itemized deductions. Limiting the number of people who benefit from the EITC would be tantamount to hiking taxes on relatively poor working families.HuffPost readers: Have you ever been audited over an EITC claim? Tell us about it ― email arthur@huffpost.com. Please include your phone number if you’re willing to be interviewed.The IRS already devotes a disproportionate amount of effort toward combating EITC errors, with more than 400,000 of the 1.2 million audits last year targeting EITC claims from taxpayers making less than $25,000 a year, according to IRS data. In 2015, Congress directed the agency to delay all refunds for tax returns claiming the credit.The government doesn’t get a very good return on its investment for all that effort, said Elaine Maag, an expert at the Tax Policy Center. It’s an especially poor investment considering how much more the IRS could recoup by targeting higher-income filers, according to the Government Accountability Office. “When money goes out the door errantly, it often goes out to other poor families, so it’s very difficult to recover,” Maag said.

Since then, dozens of women have come forward with new allegations of sexual harassment, assault and rape against the film executive. Spurred by these reports, men and women in other industries are speaking out about their own experiences with sexual harassment or abuse. Cameron Russell, a model and prominent climate change activist known for her viral Ted Talk, is sharing the stories of other models who say they have been subject to abuse by photographers, casting agents, designers or other powerful gatekeepers. Russell started posting the anonymous messages after a model friend, prompted by the Weinstein allegations, reached out to her.“She wants to encourage other women to speak up,” Russell wrote on Instagram of her friend. “We need a way to begin breaking the silence while remaining protected. We are not talking about one, five, or even twenty men. We are talking about a culture of exploitation and it must stop.”She added, “How often have you heard ‘this is art’ or ‘this is a creative field’ as an excuse to glorify oppressive and even violent behavior?”Using Russell’s hashtag, #MyJobShouldNotIncludeAbuse, models shared stories of being asked to perform oral sex, being sexually assaulted by photographers and being made to strip nude or dance naked for shoots or casting calls, among other examples. Russell, who has not yet responded to requests for comment sent to her representatives, blocked out any names of people accused. Still, the account provides a snapshot of an industry that has been rife with predators for decades. Russell also talked about her own experience with abuse from people on the job, and explained why she did not speak out at the time. “On many occasions I’ve been called a feminist for reporting unwanted groping, spanking, pinching, pressure for dates, phone calls and texts of a sexual nature, lack of appropriate changing areas, etc,” she wrote on Instagram. “And because the response has always been ‘Are you surprised?’ or ‘That’s part of the job,’ I tolerated them. When the offenses were bigger, calling them out is terrifying, and demands a level of exposure and backlash to what is already painful and sometimes shameful,” she said. Weinstein—whose representatives have denied the allegations or said he considered the incidents to be consensual—was fired from his production company on Oct. 8 and is now reportedly on his way to treatment for sex addiction in Arizona.Russell’s efforts to encourage models to share their stories of abuse will hopefully help put an end to a culture that allows sexual abuse to go unchecked.Need help?

Earlier this month at an interview with AOL’s Build series, Fisher chatted about her children’s book titled Marge in Charge, which is part of her series about a quirky babysitter named Marge who takes care of two kids, Jemima and Jake Button.In the interview, Fisher explained that she wrote the books to promote child literacy and that the idea for Marge came from running out of ideas at bedtime with her kids.“There are only so many times you can act out Peppa Pig or do impressions of your children’s friends’ parents,” she joked. She also said she gets direct inspiration and feedback from the many kids ― her own with comedian Sacha Baron Cohen and her nieces ― she’s lucky enough to have in her life. “I’m around tiny people all the time,” she said, adding later, “I let them guide the stories.”"

Days before the First Communion service on Oct. 1, school administrators and the parish’s priest, Rev. Sammie L. Maletta, reportedly told Cady’s parents that if their daughter wanted to wear the suit, she couldn’t receive First Communion rites along with the rest of her classmates.Instead, she’d have to conform to the church’s dress code by wearing a skirt, or taking part in a private ceremony ― options that wouldn’t allow Cady to come church feeling accepted just as she is.When the child heard the news, Mansell said her daughter was heartbroken. “She was very upset and very hurt,” the mom said.For the little girl who dreams of one day becoming an altar server at her church, this was a big deal.“More so than the suit, Cady was excited to make her First Communion,” Mansell said. “She felt that it was one step closer to being a full member of the church, and one step closer to being an altar server.” Catholicism has always been a part of Mansell’s life. Her own mother is a former Catholic nun who left the convent after feeling that the Holy Spirit was calling her to be a parent. Raised as a “cradle Catholic,” Mansell said that it’s very important to her that her daughter is brought up in the Catholic church and participates in the church’s sacraments. The last straw for the Mansells came when the parish priest reportedly accused her and her husband of being bad parents during a private meeting.“He said [Cady] doesn’t have the mental development and maturity to decide what she wants to wear,” Mansell said. “He said you’re raising your daughter wrong and that you’re the parents, she is supposed to follow the rules. If you tell her to wear a dress, she should be wearing a dress.”“For him to have that kind of judgement about what kind of parent I am enraged me,” Mansell said ― especially since the priest was not a physician, psychologist, or even a parent.In an email to HuffPost, a representative from St. John the Evangelist Parish told HuffPost that parents were first made aware of the fact that girls were required to wear traditional white dresses in mid-August. Another notice handed out on Sept. 23 confirmed this and added that girls’ dresses shouldn’t be sleeveless. A statement from the parish attested that this dress code had been in place for years and “is consistent with Catholic tradition for decades.” The parish compared the dress code to the requirements made of a student athlete at a game or a band member at a concert. “St. John the Evangelist uniformly enforces dress codes at our parish school and for religious rites. We have requests for exceptions to the dress code every year, ranging from sneakers to the color of one’s shirt; thus, we have consistently chosen to adhere to the dress code rather than allowing a myriad of exceptions to it. The dress code provides consistency between all students and ensures the focus of First Communion is on Jesus Christ rather than attire,” the parish said in its statement. “It is important for our children to understand that there are certain expectations they will need to comply with, in some capacity, throughout their lives. Dress codes on sports teams, in schools and in the workplace are all realities of everyday life.”Mansell said that in March, Cady was able to wear a jumpsuit and a sweater during another important Catholic ceremony ― her First Reconciliation ― while the other girls in her group wore dresses. Mansell added that Cady has never expressed anything that signals she has a diverse gender identity or sexuality ― although the child does have a vague understanding of what those things are. Her daughter shouldn’t be pigeonholed, Mansell said.After the priest’s comments about their parenting, the Mansells decided to leave the parish they had attended for five years and enroll their children in a different Catholic school within the same diocese. Mansell said the new school and parish community has been very accepting. Through it all, Mansell said Cady has remained “incredibly resilient.” And her daughter is still looking forward to receiving her First Communion and becoming an altar server one day.“I don’t think that this has changed any of her ideas about Catholicism, which is my biggest fear,” Mansell said. “My first hope is that she understands that this one experience with this one priest and this one parish does not define Catholicism.

Maletta, reportedly told Cady’s parents that if their daughter wanted to wear the suit, she couldn’t receive First Communion rites along with the rest of her classmates.Instead, she’d have to conform to the church’s dress code by wearing a skirt, or taking part in a private ceremony ― options that wouldn’t allow Cady to come church feeling accepted just as she is.When the child heard the news, Mansell said her daughter was heartbroken. “She was very upset and very hurt,” the mom said.For the little girl who dreams of one day becoming an altar server at her church, this was a big deal.“More so than the suit, Cady was excited to make her First Communion,” Mansell said. “She felt that it was one step closer to being a full member of the church, and one step closer to being an altar server.” Catholicism has always been a part of Mansell’s life. Her own mother is a former Catholic nun who left the convent after feeling that the Holy Spirit was calling her to be a parent. Raised as a “cradle Catholic,” Mansell said that it’s very important to her that her daughter is brought up in the Catholic church and participates in the church’s sacraments. The last straw for the Mansells came when the parish priest reportedly accused her and her husband of being bad parents during a private meeting.“He said [Cady] doesn’t have the mental development and maturity to decide what she wants to wear,” Mansell said. “He said you’re raising your daughter wrong and that you’re the parents, she is supposed to follow the rules. If you tell her to wear a dress, she should be wearing a dress.”“For him to have that kind of judgement about what kind of parent I am enraged me,” Mansell said ― especially since the priest was not a physician, psychologist, or even a parent.In an email to HuffPost, a representative from St. John the Evangelist Parish told HuffPost that parents were first made aware of the fact that girls were required to wear traditional white dresses in mid-August. Another notice handed out on Sept. 23 confirmed this and added that girls’ dresses shouldn’t be sleeveless. A statement from the parish attested that this dress code had been in place for years and “is consistent with Catholic tradition for decades.” The parish compared the dress code to the requirements made of a student athlete at a game or a band member at a concert. “St. John the Evangelist uniformly enforces dress codes at our parish school and for religious rites. We have requests for exceptions to the dress code every year, ranging from sneakers to the color of one’s shirt; thus, we have consistently chosen to adhere to the dress code rather than allowing a myriad of exceptions to it. The dress code provides consistency between all students and ensures the focus of First Communion is on Jesus Christ rather than attire,” the parish said in its statement. “It is important for our children to understand that there are certain expectations they will need to comply with, in some capacity, throughout their lives. Dress codes on sports teams, in schools and in the workplace are all realities of everyday life.”Mansell said that in March, Cady was able to wear a jumpsuit and a sweater during another important Catholic ceremony ― her First Reconciliation ― while the other girls in her group wore dresses. Mansell added that Cady has never expressed anything that signals she has a diverse gender identity or sexuality ― although the child does have a vague understanding of what those things are. Her daughter shouldn’t be pigeonholed, Mansell said.After the priest’s comments about their parenting, the Mansells decided to leave the parish they had attended for five years and enroll their children in a different Catholic school within the same diocese. Mansell said the new school and parish community has been very accepting. Through it all, Mansell said Cady has remained “incredibly resilient.” And her daughter is still looking forward to receiving her First Communion and becoming an altar server one day.“I don’t think that this has changed any of her ideas about Catholicism, which is my biggest fear,” Mansell said. “My first hope is that she understands that this one experience with this one priest and this one parish does not define Catholicism. It was just not the right fit for us. And that’s okay.”"

But the truth is, corsets have made their return with a vengeance. Even the queen is on board.Queen Beyoncé, that is. In true Bey fashion, she shared three consecutive photos on Instagram Thursday of the same recent outfit: Black bell bottoms, a billowing off-the-shoulder crop top and a beige corset with hip pads.It’s a pretty outrageous look ― most recent iterations of the corset trend we’ve seen haven’t also involved a crop top, for example ― but if anyone is going to pull this elaborate outfit off, it’s Beyoncé.Beyoncé has been all about corsets. She often wears them for performances, and who could forget this interesting number from Vh1′s “Big in ’03” awards ceremony? We’re guessing everybody, but good luck losing this visual now. Corsets are easier to pull off for celebrities than they are for the average person in normal life. But we can’t say Bey doesn’t make it look slightly more intriguing than usual. "

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59e0eef11500004800da1551.jpeg?cache=3Zafa1epHl&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When Twitter temporarily suspended actress Rose McGowan’s account on Thursday (reportedly due to violating rules), some women on Twitter responded with a boycott.Software engineer Kelly Ellis suggested in a tweet sent Thursday that #WomenBoycottTwitter in solidarity with McGowan (who recently alleged on Twitter that Harvey Weinstein raped her) and “all the victims of hate and harassment Twitter fails to support.”Celebrities including Alyssa Milano, Chrissy Teigen, Anna Paquin, Mark Ruffalo, Terry Crews, Joss Whedon and Michael Ian Black were among some of the high-profile Twitter users who joined the pledge on Friday. While many were willing to go silent in support of the boycott, some women have criticized the tactic of women silencing themselves during a time when their voices should be amplified more than ever:Women of color have been some of the biggest critics of the hashtag and boycott, questioning why they should join when similar issues of harassment against black and brown women on Twitter (including Jemele Hill and Leslie Jones) have gone largely unnoticed by their white peers. Director Ava DuVernay was among the dozens of black women who tweeted about the conflict that the hashtag caused Friday: The effectiveness (or lack thereof) of the boycott has certainly been a distraction from the far larger issue of institutionalized sexism and abuse in the film industry and beyond. But the concerns of women of color do raise some pretty important points about how to tackle this issue moving forward. Black women face oppression and abuse at the intersection of race and gender on a daily basis. While McGowan’s silencing may be a rallying moment for many white women, black women who face similar silencing and harassment on Twitter and other social media platforms every day have a different, though just as valid, perspective. As HuffPost writer Julia Craven more succinctly put it on Twitter, after someone called her out for only identifying as black and not a woman:The criticism, for what it’s worth, has led to some positives. The hashtag #WOCAffirmation (created by Reign of April on Twitter) began trending Friday as a way to amplify the voices and perspectives of marginalized women. "

Indoor air pollution isn't always as visible as outdoor pollution. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59e0ce4b200000d5540869d4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I never knew that indoor air quality could be an issue until I moved to New York City from Northern California in 2009.After settling into my shoebox-sized Manhattan apartment, I discovered that my elderly neighbor across the hall spent most of his time chain-smoking with his door open. Clouds of smoke poured into our hallway and seeped under my door. As a freelance writer, I’d spend hours sitting at my desk, trying to work, and struggling to breathe. It was a bumpy introduction to big-city living. But what I hadn’t realized was that I was far from alone in suffering from poor air quality inside my home. Most of us are familiar with the kind of air pollution caused by car exhaust or wildfires. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency found that indoor air can be anywhere from two to five times as polluted as outdoor air. Household air pollution is one of the world’s greatest environmental health risks, according to the World Health Organization. In fact, a 2012 WHO study found that complications from breathing dirty indoor air are responsible for 4.3 million premature deaths each year, mostly in developing countries, where billions of people burn coal or wood to fuel indoor cooking.Indoor air pollution “is one of the unrecognized environmental justice issues of our time,” according to Jonathan Levy, an environmental health professor at Boston University’s School of Public Health. He researches air pollution and equity issues in urban areas, and he notes that the homes of low-income families or public housing units tend to be smaller or not as structurally sound, and will have more indoor air pollution as a result. While some sources of pollution are out of your hands, plenty of others are a result of factors you can control. Knowing what they are is the first step to improving air quality in your home.“People are not as aware of indoor air pollution,” Levy says. “If you say ‘air pollution’ to someone, they think about the large factory or the diesel vehicle, and they don’t necessarily think about what is happening inside their homes.”While outdoor air pollution can certainly make its way indoors through open windows or cracks in poorly sealed buildings, one of the biggest sources of dirty household air actually comes from cooking or anything involving combustion ― that is, lighting something on fire ― says Gary Adamkiewicz, a professor of environmental health and exposure disparities at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. That’s because when you light up natural gas on a stove, it releases compounds like nitrogen dioxide and carbon dioxide, pollutants that are also released by fuel-burning cars and are regulated by the EPA because they irritate the lungs. So if a stove doesn’t have a good ventilation system (usually in the form of a range hood) that can push the cooking fumes outside, home-dwellers will have to breathe it. A 2014 study from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory actually found that 60 percent of Southern California homes had stoves that were so poorly ventilated that they made the indoor air even more polluted than the levels the EPA has ruled as safe for outdoors. Indoor smoking is also a huge source of household pollution, as I was unfortunate enough to learn. My neighbor eventually agreed to close his door, which was a relief, because a little paranoid Googling had yielded scary stats on what’s known as “thirdhand smoke”— when particles of nicotine and other tobacco byproducts will actually stick to the walls, rugs, and other surfaces long after the cigarette has been put out. When it’s mixed into household dust and other toxins in the air, thirdhand smoke may cause cancer, though scientists say more research needs to be done.  “What happens in a home in terms of your exposure to environmental pollutants is, in many ways, hidden,” Adamkiewicz says.And that’s certainly the case when it comes to the cleaning products, air fresheners, and personal care products we keep inside our homes. The non-profit Environmental Working Group tested over 2,000 cleaning products, and found that many of them contain chemicals that are linked to asthma, allergies, or even cancer. EWG found that, because product manufacturers aren’t required to disclose all their ingredients, many of them don’t. So, there’s a lot we still don’t know.Many air fresheners, for example, contain phthalates, which mimic certain hormones found naturally in the body and can potentially disrupt the body’s endocrine or reproductive systems. Another 2012 peer-reviewed study of 50 different categories of household products conducted by the Silent Spring Institute, a nonprofit environmental health research group, found that everything from cosmetics to personal care products were made with materials that either caused asthma or were endocrine disruptors. (A list of the specific products tested is here.)“For most consumers, they just assume that if a product is on the shelf, then all the right questions have been asked and answered about it,” Adamkiewicz says. “And that’s not necessarily the case.”Both experts we spoke to said consumers should try to limit the sources of pollution they have control over, like scented candles and cigarette smoke, and to make sure the home has proper ventilation in areas such as the kitchen. Portable air filters can be a good solution for cleaning indoor air, as long as it has a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, meaning it can rid the air of the tiny particles that can get caught in the lungs, which exacerbate asthma and are linked to heart attacks. Vacuums can be made with HEPA filters, too. When it comes to buying cleaning or personal care products, read the lists of ingredients, and avoid the ones containing phthalates, formaldehyde, flame retardants, bisphenol A (found in plastics), or perfluorinated chemicals (found in non-stick pans or stain-resistant furniture). You can check the EWG’s cleaning product database here. Oh, and don’t smoke indoors!“You can’t necessarily eliminate these things,” says Levy of most indoor pollution sources. “It’s just about awareness, thoughtfulness, and really trying to be clever where you have the choice in alternative product use.”"

Ricardo Rossello at a press briefing in Puerto Rico on Oct. 3.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59dffc2d1500004800da13b0.jpeg?cache=UanIHpQJAy&ops=crop_171_132_2453_2167%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico ― Hours after President Donald Trump seemingly threatened to withdraw federal and military assistance from Puerto Rico in a series of tweets Thursday, Gov. Ricardo Rosselló called the White House.“I got confirmation that that was not going to happen,” the Puerto Rican governor told HuffPost during a sit-down interview Thursday.More than three weeks after Hurricane Maria devastated the U.S. territory, its more than 3.4 million residents are largely without power, and many lack access to drinking water. Trump’s comments regarding federal aid on the island were disconcerting for Rosselló, who quickly sought clarification from White House Chief of Staff John Kelly.On Thursday morning, Trump tweeted about the island’s lack of infrastructure and its financial crisis before the hurricane, then said Congress would soon decide “how much to spend” on relief efforts.“We cannot keep FEMA, the Military & the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever!” Trump tweeted.But Rosselló says the White House pledged its full support to the island in a phone conversation after the tweets.“The Stafford Act is very clear that once FEMA enters into a natural disaster such as this, they’re not leaving until the actions have been taken,” Rosselló told HuffPost. “I further spoke to the White House because I wanted clarity. I spoke to Gen. Kelly, and he reiterated that they were going to be here for Puerto Rico for the long haul.”Kelly also explained that Trump’s comments on Twitter were “more saying that recovery efforts that go quicker are better because the citizens get to normalcy quicker,” according to Rosselló.“But the truth of the matter is, what I want is results,” Rosselló added. “I won’t accept anything less than to be treated equal, as a U.S. citizen. Not for me and not for all my constituents in Puerto Rico.”When asked what he thought of a U.S. president even alluding to removing federal aid from the island, Rosselló said he felt “disconnected from the chat and fodder on Twitter.”“I need to focus on outcomes,” he told HuffPost. “So my main concern when those comments came out was: Is the White House going to fulfill, as they have in the past, their commitment to standing by Puerto Rico and treating U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico equally to U.S. citizens in Florida and in Texas? The White House confirmed that it was in a phone call and then later Gen. Kelly went on TV and said as much.“As long as I have clarity on what’s going on, I can either support the actions that are taken or I can denounce them and, of course, fight for equal rights for the people of Puerto Rico.”Rosselló asked Congress for more than $4 billion in federal aid and estimated there is $95 billion worth of damage on the island, according to a letter the governor sent to Congress and shared via Twitter on Monday. The U.S. House had approved $36.5 billion in emergency relief for Puerto Rico on Thursday.“I thank them for that,” Rosselló told HuffPost in response to the aid. “I think it’s a first important step, but certainly there’s a lot more to do. I will focus on the recovery. Doesn’t matter what the noise is.” While San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz and others have continually criticized the federal government’s response on the Caribbean island, Rosselló has often expressed gratitude toward federal efforts.Rosselló told HuffPost there are currently 14,000 active Department of Defense members and 2,000 FEMA employees in Puerto Rico ― and he feels that aid has arrived on the island quickly, considering the circumstances.“Remember, we have to put the context into the situation of Puerto Rico,” the governor explained. “Every time I’ve petitioned something, prior to the storm and after the storm, [federal government officials] were quick to answer. The reality is that in the onset of the storm we had no access to ports. This was a full devastation of the whole island of Puerto Rico.“We already had a weak grid, we already had weak infrastructure, and when it went right through, it devastated the whole of the island. So, was there a quick response within the circumstances? Yes, there was.”But when asked point blank if he felt all the help from FEMA and the federal government was “enough,” the governor replied, “No, it’s not enough.”“Assets are being deployed. They are taking action. Can we do more? Of course. Do we need to do more? The answer is yes, and that’s why we’ll keep on pressing and keep on looking for all of the assets, all of the help from the federal government.”"

Don't panic—here's how to find your way back into your account.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59e0ea561500002800da1529.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By David NieldBeing hacked can feel like a personal attack: You go to log into Facebook, or Gmail, or iCloud — and your password doesn’t work, leaving you unable to protect your most important online accounts. This worst-case scenario might bring on feelings of nausea and helplessness. Fortunately, you can take action in the face of digital vandalism. If you find yourself locked out of your accounts, major internet services have prepared a few routes for getting back in. As well as restoring your access, these companies help you limit the damage that a hacker can do.How do you know that someone else really has taken control of one of your accounts? Not being able to log in is a big clue — but if your password doesn’t work, don’t immediately assume you’ve been hacked. First, make sure the culprit is really a bad actor: For example, if you can’t get into your Facebook or Twitter account on your computer, try logging in on another device to see if you’ve really lost your access. Also make sure to double-check the password you’re typing before you start to suspect the worst.Another warning sign can come in the form of email. Many services will send you messages about suspicious activity, such as when somebody logs into your account from an unfamiliar computer (or an unfamiliar country), or when somebody changes your username or password. Make sure to check your inbox for emails like these. Also keep an eye out for messages from friends: If “you” have started sending them spam, they can alert you that your account was compromised.Once you realize you’ve been hacked, it’s time to roll up your sleeves and take back your account.Raise the alarmThe good news is that you have help: Google, Apple, Microsoft and other tech giants don’t want impostors to take over your online identities either, so they’ll try their best to restore your access. For example, in some cases where you can’t open your account, it’s because the company sensed suspicious activity and automatically locked everyone out.So when you suspect a hack, your first step is to tell the company. A quick web search, such as “Report Gmail hack,” should reveal the right place to explain your problem. Before you start entering information, make sure that the page you visit is the official recovery page. Check the URL to make sure the page is hosted on the correct web domain, such as google.com or apple.com, for the service you’re trying to access. We’ve also rounded up the recovery links for a few of the big players: For Google, report hacks here, for Apple here, and for Microsoft here.Once you report your issue, follow the instructions the app or service gives you — these will be tailored specifically for your account. Different programs employ different recovery methods, so you might have to confirm your phone number or backup email address, or answer personal questions — such as a few queries about your Facebook friends — to prove you are the real account owner.If you’re lucky, you can get back in pretty fast. That’s partially because today’s apps collect so much data about us that they can identify individuals through tidbits such as date of birth, phone number, location and more. However, getting back into your account isn’t the last step you need to take.Change your passwordsOnce you can log in once more — or if you could already access your account but have noticed suspicious activity — change your password to boot out any unwelcome visitors. The new code should be completely new; don’t recycle a past password or reuse the same string of letters and numbers that open another account. If you have been using that old password to access multiple accounts (which you really should not do!), change the password on your other accounts as well.Most online services let you see all the devices where you’re logged in. Hunt around the security settings until you find this page. Then, log out of all other sessions except the one you’re currently using. For example, you can visit this Facebook page and this Google page to log out of sessions you don’t recognize.While you’re poking around your account, review the other settings to make sure nothing has been changed. Look at your personal details, review any third-party apps connected to your account, and check your security questions and answers and your backup email addresses and/or phone numbers. If you think your hacker had a chance to scan your security questions and backup accounts, try to change these on the compromised account and on any other account that relies on the same information. This will prevent the bad actor from using your personal details to breach other accounts in the future.Speaking of other accounts, were your credit cards, bank accounts, or other financial programs connected to the compromised service? In this case, review your statements. If your hacker spent any of your money, you should try to claim back the cash as soon as possible — contact your bank directly and ask how to do this. While you’re checking for financial malfeasance, also review your account to see if the hacker added any unfamiliar payment methods or shipping addresses.Run security checksHaving recovered from a hacking attempt, you’ll want to protect against any future ones. So activate the security features designed to prevent attacks — for more details, you can follow our guide to protecting your online accounts. One of the most helpful measures is turning on two-step verification, where logging in requires a code sent to your phone, on top of the standard username and password. And specific services offer their own security features: Facebook, for example, lets you add a list of trusted friends who can verify your identity if you get hacked again. Turn on this option via the Security page in Settings.Next, try to find out how the hacker managed to access your account so you can prevent future incursions. This won’t always be possible; however, it can’t hurt to run a thorough virus and malware scan of your hard drive (in case that’s how the attacker got in). Before you start, update both your operating system and your antivirus package of choice. After you run the review, get a second opinion from a standalone scanner like Kaspersky Virus Scanner for macOS or Microsoft Safety Scanner for Windows.If the breach affected a service that includes email, such as your Google account, check the email account for sent messages or for new filters. For example, clever hackers can set up filters that forward all incoming mail to an address you don’t recognize. Delete such filters to prevent people from worming their way back into your account in the future. This is particularly important because you can reset many other accounts’ passwords, and receive notifications about suspicious activity, over email. You don’t want an eavesdropper to nab those recovery messages.In fact, even if only one account becomes compromised, you should consider all your main services breached.

Reinhart, who regularly posts updates about her life on Tumblr, bravely penned an emotional story about being sexually harassed by an older co-worker when she was just a teenager. The two met while working together on a project and developed a flirtation despite their age difference. They even went out on a date, but she left feeling “completely violated” after he tried to force himself on her. “He was incredibly charming and charismatic — we flirted for a while before we went on our first date,” the 21-year-old actress explained. “He was pretty significantly older than me, but I thought of myself as mature so it didn’t seem like a big deal.”“All that matters is that he tried to force himself on me when we were on a date,” she continued. “I had to stop him and say ‘no, I don’t want that,’ and ‘I can’t do that.’” Reinhart said she had to walk away to prevent the situation from going further.“I remember feeling like this was a scene right out of a horror movie,” she added.Despite her insistence on wanting to be taken home, the individual started driving back to his apartment instead, where Reinhart suspected he planned to take advantage of her. “If I made it there, something bad was going to happen to me,” she continued. “I told him to drop me off at my home, that I didn’t want to go back to his place. He said some snarky comment but reluctantly brought me to where I was staying.”Reinhart purposefully doesn’t mention the perpetrator by name, writing that she didn’t comfortable or believe it’s necessary, but reveals she confronted him the next day about how “how wrong it felt.”“This guy proceeded to tell me that it was my fault for leading him on. Saying that ‘I seemed like a sexual girl and that I’d be down for it,’” Reinhart wrote.The actress said that the individual later became angry and defensive, “claiming that I was ‘a tease’ and ‘the most manipulative woman he’d ever met,’” she said.At the time, Reinhart chose to stay silent, given how much power the manhad on set. She also feared that no one would believe her if she spoke up, and recalled feeling guilty about the situation and doubted her own instincts during their encounter.The actress is speaking out now to demonstrate how common these abuses toward women are in the film industry, and to show her support for all who choose to speak out about similar experiences. “So I understand how these women feel - the women coming forward about being harassed and assaulted by Harvey Weinstein,” she concluded. “I stand with them. I believe them. I believe in standing up for yourself as a woman and coming forward about sexual harassment.”To read Reinhart’s full post, head over to her Tumblr page. "

Coleman was pregnant at the time, and a video released by the Taliban in December showed their two sons born while they were hostages.Thursday’s statement from the Pakistani army was the first mention of a third child.The rescue came as Pakistan and the United States, uneasy allies in fighting Taliban and other Islamist extremists in the region, are experiencing one of the worst lows in relations.Pakistan touted the success of the operation as proof of the strength of the alliance.“The success underscores the importance of timely intelligence sharing and Pakistan’s continued commitment towards fighting this menace through cooperation between two forces against a common enemy,” the Pakistani army statement said. The family were released from “terrorist custody.”U.S. intelligence agencies had been tracking the hostages and on Wednesday shared that they family had been moved across to Pakistan through Kurram tribal area border, the army said.

Police have killed nearly 4,000 people since Duterte took office in late June of last year, while emboldened vigilante groups have murdered thousands more. The change in policy is a sign that Duterte’s administration may be beginning to bend under the increasing weight of domestic and international pressure, despite the president’s characteristically belligerent reactions to criticism and attacks against human rights groups.“What’s different now is that opinion polls are indicating a softening in support for Duterte, and there have been very large, loud and public displays of opposition to the drug war,” said Phelim Kine, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch.Recent weeks have seen protests, falling approval ratings and threats of international economic repercussions over Duterte’s violent 15-month anti-drug campaign. The high-profile extrajudicial killings of three teenagers this summer put an increased spotlight on the brutal nature of anti-drug operations.The death of 17-year-old Kian delos Santos in August drew special outrage as it appeared to provide clear evidence of a police cover-up. Officers involved claimed to have shot Santos after he fired on them while resisting arrest, but closed-circuit TV footage revealed two plainclothes policemen had the teenager in custody and fully restrained before his death. Santos’ body was found in an alley near his house, shot twice in the head and once in the back. Human rights groups and critics of Duterte’s government have consistently condemned the police for carrying out extrajudicial killings with impunity, often planting evidence or falsifying accounts of how the deaths took place. Duterte even briefly suspended police involvement in the drug war once before, in January, after anti-drug squad officers kidnapped and murdered a South Korean businessman.But the highly publicized killing of Santos, along with those of two other teenage boys in the past two months, has brought new levels of opposition to the drug war. A Social Weather Stations poll released earlier this week showed a significant drop in public support for Duterte, with trust in him hitting the lowest point of his presidency, albeit remaining mostly favorable. Adding to Duterte’s woes are falling foreign investment, continuous martial law in the island of Mindanao over conflict with extremists, and pressure from the European Union that it will end a preferential trade deal if the killings don’t stop.Duterte responded to the EU officials’ warnings in his speech on Thursday, calling them “bullshit” and saying, “We are past the colonization stage. Don’t fuck with us.” But human rights groups say that despite Duterte’s bellicose rhetoric, the economic consequences of his drug war are a major concern for the Philippines.“It’s clear that people in his government, people in the business community are telling him that he needs to pull back ― that there’s about to be an economic price to be paid for this war on drugs that is going to be considerable and painful,” Kine said.In response to the growing discontent around extrajudicial killings, Duterte’s administration has made overtures toward investigations into police conduct and tried to manage the public image of the drug war. Officials have denied abuses as “fake news” and tried to downplay the statistics on drug-related killings since Duterte took office.The Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency taking control of operations has the potential to slow the rate of extrajudicial killings, as the group has only about 1 percent of the forces of the national police, but the deaths won’t stop entirely.Human rights groups say that one of the most dangerous ramifications of Duterte’s drug war has been a breakdown in the rule of law as vigilante groups have felt emboldened to carry out killings without fear of reprisal. During the brief halt in police operations earlier this year, bodies of victims still piled up in the streets. Their heads were wrapped in packing tape and they were lying next to cardboard signs accusing them of having links to drugs.“You can get away with murder in the Philippines. Anyone with a gun and a grudge can kill someone and it can be attributed to a drug killing,” Kine said. “The war isn’t over until there are some meaningful moves toward accountability.”"

61,POLITICS,"Coal Is Going Down, Even Without The Clean Power Plan","Elliott Negin, ContributorSenior Writer, Union of Concerned Scientists",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/coal-is-going-down-even-without-the-clean-power-plan_us_59dea14ce4b075f45223a3d6,"Last Monday, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt announced he will repeal the Obama administration’s",2017-10-12,<p>EPA chief Scott Pruitt just issued a rule to repeal an Obama-era regulation limiting power plant carbon emissions.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59dea6cd1400007a234945ae.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last Monday, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt announced he will repeal the Obama administration’s regulation to curb power plant carbon emissions, telling coal miners in Kentucky that “the war on coal is over.” The next day he kept his promise, issuing a proposed rule to eliminate the Clean Power Plan.It was hardly a surprise. After all, President Trump has called climate change a “hoax” and vowed during his campaign to bring back coal jobs, which is why Pruitt made his preliminary announcement in Kentucky, where workers have a direct economic stake.Despite the rhetoric, however, Pruitt and Trump can’t alter the harsh reality of the U.S. coal industry: Terminating the Clean Power Plan isn’t going to bring it back. Consider the facts: As recently as 2008, coal-fired power plants generated half of all U.S. electricity. Since then, demand for coal has dropped steadily due to cheap natural gas, new wind and solar projects, energy efficiency initiatives, and bad investment decisions, forcing three of the four largest U.S. coal companies — and smaller ones as well — into bankruptcy. Today, coal accounts for about 30 percent of U.S. electricity generation. As for jobs, mechanization displaced miners years ago. In 1980, more than 228,000 people worked in the coal industry. In July, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the industry employed only 50,400. Employment is especially anemic in Kentucky, which supplies 7 percent of the nation’s coal, making it the third-largest coal-producing state. The coal industry employed just 5,600 people in Kentucky in July, according to the BLS, a mere 0.28 percent of the state’s nonfarm working population and 70 percent fewer than at the end of 2008. Mining jobs aside, according to a new Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) analysis, the rapid transition away from coal-powered electricity is likely to continue no matter what the Trump administration does. “A significant portion of today’s coal fleet can’t compete economically with cleaner energy options,” said Jeremy Richardson, a UCS senior energy analyst and the report’s lead author. “That’s particularly the case in the Southeast, where operational costs for coal units are considerably higher than what utilities would have to pay for natural gas or renewables.”Coal Plant Retirements Will ContinueThe numbers tell the story: Nine years ago, 1,256 turbine units at 526 coal-fired power plants had a generating capacity of nearly 357 gigawatts (GW). (One gigawatt can power some 700,000 average homes.) Now, 706 units at 329 coal-fired power plants have a capacity of 284 GW — 20 percent less. In the intervening years, utilities converted 98 units to burn natural gas and retired 452 others. Of the remaining 706 units, utilities have already announced plans to either retire or convert 163 more by 2030, amounting to roughly 18 percent of total U.S. coal capacity. But even that does not provide the full picture: UCS identified another 122 units at 58 plants that are uneconomic compared with natural gas — an additional 20 percent of coal capacity that is ripe for retirement. Taken together, UCS analysis shows that U.S. coal-fired electricity capacity could drop by more than a third in the next 15 years. This inevitable decline will affect some states far more than others. Ironically, the state that consumes the highest percentage of uneconomic coal-fired electricity is West Virginia, the second-largest U.S. coal-producing state. UCS found that 12 of the 19 coal-fired units currently operating in the state are ripe for retirement, accounting for some 57 percent of the state’s electricity. Four other states are generating more than 20 percent of their electricity from uneconomic coal-fired units: Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina and South Carolina.Fewer Coal Plants, Better HealthShutting down more old, inefficient coal units or converting them to run on natural gas will undoubtedly have a positive effect on public health. The data show that tighter pollution controls and closures already have dramatically reduced toxic coal plant pollutants linked to cancer and cardiovascular, respiratory and neurological diseases. Between 2004 and 2012, for example, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions — the main components of fine particulate pollution — dropped 68 percent and 55 percent, respectively, according to a 2015 Clean Air Task Force study. As a result, the study found, the number of asthma attacks attributable to coal plant pollution plunged 77 percent, heart attacks decreased 69 percent, hospital admissions plummeted 74 percent, and premature deaths declined 68 percent, from 23,600 to 7,500.Closing more coal plants would particularly benefit low-income communities and communities of color, which are disproportionately harmed by coal’s toxic emissions. A 2012 NAACP study found that the nearly 6 million Americans who lived within 3 miles of a coal plant in 2000 had an average per capita income of $26,000 in today’s dollars — 15 percent lower than the national average — and 39 percent were people of color. According to UCS, by 2016 the number of Americans living within 3 miles of a coal plant was down to 3.3 million, and when the units scheduled for retirement are shuttered, fewer than 2 million will live that close. According to an August 2016 Carnegie Mellon study in the journal Energy, converting all currently operating coal power plants to natural gas would further reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions by 90 percent and 60 percent, respectively. But coal plants are also one of the nation’s largest sources of carbon dioxide emissions, accounting for roughly 20 percent. Replacing them with natural gas would not do enough to reduce the electric power sector’s contribution to climate change, not only because the burning of natural gas produces carbon dioxide, but also because gas leaks at drilling sites, processing plants and pipelines release methane, a more powerful heat-trapping gas than carbon dioxide. The UCS analysis recommends a better approach.The Case for Renewable Energy“In states where many outmoded coal units will likely close, a wholesale shift from one fossil fuel to another is tempting, but it would be a big mistake,” said Sam Gomberg, a UCS senior energy analyst and coauthor of the new UCS report. “Aside from the fact that it wouldn’t adequately combat global warming, there are other problems with relying too heavily on natural gas, including yo-yoing prices and utilities getting stuck with obsolete infrastructure.” To avoid these pitfalls, Gomberg said, states should diversify their energy mix with renewable resources such as wind and solar power, energy efficiency, and emerging technologies, including battery storage and smart meters.Given the scale and scope of the energy transition now under way, the choices utilities make to replace coal will have a major impact on public health, the environment, and economic justice. “Our analysis makes it abundantly clear that the transition away from coal is continuing and it’s long past time for Congress and the administration to drop the false premise that killing environmental safeguards will bring back coal jobs,” said Richardson. “Cities and states need to prepare for this next wave of coal plant retirements and work with local communities to figure out how to avoid an overdependence on natural gas and ensure that the benefits of transitioning to a clean energy economy flow to communities equitably.” Elliott Negin is a senior writer at the Union of Concerned Scientists."

All of them are at risk of being denied federal grants, often those aimed at public safety, due to their policies limiting cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.They will have until Oct. 27 to prove their policies and practices comply with the law, DOJ said in a statement.“Jurisdictions that adopt so-called ‘sanctuary policies’ also adopt the view that the protection of criminal aliens is more important than the protection of law-abiding citizens and of the rule of law,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in the statement.There is no set definition for sanctuary cities or policies, but the term is most often used for jurisdictions that decline to detain certain individuals based solely on ICE requests, called detainers. The threats from DOJ are not regarding detainers, however, which the Trump administration has acknowledged are not mandatory in spite of Sessions’ frequent implications to the contrary.The statute DOJ says five jurisdictions may be violating is Title 8 U.S.C., Section 1373, which states that local officials cannot bar or restrict government workers from sharing information with federal immigration agents regarding individuals’ legal status.The Trump administration is already facing litigation over its threats against jurisdictions that contend they are in compliance with the law. Chicago, one of the cities at risk of losing funding, sued the federal government in August over the matter. San Francisco and the state of California sued the same month.San Francisco and Santa Clara County, California, won a preliminary injunction in April against an executive order by the president barring funds for sanctuary cities.Sessions and President Donald Trump frequently single out San Francisco as a sanctuary city, at times misconstruing the law to do so. San Francisco was not on DOJ’s list of jurisdictions potentially in violation of the law.The Trump administration’s threats have not fully stopped the sanctuary movement. California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) signed a bill into law earlier this month that further limits law enforcement in the state from cooperating in immigration efforts.In response, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it “will have no choice” but to conduct arrests in neighborhoods and workplaces in the state, leading to more “collateral” arrests of people they were not initially targeting.The White House is pressing Congress to grant it the ability to punish jurisdictions for declining to cooperate with ICE. One of Trump’s immigration priorities released on Sunday is to “stop ‘sanctuary cities.’” “States and localities that refuse to cooperate with Federal authorities should be ineligible for funding from certain grants and cooperative agreements,” the White House said in a statement, adding that there “are hundreds of jurisdictions across the country that do not honor requests from ICE to hold criminal aliens who already are in state and local custody.”Sessions said in his statement Thursday that jurisdictions should go farther than simply sharing information with the federal government and should “establish sensible and effective partnerships to properly process criminal aliens.”"

The move comes a little over a month after eco-friendly brand Everlane dropped its first-ever line of sustainable denim.Reformation’s new collection, aptly branded Ref Jeans, is held to the same material standards as the rest of the brand’s products: with 100 percent recycled materials, leftover fabrics, or sustainably sourced fibers. The line features 46 new pieces, including 11 denim styles in 14 washes, 10 tops and 4 dresses, all designed to pair perfectly with denim. “My biggest dream is to bring sustainable fashion to everyone,” writes Yael Aflalo, the brand’s founder and CEO. “This year, we decided to tackle the worst polluting type of clothing that we all buy all the time ― denim.”An absurd amount of water is typically needed to produce a single pair of jeans. That’s why, until now, many eco-first retailers have kept their distance from the closet staple. A single pair of jeans takes about 1,500 gallons of water (or sometimes more) once the dying and washing is complete. “On average, one Ref Jeans saves 1,468 gallons of water, compared to a conventional pair,” Aflalo writes. “And we are working on making them even better.” If this all sounds a bit too good to be true, it might be.

And, as we’ve seen this week with the firing of Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein from his own company, they’re finally being taken seriously. The question is: Why now? Certainly, the bravery of a handful of well-known and powerful women such as Gretchen Carlson, Megyn Kelly and Ashley Judd has been critical in exposing serial sexual abusers like Fox News founder Roger Ailes and Weinstein. And social networks like Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and Medium give platforms to women like former Uber engineer Susan Fowler, whose story of harassment led to the ouster of that company’s CEO. But some of the credit for this new world also goes to the former president. Yep, when it comes to women speaking up and getting heard, we can all say a collective, “Thanks, Obama.”The White House under Barack Obama made women’s rights a priority, creating an atmosphere and a legal framework where women were respected and believed and defended. And even as the current White House works overtime to shut down women’s rights, the Obama legacy is hardly going away. Indeed, the election of Donald Trump seems to have further emboldened women’s voices.“We definitely had an administration that cared about women’s rights and now we have an administration that is doing everything in its power to limit them,” said Nancy Erika Smith, the lawyer who represented Carlson in the Fox News host’s sexual discrimination lawsuit against Ailes. “We all woke up on November 9 and said, ‘What the fuck?’ and felt the need to do something.” The election of a man with a track record of misogyny who’s been accused of sexual assault by multiple women cemented Smith’s intention to speak up for women (of course, not all women, since more than half of white women voted for Trump) and fortified the resolve of millions of others. “I don’t put up with anything anymore. I am so done with it,” Smith said.Smith hasn’t seen an increase in clients coming to her with sexual harassment cases ― there’s always a steady stream, she said ― but others say they have noticed a change. More women are calling the National Women’s Law Center for help dealing with harassment, discrimination and abuse, said Fatima Goss Graves, the group’s president and CEO.“This is a decades-old problem. But it is NOW that the complaints that are long-running are breaking through and being heard,” Goss Graves said.Goss Graves and other activists are worried that the work of the Obama administration will be unraveled by the current White House. And the list of actions the Trump administration has taken so far that curtail women’s rights is long.Just last week, the White House rolled back the requirement that employer health plans cover birth control. The Department of Education, meanwhile, is pushing hard to curtail the rights of sexual assault survivors on college campuses ― a huge focus of the prior administration.But the White House under Obama, the first president to call himself a feminist, got a lot done ― and not all of it can easily be reversed. The administration, for example, threw its support behind Peggy Young. The former UPS worker took her pregnancy discrimination case against the shipping company all the way to the Supreme Court. And in 2015, she won, securing stronger rights for pregnant women in the workplace.Not too long after that, the Department of Justice intervened in a pregnancy discrimination lawsuit filed by two female police officers in Kentucky, securing a ruling in their favor.“The Obama administration really tried to do significant work and lift up the voices of sex assault and discrimination survivors,” said Vanita Gupta, the former head of the Department of Justice’s civil rights division. “There was also a concerted effort around women and gender equality.”Gupta, who is now president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said that at DOJ, lawyers had a “whole docket of cases” around employment discrimination against women and that the agency created guidance especially around gender issues in policing, including making sure treatment of assault survivors was appropriate.The first piece of legislation Obama signed was an equal pay law. Later, the administration helped put a rule in place that would have required companies to report equal pay data. The Trump administration rolled it back.The previous White House also had a large percentage of women leaders, including herself, Gupta said. “Incredible modeling happens when you have a lot of women in significant leadership positions,” she said. Women comprised 35 to 45 percent of the highest-paid staff throughout the Obama administration. Under Trump, as of this summer, women held just under 26 percent of those upper-level roles, according to the administration’s data. To be sure, you don’t need to analyze the data to see that the most powerful players in this administration are men.But perhaps the most dramatic change set in motion by the previous White House took place in a 2011 “Dear Colleague” letter. Sent by the Obama administration to college campuses around the country, the letter defined sexual assault and set a new standard for how schools should respond and go after those accused. “The letter was such a clear distillation of students’ rights and schools’ responsibilities,” said Alexandra Brodsky, who was a student activist at Yale at the time. Brodsky said the letter emboldened women on campus to demand support from their administrators. “I know students who used the letter to advocate for their rights within the school,” said Brodsky, who is now a fellow at the National Women’s Law Center.In September, the Trump administration got rid of that guidance, but Brodsky and her organization are still advocating for survivors and filing suits on behalf of students.Indeed, on Wednesday the group launched a new legal network, Legal Network for Gender Equity, that intends to pick up the mantle from the previous administration and defend women in cases of discrimination and assault.

70,POLITICS,The Poultry Lobby Wants Trump To Let Them Speed Up Processing Lines,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-poultry-lobby-wants-trump-to-let-them-speed-up-processing-lines_us_59dfcb67e4b03a7be57f4c9d,Labor and safety groups are urging the Agriculture Department to turn down their request out of concern for workers and the public.,2017-10-12,The poultry industry has asked Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue to let them run their processing lines without speed limits.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59dfd0422d0000971730a115.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"America’s poultry workers better get ready to work faster.A previously abandoned and controversial plan to speed up processing lines inside chicken plants has found new life under the Trump administration. The industry has formally asked that the White House lift the limits capping how quickly birds can move down plant lines, which would allow meatpacking companies to process more chickens.But worker rights and food safety groups say the plan would also make a difficult job even harder, endangering vulnerable workers and weakening the food inspection process. Eleven such organizations plan to visit the U.S. Department of Agriculture next week ― accompanied by poultry workers ― demanding that it reject the industry’s proposal.In most poultry facilities, line speeds are currently capped at 140 birds per minute to allow adequate time to inspect them for signs of contamination. The industry has proposed that the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service get rid of the limits altogether for facilities that choose to take part in a new inspection program aimed at cutting down on salmonella and other foodborne dangers.Opponents of a speedup claim the current rates are already too fast and that any increase would be accompanied by a rise in carpal tunnel syndrome and other painful injuries common to the low-wage meatpacking workforce.Marc Perrone, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers union, which represents 70,000 poultry workers around the country, sent a letter Wednesday to the USDA calling the industry effort “troubling.”“Poultry workers hold some of the most dangerous and difficult jobs in America,” Perrone said. “The implications of this rule change are striking.”It isn’t clear when the USDA would make a decision on the request, and a USDA spokeswoman declined to comment. The agency is now run by Sonny Perdue, the former Georgia governor whose nomination enjoyed wide support from agricultural and poultry companies. (He is not related to the Perdue family famous for its supermarket chickens.)A spokesman for the National Chicken Council, an industry lobby, said its petition to the USDA speaks for itself. The petition argues that allowing a speedup would have no impact on food safety and that the industry’s falling occupational injury rate should allay concerns about the effects on workers. Granting the speedup, the council argued, would be right in line with Trump’s deregulatory agenda.“These cost saving actions are consistent with the regulatory reform initiatives recently put in place by the President, and waivers are consistent with the Administration’s emphasis on reducing regulatory burdens on the industry,” the petition reads.The chicken industry has fought for years to raise the cap on line speeds, just as worker and consumer groups have fought to beat back those efforts. The Obama administration proposed then later pulled a speedup plan after an outcry from worker and consumer groups as well as Democrats in Congress. That rule would have raised the cap from 140 birds per minute to 170, a speed that was allowed only at plants that took part in a special pilot program. Under the latest proposal, there would be no cap at all for many plants.The industry claims U.S. plants need to process more birds to keep up with competitors in other countries where the speed caps are more lax. “Creating a waiver system to allow establishments to operate without arbitrary line speed limits will put U.S. producers on more equal footing,” the council argued. The case for allowing faster line speeds rests largely on the rosy injury data for chicken processing jobs. The data collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics seems to show that poultry work has been getting less dangerous over time, with the number of injuries per 100 workers dropping, from nearly 10 in 2004 to less than six in 2013. From the industry’s perspective, the improving safety picture makes the concern over line speeds overblown.But the injury data isn’t everything it seems. Many workers choose not to disclose injuries to their bosses for fear of losing their jobs, while many companies choose not to disclose injuries to federal officials for fear of increased scrutiny and higher costs. As a result, many experts believe the overall injury rate for the field is much higher than the statistics indicate. It isn’t just labor groups that question the accuracy of the improving injury numbers: The U.S. Government Accountability Office published a report in 2016 probing the poultry industry’s “underreporting” problem and saying the federal data probably don’t provide a complete picture of the hazards involved in poultry work. The GAO found that at some plants workers were punished for visiting the in-house health clinic too frequently.As one occupational health expert previously put it to HuffPost, “We should have no confidence about the industry’s assertions about its injury rates.”The poultry lobby already has some GOP backing on Capitol Hill. Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, whose state is the leading slaughterer of chickens in the U.S., recently published an opinion piece in The Hill saying the nation’s poultry plants don’t move fast enough.Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), a longtime opponent of faster lines, fired back at Collins, writing in her own op-ed that the poultry industry is already “dangerous enough.” “These corporations rarely stop the line or even slow it down ― leaving workers making tens of thousands of repetitive motions each day,” DeLauro wrote."

This commitment did not magically appear in my thoughts, but rather was instilled there by a man I once shook hands with as a pre-law student on a visit to the Supreme Court.Thurgood Marshall was a man of conviction who was criticized, chastised, even ostracized for everything he believed in, stood for, and looked like. Despite all these obstacles, he not only participated in the arduous climb for civil rights, he dominated the uphill struggle. His extraordinary legacy will be recognized in an upcoming film, just as our nation marks the 50th anniversary of Marshall taking his seat as the first African-American associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.The movie, Marshall, will be released in theaters on Friday, just days after the nation recognized Thurgood Marshall Day on Oct. 2. The film underscores the impact Marshall made in the lives of countless black Americans. I was honored to be asked to play a role in the movie, alongside Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, whom I represented in the tragically unjust case of the 2012 killing of their son, Trayvon Martin.The real-life person I portray is attorney Z. Alexander Looby, a gifted civil rights lawyer.

This commitment did not magically appear in my thoughts, but rather was instilled there by a man I once shook hands with as a pre-law student on a visit to the Supreme Court.Thurgood Marshall was a man of conviction who was criticized, chastised, even ostracized for everything he believed in, stood for, and looked like. Despite all these obstacles, he not only participated in the arduous climb for civil rights, he dominated the uphill struggle. His extraordinary legacy will be recognized in an upcoming film, just as our nation marks the 50th anniversary of Marshall taking his seat as the first African-American associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.The movie, Marshall, will be released in theaters on Friday, just days after the nation recognized Thurgood Marshall Day on Oct. 2. The film underscores the impact Marshall made in the lives of countless black Americans. I was honored to be asked to play a role in the movie, alongside Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, whom I represented in the tragically unjust case of the 2012 killing of their son, Trayvon Martin.The real-life person I portray is attorney Z. Alexander Looby, a gifted civil rights lawyer. In the film I “represent” characters played by Ms. Fulton and Mr. Martin, who were cast as the parents of a 14-year-old boy accused of killing a police officer in Mississippi.

73,ENTERTAINMENT,Emma Thompson Thinks There Are Many More Harvey Weinsteins In Hollywood,Cole Delbyck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/emma-thompson-thinks-there-are-many-more-harvey-weinsteins-in-hollywood_us_59dfb6e3e4b0a52aca1679f1,"""Do they have to all be as bad as him to make it count?""",2017-10-12,Emma Thompson the 61st BFI London Film Festival in October 2017. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59dfc5922000000934086832.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Emma Thompson is joining a chorus of famous actresses condemning Harvey Weinstein in the wake of the many allegations of sexual assault and harassment leveled against him. Thompson, who starred in a handful of films produced by Weinstein’s company, including 2008′s “Brideshead Revisited,” said she had no previous knowledge of his actions, but is not entirely surprised. “I didn’t know about these things, but they don’t surprise me at all and they’re endemic to the system anyway,” Thompson told BBC Newsnight. “What I find sort of extraordinary is that this man is at the top of a very particular iceberg.”“I don’t think you can describe him as a sex addict,” she continued. “He’s a predator. But what he’s, as it were, [at] the top of the ladder of is a system of harassment and belittling and bullying, and interference.”Later in the interview, when journalist Emily Maitlis pressed Thompson on whether she believed there were others within the film industry that have committed similar acts, the “Beauty and the Beast” actress dropped this piece of knowledge. “Of course. Many. Maybe not to that degree,” she responded. “Do they have to all be as bad as him to make it count? Does it only count if you really have done it to loads and loads and loads of women? Or does it count if you do it to one woman, once?” Thompson added, “I think the latter.”Weinstein was fired from his production company this week after incriminating investigative reports by both The New York Times and The New Yorker detailed decades of alleged sexual harassment, as well as rape, according to three women’s testimonies. The producer has since reportedly fled to a rehab facility in Arizona to treat, among other things, a sex addiction.Thompson, however, doesn’t consider this kind of behavior specific to the film industry, but part of a larger problem regarding how men abuse power. “This has been part of our world, women’s world, since time immemorial,” she said. “So what we need to start talking about is this crisis in masculinity, the crisis of extreme masculinity, which is this sort of behavior, and the fact that it is not only OK, but it also is represented by the most powerful man in the world at the moment.”While Thompson does not mention him by name, she is likely referring to President Donald Trump, whom she once turned down a date with and has routinely criticized since he took office.

Most of the fires were less than 10 percent contained as of Thursday, with about 8,000 firefighters working to extinguish them.“We are not even close to being out of this emergency,” Sheriff Rob Giordano said at a news conference Thursday evening.Seventeen fatalities have come in Sonoma County. Other deaths have been reported in Mendocino County (eight), Yuba County (four), and Napa County (two). The 32 deaths have set a new state record for the deadliest spate of wildfires in California history. The second-deadliest event was in 1933, when a fast moving brush fire in Los Angeles’ Griffith Park killed 29 people and injured more than 150.“We will do everything in our power to locate all the missing persons,” Giordano said. “And I promise you we will handle the remains with care and get them returned to their loved ones.”The Sonoma County Coroner’s Office identified 10 people killed in the county, eight of whom were in their 70s or older. Giordano said authorities had begun searching for those killed by the blazes.“We have recovered people where their bodies are intact,” he said, before noting that officials “have recovered people where there’s just ash and bone.”Giordano warned it’d be “unrealistic” to think the death toll wouldn’t continue to rise. He noted that in Sonoma County alone, out of a total of 900 people who were originally reported as missing, 437 have been confirmed as safe.Most of those reported missing are presumed to have the status due to the difficulty of communicating in the area, not because they’re necessarily deceased or injured.“We have had big fires in the past,” California Gov. Jerry Brown said in a press conference Wednesday. “This is one of the biggest, most serious, and it’s not over.”“We’re pretty exhausted. It’s pretty steep terrain,” Sonoma firefighter Steven Moore told NPR. “We’ve been dealing with trying to save the structures. The winds aren’t helping. All we can do is get to the structures as fast as we possibly can and save what we can.”Evacuations continue across Napa and Sonoma counties as authorities attempt to convey the severity of the threat.“This is a mandatory evacuation. Your presence in Calistoga is not welcome if you are not a first responder,” Calistoga Mayor Chris Canning said.Some evacuees even left behind cookies for the first responders, according to The Associated Press.Here’s how you can help those affected by the fires."
75,POLITICS,Finally Something Economists Can Agree On: Trump’s Debt Talk Made Zero Sense,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-debt-stock-market_us_59dfd06de4b04d1d51807f2e,"No, an increase in values of stocks owned by shareholders does not decrease the national debt owed by taxpayers.",2017-10-12,"President Donald Trump arrives to speak about tax reform in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on Oct. 11.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59dfd17d1500002000da1347.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump may still be divisive to most Americans, but his recent explanation about how an increasing stock market decreases the national debt appears to have unified both Republican and Democratic economists.They think it’s nuts.“The thing he said last night was just mind-achingly wrong,” said Jared Bernstein, once the top economic adviser to former Democratic Vice President Joe Biden. “Literally to the point where it was making my head hurt. I had to shut it off, and it made me feel better.”Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Sen. John McCain’s economic adviser during the senator’s 2008 presidential run, agreed. “There’s no relationship,” he said. “So that’s pretty clear.”The cause of Bernstein’s headache: Trump’s interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity, in which he claimed that the increased value of stocks somehow reduced the accumulated national debt – apparently on a dollar-for-dollar basis.“As you know, the last eight years, they borrowed more than it did in the whole history of our country. So they borrowed more than $10 trillion, right? And yet, we picked up $5.2 trillion just in the stock market,” Trump told his friend and informal adviser. “So you could say in one sense, we’re really increasing values. And maybe in a sense, we’re reducing debt.”The two values, though, have nothing to do with each other. The national debt is the accumulated amount owed by the nation because the government over the years has spent more than it has received in tax revenues. The value of all the stocks of all the publicly traded companies is owned by their various shareholders, not the government.An increase in the latter cannot decrease the former unless Trump plans to confiscate the aggregated increase in stock value since his election and use it to pay down the debt.The White House on Thursday said Trump was speaking more broadly. “The president was simply making the point that we’ve seen enormous growth in the stock market since his election,” a White House official said on condition of anonymity. “That means more money in the pocket of everyday citizens, and more circulating in our economy as a whole.”Trump’s explanation to Hannity also neglected to mention that former President Obama took office in the middle of a major financial crisis, whereas Trump took over following seven years of stable growth.It was not, however, the first time Trump has shown signs of not understanding the functioning of the debt.In June, during a visit by South Korean President Moon Jae-in, Trump said he was unhappy with a trade agreement with South Korea because that country’s exports to the United States are worth more than its imports. “We cannot allow that to continue,” Trump said. “This is really a statement that I make about all trade: For many, many years the United States has suffered through massive trade deficits. That’s why we have $20 trillion in debt.”Holtz-Eakin, who at one time served as director of the Congressional Budget Office, said there actually is a relationship between trade deficits and the national debt, but it is the opposite one from what Trump appears to believe. In reality, he said, large budget deficits can cause a trade deficit, not the other way around.Bernstein, meanwhile, said he thinks Trump was talking up the stock market because he understands that his proposed tax cuts would add trillions more to the national debt and wants his supporters to continue to believe that increased stock market values will offset that.“I think there’s a method to his madness,” Bernstein said.Hear S.V.

The new legislation, named the Title IX Protection Act, would codify into law three Title IX guidances that were created during the Obama, George W. Bush and Clinton administrations. These guidances ― the 2014 Questions and Answers on Title IX document, the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter and the 2001 Guidance on Title IX (originally issued by the Clinton administration and then re-issued by the Bush administration) ― were designed to help all parties involved in sexual assault cases navigate the campus reporting process. “Students should be chasing dreams, not running from sexual predators,” Rep. Lois Frankel (D-Fla.) said at the press conference. In the beginning of September, DeVos announced that she would begin rolling back guidances like those named above. She called the current campus reporting process a “failed system” that is “increasingly elaborate and confusing.” Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) has spearheaded the proposed legislation with help from the Democratic Women’s Working Group. Speier was joined at the press conference at the Capitol Visitors Center by other congressional lawmakers, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.) and Rep. Ann McLane Kuster (D-N.H.). Anti-sexual violence and advocacy groups including End Rape On Campus, Know Your IX, the National Women’s Law Center and the American Association of University Women were also in attendance. “The Title IX Protection Act is very important because Secretary DeVos’ decision to roll back vital protections for victims of campus sexual assault is an alarming reminder of the White House’ dismissive and cruel attitude towards survivors and students,” Pelosi said during the press conference. Speier told HuffPost that this bill is key to ensuring that all parties involved in sexual assault accusations handled under Title IX are treated fairly. “The most important element of this legislation is that we create a standard that cannot be changed,” Speier said. “We have a secretary of education who is trying to take us back in time and we’re not going back in time. We’re not going back to a period of time when a woman who is raped is not believed or her case is swept under the rug.”Jess Davidson, managing director of End Rape On Campus, told HuffPost that this bill will send a strong message to survivors that they are not alone. “A few weeks ago, Secretary DeVos sent survivors of sexual assault a terrible leadership signal, one that clearly told survivors the United States government is not with them, and that survivors are on their own when it comes to the enforcement of their own civil rights. But advocates and survivors know we can’t go back,” Davidson said. “The Title IX Protection Act sends the opposite message to survivors, and to all who want fairness in Title IX processes, as it reiterates the importance of strong Title IX enforcement and of fair, impartial and trauma-informed processes.”During the presser, Speier and other speakers addressed an argument often used against the Title IX reporting process. In Title IX cases, the accused must be found guilty by only a “preponderance of the evidence.” That’s the standard of proof usually used in civil rights cases and other civil court matters. It is lower than the “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard used in criminal cases, where the punishment could be prison time.Preponderance of the evidence means simply that it is more likely than not that the accused did the alleged deed. The standard is used in Title IX cases where the potential punishments relate to the accused’s status at school ― suspension, expulsion, etc. ― and do not threaten a loss of liberty, like prison.Critics of the Title IX reporting process often contend that the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard makes it too easy to wrongly convict the innocent. But Speier and others at the press conference argued for the standard by putting sexual violence on college campuses in the larger context of civil rights. “The law is clear, women have the right to an education free from discrimination and sexual violence,” Speier said. “Because [preponderance of the evidence] is what is used in all civil rights cases, and isn’t this a civil right ― to be able to go to school and not be subjected to violence?”Watch the full press conference below. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mistakenly said that “clear and convincing evidence” is the same as “beyond a reasonable doubt.” It is, in fact, a third standard of proof that falls between “preponderance of the evidence” and “beyond a reasonable doubt.”"

The black comedy, which marks Harrison’s directorial debut, follows down-and-out artists Felix (Matthew Wilkas) and Cathy (Jenn Harris), who are struggling to make ends meet in New York. One day, they’re given the chance to earn a fortune and wipe out some of their mounting debt... by killing a stranger. A few questionable, if humorously presented, decisions later, the pair become hired hit men. Their victims and accomplices include a plethora of guest stars, including Jemima Kirke, John Early, Ana Gasteyer and Bebe Neuwirth. (Olympic freeskier Gus Kenworthy, who is Wilkas’ longtime beau, even turns in a cameo.) “New York Is Dead,” which premiered at the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival, is an onscreen reunion for Wilkas and Harris, who also starred in the 2012 queer cult hit, “Gayby.” The pair co-wrote the series, which Wilkas called “sort of autobiographical” in that the writer-performers have their own love/hate relationships with the Big Apple. “New York is an absurd, beautiful and impossible place where everyone is fighting for their piece of space,” he told HuffPost. “Jenn and I have never killed anyone, of course, but we have, in our individual ways, experienced struggle. As important as art and creativity is to New York, it doesn’t really make life easy for its artists.” Shooting with Harrison, he added, was “pretty phenomenal.” The pair raised money for the production of the first season of “New York Is Dead” through a successful Kickstarter campaign, while all six episodes were shot over just seven days. To Wilkas, whose credits also include “The Mummy” and HBO’s “Looking,” the support from audiences “means the world.” “We never would have been able to make this show without our fans and friends,” he said, “and knowing that they support us and are invested in the project is super inspiring.” The first two episodes of “New York Is Dead” will be released Friday, Oct. 13 on Funny or Die.

Wong,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-york-is-dead-preview_us_59df9db7e4b0fdad73b2c683,"Jenn Harris and Matthew Wilkas are inadvertent assassins in ""New York Is Dead.""",2017-10-12,John Early (left) and Jemima Kirke are two guest stars who pop up on the black comedy series. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59dfb50b1500004800da12d2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“Queer as Folk” icon Randy Harrison becomes a hipster tour guide in this exclusive clip from his new web series, “New York Is Dead.” HuffPost got a first look at the series before its Funny or Die premiere this Friday. The black comedy, which marks Harrison’s directorial debut, follows down-and-out artists Felix (Matthew Wilkas) and Cathy (Jenn Harris), who are struggling to make ends meet in New York. One day, they’re given the chance to earn a fortune and wipe out some of their mounting debt... by killing a stranger. A few questionable, if humorously presented, decisions later, the pair become hired hit men. Their victims and accomplices include a plethora of guest stars, including Jemima Kirke, John Early, Ana Gasteyer and Bebe Neuwirth. (Olympic freeskier Gus Kenworthy, who is Wilkas’ longtime beau, even turns in a cameo.) “New York Is Dead,” which premiered at the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival, is an onscreen reunion for Wilkas and Harris, who also starred in the 2012 queer cult hit, “Gayby.” The pair co-wrote the series, which Wilkas called “sort of autobiographical” in that the writer-performers have their own love/hate relationships with the Big Apple. “New York is an absurd, beautiful and impossible place where everyone is fighting for their piece of space,” he told HuffPost. “Jenn and I have never killed anyone, of course, but we have, in our individual ways, experienced struggle. As important as art and creativity is to New York, it doesn’t really make life easy for its artists.” Shooting with Harrison, he added, was “pretty phenomenal.” The pair raised money for the production of the first season of “New York Is Dead” through a successful Kickstarter campaign, while all six episodes were shot over just seven days. To Wilkas, whose credits also include “The Mummy” and HBO’s “Looking,” the support from audiences “means the world.” “We never would have been able to make this show without our fans and friends,” he said, “and knowing that they support us and are invested in the project is super inspiring.” The first two episodes of “New York Is Dead” will be released Friday, Oct. 13 on Funny or Die.

In a new blog post, Ham said all of those trick-or-treaters coming to the door on Oct. 31 provide “a fantastic opportunity to share the saving gospel with your friends and neighbors.” Ham’s message was actually a sales pitch for his organization’s “Halloween Learn & Share Kits,” which include religious pamphlets as well as fake money with Bible messages to be given out to candy-seeking children:The fake million-dollar bills come with a picture of either a dinosaur or Noah’s Ark on the front and ominous warnings of damnation on the reverse side. “Have you ever lied, stolen or used God’s name in vain?” a message on one of the bills reads. “If so, you’ve broken God’s law. The penalty for your crimes against God is death and eternal hell.”Kids will love it. If trick-or-treaters hear about the weird fake money offerings and stop showing up, Ham has a backup plan.“Try ‘reverse-trick-or-treating’ when you bring a basket of goodies to bless your neighbors,” he wrote on the Answers in Genesis website. “Include a gospel booklet with your home-baked or store-bought treats. This is a great way to encourage your kids to give and bless others as well as share the gospel as a family.”"

Gov. Matt Bevin, speaking to WHAS radio, shot down a fellow Republican’s proposal to legalize, regulate and tax sales of marijuana. State Sen. Dan Seum had argued last week that such a move could help pull the state out of its pension crisis. Instead of addressing the issue with research and facts, Bevin pushed the hysteria button.“So a lot of toked-up people gambling, that’s the solution for Kentucky?” Bevin asked after the radio host brought up ideas to legalize marijuana or expand gambling. “I would say no and no. Not while I’m governor. Those are sucker’s bets. We’re not going to legalize marijuana in this state.”He claimed that Colorado, one of the first states to legalize weed recreationally, was seeing horrible results.“There are people overdosing based on ingestion of products that are edibles and things,” Bevin said. There are “law enforcement people in emergency rooms being overrun by problems.”“It has not been good for that state, and states like us would be wise to look at that and realize that’s a sucker’s bet,” the governor argued.The “sucker’s bet” has currently netted Colorado tax revenue in excessive of half a billion dollars.As for the alleged overdoses, Dr. Daniel Vigil of the Colorado Department of Public Health told Insider Louisville that the incidents would more accurately be described as overconsumption ― “not overdoses comparable to an opioid overdose.” He said the state saw a temporary hike in poison center calls and emergency room visits, which it has since addressed with new policies.If Bevin is still worried, HuffPost has compiled an exhaustive list of every single person who has died solely from a marijuana overdose.

87,POLITICS,Jeff Sessions Wants To Make It Harder For Immigrants To Get Asylum,Roque Planas and Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-sessions-asylum-immigrants_us_59dfa9bfe4b0eb18af071a55,"The attorney general described a ""crisis"" at the border, despite the plummeting number of illegal crossings.",2017-10-12,Attorney General Jeff Sessions delivers a speech on the asylum system at the Executive Office for Immigration Review. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59dfab412d0000971730a073.jpeg?cache=jCKZ7Uq0cE&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"FALLS CHURCH, Va. ― Attorney General Jeff Sessions broadly accused immigrants of lying to attain asylum Thursday, claiming that “dirty immigration lawyers,” along with “rampant abuse and fraud,” allow too many people to avoid deportation. His aim: convincing members of Congress and the public that the law needs to be changed so that undocumented immigrants who say they’re seeking safety in the U.S. can be swiftly deported.“The system is being gamed,” Sessions said in a speech at the Executive Office for Immigration Review, which is part of the Department of Justice. “There’s no doubt about it. The credible fear process was intended to be a lifeline for persons facing serious persecution. But it has become an easy ticket to illegal entry into the United States.”Sessions’ speech was part of a pitch for President Donald Trump’s immigration policy priorities, released on Sunday. The president said he wants significant policy concessions from Congress, including changes to the asylum system, in exchange for approving protections for so-called “Dreamers,” young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.If Trump gets his way, Dreamers would largely be allowed to stay in the U.S., but at the expense of other undocumented immigrants. The White House wants more latitude to swiftly deport unaccompanied minors, families entering together and asylum-seekers, while prosecuting more people for petty immigration violations and expanding the barrier on the U.S.-Mexico border. Immigrant rights advocates warned that such changes could be deadly.“The language that was used this morning that is inherently tied to attempts to restrict access to asylum beyond what is already in existence now is incredibly dangerous and will actually cost people their lives,” said Amy Fisher, the policy director for RAICES, a nonprofit group that offers legal services to immigrants seeking asylum.Sessions said that some people are true asylum-seekers who should be granted protection. But he said that many others are lying and that false claims are slowing deportation rates and clogging the court system. The asylum system, Sessions said, was “never intended to provide asylum to all those who fear generalized violence, crime, personal vendettas, or a lack of job prospects. Yet, vague, insubstantial, and subjective claims have swamped our system.”He cited significant backlogs in immigration courts, where more than 630,000 cases are currently pending. The administration is seeking to add 370 immigration judges to EOIR as part of its policy priorities ― more than double the current number. He also referenced a 2015 report by the Government Accountability Office that listed some examples of asylum fraud. The primary conclusion of the report was that agencies should do a better job detecting and tracking the issue. It did not advocate for changes to the asylum process as a whole.Sessions criticized a 2009 reform under President Barack Obama’s administration that required most immigrants facing “expedited removal” ― a fast-track process to deportation ― to be released from immigrant detention after they passed a “credible fear” interview and while they take the case before judge. The Obama administration made that change to avoid keeping people who might win asylum from getting detained indefinitely, according to Doris Meissner, a senior fellow with the Migration Policy Institute and a former commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.Doing away with the policy, which the Trump administration could do without Congress, would likely mean that more asylum-seekers are locked up in detention for longer periods of time, according to Meissner.“Detention is expensive, particularly the way the immigration system is clogged,” Meissner told HuffPost. “And these are people who have not committed a crime. Should they remain in detention for a few years while their case is decided? That’s what this policy was trying to avoid.”Sessions’ claim that the United States faces a “crisis” at the border isn’t reflected in the data.The number of apprehensions for illegally crossing the border stands at 281,390, with one month left to tally for the fiscal year, which ended last month. Another 102,692 people were deemed “inadmissible” at the border, but generally allowed to enter the United States to ask for asylum or other forms of humanitarian exemption from deportation. The Customs and Border Protection agency did not start counting “inadmissibles” as a separate category until last year.That puts the total number of undocumented immigrants crossing the southern border into the United States this year, including asylum-seekers, at 384,082 ― on track to be the lowest number of unauthorized entries recorded by CBP since at least 1973.Those low numbers reflect several changes at the U.S.-Mexico border over the last decade. Migration from Mexico plummeted following the U.S. economic crisis of 2008. But by 2014, tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors and families traveling from the Central American countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala began crossing into the United States, many of whom made asylum claims to escape out-of-control gang violence and political instability.But even before Sessions’ remarks, the Trump administration had already taken steps to thwart asylum applicants from entering the country. Shortly after taking office, lawyers and immigrant rights groups accused the CBP agents of turning away asylum-seekers at the U.S.-Mexico border, despite guarantees under both U.S. and international law that allows them to cross legally into the country to make those claims.In July, the Center for Constitutional Rights and the Tijuana-based nonprofit legal group Al Otro Lado filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration over the alleged actions by CBP. “They’re taking matters into their own hands to drive the results that they’d like to see,” Angelo Guisado, a staff attorney with the center, told HuffPost. “And it’s very clear that the results that they’d like to see are fewer immigrants in this country.” Nicole Ramos, the director of the Border Rights Project at Al Otro Lado, acknowledged that many asylum applicants fail to make successful claims in immigration court after passing credible fear interviews. But she said that happens because there are few nonprofits like hers that are able to offer pro bono representation to asylum-seekers. Private attorneys are often too expensive for many immigrants to afford, particularly those who aren’t allowed to work legally in the United States.The immigration courts heard decided roughly 22,000 asylum cases last year, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse database at Syracuse University. Judges denied 57 percent of those claims, though the decisions varied widely depending the judge. For those appearing in court without a lawyer, however, the denial rate was 90 percent.“The answer isn’t just fraud,” Ramos told HuffPost. “I’m wondering if [Sessions] and I are living in the same world … I don’t think he has a realistic view of the system and I question his understanding of current events.”"
88,ENTERTAINMENT,Peter Biskind Wrote The Book On Harvey Weinstein. Here's Why He Ignored The Rumors.,Jason Cherkis,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/peter-biskind-harvey-weinstein_us_59df65cae4b00abf3646bafe,The author insists he made the right decision.,2017-10-12,"While writing a 2004 book that prominently featured Harvey Weinstein (above), author Peter Biskind did not pursue rumors about the film producer's treatment of women.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59df67642d00009717309f0c.jpeg?cache=eeL91x0mag&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― There were very few Hollywood reporters better positioned to expose Harvey Weinstein than Peter Biskind. The author and journalist was the executive editor at Premiere magazine, a glossy dedicated to the movie business, during the film producer’s rise, and he later became a contributing editor at Vanity Fair. In the world of the lunch-date celebrity puff piece, Biskind stood out for his doggedness. His unflinching book on the woolly fraternity of 1970s-era American filmmakers, Easy Riders, Raging Bulls: How the Sex-Drugs-And-Rock ‘N’ Roll Generation Saved Hollywood, is considered the definitive account of that era.After that book’s success, Biskind turned his attention to Weinstein for a sequel of sorts chronicling the rise of the ’90s indie film rebels. In 2004, he published Down and Dirty Pictures: Miramax, Sundance and the Rise of Independent Film. The book, which runs more than 500 pages, details Weinstein’s brutish business practices but contains zero details of his alleged criminal and lecherous behavior toward women. Biskind told HuffPost he just didn’t think it was relevant.In the book’s preface, Biskind describes an astonishing meeting with Weinstein. At this point, Biskind’s work on the book was underway, and the mogul wanted assurances that the reporter would not be poking around his private life. Biskind told me that Weinstein’s paranoia was unnecessary. He needed access and he wasn’t interested in pursuing the rumors. He couldn’t see a way the allegations had influenced Weinstein’s business operation (they had, of course). “It was probably the first meeting I had with him, which I was trying to see if he would talk to me, essentially, so I was probably trying to reassure him that I wasn’t looking for that,” Biskind explained. “I guess I wanted to put him at ease to some degree because I wanted to interview him.” The scene of that meeting Biskind describes in Down and Dirty Pictures is by now recognizable as textbook Harvey.“Harvey was unhappy,” Biskind writes. “I had told him that I wasn’t going to pry into his private life ― the 1990s were not, after all, the 1970s; drugs, sex, and rock ‘n’ roll were not creative stimulants or career busters as they were then ― but he had received word from his network of informants who curry favor with him by picking up the phone and conveying what they’ve heard that I was nosing about.”Weinstein teased Biskind about his book being a lame idea and then dangled the prospect of a more lucrative payday for the journalist. Maybe he could do something for Miramax Books, he offered. Biskind is honest enough to admit he started to take Weinstein’s bait.“I did have a project that I was secretly nursing, and I told him what it was, all the while feeling like a schmuck for letting him play me,” Biskind writes. “What I said seemed to excite him. His face lit up, and he bellowed, ‘That’s a terrific idea, that could make millions. We’ll do it, won’t we, Bob? Why don’t you just give up the book you’re writing now and do this one.’ I declined, and he seemed genuinely sorry for me as I confirmed for him that I was indeed a loser.”The exchange didn’t anger Biskind enough to dig any deeper. And Weinstein ended up cooperating for the book. In light of the revelations that have come out in The New York Times and The New Yorker, I tracked down Biskind. Here is a condensed version of our phone interview about his Miramax book and why he didn’t pursue the biggest story to hit Hollywood in decades.Did you ever hear the rumors about Harvey when you were doing the book?I heard some, yeah. But I didn’t pursue them because first of all the book wasn’t solely about Harvey. It was about the explosion of independents in the ’90s and secondly I felt like I had gone into people’s personal lives in my previous book, Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, because that was about Hollywood in the ’70s. It was an era of personal filmmaking, and I felt it was relevant. In this book, this is more of a business book and I didn’t feel it was all that relevant to the subject I was writing about.I also felt that if I got into it, it was going to skew the book completely and turn it into a different kind of book. I did hear some rumors. It’s impossible not to. But as I said, I didn’t really follow them up.Did you ever ask Weinstein about them? Did you wonder if looking back it did have an impact on his business? He used his power in ways to intimidate people, keep these women docile.I think that’s true that it does keep them docile, but on the other hand if you are giving a freshman actress a role in a feature film, that keeps them pretty docile, too. … I didn’t feel like it affected the business that much. I didn’t see the connection.Did you ever ask Weinstein about it?I never asked him about it because, again, I didn’t feel it was relevant to what I was doing. I mean, I did hear, you know, the Gwyneth Paltrow story — I heard from Brad Pitt, but it was off the record and so I never used that. I was writing a profile of Brad Pitt for Vanity Fair.And when Brad Pitt told you, did you take that up with [Vanity Fair editor] Graydon Carter?No. I didn’t use it because it was off the record, and it was a kind of parenthetical in the interview.What was your impression of Weinstein? Did you think he was capable of this kind of thing?Yeah — very. He was a scary guy. He was always very nice to me but in the book ... I talk about this meeting I had with him right before the book came out. I said something like … the air was heavy with menace and there was a baseball bat leaning against the wall in the corner of his office. He was a scary guy, although he was always nice to me. He never lost his temper with me. I did a lot of interviewing with him but he never lost his temper. He was really on his best behavior, and I had known him before I started working on the book — not well, but well enough. I never saw that side of him.Do you regret that you didn’t report out the Weinstein assaults?I still feel like it would have distorted the book and would have made the book about Harvey.There are a lot of stories in the book about his business practices, which are pretty horrifying, and nobody wanted to talk about that. It was hard enough to get the stuff that I was looking for, much less to go after this other stuff, which would have been twice as hard to do.In a way, it would have made the book juicier and it would have done some justice to the people that he mistreated, but again you have to pick and choose. You can’t cover everything. "
